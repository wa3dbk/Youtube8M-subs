blue<00:04:53.320> flashing<00:04:54.320> mode<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:55.280> your<00:04:55.370> other<00:04:55.660> strobe

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
blue flashing mode and your other strobe

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.560 
blue flashing mode and your other strobe
and<00:04:56.870> stuff<00:04:57.080> like<00:04:57.200> that<00:04:58.240> I'll<00:04:59.240> show<00:04:59.390> you<00:04:59.420> those

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
and stuff like that I'll show you those

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.410 
and stuff like that I'll show you those
up<00:04:59.750> once<00:04:59.960> again<00:05:01.030> all<00:05:02.030> right<00:05:02.150> let's<00:05:02.270> try<00:05:02.360> it

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
up once again all right let's try it

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.880 
up once again all right let's try it
with<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.570> 4500<00:05:03.350> just<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.620> see<00:05:03.770> the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
with a 4500 just so you see the

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.800 
with a 4500 just so you see the
difference<00:05:05.740> alright<00:05:06.740> here<00:05:06.920> it<00:05:07.010> is<00:05:07.100> with<00:05:07.400> a

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
difference alright here it is with a

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.050 
difference alright here it is with a
4500<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.250> see<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.550> difference<00:05:10.670> in<00:05:11.000> the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
4500 so you see the difference in the

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.020 
4500 so you see the difference in the
output<00:05:11.390> it's<00:05:11.540> pretty<00:05:11.750> apparent<00:05:12.640> zoom<00:05:13.640> in<00:05:13.790> just

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
output it's pretty apparent zoom in just

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.440 
output it's pretty apparent zoom in just
you<00:05:14.120> can<00:05:14.210> see<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.510> better<00:05:16.180> yeah<00:05:17.180> just<00:05:17.390> a

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
you can see that better yeah just a

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.730 
you can see that better yeah just a
whole<00:05:17.600> lot<00:05:17.750> more<00:05:17.900> lumens<00:05:18.230> coming<00:05:18.470> out<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.650> this

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
whole lot more lumens coming out of this

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.010 
whole lot more lumens coming out of this
thing<00:05:18.920> now<00:05:19.910> there<00:05:20.090> are<00:05:20.180> some<00:05:20.360> downsides<00:05:20.510> to

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
thing now there are some downsides to

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.270 
thing now there are some downsides to
looking<00:05:21.290> my<00:05:21.440> own<00:05:21.560> batteries<00:05:21.980> they<00:05:22.130> are<00:05:22.250> a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
looking my own batteries they are a

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.710 
looking my own batteries they are a
little<00:05:22.430> bit<00:05:22.610> more<00:05:22.640> expensive<00:05:23.240> there<00:05:23.420> are<00:05:23.540> some

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
little bit more expensive there are some

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.380 
little bit more expensive there are some
dangers<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.170> them<00:05:24.350> but<00:05:24.980> you<00:05:25.580> know<00:05:25.700> if<00:05:25.790> you<00:05:25.970> use

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
dangers to them but you know if you use

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.540 
dangers to them but you know if you use
common<00:05:26.750> sense<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.230> follow<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.010> instructions

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
common sense and follow the instructions

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.770 
common sense and follow the instructions
and<00:05:28.670> everything<00:05:28.760> you<00:05:29.210> shouldn't<00:05:29.540> have<00:05:29.630> any

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
and everything you shouldn't have any

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.600 
and everything you shouldn't have any
problems<00:05:30.110> with<00:05:30.230> them<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:31.190> light<00:05:31.370> will

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
problems with them the light will

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.500 
problems with them the light will
definitely<00:05:32.120> get<00:05:32.240> hot<00:05:32.450> or<00:05:32.600> faster<00:05:33.310> but<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:35.360> get

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
definitely get hot or faster but you get

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.540 
definitely get hot or faster but you get
a<00:05:35.540> whole<00:05:35.750> heck<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:35.990> a<00:05:36.050> lot<00:05:36.080> more<00:05:36.200> output<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:37.250> a

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
a whole heck of a lot more output and a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.310 
a whole heck of a lot more output and a
lot<00:05:37.730> of<00:05:37.760> people<00:05:38.090> that's<00:05:38.420> definitely<00:05:38.990> worth<00:05:39.080> it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
lot of people that's definitely worth it

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.790 
lot of people that's definitely worth it
so<00:05:39.860> this<00:05:40.850> can<00:05:41.060> kind<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.360> show<00:05:41.540> you<00:05:41.600> give<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:42.710> an

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
so this can kind of show you give you an

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.770 
so this can kind of show you give you an
idea<00:05:42.950> help<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:43.760> decide<00:05:44.030> if<00:05:44.150> it's<00:05:44.270> worth<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.600> to

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
idea help you decide if it's worth it to

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.620 
idea help you decide if it's worth it to
you<00:05:44.810> or<00:05:45.050> not<00:05:45.640> and<00:05:46.640> we're<00:05:47.150> gonna<00:05:47.240> try<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.390> little

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
you or not and we're gonna try a little

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.760 
you or not and we're gonna try a little
bit<00:05:47.720> longer<00:05:47.900> distance<00:05:48.320> here<00:05:48.470> in<00:05:48.560> just<00:05:48.680> a

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
bit longer distance here in just a

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.950 
bit longer distance here in just a
second<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:49.280> I'm<00:05:49.460> just<00:05:49.580> gonna<00:05:49.670> leave<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.120> 4500

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
second and I'm just gonna leave the 4500

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.510 
second and I'm just gonna leave the 4500
in<00:05:51.050> there<00:05:51.230> because<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.830> this<00:05:51.920> longer<00:05:52.160> distance

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
in there because of this longer distance

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.950 
in there because of this longer distance
you're<00:05:52.670> not<00:05:52.790> gonna<00:05:52.880> see<00:05:53.060> very<00:05:53.270> far<00:05:53.510> with<00:05:53.750> the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
you're not gonna see very far with the

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.870 
you're not gonna see very far with the
with<00:05:54.470> yet<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.680> loop<00:05:54.890> in<00:05:54.980> it<00:05:55.010> let's<00:05:55.550> go<00:05:55.640> try<00:05:55.850> out

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
with yet a loop in it let's go try out

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.189 
with yet a loop in it let's go try out
that<00:05:56.060> longer<00:05:56.240> distance

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.959 

so<00:05:59.770> we're<00:05:59.860> outside<00:06:00.189> with<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.550> Night<00:06:00.759> Court

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
so we're outside with the Night Court

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.149 
so we're outside with the Night Court
SRT<00:06:01.599> 3<00:06:01.960> let's<00:06:02.499> go<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:02.770> show<00:06:02.889> you<00:06:02.979> what<00:06:03.069> this

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
SRT 3 let's go and show you what this

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.100 
SRT 3 let's go and show you what this
thing<00:06:03.189> could<00:06:03.460> do<00:06:03.610> turn<00:06:04.449> down<00:06:04.629> a<00:06:04.659> little<00:06:04.870> bit

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
thing could do turn down a little bit

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.080 
thing could do turn down a little bit
but<00:06:05.349> there's<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.949> boat<00:06:06.340> out<00:06:06.580> there<00:06:06.610> at<00:06:06.909> about

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
but there's the boat out there at about

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.269 
but there's the boat out there at about
20<00:06:07.389> feet<00:06:07.569> targets<00:06:08.439> out<00:06:08.560> there<00:06:08.590> let<00:06:08.979> me<00:06:09.009> crank

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
20 feet targets out there let me crank

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.300 
20 feet targets out there let me crank
it<00:06:09.370> up<00:06:09.629> at<00:06:10.629> about<00:06:10.930> 50<00:06:11.560> yards<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:11.979> a<00:06:12.009> hundred

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
it up at about 50 yards and a hundred

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.779 
it up at about 50 yards and a hundred
yards<00:06:13.469> and<00:06:14.469> then<00:06:14.949> the<00:06:15.039> tree<00:06:15.219> line<00:06:15.370> beyond<00:06:15.669> it

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
yards and then the tree line beyond it

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.480 
yards and then the tree line beyond it
130<00:06:16.270> yards<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:17.139> see<00:06:17.409> when<00:06:17.889> I<00:06:17.979> crank<00:06:18.249> it<00:06:18.310> down

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
130 yards you see when I crank it down

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.899 
130 yards you see when I crank it down
still<00:06:19.270> excel<00:06:19.599> outs<00:06:19.870> all<00:06:20.050> those<00:06:20.229> pretty<00:06:20.439> well

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
still excel outs all those pretty well

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.700 
still excel outs all those pretty well
so<00:06:21.909> a<00:06:21.969> lot<00:06:22.120> of<00:06:22.150> range<00:06:22.419> on<00:06:22.599> this<00:06:22.719> thing<00:06:22.930> you<00:06:23.229> got

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
so a lot of range on this thing you got

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.689 
so a lot of range on this thing you got
the<00:06:23.800> colors<00:06:24.129> as<00:06:24.249> well

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
the colors as well

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.390 
the colors as well
useful<00:06:25.509> features<00:06:26.319> and<00:06:26.499> functions<00:06:26.979> and<00:06:27.129> modes

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
useful features and functions and modes

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.550 
useful features and functions and modes
and<00:06:27.789> colors<00:06:28.150> and<00:06:28.330> everything<00:06:28.539> pretty<00:06:29.289> cool

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
and colors and everything pretty cool

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.920 
and colors and everything pretty cool
light<00:06:29.740> again<00:06:30.430> this<00:06:30.520> is<00:06:30.669> a<00:06:30.729> 14<00:06:31.029> 500<00:06:31.509> in<00:06:31.599> here<00:06:31.779> so

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
light again this is a 14 500 in here so

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.909 
light again this is a 14 500 in here so
you're<00:06:32.020> not<00:06:32.050> going<00:06:32.229> to<00:06:32.289> get<00:06:32.439> quite<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.740> same

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
you're not going to get quite the same

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.580 
you're not going to get quite the same
performance<00:06:33.400> on<00:06:33.580> a<00:06:33.610> an<00:06:34.180> alkaline<00:06:34.659> or<00:06:34.990> nickel
