00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.040
 she believed it was a photograph 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.420
 my name is more person 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.860
 co-owner of Fame photograph I 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.050
 I'll make the presentation for you. 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.660
 one more lighting product is a led 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.850
 light 500 brand of gringa a product 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.189
 very versatile and easy to handle 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.869
 you can use it to make videos right 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.320
 We see videos that we need in this very 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.450
 cool 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.489
 photo will also be very used 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.650
 product photo 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.600
 children mostly in born that he 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.090
 has a very light light a very soft light 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.310
 a very interesting light and a 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.010
 control of this lighting is too much dish 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.780
 Is he here in the back of it? 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.329
 all lighting control 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.000
 we have a general key to being able to do 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.190
 control of the beginning of work and 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.410
 plus four independent keys to 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.390
 you can work individually for 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.489
 module are four modes that it has 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.679
 key 1 2 3 and 4 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.989
 the money so you can do it 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:09.250
 this assessment of the amount of light 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.990
 You need a cooler so you can have 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.670
 and be able to work for 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.300
 enough time with this equipment is 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.320
 he is flying tele 110 110 automatic already 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.870
 comes the source 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.940
 and you can no longer take any location 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.630
 without this problem. 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.960
 variation of the 110 or 220 power point 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.420
 and here another practicality that he 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.820
 have you work this way or 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.000
 work this vertical lighting 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.330
 You can work it this way or 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.050
 here with it horizontally one 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.540
 system of tabs or hors bands for power 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.270
 Can you do this one? 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.910
 control the incidence of light a light 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.150
 a more concentrated light 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.280
 having this possibility here then 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.360
 To make him his call, he went to call 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.190
 the general key 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.520
 look at module 1 only lit a part 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.570
 so the module 3 ascended to another area 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.729
 and the dm 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.040
 so you can increase this 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.050
 lighting or dim lighting 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.780
 ok then key 2 and key 4 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.100
 um then lit all the lamps 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.080
 are all on and now the dna with the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.790
 maximum variation of lighting 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.990
 you will have full control of this 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.630
 lighting up to this product it is in 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.640
 worth of it 999 reais 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.130
 you buy here in fame photo 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.680
 direct with sellers with but with 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.350
 ronaldo with graziela or by the site 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.430
 fame photography point with br br 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.930
 by telephone or by phone 0 47 33 50 68 00 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.860
 in the sequence I'm going to give a demonstration 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.990
 for you, the lighting is with the model 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.090
 hello everybody, I'll make a little 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.990
 demonstration for you this is the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.730
 my model 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.190
 Let's do some cool lighting on her. 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.620
 starting with the lowest illumination 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.690
 until full illumination for you 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.860
 feel the incidence of this light is a 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.440
 very cool light 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.890
 So I'm calling to vote, calling the key. 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.270
 Overall the key number 1 only binds 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.280
 first module and making an increase or 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.500
 the decrease of that power then 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.959
 decrease the maximum or only with the key 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.130
 number 11 with key number two then 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.740
 from practically no light until the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.590
 maximum evaluation with only two keys 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.720
 connected by the key 2 and 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.790
 ascending the key to which our 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.490
 incidence of light is now full 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.099
 a very strong light and here then 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.660
 now controlling the lighting 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.920
 through money 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.340
 look at this evaluation and here if I 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.260
 want to have a wider situation 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.709
 using it in portrait mode 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.760
 can control this area of 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:07.030
 even lighting with the boys then 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.060
 very cool model of the forest 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.380
 church and you will find it here in 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.000
 fame photography 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.000
 Ok, a hug to everyone.
