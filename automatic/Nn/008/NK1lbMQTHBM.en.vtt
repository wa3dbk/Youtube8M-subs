what i used to get the curls i have in
today<00:00:49.710> um<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.800> only<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
today um the only thing is that the

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.979 
today um the only thing is that the
letters<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:58.280> basically<00:00:59.280> smeared<00:01:00.210> off<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
letters they basically smeared off of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.320 
letters they basically smeared off of
this<00:01:01.350> part<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> actual<00:01:05.700> curler

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
this part but this is the actual curler

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.250 
this part but this is the actual curler
and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.340> attachable

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
and then they have the attachable

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.130 
and then they have the attachable
barrels<00:01:10.490> with<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.570> um<00:01:13.010> it's<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:15.140> 32

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
barrels with this one um it's the 32

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.700 
barrels with this one um it's the 32
millimeter<00:01:17.000> barrel<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.509> comes<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
millimeter barrel and it comes off and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.270 
millimeter barrel and it comes off and
that<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.580> looks<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.890> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
that is how it looks and then this is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.719 
that is how it looks and then this is
the<00:01:23.640> base<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.090> has<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:28.290> levels<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:29.369> heat

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the base and it has two levels of heat

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
the base and it has two levels of heat
it<00:01:30.439> actually<00:01:31.439> goes<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.350> 400<00:01:34.350> degrees<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it actually goes up to 400 degrees I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.210 
it actually goes up to 400 degrees I
think<00:01:35.610> um<00:01:37.250> yes<00:01:38.250> 100<00:01:39.180> degrees<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.770> gets<00:01:41.070> very

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
think um yes 100 degrees so it gets very

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.359 
think um yes 100 degrees so it gets very
hot<00:01:42.229> um<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:44.399> other<00:01:44.430> barrels<00:01:45.770> they<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:47.040> come

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
hot um the other barrels they all come

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.740 
hot um the other barrels they all come
in<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.979> too<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.880> has<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.890> blue<00:01:52.890> zebra<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:54.509> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
in this too it has the blue zebra and it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.980 
in this too it has the blue zebra and it
eats<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.170> herstyler<00:01:55.740> brand

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
eats a herstyler brand

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.230 
eats a herstyler brand
of<00:01:58.810> these<00:01:59.810> are<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.140> other<00:02:00.320> two<00:02:00.439> barrels<00:02:01.240> this

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
of these are the other two barrels this

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.340 
of these are the other two barrels this
is<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:03.159> 25<00:02:04.159> millimeter<00:02:04.700> barrel<00:02:05.210> for<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.930> 18

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
is the 25 millimeter barrel for the 18

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.479 
is the 25 millimeter barrel for the 18
25<00:02:06.890> millimeter<00:02:07.690> barrel<00:02:08.690> um<00:02:09.130> this<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.280> probably

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
25 millimeter barrel um this is probably

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.720 
25 millimeter barrel um this is probably
the<00:02:10.670> standard<00:02:11.209> when<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.750> would<00:02:11.959> get<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
the standard when you would get the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.680 
the standard when you would get the
Remington<00:02:13.730> curling<00:02:13.760> wand<00:02:14.569> um<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:17.330> regular

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
Remington curling wand um the regular

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.070 
Remington curling wand um the regular
herstyler<00:02:18.140> which<00:02:18.560> only<00:02:18.830> has<00:02:19.130> one<00:02:19.760> barrel<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
herstyler which only has one barrel you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.800 
herstyler which only has one barrel you
will<00:02:21.260> get<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:23.590> size<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:25.130> those<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:26.330> if<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.690> do

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
will get this size in those so if you do

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.750 
will get this size in those so if you do
have<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:27.050> curl<00:02:27.349> one<00:02:27.620> more<00:02:28.130> than<00:02:28.310> likely<00:02:28.489> this

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
have a curl one more than likely this

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
have a curl one more than likely this
week<00:02:29.120> sighs<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.230> um<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.760> then<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
week sighs that you have um and then the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
smallest one which is a 9 to 18

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.170 
smallest one which is a 9 to 18
millimeter<00:02:39.040> barrel<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> small

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
millimeter barrel and this is a small

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.949 
millimeter barrel and this is a small
one<00:02:41.720> um<00:02:42.049> I<00:02:42.760> actually<00:02:43.760> did<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:45.549> Teyana<00:02:46.549> Taylor

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
one um I actually did the Teyana Taylor

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.590 
one um I actually did the Teyana Taylor
curls<00:02:47.959> with<00:02:48.950> this<00:02:49.790> barrel<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.630> very<00:02:51.410> small<00:02:52.040> and

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
better on freshly washed hair the

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.200 
better on freshly washed hair the
durability<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:27.060> curls<00:04:27.390> but<00:04:28.190> um<00:04:29.210> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
durability of the curls but um the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.820 
durability of the curls but um the
formation<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:30.870> curse<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:31.320> think<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.650> works

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
formation of curse I think it works

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
formation of curse I think it works
better<00:04:31.980> on<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:33.750> know<00:04:33.900> old<00:04:34.560> hair<00:04:35.040> or<00:04:35.280> hair<00:04:35.310> that

needs to be washed I think it works
better<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.760> in<00:04:39.510> getting<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.020> curl<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.440> you

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
better and in getting the curl that you

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.130 
better and in getting the curl that you
want<00:04:41.070> because<00:04:41.880> when<00:04:42.240> your<00:04:42.420> hair<00:04:42.630> is<00:04:42.660> freshly
