00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 Ai welcome to my channel 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.240
 bingo video and enter the name edson 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 and will start by starting a series of 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.380
 videos there teaching some 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:33.360
 technical improvisation all that I can 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 to spend there is this theme that has already 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.680
 too much cloth for mango is the following is neither 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 You'll always be playing with your 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.100
 band save your friends and you will 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.340
 It's time for the sun and you're going 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.630
 have that tone that you 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:00.680
 is accustomed 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:02.579
 then the next 'you will serve to 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.070
 when you come across the situation 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.740
 Do you know if you are there for example? 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.250
 You were playing and I do not know, someone asks. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.119
 For you, the tone of the song is this. 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.119
 and the smallest 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.490
 so you're going to have to follow a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 smaller 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.350
 You'll just have to ride there. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.830
 This is not how I got used to it. 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.720
 pass on to you is the following if you 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.400
 has 11 one key issue here is better 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.400
 All translations 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 look for full of smaller appliances 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.840
 It's like you have this chip. 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.840
 on here 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840
 is 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.100
 the haiti but why it will look is full of 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.360
 despite the smaller because the following is the a 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.150
 pj is nothing more than the tonic of this 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.840
 fifth of love are the notes that form the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.800
 board 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.080
 then it is also important to note the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.580
 following by these new here is the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.440
 notes that form the string 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.990
 they are the notes on which the chord 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.720
 it rests then for example if I take 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.410
 way when digging the plateau 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.410
 by the minor 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.030
 and I have to look until the 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.760
 that is by doing and resting in notes 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:38.299
 of the accord in notes forming the grandmother gave 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.099
 the smallest then with pj already has practice already 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.790
 it is best to know the geography of 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.170
 arm 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.170
 so I can very well start at 1 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.710
 i 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.700
 I see training here, the presence 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.700
 of the smaller air 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.120
 finished the name is the fifth fair 99 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.290
 also it is not as well to stay in 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.769
 mine in the fifth fair 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.379
 so with that reasoning you already have there 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.859
 more or less weapons against this type of 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:23.030
 problem that I fear so much here 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:26.430
 Le Havre's novelty improvised at last. 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.260
 that was my tip for today is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.629
 subscribe to the channel 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.189

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.439
 and I'm going to give you more tips on what I 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.879
 can help will help here what 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.879
