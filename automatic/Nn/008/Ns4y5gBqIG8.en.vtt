it's<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.619> telepresence<00:01:31.100> device<00:01:31.670> right<00:01:32.240> and

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
it's a telepresence device right and

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.719 
it's a telepresence device right and
it's<00:01:33.320> for<00:01:33.500> people<00:01:33.649> who<00:01:33.890> who<00:01:34.280> want<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.579> have

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
there's their remote and I can get that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.920 
there's their remote and I can get that
but<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:39.140> mean<00:01:39.530> robot<00:01:40.460> on<00:01:40.579> a<00:01:40.700> stick<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.630> that

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
but I mean robot on a stick is that

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.539 
but I mean robot on a stick is that
really<00:01:42.200> something<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.649> was<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.859> big<00:01:43.219> product

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
really something that was a big product

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.779 
really something that was a big product
well<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.960> is<00:01:45.140> really<00:01:45.469> nicely<00:01:45.789> marketed

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
well so this is really nicely marketed

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.090 
well so this is really nicely marketed
at<00:01:46.969> businesses<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:47.930> think<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.530> perfect

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
at businesses I think this is perfect

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.190 
at businesses I think this is perfect
for<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.310> conference<00:01:49.729> room<00:01:50.030> where<00:01:50.719> you<00:01:50.960> need

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
for the conference room where you need

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.260 
for the conference room where you need
to<00:01:51.409> be<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.829> a<00:01:52.130> telepresence<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.149> know

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
to be in a telepresence you know

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.950 
to be in a telepresence you know
position<00:01:54.219> but<00:01:55.219> you<00:01:56.119> can<00:01:56.329> actually<00:01:56.600> look

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
position but you can actually look

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.740 
position but you can actually look
around<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:57.710> participants<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.700> change<00:01:59.600> your

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
around at participants and change your

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.990 
around at participants and change your
ankle<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.039> this<00:02:01.189> is<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.340> interface<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:01.909> I

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
ankle so this is the interface that I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.020 
ankle so this is the interface that I
have<00:02:02.179> on<00:02:02.450> my<00:02:02.750> end<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.890> very<00:02:03.979> simple<00:02:04.670> if<00:02:04.820> I

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
have on my end it's very simple if I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.669 
have on my end it's very simple if I
want<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.420> something<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.259> click<00:02:06.469> on<00:02:06.499> it

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
want to see something I can click on it

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.270 
want to see something I can click on it
and<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.369> will<00:02:07.520> Center<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:07.969> on<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:10.009> ooh
