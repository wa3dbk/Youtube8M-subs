forces team just like a standard guitar
but<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.409> would<00:01:13.560> tune<00:01:13.830> these<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.430> half<00:01:15.030> steps

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
but they would tune these and half steps

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.270 
but they would tune these and half steps
that<00:01:16.020> could<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.860> way<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:17.130> but

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that could all go all the way down but

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
that could all go all the way down but
since<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> harp<00:01:18.479> guitar<00:01:18.750> player<00:01:19.020> I
