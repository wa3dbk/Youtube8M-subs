it's<00:01:40.030> like<00:01:40.179> it's<00:01:40.420> definitely<00:01:40.929> not<00:01:41.079> that<00:01:41.350> like

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
it's like it's definitely not that like

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.929 
it's like it's definitely not that like
if<00:01:41.679> it's<00:01:41.829> anything<00:01:42.039> is<00:01:42.280> not<00:01:42.399> that<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.789> know<00:01:42.850> I

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
if it's anything is not that you know I

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.559

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
mean like basically what they told me is

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.440 
mean like basically what they told me is
like<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.979> account<00:01:48.399> has<00:01:48.729> been<00:01:48.929> used<00:01:49.929> to<00:01:50.439> troll
