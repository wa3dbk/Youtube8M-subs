00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.750
 Salt nizami walked I walked myself and no one 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.000
 did not touch and suddenly began such a downpour 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.990
 under which I dredged well, literally to 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.080
 the depths of the soul 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.270
 I like to go home and I want to change 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.360
 invite you to show 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.160
 how I got here in Lyon, how I already 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.410
 I said I live in the heart of the old 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.989
 city door to the entrance is on 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.000
 the most famous pedestrian street will be given 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.620
 more precisely not even in the entrance to one of those 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.870
 most trabuly about which I, too 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.760
 told the truth my trabuly closed 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.550
 for visiting and converted because not 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.010
 pass-through but his mood does not change 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.660
 what I especially like is the sky 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.510
 which can be seen in the open and 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.160
 trabuli holds when she is of course in 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.960
 same time when it rains outside 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.460
 here he goes too 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.050
 someone my grass may seem 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.870
 gloomy but it is only for the first 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.460
 look there is something fabulous when 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.000
 there is something behind every door 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.980
 mysterious Lena apartment is very 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.650
 similar to my Moscow even color 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.750
 combinations like i pick everything bright and 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.090
 positive and filled with some special 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.590
 Cozy living room is small but it has 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.810
 everything you need 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.850
 really like the elongated windows which 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.920
 bright sunny day help apartment 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.040
 tune up with new even brighter 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.710
 paints and funny little things create more 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.290
 more joyful mood and this is a pile 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.020
 of my books that grows just like on 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.820
 yeast heavy damn do not know how it all 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.080
 I'm lucky but I already bought extra 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 large suitcase 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.240
 I have a small kitchen, but we are ready 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.760
 culinary feat because 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.740
 equipped with everything necessary but honestly 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.840
 I confess I never got to her but 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.610
 only a couple of times is when trying 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.220
 cook something in the mini oven already 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.860
 almost at night I knocked out the light in all 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.090
 apartment hour flashlight on the phone gone 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.819
 on picking in the shield 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.250
 to exclaim at last let there be light 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.379
 the bedroom also plays with bright colors 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.569
 waking up in it is very nice though 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.450
 difficult because you have to do it 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.030
 very early by the ringing of washing dishes from 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.069
 neighboring restaurants here even a fireplace 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.440
 there is truth fake but still too 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.379
 creates a mood of French comfort 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.319
 and still really like the shutters of the curtains like you 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.530
 noticed here is not why 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.680
 the only protection sometimes from the eyes of neighbors 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.290
 whose windows are directly opposite 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.689
 the bathroom is also bright though too pink 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.939
 as if barbie you are more beautiful than the tree in the mirrors i 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.430
 I do not fit despite the fact that they are here 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.180
 two so this design idea is not 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.799
 triggered 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.359
 I'm sorry but we 'll go to the toilet here too 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.700
 there is a traffic sign about the button for 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.400
 pedestrians and really uprooted 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.689
 such here are my masters inventers well 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.519
 finally the view from the windows 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.069
 there are no panoramas here all the same 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.560
 trabuly atrium patio 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.260
 but how nice to look out in the morning and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.909
 look at the sky if it is still 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.439
 the blue on this tour is over there 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.199
 the sun came out it's time to change clothes 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.790
 grab a tripod and run photographing 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.329
 Sasha was cookingtime with you 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.329
