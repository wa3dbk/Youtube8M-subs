00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.420
 powerful apparatus alone and am here a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.769
 present you this new video that you don't 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.180
 the video shows the boys this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.040
 I assure you no I give you a little different from the 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.109
 it is usually quite special because in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.449
 this video I'm going to show you this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.310
 that I know about the team of the year girls 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.560
 first of all, let me state that all that is there 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.699
 I will say it is not yet not exact official 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.380
 because she and has not yet released 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.909
 nothing about team of the year 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.849
 so guys let's start immediately saying 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:32.610
 that towards May often yesterday 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.230
 fifa every year fiva releases and the team 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 dissidents but I decided in the set of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
 a team of players in fact 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 who obviously played well in a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 championship 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 that's why timothy season it's called 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.850
 so this season's team 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.140
 first and foremost little girls to say that in 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.579
 tv on the season as I said before is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 composed of multiple teams is like practically 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.699
 it is said vico it is said because obviously 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.710
 not having been anything yet 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.690
 confirmed I can't tell you if it assures 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.920
 things like that they say kate bites season 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.769
 will be if this year 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.019
 6 because it is first and foremost is obviously 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.300
 they will always repeat it is said though 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.070
 however remember they are not yet sources 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.079
 official so it can happen that you don't 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 may not even happen then 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.530
 tomorrow the first of May should come out 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.659
 before the first team of the season 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 first team of the season called is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 made up of the most consistent players 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 fit partner what does boy mean 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.640
 in the first place it will be composed of those 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.500
 players who played obviously 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 good in a league but what a bad luck 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.579
 in bad luck he wants them never to be 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 became fit 15 boys then 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.000
 dinner is told it is said to be composed 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.710
 it will be divided into two teams that this 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.229
 qua moscone sis dal never in shape 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.479
 one composed alone but alone 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 gold players and the other players or 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.130
 bronze and silver to that of the players 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 or rom as we can see first 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.869
 I only tell you which positions or the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.340
 stats are not official and most 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.960
 apparently of the information that precisely there is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.840
 I'm giving them I took from the former play fifa 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.869
 and then he gave me claudio is in fact it 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.340
 thank you anyway guys then 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.399
 let me imagine taken from the explain fifa 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.500
 yes how can we see what 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.149
 we know well there is obviously diamonds 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.220
 diamonds than the role of midfielder 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.660
 and I really hope so that it is so 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.519
 because he thought a little to use a 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.420
 nice blue diamonds that even four 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.190
 bit stars aes no 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.140
 and quite paid in a nice series a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.780
 or as we can see in the ass for 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.220
 wolves not ass the defender of 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.260
 marseille I don't know if he pronounced it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.150
 well anyway it 's really for me 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 strong already he was paid of his 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.000
 think for a while if we wanted to go back 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.100
 how strong or young the throat will be 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.500
 speak for me of the team of the season 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.660
 the one made up of players who were 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.060
 gold is the goalkeeper the Brazilian goalkeeper 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.650
 because if you notice Brazil does not have 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 so one of the great goalkeepers then 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.069
 this would be very useful precisely for 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.410
 of hybrids for teams 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.670
 brazilian same thing as a rumor said 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.650
 we can see a strong move in the teams 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.680
 consists basten and for in the form of 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.030
 players all silver and bronze sorry 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.819
 guys, I keep getting started we have 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.010
 made the comment for five times 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.350
 because precisely I did not want to be little and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.010
 precise cube boys then of this 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.810
 team 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.150
 the player that is the best for me is 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.890
 of the offended and are the best and is the fi 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.510
 and all and bust of the offers have 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.519
 shifted the role of external right 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.970
 obviously I say they moved however like 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.530
 things said the stacks the over all and the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.090
 positions are not yet official 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.850
 so I can't know that much though 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.120
 probably will be external right ai 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.500
 guys what season I already said it was 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.690
 composed of six teams these six 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.760
 teams in addition to the moscow system never 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.829
 inform that it is said that it will come out tomorrow 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.930
 it will also be the fear of season composed 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.100
 only the barclays players then 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.840
 another parking compound i 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.819
 players of the league billia and then the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.349
 others are 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.549
 precisely made up of players who 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.180
 they played the best championships 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.269
 however divided into europe in what sense 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.379
 there is a final decision for the south of Europe 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.939
 made up of players from Italy 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.739
 of the france of the badge of portugal 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.109
 obviously I talk about the championship and then 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.030
 antipodi northern European season like 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.099
 those of holland germany perhaps 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.079
 some other nation is still said later 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.120
 that there will be a team at christie's at a 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.319
 composed of mice eleven players who 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.030
 precisely they played this better 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.590
 championship something like the team of the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.629
 year only at the post of the year of 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.190
 season then we first talk a 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.259
 moment of the date even these are not 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.479
 absolutely official made if this 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.099
 video and it will touch big on the facts not 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.810
 you will give nothing of your own just said e 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.570
 I'll take it off because I don't see the reason 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.009
 to keep it anyway yes I am afraid of yes london 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.720
 bates premier league should come out 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.220
 the eight May, instead, those of the south 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.570
 of Europe then the one established and ai 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.610
 italy players from france 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.900

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.400
 Northern Europe to 22 May 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.840
 then you will pass other season worlds 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.599

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.180
