00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 in the last week the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.029
 carburetors and the multiples of the three 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.490
 riders who took the podium in the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 road tourism in mendoza we want 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
 know what it was that brought you to you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.880
 remove those elements and what exams 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.590
 they did hello Pauline if what 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.660
 we remove is the mold design plan and the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.810
 carburetor than what is on the table 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 and you can show people what 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.619
 we do is analyze so much 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.380
 dimensionally as internally the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 intake manifold and carburetor 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.040
 carburetor is completely disassembled and you see 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.719
 each of the components that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.920
 they have to agree to what 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.050
 specifies the regulation both 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 dimensionally as in the concept of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.190
 how it was delivered of elements here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.020
 we are looking at the carburetor and the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 multiple the car of moroso lombardo el 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.730
 auto mauro gialombardo notice that you are 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.590
 Sandblasting is done for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.100
 contact that the surface of the manifold 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.059
 it was not cut or modified and good 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.710
 because there are different parameters 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.390
 dimensional that are those that are in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.640
 the regulations that are what we 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.579
 we control like the distance there 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.580
 from him 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.430
 where it supports the admission manifold 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.990
 to the center where the carburetor goes 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.330
 we control the height of the cue and the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.580
 dimensions both in width and length 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.659
 that has to have and in height our 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.250
 parameters have been exhausted in the 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.750
 regulation and only that good in this 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.180
 opportunity had to withdraw the multiple 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.549
 to do that verification and if the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.360
 camera accompanies me here we will see the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.799
 graphics where the measurement is shown 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.970
 regulation that each 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.590
 one of the elements I want me to 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.149
 we counted recent if the multiple of 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.860
 admission has to have from where 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.560
 support up to cylinder up to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.690
 carburetor center 160 mm more 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.000
 minus 3 after is specified the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.830
 rectangle where you can machine for 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.049
 put the cue and good the carburetor 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.060
 has a trumpet height 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.740
 of admission to the base of the manifold 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.810
 admission which is what is controlled as 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.380
 parameter and then we have other 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.940
 components that are for example this is not 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.429
 only by technical regulations we allow 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.610
 remove this plug cited that allows 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.140
 level the fuel passages and 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.080
 it was verified that what is made of 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 a form that is specified 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.390
 we also have the centering that is a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.880
 strategic element in the carburetor 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.310
 that allows to eliminate any roughness 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.500
 that has inside the centering tube 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.290
 and in case there is a need to put 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.030
 Epoxy material is allowed but has no 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.850
 to be touched this part where is the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.460
 part of the plane that we 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.060
 we call good we contact as 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.060
 corresponds 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.970
 and this is the diffuser where it has 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.640
 specified the diameter measurement of 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.040
 38 maximum heights and diameters 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.180
 where they guide the carburetor you have 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.560
 the freedom to withdraw any 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.420
 element when you create it 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.950
 available if not done in this case 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.300
 will have to do a sandblasting that does not 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.280
 it is feasible to make a car less 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.450
 we carry engineer thank you very much 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.050
 been very clear in his explanations 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.050
 now
