00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Start the quest by heading to Ul'dah - Steps of Nald

00:00:28.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Talk to Dural Tharal at 11x 8y

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There are two FATEs you can head to for this quest, called Lightning Strikes - Armored Beast.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:58.000
First FATE is at Eastern Thanalan 28x 16y

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Bronze medal isn't high enough to obtain the item

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You'll know the FATE will begin soon when you see NPCs fleeing and screaming

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This second FATE is at Southern Thanalan 20x 12y

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Upon FATE completion, you'll receive 1 "Strange Otherworldly Parcel"

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The item takes up inventory space, and is also unique and untrableabless

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Head back to town and hand in your item to complete the quest

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And this is how the pants and gloves appears on a lalafell
