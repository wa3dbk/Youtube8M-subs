hey<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> little<00:00:02.399> electronics<00:00:03.060> project

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hey this is a little electronics project

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey this is a little electronics project
that<00:00:03.629> i<00:00:03.659> put<00:00:03.870> together<00:00:03.959> using<00:00:04.410> my<00:00:04.680> arduino<00:00:05.160> and

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
that i put together using my arduino and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.690 
that i put together using my arduino and
a<00:00:05.370> few<00:00:05.549> extra<00:00:05.640> parts<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.700> high-speed

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
a few extra parts it is a high-speed

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240 
a few extra parts it is a high-speed
camera<00:00:08.940> trigger<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:10.070> doesn't<00:00:11.070> actually

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
camera trigger and doesn't actually

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.700 
camera trigger and doesn't actually
trigger<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> camera<00:00:12.150> triggers<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> flash<00:00:13.110> so

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
trigger the camera triggers a flash so

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.079 
trigger the camera triggers a flash so
you<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:13.920> leave<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> shutter<00:00:14.519> open<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
you just leave the shutter open for a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.990 
you just leave the shutter open for a
few<00:00:15.240> seconds<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.109> dim<00:00:16.740> room<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
few seconds in a dim room if the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.220 
few seconds in a dim room if the
aperture<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.420> small<00:00:18.660> enough<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.960> can

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
aperture is small enough you can

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.980 
aperture is small enough you can
actually<00:00:19.350> have<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> room<00:00:20.340> lights<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.990> pretty

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
actually have the room lights on pretty

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.240 
actually have the room lights on pretty
significantly<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.990> then<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.320> trigger<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
significantly and then you trigger a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.189 
significantly and then you trigger a
flash<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.820> exactly<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> moment<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
flash it exactly the moment that you

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.570 
flash it exactly the moment that you
want<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:28.650> off<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.039> that's<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
want it to go off and that's all it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.820 
want it to go off and that's all it
shows<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> film<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.660> pretty<00:00:30.810> neat<00:00:31.080> so

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
shows up on the film it's pretty neat so

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.520 
shows up on the film it's pretty neat so
this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> laser<00:00:32.640> I've<00:00:32.940> shine<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> photo

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
this is a laser I've shine it at a photo

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.610 
this is a laser I've shine it at a photo
transistor<00:00:34.829> which<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.670> actually<00:00:36.620> probably

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
transistor which is actually probably

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.110 
transistor which is actually probably
the<00:00:37.800> hardest<00:00:38.129> part<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> project<00:00:38.730> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the hardest part of the project is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
the hardest part of the project is
aiming<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> correctly<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.649> getting<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
aiming this correctly and getting to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.119 
aiming this correctly and getting to
stay<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:42.180> once<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:43.020> laser<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.530> aimed<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
stay but once the laser is aimed at the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.000 
stay but once the laser is aimed at the
phototransistor<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:46.020> beam<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.500> stays<00:00:46.710> on

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
phototransistor the beam just stays on

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.979 
phototransistor the beam just stays on
and<00:00:48.020> then<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.980> break<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> beam<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.449> can

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and then if you break the beam you can

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
and then if you break the beam you can
even<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.980> aerosol<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.820> very

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
even do this with aerosol it's very

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.619 
even do this with aerosol it's very
sensitive<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.399> triggers<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.090> sequence

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
sensitive then it triggers a sequence

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.580 
sensitive then it triggers a sequence
that<00:00:57.930> turns<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.980> laser<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.730> then<00:01:00.590> waits

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that turns the laser off and then waits

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.640 
that turns the laser off and then waits
a<00:01:01.890> time<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.730> specify<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.750> makes

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
a time that you specify and then makes

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.179 
a time that you specify and then makes
the<00:01:04.799> flash<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:07.049> control<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> time

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the flash go off so you control the time

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
the flash go off so you control the time
delay<00:01:08.580> between<00:01:08.610> breaking<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> beam<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
delay between breaking the beam and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.830 
delay between breaking the beam and
flash<00:01:10.020> using<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.560> pot<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.610> turned<00:01:12.570> this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
flash using this pot here turned this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.859 
flash using this pot here turned this
way<00:01:12.900> means<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.700> flash<00:01:15.180> goes<00:01:15.420> off<00:01:15.570> immediately

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
way means the flash goes off immediately

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.649 
way means the flash goes off immediately
when<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.380> break<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> beam<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.420> turned<00:01:18.420> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
when you break the beam and turned this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
when you break the beam and turned this
way<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.830> flash<00:01:20.130> waits<00:01:21.380> 1023<00:01:22.380> milliseconds<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
way to flash waits 1023 milliseconds you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
way to flash waits 1023 milliseconds you
can<00:01:23.460> alter<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.600> millisecond<00:01:25.170> increments

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
can alter this in millisecond increments

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.670 
can alter this in millisecond increments
so<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.130> sensitive<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.500> for<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
so it's very sensitive and for what I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.460 
so it's very sensitive and for what I
was<00:01:28.860> trying<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.610> worked<00:01:29.970> great<00:01:30.470> maybe

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
was trying to do it worked great maybe

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.819 
was trying to do it worked great maybe
if<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> wanted<00:01:32.040> something<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:33.470> micro<00:01:34.470> second

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
if you wanted something on micro second

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.760 
if you wanted something on micro second
scale<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.250> might<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.729> bit

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
scale it might be a little bit

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.569 
scale it might be a little bit
insufficient<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.100> figure<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.400> other

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
insufficient you can figure out other

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.740 
insufficient you can figure out other
ways<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.659> more

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
ways to do that then so in a little more

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.609 
ways to do that then so in a little more
detail<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:44.869> Arduino<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.960> controlling<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
detail the Arduino is controlling the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.830 
detail the Arduino is controlling the
laser<00:01:46.890> power<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.340> turns<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.790> off<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.180> then

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
laser power it turns that off and then

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.910 
laser power it turns that off and then
to<00:01:49.549> set<00:01:50.549> off<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.880> flash<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:52.259> closes<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
to set off the flash it just closes a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.149 
to set off the flash it just closes a
switch<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> flash<00:01:54.270> works<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
switch because the way a flash works is

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.100 
switch because the way a flash works is
you<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.340> capacitor<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.299> charges<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
you have a capacitor that charges up and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.600 
you have a capacitor that charges up and
then<00:01:59.100> you<00:02:00.530> short-circuit<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.560> capacitor<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
then you short-circuit the capacitor to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.289 
then you short-circuit the capacitor to
discharge<00:02:03.180> through<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.630> bulb<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.939> sets

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
discharge through a bulb and that sets

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.740 
discharge through a bulb and that sets
off<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> huge<00:02:07.049> burst<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.560> light<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.270> if<00:02:09.270> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
off a huge burst of light and if you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.340 
off a huge burst of light and if you
look<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.400> contacts<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:12.120> flash

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
look at the contacts on a flash

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.170 
look at the contacts on a flash
a<00:02:13.410> lot<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> time<00:02:14.130> there<00:02:14.400> are<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.580> bunch<00:02:14.970> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
a lot of the time there are a bunch of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.230 
a lot of the time there are a bunch of
little<00:02:15.690> contacts<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.950> bottom<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.520> all

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
little contacts on the bottom and all

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.580 
little contacts on the bottom and all
that<00:02:18.390> actually<00:02:18.510> matters<00:02:19.050> for<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> flash

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
that actually matters for the flash

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.500 
that actually matters for the flash
going<00:02:19.920> off<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.670> one<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> middle<00:02:21.210> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
going off is the one in the middle and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.190 
going off is the one in the middle and
you<00:02:21.570> want<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.560> connect<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.310> contact<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
you want to connect that contact to the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.170 
you want to connect that contact to the
one<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.560> side<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.760> basically

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
one on the side and that basically

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.090 
one on the side and that basically
closes<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.020> switch<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.500> discharge<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
closes the switch to discharge the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.280 
closes the switch to discharge the
capacitor<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.790> don't<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.600> flash<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.110> me

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
capacitor I don't have a flash with me

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.270 
capacitor I don't have a flash with me
because<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.650> borrowing<00:02:31.800> one<00:02:31.980> from<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
because I was borrowing one from a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
because I was borrowing one from a
friend<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:34.700> used<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:36.000> little<00:02:36.930> relay<00:02:37.320> for

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
friend but I used this little relay for

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.710 
friend but I used this little relay for
the<00:02:38.160> switch<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.030> our<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.510> just

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the switch so that our do we know just

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.790 
the switch so that our do we know just
controls<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:41.840> it<00:02:42.840> causes<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.410> for<00:02:43.650> one

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
controls that and it causes it for one

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.440 
controls that and it causes it for one
millisecond<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.730> capacitor<00:02:45.240> can

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
millisecond but the capacitor can

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.510 
millisecond but the capacitor can
discharge<00:02:45.630> much<00:02:46.080> more<00:02:46.350> quickly<00:02:46.560> than<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.070> if

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
discharge much more quickly than that if

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.150 
discharge much more quickly than that if
you<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.910> good<00:02:48.120> flesh<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.690> then<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.770> takes

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
you have a good flesh and then it takes

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.130 
you have a good flesh and then it takes
a<00:02:50.340> picture<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.940> got<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.450> bunch<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.870> really

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
a picture so I got a bunch of really

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.360 
a picture so I got a bunch of really
cool<00:02:52.950> high-speed<00:02:53.520> photographs<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.330> got<00:02:55.370> flour

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
cool high-speed photographs I got flour

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.440 
cool high-speed photographs I got flour
being<00:02:57.120> shot<00:02:57.720> through<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> syringe<00:02:58.910> some<00:02:59.910> water

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
being shot through a syringe some water

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.080 
being shot through a syringe some water
dropping<00:03:00.960> some<00:03:01.890> really<00:03:02.160> great<00:03:02.340> pictures<00:03:02.670> of

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
dropping some really great pictures of

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.750 
dropping some really great pictures of
Smashing<00:03:03.600> fruit<00:03:03.900> things<00:03:04.230> like<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
Smashing fruit things like that and you

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.570 
Smashing fruit things like that and you
can<00:03:05.940> try<00:03:06.120> stuff<00:03:06.360> out<00:03:06.480> for<00:03:06.660> yourself<00:03:06.990> so<00:03:07.580> that's

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
can try stuff out for yourself so that's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.480 
can try stuff out for yourself so that's
about<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.790> thanks<00:03:09.300> for<00:03:09.450> watching
