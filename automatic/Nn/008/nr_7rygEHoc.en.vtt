00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
on the television I held it for like

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.369 
on the television I held it for like
five<00:00:35.940> minutes<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
five minutes I don't think you have to

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.049 
five minutes I don't think you have to
do<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.589> for<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.800> long<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
do it for that long but then when I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.299 
do it for that long but then when I
released<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.589> think<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.890> pressed<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
released it and I think I pressed it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.890 
released it and I think I pressed it
again<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.420> transmission

actually<00:00:43.320> occurred<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.909> you<00:00:45.150> remember<00:00:45.420> on

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
actually occurred and if you remember on

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.960 
actually occurred and if you remember on
farm<00:00:45.839> you<00:00:46.080> had<00:00:46.229> to<00:00:46.409> hold<00:00:46.589> that<00:00:47.369> button<00:00:47.640> down

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
