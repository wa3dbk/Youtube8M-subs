people<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.830> wondering<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:29.429> kinds<00:00:29.730> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
people are wondering what kinds of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.400 
people are wondering what kinds of
things<00:00:29.849> we'd<00:00:30.210> find<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> stream<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.140> can

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
things we'd find in the stream here can

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.600 
things we'd find in the stream here can
you<00:00:31.500> tell<00:00:31.679> us<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.920> little<00:00:32.009> bit<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you tell us a little bit about that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.100 
you tell us a little bit about that
that's<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.030> good<00:00:33.210> question<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> look<00:00:33.960> here

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that's a good question if you look here

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.479 
that's a good question if you look here
at<00:00:34.230> coolio<00:00:34.500> stream<00:00:34.950> you'll<00:00:35.100> notice<00:00:35.370> right

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
at coolio stream you'll notice right

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.639 
at coolio stream you'll notice right
away<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.149> lined<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.600> concrete<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
away that it's lined with concrete the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.080 
away that it's lined with concrete the
reason<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.129> lined<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.399> concrete<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
reason it was lined with concrete is to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
reason it was lined with concrete is to
protect<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.899> houses<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> were<00:00:40.469> built<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
protect the houses that were built in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.069 
protect the houses that were built in
the<00:00:40.920> valley<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.489> flooding<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.360> essentially

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the valley from flooding so essentially

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.720 
the valley from flooding so essentially
you're<00:00:43.350> getting<00:00:43.649> water<00:00:43.860> off<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.129> land<00:00:44.520> more

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you're getting water off the land more

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
you're getting water off the land more
quickly<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> doesn't<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.110> time<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> build

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
quickly so it doesn't have time to build

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
quickly so it doesn't have time to build
up<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.760> acts<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.149> water

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
up and it kind of acts like a water

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.200 
up and it kind of acts like a water
slide<00:00:48.800> exactly<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.550> fast-moving<00:00:50.879> water

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
slide exactly but that fast-moving water

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
slide exactly but that fast-moving water
can<00:00:51.510> cause<00:00:51.660> quite<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> few<00:00:52.260> problems<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:53.160> what

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
can cause quite a few problems like what

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
can cause quite a few problems like what
well<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.600> thing<00:00:54.629> sediment<00:00:55.410> from<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
well for one thing sediment from the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860 
well for one thing sediment from the
mountain<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.370> no<00:00:56.520> longer<00:00:56.789> caught<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.420> filtered

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
mountain is no longer caught or filtered

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
mountain is no longer caught or filtered
as<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.140> comes<00:00:58.530> down<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> tends<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> just

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
as it comes down so it tends to just

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.490 
as it comes down so it tends to just
race<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> mountain<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.079> straight<00:01:01.379> out

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
race down the mountain and straight out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.579 
race down the mountain and straight out
into<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> reef<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:03.000> sediment

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
into the reef and that sediment

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.590 
into the reef and that sediment
ultimately<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.949> attract<00:01:05.400> algae<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
ultimately will attract algae and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.899 
ultimately will attract algae and
toxicants<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.740> once<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.040> layer<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.580> algae

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
toxicants and once that layer of algae

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
toxicants and once that layer of algae
intoxicants<00:01:09.630> gets<00:01:09.810> built<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:11.010> smother

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
intoxicants gets built up it can smother

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.000 
intoxicants gets built up it can smother
and<00:01:11.520> even<00:01:11.729> kill<00:01:11.939> coral<00:01:12.330> reefs<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.560> new<00:01:13.740> coral

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and even kill coral reefs and new coral

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
and even kill coral reefs and new coral
just<00:01:14.220> won't<00:01:14.369> grow<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> either<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.570> I'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
just won't grow on it either so I'm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
just won't grow on it either so I'm
assuming<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.290> once<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.680> coral<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.100> gone

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
assuming that once the coral is gone

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
assuming that once the coral is gone
then<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> organisms<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.360> live<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:18.869> also

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
then the organisms that live there also

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
then the organisms that live there also
are<00:01:19.710> gone<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.220> end<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.790> place<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
are gone you end up in a place with the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.840 
are gone you end up in a place with the
ocean<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.780> much<00:01:22.020> less<00:01:22.259> diversity<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.729> fish

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
ocean with much less diversity the fish

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.219 
ocean with much less diversity the fish
and<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> animals<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> live<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> coral

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and the animals that live in the coral

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.719 
and the animals that live in the coral
reef<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> seagrass<00:01:26.100> beds<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.400> can't

reef and the seagrass beds just can't

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
reef and the seagrass beds just can't
survive<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.330> luck<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:27.930> today

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
survive in that luck out there today

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.020 
survive in that luck out there today
we're<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> look<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.430> water

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
we're going to look at some water

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.230 
we're going to look at some water
quality<00:01:30.299> parameters<00:01:31.290> today<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.430> very

they<00:01:50.490> even<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> water<00:01:51.350> they<00:01:52.350> come

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
they even get in the water they come

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.960 
they even get in the water they come
from<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.799> variety<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.220> sources<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> most

from a variety of sources but the most

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.580 
from a variety of sources but the most
common<00:01:54.210> ones<00:01:54.600> would<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.900> your<00:01:55.320> lawn

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
common ones would be your lawn

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
common ones would be your lawn
fertilizers<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.850> other<00:01:57.420> types<00:01:57.659> of

wastes<00:02:03.350> cleaners<00:02:04.350> things<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.130> okay<00:02:05.759> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
wastes cleaners things like that okay so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
wastes cleaners things like that okay so
how<00:02:06.630> does<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:06.840> nutrient<00:02:07.500> testing<00:02:07.890> kit<00:02:08.100> work

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
how does this nutrient testing kit work

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
how does this nutrient testing kit work
let<00:02:08.819> me<00:02:08.880> show<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.060> let's<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.660> test<00:02:10.020> for

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
let me show you let's do a test for

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.620 
let me show you let's do a test for
nitrates<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:10.979> phosphates<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.239> what<00:02:12.390> we'll<00:02:12.510> do

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
nitrates and phosphates so what we'll do

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.630 
nitrates and phosphates so what we'll do
today<00:02:12.780> our<00:02:13.020> simple<00:02:13.410> color<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.709> metric<00:02:14.160> tests

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
today our simple color a metric tests

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.720 
today our simple color a metric tests
for<00:02:14.880> both<00:02:15.230> nitrate<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.440> phosphate<00:02:16.830> color

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
for both nitrate and phosphate color

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.190 
for both nitrate and phosphate color
metric<00:02:18.120> means<00:02:18.330> there's<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.750> color<00:02:18.959> change

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
metric means there's just a color change

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.920 
metric means there's just a color change
involved<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.940> darker<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.390> color<00:02:21.600> change

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
involved and the darker the color change

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.380 
involved and the darker the color change
that<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:23.150> higher<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
that you get the higher the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.060 
that you get the higher the
concentration<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.440> nutrient<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
concentration of the nutrient in the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.340 
concentration of the nutrient in the
water<00:02:26.250> okay<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> first<00:02:27.840> thing<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.080> we'll

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
water okay so the first thing that we'll

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.250 
water okay so the first thing that we'll
look<00:02:28.380> at<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.860> nitrate<00:02:29.760> level<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.690> what

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
look at is the nitrate level so what

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.809 
look at is the nitrate level so what
we'll<00:02:31.410> do<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.590> we'll<00:02:31.860> take<00:02:32.100> one<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.310> these<00:02:32.519> test

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
we'll do is we'll take one of these test

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.000 
we'll do is we'll take one of these test
tubes<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.300> we'll<00:02:34.140> fill<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.650> five

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
tubes and we'll fill it to the five

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490 
tubes and we'll fill it to the five
milliliter<00:02:35.519> line<00:02:35.850> with<00:02:36.510> our<00:02:36.750> water<00:02:37.110> sample

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
milliliter line with our water sample

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.259 
milliliter line with our water sample
that<00:02:37.620> we've<00:02:37.739> already<00:02:37.950> collected<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
that we've already collected out of the

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.180 
that we've already collected out of the
stream<00:02:39.630> mouth<00:02:39.810> okay<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.890> could<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.160> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
stream mouth okay if you could do that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.390 
stream mouth okay if you could do that
sure

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.000 

okay<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.030> think<00:02:49.209> that's<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.780> great<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.739> next

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
okay I think that's it great the next

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.289 
okay I think that's it great the next
thing<00:02:51.129> that<00:02:51.189> we'll<00:02:51.459> do<00:02:51.579> is<00:02:51.670> we'll<00:02:51.790> take<00:02:51.970> one<00:02:52.150> of

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
thing that we'll do is we'll take one of

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.259 
thing that we'll do is we'll take one of
these<00:02:52.420> nitrate<00:02:53.110> react<00:02:53.950> reagent<00:02:54.549> tablets<00:02:55.030> and

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
these nitrate react reagent tablets and

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.259 
these nitrate react reagent tablets and
we'll<00:02:55.450> put<00:02:55.689> it<00:02:55.810> inside<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.980> test<00:02:57.220> tube<00:02:57.430> okay

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.270 

just<00:03:01.269> drop<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.659> in<00:03:01.780> that's<00:03:02.230> right<00:03:02.409> okay<00:03:02.860> simple

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
just drop it in that's right okay simple

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.240 
just drop it in that's right okay simple
yeah<00:03:03.400> yeah<00:03:03.939> and<00:03:04.390> go<00:03:04.780> ahead<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:04.959> cap<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:06.780> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
yeah yeah and go ahead and cap it and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.710 
yeah yeah and go ahead and cap it and
then<00:03:09.250> what<00:03:09.459> you'll<00:03:09.579> want<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.849> do<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.510> just

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
then what you'll want to do is to just

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.559 
then what you'll want to do is to just
slowly<00:03:11.579> continue<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.730> invert<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.180> tube<00:03:13.359> it

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
slowly continue to invert the tube it

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.770 
slowly continue to invert the tube it
helps<00:03:13.959> if<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.170> put<00:03:14.349> a<00:03:14.560> finger<00:03:14.829> on<00:03:14.950> each<00:03:15.220> end

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
helps if you put a finger on each end

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.839 
helps if you put a finger on each end
there<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:16.870> go<00:03:16.989> okay<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.799> just<00:03:17.849> keep

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
there you go okay and just keep

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.270 
there you go okay and just keep
inverting<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:20.170> idea<00:03:20.409> being<00:03:20.590> not<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:21.010> shake

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
inverting it the idea being not to shake

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.970 
inverting it the idea being not to shake
it<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.940> slowly<00:03:22.389> invert<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.810> until<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
it but to slowly invert it until the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.339 
it but to slowly invert it until the
tablet<00:03:24.370> dissolves<00:03:24.909> okay<00:03:25.599> this<00:03:25.780> can<00:03:25.989> take<00:03:26.139> just

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
tablet dissolves okay this can take just

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.369 
tablet dissolves okay this can take just
a<00:03:26.530> couple<00:03:26.560> minutes<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:29.049> while<00:03:29.230> we're<00:03:29.349> waiting

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
a couple minutes so while we're waiting

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.670 
a couple minutes so while we're waiting
for<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:30.069> test<00:03:30.579> reaction<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.690> occur<00:03:31.989> we'll<00:03:32.560> go

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
for that test reaction to occur we'll go

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.449 
for that test reaction to occur we'll go
ahead<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.280> run<00:03:34.120> our<00:03:34.180> phosphate<00:03:34.780> test<00:03:35.079> okay<00:03:35.650> so

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
ahead and run our phosphate test okay so

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.190 
ahead and run our phosphate test okay so
the<00:03:36.579> next<00:03:36.609> thing<00:03:36.879> we'll<00:03:37.090> do<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.209> use<00:03:37.750> another

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
the next thing we'll do is use another

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.379 
the next thing we'll do is use another
test<00:03:38.500> tube<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.040> same<00:03:39.250> type<00:03:39.519> okay<00:03:40.239> and

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
test tube of the same type okay and

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.990 
test tube of the same type okay and
we'll<00:03:40.870> fill<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.590> 10<00:03:41.980> milliliter<00:03:42.670> line

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
we'll fill it to the 10 milliliter line

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.020 
we'll fill it to the 10 milliliter line
with<00:03:43.389> our<00:03:43.989> water<00:03:44.560> sample<00:03:46.829> great<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.159> then

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
with our water sample great and then

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.300 
with our water sample great and then
we'll<00:03:49.239> add<00:03:49.420> one<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:49.989> these<00:03:50.109> tablets<00:03:50.859> which<00:03:51.129> is

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
we'll add one of these tablets which is

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.610 
we'll add one of these tablets which is
a<00:03:51.340> phosphate<00:03:52.060> reagent<00:03:52.540> tablet<00:03:53.019> all<00:03:53.470> right

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.300 

alright<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.610> it's<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.420> same<00:04:01.450> procedure

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
alright and it's the same procedure

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.690 
alright and it's the same procedure
captive<00:04:03.310> sample<00:04:03.730> invert<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:05.280> until<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
captive sample invert it until the

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.699 
captive sample invert it until the
tablet<00:04:07.150> dissolves<00:04:07.569> or<00:04:07.690> nearly<00:04:07.959> dissolves<00:04:08.560> if

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
tablet dissolves or nearly dissolves if

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.289 
tablet dissolves or nearly dissolves if
sometimes<00:04:09.069> they<00:04:09.220> won't<00:04:09.400> completely<00:04:09.760> dissolve

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
sometimes they won't completely dissolve

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.080 
sometimes they won't completely dissolve
and<00:04:10.810> as<00:04:11.530> this<00:04:11.680> one<00:04:11.890> do<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.430> have<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.700> wait<00:04:12.849> five

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
and as this one do you have to wait five

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.580 
and as this one do you have to wait five
minutes<00:04:13.390> for<00:04:13.569> the<00:04:13.810> down<00:04:13.959> tube<00:04:14.260> will<00:04:14.470> wait

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
minutes for the down tube will wait

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.740 
minutes for the down tube will wait
another<00:04:14.920> five<00:04:15.310> or<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:15.790> minutes<00:04:15.819> for<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:16.540> one

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
another five or so minutes for that one

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.210 
another five or so minutes for that one
as<00:04:16.900> well<00:04:21.510> all<00:04:22.510> right<00:04:22.600> great<00:04:22.870> job<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:24.010> seems

your<00:04:36.699> own<00:04:36.820> stream<00:04:37.180> alright<00:04:37.810> Alyssa<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.169> think

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
your own stream alright Alyssa I think

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.930 
your own stream alright Alyssa I think
it's<00:04:38.560> been<00:04:38.710> about<00:04:38.889> five<00:04:39.130> minutes<00:04:39.400> our<00:04:39.699> tests

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
it's been about five minutes our tests

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.460 
it's been about five minutes our tests
should<00:04:40.090> be<00:04:40.240> done<00:04:40.419> right<00:04:40.630> yeah<00:04:40.960> let's<00:04:41.229> see<00:04:41.350> what

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
should be done right yeah let's see what

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.129 
should be done right yeah let's see what
we<00:04:41.560> have<00:04:41.590> here<00:04:41.740> okay<00:04:42.660> do<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.750> want<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> start

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
we have here okay do you want to start

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.310 
we have here okay do you want to start
with<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:44.410> nitrate<00:04:44.800> yes<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:46.570> procedure<00:04:46.930> for

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
with the nitrate yes the procedure for

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.350 
with the nitrate yes the procedure for
determining<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:48.310> level<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.850> nitrate<00:04:49.240> that

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
determining the level of nitrate that

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.200 
determining the level of nitrate that
you<00:04:49.479> find<00:04:49.750> in<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.020> water<00:04:50.229> is<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:51.310> lay<00:04:51.820> this

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
you find in the water is to lay this

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.650 
you find in the water is to lay this
test<00:04:52.630> tube<00:04:52.930> on<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.229> white<00:04:53.710> strip<00:04:54.250> adjacent<00:04:54.970> to

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
test tube on the white strip adjacent to

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.379 
test tube on the white strip adjacent to
the<00:04:56.350> indicator<00:04:56.650> levels<00:04:57.310> on<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:57.760> on<00:04:58.150> the

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
the indicator levels on this on the

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.469 
the indicator levels on this on the
table<00:04:58.750> okay<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.590> what<00:05:00.160> we<00:05:00.280> see<00:05:00.460> here<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.940> a

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
table okay so what we see here is a

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.320 
table okay so what we see here is a
white<00:05:01.720> card<00:05:02.139> with<00:05:02.440> red<00:05:02.680> dots<00:05:02.979> and<00:05:03.370> we<00:05:04.120> match

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
white card with red dots and we match

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.990 
white card with red dots and we match
the<00:05:04.660> color<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.680> sample<00:05:06.099> to<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.880> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
the color of the sample to to the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.290 
the color of the sample to to the
closest<00:05:07.510> red<00:05:07.900> dot<00:05:08.169> color<00:05:08.500> on<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:08.979> card<00:05:09.300> so

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
closest red dot color on the card so

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.150 
closest red dot color on the card so
this<00:05:10.510> does<00:05:10.720> look<00:05:10.930> pretty<00:05:11.110> high<00:05:11.380> for<00:05:11.440> the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
this does look pretty high for the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.920 
this does look pretty high for the
colors<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.669> are<00:05:12.820> on<00:05:12.970> there<00:05:13.180> yeah<00:05:13.510> it's<00:05:13.750> about

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
colors that are on there yeah it's about

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.260 
colors that are on there yeah it's about
a<00:05:14.110> medium<00:05:14.470> range<00:05:15.070> here<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.550> this<00:05:15.639> gives<00:05:15.820> us<00:05:16.090> a

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
a medium range here and this gives us a

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.140 
a medium range here and this gives us a
kind<00:05:16.539> of<00:05:16.660> a<00:05:16.780> range<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:18.190> level<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.849> doesn't

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
kind of a range of the level it doesn't

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.029 
kind of a range of the level it doesn't
give<00:05:19.240> us<00:05:19.389> a<00:05:19.510> precise<00:05:19.960> level<00:05:20.260> but<00:05:20.560> it<00:05:20.680> gives<00:05:20.800> us

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
give us a precise level but it gives us

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.550 
give us a precise level but it gives us
a<00:05:21.160> good<00:05:21.400> idea<00:05:21.460> of<00:05:21.940> how<00:05:22.270> much<00:05:22.479> is<00:05:22.660> there<00:05:22.900> okay

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
a good idea of how much is there okay

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.589 
a good idea of how much is there okay
just<00:05:24.220> think<00:05:24.460> we'll<00:05:24.639> do<00:05:24.729> the<00:05:24.880> same<00:05:25.090> thing<00:05:25.389> with

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
just think we'll do the same thing with

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.589 
just think we'll do the same thing with
the<00:05:25.630> phosphate<00:05:26.320> test<00:05:27.030> will<00:05:28.030> take<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.360> test

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
the phosphate test will take the test

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.670 
the phosphate test will take the test
tube<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:30.360> we'll<00:05:31.360> lay<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.750> on<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.990> white<00:05:32.169> space

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
tube and we'll lay it on the white space

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.760 
tube and we'll lay it on the white space
next<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.880> phosphate<00:05:34.479> indicator<00:05:35.050> colors

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
next to the phosphate indicator colors

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.850 
next to the phosphate indicator colors
and<00:05:36.070> we'll<00:05:36.820> try<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.150> match<00:05:37.479> the<00:05:38.320> color<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.680> the

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
and we'll try to match the color of the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.490 
and we'll try to match the color of the
test<00:05:39.099> tube<00:05:39.340> with<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.940> closest<00:05:40.599> color<00:05:40.870> dot<00:05:41.229> on

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
test tube with the closest color dot on

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.800 
test tube with the closest color dot on
the<00:05:41.740> card<00:05:41.979> okay<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:42.940> again<00:05:43.210> it<00:05:43.330> looks<00:05:43.360> like<00:05:43.660> we

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
the card okay and again it looks like we

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.750 
the card okay and again it looks like we
have<00:05:43.930> kind<00:05:44.229> of<00:05:44.289> a<00:05:44.410> mid-range<00:05:44.830> going<00:05:45.310> on<00:05:45.490> here

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
have kind of a mid-range going on here

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.409 
have kind of a mid-range going on here
yeah<00:05:46.120> yeah<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:47.710> 100<00:05:48.190> years<00:05:48.400> ago<00:05:48.699> before<00:05:49.030> there

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
yeah yeah so 100 years ago before there

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.420 
yeah yeah so 100 years ago before there
was<00:05:49.630> this<00:05:49.930> channelized<00:05:50.590> stream<00:05:50.979> with<00:05:51.160> all<00:05:51.310> the

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
was this channelized stream with all the

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.000 
was this channelized stream with all the
concrete<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:52.150> all<00:05:52.240> this<00:05:52.389> development<00:05:53.020> what

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
concrete and all this development what

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.770 
concrete and all this development what
kind<00:05:54.220> of<00:05:54.310> nutrient<00:05:54.880> levels<00:05:55.180> would<00:05:55.360> we<00:05:55.539> see

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
kind of nutrient levels would we see

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.659 
kind of nutrient levels would we see
well<00:05:56.680> we<00:05:56.770> definitely<00:05:56.949> would<00:05:57.310> have<00:05:57.340> seen<00:05:57.639> a

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
well we definitely would have seen a

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.850 
well we definitely would have seen a
better<00:05:58.240> balance<00:05:58.599> of<00:05:58.960> nutrients<00:05:59.320> between<00:05:59.680> the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
better balance of nutrients between the

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.100 
better balance of nutrients between the
land<00:06:00.039> and<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.340> ocean<00:06:00.849> we<00:06:01.599> also<00:06:01.720> would<00:06:01.960> have

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
land and the ocean we also would have

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.800 
land and the ocean we also would have
seen<00:06:02.410> a<00:06:02.710> lot<00:06:03.220> more<00:06:03.460> diversity<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.389> habitats

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
seen a lot more diversity and habitats

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.580 
seen a lot more diversity and habitats
in<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.260> bay<00:06:05.410> a<00:06:06.099> lot<00:06:06.610> less<00:06:06.820> of<00:06:07.030> this<00:06:07.120> you<00:06:07.419> know

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
in the bay a lot less of this you know

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.350 
in the bay a lot less of this you know
associated<00:06:08.590> algae<00:06:08.950> growth<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:09.909> so<00:06:10.150> forth

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
associated algae growth and so forth

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.550 
associated algae growth and so forth
there<00:06:10.479> still<00:06:10.659> would<00:06:10.719> have<00:06:10.780> been<00:06:10.930> some<00:06:11.200> algae

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
there still would have been some algae

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.300 
there still would have been some algae
and<00:06:11.680> some<00:06:11.890> set

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
and some set

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.640 
and some set
out<00:06:12.370> there<00:06:12.550> but<00:06:13.210> nothing<00:06:13.600> like<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:14.170> muck<00:06:14.470> that

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
out there but nothing like the muck that

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.050 
out there but nothing like the muck that
we<00:06:14.800> see<00:06:14.980> here<00:06:15.100> but<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.400> coral<00:06:15.640> reefs<00:06:15.850> would

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
we see here but the coral reefs would

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.120 
we see here but the coral reefs would
have<00:06:16.150> been<00:06:16.270> in<00:06:16.420> better<00:06:16.570> shape<00:06:16.950> and<00:06:17.950> the

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
have been in better shape and the

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.560 
have been in better shape and the
seagrass<00:06:18.460> beds<00:06:18.490> would<00:06:18.880> have<00:06:19.000> been<00:06:19.120> in<00:06:19.450> better

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
seagrass beds would have been in better

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.450 
seagrass beds would have been in better
