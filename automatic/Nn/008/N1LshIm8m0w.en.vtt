00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
and I think that for each of them they

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.819 
and I think that for each of them they
would<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:41.899> wanted<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.259> have<00:01:42.409> their<00:01:42.590> day<00:01:42.710> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.770 
court and would have wanted to be heard
I<00:01:44.360> think<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.490> miss<00:01:46.490> Roy<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:46.969> going<00:01:47.149> to<00:01:47.270> have<00:01:47.450> a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
I think that miss Roy is going to have a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.830
