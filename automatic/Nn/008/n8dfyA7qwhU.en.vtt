00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello now print this one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.200
 let's see the package inside 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.790
 so inside is such here 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 box 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.750
 it says spa one as i remember it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.060
 the company is engaged in production 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.800
 various sports watches see what 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.119
 all the same here we have yes 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.119
 really and for hours 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.050
 more and more nothing 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 colleague from came and so in the kit 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 only instruction in English and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.309
 Here is such a sensor 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.969
 which are part of the clock this 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.969
 heart rate monitor 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.660
 it feeds us from one battery cr 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660
 2032 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.460
 the battery is already inside so 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.369
 let's go to the clock itself what we see is 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:15.229
 we have four buttons they are metal 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.600
 watch case is also made of metal 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.750
 rubber strap at the back is present 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.759
 the inscription of water resistance on 50 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.479
 meters and the actual model of these 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.920
 spv of hours is 906, left top button 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 this highlight 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.530
 lower fashion upper right start stop and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.439
 right button menu mode on top 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.100
 is the logo he slept now i 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.119
 I will show you how the lights work 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.549
 the numbers themselves glow no background around them 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.950
 as it is mostly done in various 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.829
 electronic clock in this case 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.870
 the elements themselves are glowing 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.270
 on the screen 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.700
 Here is such a heart rate sensor in 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.400
 complete strap has the ability 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.490
 adjustment is removed like this 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.490
 way 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.840
 very well thought out of two 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.730
 parties can do it 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.130
 that is enough once 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.930
 adjust the sensor for yourself and after 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.850
 remove and install them from 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.370
 using quick-release fastener 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.970
 refer to the instructions see what 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.000
 functions have this watch 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.490
 Of course, the clock has an alarm clock 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 stopwatch backlight screen signal when 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.770
 pressing the buttons claimed 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.080
 water resistant to 50 meters as well 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.660
 they give a signal when the readings 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.360
 heart rate monitor exceed or fall 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.900
 below the set limit the minimum threshold 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.470
 is 60 and the top 220 beats in 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.959
 a minute 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.540
 wireless heart rate monitor works 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.610
 at a frequency of 5 3 kilohertz on this 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.160
 The picture shows the installation method 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.080
 hours they can be worn on the hand and 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.970
 attach to the handlebar or 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.160
 another vehicle using 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.350
 whom do you play sports 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.450
 declared work time from one 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.490
 batteries 36 months 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.190
 So let's go through the main functions. 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.250
 data clock left button is responsible 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.290
 just for activating the backlight for 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.650
 to set the alarm click 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.690
 bottom left button called fashion 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.970
 getting into the alarm settings using 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.340
 right upper start-stop you can 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.050
 set the alarm 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.140
 signal that sounds when offensive 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.500
 New hour and at the same time both characters 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.660
 in order to change the time on which 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.940
 set alarm click on the key 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.980
 menu 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.700
 time is changed with the button 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.920
 start-stop 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.290
 set now the alarm to you 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.290
 could appreciate the sound with which it sounds 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.440
 This is how the alarm clock sounds. 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.690
 you can press any button or 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.209
 it will stop automatically after 30 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.099
 seconds to get into mode 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.769
 heart rate monitor, press the top right 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.830
 the start stop button starts 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.110
 timer and heart rate monitor start counting 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.870
 pulse now you see my pulse 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.169
 eighty three beats per minute pressed 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.030
 on the start-stop key displays 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.340
 average heart rate over current 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.410
 time lapse and also stops 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.260
 timer Pressing the key 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.300
 start-stop re-starts the timer for 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.130
 order to exit heart rate mode 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.850
 stop the timer using the button 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.700
 start-stop 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.229
 and hold the same button again for 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.290
 return to normal mode 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.960
 pressing the lower right menu button in 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.770
 clock mode does not do anything long 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.160
 retention 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.130
 puts the clock in setting mode here 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.710
 you can set the time as well 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:59.250
 the upper threshold of the pulse at which will be 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:02.729
 warnings and exceeding 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.030
 threshold watch beeps important 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.539
 correctly position the sensor as shown 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.880
 in this picture it should be 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.669
 opposite the heart is the maximum distance 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.440
 from the sensor to the clock is 65 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.900
 centimeters that is quite real 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.270
 set the clock on the handlebars and 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.740
 watch the result on it now wear 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.139
 at hand let's see how they will 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.139
 look bad on my arm 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.080
 looks great in my opinion will come out 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.840
 pulsator mode my opinion is that the data 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.419
 watches are very real to the purchase value 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.879
 I think they are around $ 30 and out of them 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.449
 competitors can only remember 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:48.060
 sigma manufacturer 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.400
 they also do the heart rate monitor me and 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.469
 wella computers to 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.050
 check how this watch will show itself when 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.789
 testing takes time but my first 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.159
 familiarity with them went well I 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.870
 I will be pleased to use them all 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.639

 electronic gadgets ask questions 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:13.680
 On this watch, I will indicate a purchase link 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.120
 in the description under the video all good 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.120
 mood to new meetings
