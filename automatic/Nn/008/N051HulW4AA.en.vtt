00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 in the past the great warriors were 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.620
 fearless because they were 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.900
 carriers of great skills 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.139
 they grew they lived their lives in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.450
 great virtues in honor of justice and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 motto of the warriors were to protect 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.930
 defend a just cause that glorifies the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.699
 god is the greatest good 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.800
 different from the soldiers who were 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.230
 obliged to follow the orders of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 hierarchy of the empire in exchange for the deaf 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.550
 and promises of a better life in a 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.949
 time of great battles that were 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.559
 necessary for our evolution 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.469
 today we do not need the times anymore 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.230
 passed and we evolved the warriors 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.510
 of light are paladin incarnate souls 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 living the historical moments in times 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.809
 of this new land that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.969
 detaches each day 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 time and linear time of a system of 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.500
 belief that no longer serves us 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.960
 we must detach ourselves from systems 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 ancient and past thoughts and unite 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.500
 our forces at this moment in a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 light vibration 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 This is our work, let's cut with 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.729
 our invisible swords in the fallible 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.490
 moorings and traps of our minds and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.070
 thoughts dispense what does not 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 well let go quietly without 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 to be part of the battle 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.580
 keeping the love of all that is sacred 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.270
 and allows us to bring the desires of the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.540
 union of the faith of the goodness of the inner light 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.880
 We are paladins in search of the light. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 our swords in the form of a cross for 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 to remember that justice is in every 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.100
 one of our words thought and action 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.189
 Divine, we re- live life to the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.560
 light and all beings give off less 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.500
 from what does not add enlightenment to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.110
 goodness to the sacred, let us overcome our 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.170
 weaknesses are material or carnal 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.899
 let 's free personal time in virtue 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.909
 goodness honor and truth enshrines 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.619
 attributes of the song's activity 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.770
 warrior soul of light 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.770
 let us be the unshakable faith love and light
