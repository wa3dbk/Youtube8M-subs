00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.950
 There you go 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.850
 shoot the 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.850
 for 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.849
 see at the level of compression do 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.130
 a little burn-in and valves and 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.320
 others and then I will explain 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.019
 a little what will be done in what 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.510
 carburetor leaves here it's going to be 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.040
 removed the radiator should be removed 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.900
 the collector of course with the exhaust 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 who is behind a little disconnect everything 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.460
 the cables and then we will be able 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.730
 remove the motor completely 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:58.050
 it will of course have to removed the grocery store have 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.620
 been reduced in russia to remove 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.590
 three and a half pounds 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.700
 maybe a little bit more and that makes 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.910
 a little heavier and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 and so 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.930
 here we go 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 now i have interest but made a 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.040
 tonic flaw makes it necessary to do 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:35.430
 it is therefore disconnect the carburetors 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.030
 on the motor side this time at the level 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.030
 intake pipes 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.610
 there are flow rates and a little more 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.490
 far so on so I had it tv 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.440
 and then once removed you have to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.020
 disconnect the choke cable 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:01.830
 two cables for the throttle 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.860
 I think it's all a yes and target 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.470
 connected below the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.530
 carburetor heaters so here a 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.530
 hop hop is then on the other side too 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.470
 shows here to disconnect 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.110
 yes a little further this one so he 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.269
 there is the carburettor that comes out on its own and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:33.980
 will be there now so we removed the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.859
 carburettor also summoned a big hole 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.640
 so the carburetor was removed and other 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:44.359
 thing free escape so here I have 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.470
 removed excellence eyes also 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.470
 I still say and the collectors 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.290
 yes we continue 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.060
 and here is the collector 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.749
 ehret then a little trick for not 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:18.249
 lose your screws you give them to them 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:24.310
 place if we can see the light whose 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:27.189
 levis format to their pass like that and 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.819
 no problem I see what is not 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.469
 to tell you at all that she aims to 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.250
 leo 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:41.540
 here you are after having 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.270
 remove the collector I handed the cash 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.840
 So simply coated with breech 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.860
 screwed and but not serial at all a 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.720
 of course did not forget that when you 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.810
 put off your June if you want 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.810
 recover and clean the surface well 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.500
 and so now I'm going 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.780
 take care of my channel that I 'm going 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.959
 must remove 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.660
 it's stupid because I exchanged it 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:12.590
 not even 500 km so I could have fun 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.950
 again remove everything and we 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.950
 keep on going 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.379
 So this is it 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.240
 I stopped ray the little pinion 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:32.289
 chain that listen side well what I 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.080
 know to do it is wee d'anjou he 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:40.219
 has already retired a little bit of weight 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:46.270
 and then they make that disconnected the 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:54.580
 radiator and for that just 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:56.479
 here are loosened bolts we have 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.759
 of the two bolts that are only 6 to 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.759
 above and still inside 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:10.490
 m hop and one more bolt there and then we 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:17.289
 can remove the radiator but just in 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:21.580
 disconnecting the jo here is impeccable 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.580
 and we continue
