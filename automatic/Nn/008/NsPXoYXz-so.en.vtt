today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.860 
today I'm going to show you how to
assemble<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.379> worm<00:00:07.560> Factory<00:00:08.389> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.599> one

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
assemble the worm Factory this is one

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.770 
assemble the worm Factory this is one
that<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.139> have<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.740> use<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> lot<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.030> other<00:00:12.269> methods

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
that I have I use a lot of other methods

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.330 
that I have I use a lot of other methods
but<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.320> one<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.280> I

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
should use for shoveling that example

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.099 
should use for shoveling that example
I'm<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.210> try<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.359> put<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.630> together<00:00:18.779> as

earlier I should get a good sear and

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.670 
earlier I should get a good sear and
slide<00:02:38.720> off<00:02:39.260> there

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.510 

as<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.250> see

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
as you see

as you see
a<00:02:45.610> good<00:02:46.330> half<00:02:46.540> father<00:02:46.810> pound<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.410> worms<00:02:47.590> other

go<00:02:48.160> ahead<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.460> put<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> little<00:02:48.790> bit<00:02:48.910> more

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
go ahead and put a little bit more

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.520 
go ahead and put a little bit more
like<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.780> said<00:02:50.960> you<00:02:51.170> see

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.740 

and<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.190> little<00:02:54.340> bit<00:02:54.550> of<00:02:54.580> war<00:02:54.790> learning<00:02:55.240> origin

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
and a little bit of war learning origin

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.559 
and a little bit of war learning origin
of<00:02:56.190> spread<00:02:57.190> them<00:02:57.340> around<00:02:57.459> leave<00:02:57.819> living<00:02:58.090> pilot

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
of spread them around leave living pilot

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.320 
of spread them around leave living pilot
doesn't<00:02:58.720> really<00:02:58.959> matter<00:02:59.400> there's<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.490> enough

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
doesn't really matter there's a enough

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.650 
doesn't really matter there's a enough
of<00:03:01.510> them<00:03:01.600> in<00:03:01.690> there<00:03:01.840> they'll<00:03:02.020> find<00:03:02.260> each<00:03:02.380> other

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
of them in there they'll find each other

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.610 
of them in there they'll find each other
so<00:03:04.660> i<00:03:04.690> guess<00:03:04.990> i'm<00:03:05.110> going<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.290> end<00:03:05.410> up<00:03:05.470> with

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
so i guess i'm going to end up with

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.040 
so i guess i'm going to end up with
about<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.860> power<00:03:06.130> of<00:03:06.250> em<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.520> here
