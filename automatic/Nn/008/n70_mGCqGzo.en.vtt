00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it happened in like quite a few of the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
it happened in like quite a few of the
games<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.649> getting<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.250> repetitive<00:01:44.549> so

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
games it was getting a bit repetitive so

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.760 
games it was getting a bit repetitive so
that<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> bit<00:01:45.930> weird<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.259> mean<00:01:46.380> his<00:01:46.560> shock

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that was a bit weird I mean his shock

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.249 
that was a bit weird I mean his shock
power<00:01:46.950> isn't<00:01:47.189> great<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.390> apparently

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
power isn't great but then apparently

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.480 
power isn't great but then apparently
the<00:01:49.350> keepers<00:01:49.590> can't<00:01:49.799> handle<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.310> yeah

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the keepers can't handle it so yeah

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.100 
the keepers can't handle it so yeah
pretty<00:01:50.729> crazy<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.869> finish

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
pretty crazy and if you don't finish
