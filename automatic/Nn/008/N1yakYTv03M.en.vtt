00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so I want to take a guess I'm going to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
so I want to take a guess I'm going to
say<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> first<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.230> we're

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
say that the first one that we're

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.280 
say that the first one that we're
opening<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:04.760> drumroll<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:06.450> gonna<00:01:06.810> say<00:01:07.110> it's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
opening is drumroll I'm gonna say it's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
opening is drumroll I'm gonna say it's
the<00:01:07.439> n3<00:01:07.799> let's<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.760> right<00:01:08.790> ah<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.850> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the n3 let's see if I'm right ah it is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.310 
the n3 let's see if I'm right ah it is
the<00:01:12.240> n3<00:01:12.750> ok<00:01:14.810> now<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> n3<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:17.810> slightly<00:01:18.810> unique

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the n3 ok now the n3 is slightly unique

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.429 
the n3 ok now the n3 is slightly unique
but<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.130> rotating<00:01:20.670> camera<00:01:20.990> isn't<00:01:21.990> something

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
but the rotating camera isn't something

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
but the rotating camera isn't something
that's<00:01:22.560> entirely<00:01:23.490> new<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.979> opa<00:01:25.979> devices<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that's entirely new to opa devices the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
that's entirely new to opa devices the
oppo<00:01:27.479> n1<00:01:27.689> also<00:01:28.470> had<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> rotating<00:01:29.189> camera

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
oppo n1 also had a rotating camera

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.870 
oppo n1 also had a rotating camera
what's<00:01:30.210> different<00:01:30.360> about<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.880> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
what's different about this is that this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
what's different about this is that this
one<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:35.000> automatic<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.630> rotate<00:01:37.049> by<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
one is automatic it will rotate by the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.300 
one is automatic it will rotate by the
oak<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:38.670> rotate<00:01:39.090> by<00:01:39.270> gestures<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.920> an

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
oak little rotate by gestures and as an

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.899 
oak little rotate by gestures and as an
another<00:01:42.240> command<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:42.899> well<00:01:43.490> whereas<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
another command as well whereas the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.499 
another command as well whereas the
previous<00:01:44.939> model<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.110> end<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:47.270> was<00:01:48.270> all

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
previous model the end one was all

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.280 
previous model the end one was all
manual<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> automatic<00:01:50.220> rotation<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.939> nice

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
manual so the automatic rotation is nice

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.700 
manual so the automatic rotation is nice
so<00:01:52.670> if<00:01:53.670> you're<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:53.970> familiar<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.750> oppo

now this is the cameras been tested to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.470 
now this is the cameras been tested to
rotate<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.490> hundred<00:02:21.880> thousand<00:02:22.300> times

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
the device it's all figure how to put

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.170 
the device it's all figure how to put
the<00:04:29.770> battery<00:04:30.040> in<00:04:30.160> later<00:04:30.460> but<00:04:30.759> it<00:04:30.970> looks<00:04:31.120> like

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
the battery in later but it looks like

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.340 
the battery in later but it looks like
this<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.540> slightly<00:04:31.750> different<00:04:31.960> than<00:04:32.169> the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
this is slightly different than the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.680 
this is slightly different than the
original<00:04:32.710> low<00:04:32.830> click<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:34.150> not<00:04:34.330> completely

unblock the next one and see what we got
there<00:04:49.139> okay<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:50.199> if<00:04:50.590> this<00:04:50.800> was<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:52.710> n3<00:04:53.850> that

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
there okay so if this was the n3 that

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.240 
there okay so if this was the n3 that
means<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.330> one<00:04:55.539> is<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.810> r5<00:04:56.289> and<00:04:56.680> there<00:04:56.889> is

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
means this one is the r5 and there is

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.450 
means this one is the r5 and there is
the<00:04:57.970> r5<00:04:58.630> alright<00:04:59.260> so<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.830> packaging<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.280> going

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
the r5 alright so the packaging is going

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.129 
the r5 alright so the packaging is going
to<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.639> very<00:05:00.669> similar<00:05:01.360> but<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.660> devices<00:05:02.050> are

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
to be very similar but the devices are

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.629 
to be very similar but the devices are
going<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.320> be<00:05:02.380> very<00:05:02.530> different<00:05:02.800> let's<00:05:03.520> go

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
going to be very different let's go

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.560 
going to be very different let's go
ahead<00:05:03.699> and<00:05:03.789> rip<00:05:04.000> that<00:05:04.180> off<00:05:04.440> all<00:05:05.440> right<00:05:06.570> here's

millimeter<00:05:39.550> audio<00:05:40.510> jack<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:41.470> device<00:05:41.770> is

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
millimeter audio jack this device is

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.430 
millimeter audio jack this device is
actually<00:05:42.240> so<00:05:43.240> thin<00:05:43.659> that<00:05:43.690> they<00:05:44.020> couldn't<00:05:44.289> put

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
actually so thin that they couldn't put

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.210 
actually so thin that they couldn't put
it<00:05:44.560> in<00:05:44.820> quite<00:05:45.820> interesting<00:05:48.539> but<00:05:49.860> it<00:05:50.860> does<00:05:51.039> have

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
it in quite interesting but it does have

and<00:06:01.960> it's<00:06:02.380> a<00:06:02.500> very<00:06:02.530> thin<00:06:02.979> we'll<00:06:03.220> go<00:06:03.340> ahead<00:06:03.430> and

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
and it's a very thin we'll go ahead and

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.890 
and it's a very thin we'll go ahead and
take<00:06:03.669> a<00:06:03.729> look<00:06:03.909> at<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.120> specs<00:06:04.419> later<00:06:04.659> and

feeling<00:06:12.130> device<00:06:12.720> all<00:06:13.720> right<00:06:13.810> let's<00:06:13.990> see<00:06:14.080> what

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
feeling device all right let's see what

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.510 
feeling device all right let's see what
we<00:06:14.199> got<00:06:14.380> here<00:06:14.440> the<00:06:14.680> packaging<00:06:15.130> should<00:06:15.310> be

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
we got here the packaging should be

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.320 
we got here the packaging should be
fairly<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.150> same<00:06:16.360> since<00:06:17.199> it<00:06:17.440> is<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:18.330> sister

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
fairly the same since it is a sister

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
here now remember the r5 doesn't have an

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.089 
here now remember the r5 doesn't have an
audio<00:06:34.719> jack<00:06:34.779> so<00:06:35.349> it's<00:06:35.500> quite<00:06:35.710> interesting

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
audio jack so it's quite interesting
