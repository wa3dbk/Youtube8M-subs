00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.120 
annoying because it doesn't contain an
SPF<00:03:08.240> which<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.630> find<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.230> little<00:03:09.350> bit<00:03:09.650> silly<00:03:09.890> and

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
SPF which I find a little bit silly and

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.220 
SPF which I find a little bit silly and
a<00:03:10.190> little<00:03:10.490> bit<00:03:10.610> Dicky<00:03:10.910> don't<00:03:11.269> wheel<00:03:11.510> so

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
a little bit Dicky don't wheel so

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.990 
a little bit Dicky don't wheel so
pattern<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.709> like<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.280> very<00:03:13.459> thick<00:03:13.760> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
pattern that I like it's very thick the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.479 
pattern that I like it's very thick the
shade<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.630> little<00:03:15.050> bit<00:03:15.200> sticky<00:03:15.470> Ricky<00:03:15.860> but<00:03:16.130> I

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
shade is a little bit sticky Ricky but I

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.070 
shade is a little bit sticky Ricky but I
probably<00:03:17.060> wear<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.420> more<00:03:17.510> in<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.690> summer<00:03:17.900> but

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
probably wear it more in the summer but

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.300 
probably wear it more in the summer but
then<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.290> wouldn't<00:03:18.500> work<00:03:18.650> because<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:18.980> contains

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
then I wouldn't work because it contains

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.560 
then I wouldn't work because it contains
