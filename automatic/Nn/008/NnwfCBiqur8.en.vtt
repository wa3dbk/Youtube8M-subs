00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
spirit and and I think that was a pretty

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.190 
spirit and and I think that was a pretty
cool<00:01:54.770> dynamic<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.040> other<00:01:56.369> focus<00:01:56.790> between

cool dynamic the other focus between

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.929 
cool dynamic the other focus between
retino<00:01:58.200> Raph<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.590> Casey<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.700> expected

retino Raph and Casey is to be expected

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.590 
retino Raph and Casey is to be expected
but<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> wasn't<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.259> interesting<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.399> /<00:02:03.180> and
