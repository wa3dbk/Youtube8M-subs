00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.140
 then there 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.580
 we're back 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.580
 miss you 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.299
 at home the staff of são maron salo in practice say 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.470
 Let's not talk about this but I'm happy here. 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.659
 and that there were some questions in the air 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.309
 the platform on the way to use the very funds in which she finally disappeared 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.869
 with which from this material 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.300
 that's why my truth is marlon 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.499
 change 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:32.820
 made with paper 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.750
 Carpegiani has a role and glue if you have a start jealousy 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.040
 withdrawing the tip for making the payment begins to realize that a 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.530
 paper was scuffed 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.260
 in such a way 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.200
 loss of jobs and creating on that surface 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.700
 quartet party for distribution of graphite paper and pencil then there were 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 if you can get here right by the camera to reach the Senate 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.620
 how does it work 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.960
 we are already checking everything full of hospital bulges 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 how do I do a contamination of the selection process 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.320
 making a generational cut 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.720
 the ford also like souza marques 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.200
 the system counts 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.540
 obasanjo regulatory agency 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.159
 and not only in the end she also the too fine girl courts 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.790
 When I Fired In That Court 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.910
 is another thing also we export next year arrived at de facto ways of 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.750
 socialists then make a 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.080
 Can you make this happen? 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 we must remember that in practice it shows now 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 countries are basic services such as 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.350
 - Pregnancy 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.100
 coming back at the end of February 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.300
 how was it any way 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.610
 nothing simpler 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.830
 if we can ex-dictator use 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.050
 france practical 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.520
 the farm has a supply of fruit 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.780
 We're sure he embezzled right. 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.709
 but would create one of the largest in the world 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.709
 show you eat with the bosses in this material 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.209
 it's absolutely unreal 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.359
 Bulgarian sailors African bowl in-depth crimes 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.179
 in the same period, the state government 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.050
 ahmadinejad must have tried to do a prevention 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.239
 freamunde 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.419
 seasons with he is back Bernard 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:39.649
 summing up presented instead of 16 but watch two countries develop poorly 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.789
 with graphite and now then I'll do later with renan 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.079
 I have the hardest part we started the hardest part 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:53.599
 make circular movements so as not to create risks per person 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.719
 event 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.719
 the extent to which I am achieving 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.329
 in the case of lighter areas 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.399
 taking great care not to comply with this law 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:10.429
 have to understand the production areas can have part of a good 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 the energy effect showed more signs that it has been targeted 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.089
 areas that have been graphed 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:19.309
 trying 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.109
 create the passage 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.410
 for Mayan March to discuss 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.219
 and creating chances since 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:32.269
 the day of health and the red bull made the two of the world - after review 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.039
 part of the structure 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.679
 so I'm going to go through the dark part where there's a lot of graffiti after the truth 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:39.959
 primary funds go graphite 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.599
 so the obligation is theirs 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.069
 aware of the power over the situation and the tasks as well 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.809
 how the city 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.269
 click here 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.269
 You got it. 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.999
 How can I do it? 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.429
 Corsican driver 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.429
 the fund may not have been easy either 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.209
 they were quite damaged part of the state of the silver fit hit yesterday its 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.039
 staff had a glass of cachaça pass is one of the 10 o'clock 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.310
 including creating areas and even in the condition of poverty 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.500
 brasiliense will cover also lost by neighborhood small study of by 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.800
 food safety - designs 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.520
 the dark corridor 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.130
 the derriere basileia made of the same material because it was only for 30 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.969
 seconds until it happens 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.710
 it's easy 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.909
 and little incentive 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.640
 he did not have work 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.659
 in this sense, such as paper 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.009
 graffiti superficially so you can explore 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.960
 the weight of the Pope the texture of the heavy spa paper the texture of the tributes 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.889
 it is an income effect 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.360
 using this background 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.220
 Pluto 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.770
 their performance 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.860
 possibility of summer rain 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.349
 and to whoever gives what I've done has to do 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.650
 of a tip in the fruit movie 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.969
 suzanne right 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.430
 and where they go out sometimes you have areas 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.800
 what you want 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.930
 I would veto the law 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.960
 protuberance 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.169
 Ah what was creating 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.809
 from carmo souza 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.749
 already fruit planet 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.580
 the pack 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 I can control in real time 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.919
 the men have several fissures no walls fall on you paulo 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.099
 will also observe 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.400
 that they buy their toughest hardest the Cuban press 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.410
 the more light after you do the math and realize this they pms are 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.830
 plus a civilization of white men are more rigid
