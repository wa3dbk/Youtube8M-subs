00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
light mark basically it's what it sounds

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.460 
light mark basically it's what it sounds
like<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.360> it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.570> flashlight<00:01:45.840> which

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like it's and it's a flashlight which

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.749 
like it's and it's a flashlight which
uses<00:01:46.920> an<00:01:47.040> LED<00:01:47.430> instead<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:49.759> incandescent

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
uses an LED instead of a incandescent

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.319 
uses an LED instead of a incandescent
bulb<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:53.450> light<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:56.100> area<00:01:57.000> in

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
bulb I think to light up the area in

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.600 
bulb I think to light up the area in
front<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:59.390> basically<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.829> advantages<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
front of it basically the advantages of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.059 
front of it basically the advantages of
this<00:02:02.909> are<00:02:04.130> much<00:02:05.130> longer<00:02:05.460> burn<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:07.069> you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
this are much longer burn time and you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.540 
this are much longer burn time and you
never<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.580> replace<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.950> also<00:02:11.190> much

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
never have to replace it it's also much

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.180 
never have to replace it it's also much
smaller

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
smaller

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.590 
smaller
in<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.660> more<00:02:13.660> compact<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.280> can<00:02:15.880> fit<00:02:16.270> a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
in the more compact so you can fit a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.890 
in the more compact so you can fit a
whole<00:02:17.320> lot<00:02:17.590> more<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.460> flashlight<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.270> a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
whole lot more of a flashlight and a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.350 
whole lot more of a flashlight and a
whole<00:02:20.110> lot<00:02:20.320> less<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.890> size<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.860> get<00:02:24.360> this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
whole lot less of a size to get this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.130 
whole lot less of a size to get this
kind<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.840> illumination<00:02:26.380> would<00:02:27.370> take<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:28.050> huge

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.280 

regular<00:02:32.140> incandescent<00:02:32.940> flashlight<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
regular incandescent flashlight so the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.480 
regular incandescent flashlight so the
fact<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.710> this<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.630> nice<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.190> small<00:02:39.190> and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
fact that this is nice and small and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.300 
fact that this is nice and small and
light<00:02:39.670> easy<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.570> carry<00:02:40.980> huge<00:02:41.980> plus<00:02:44.010> burn<00:02:45.010> time

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
light easy to carry huge plus burn time

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.030 
light easy to carry huge plus burn time
is<00:02:45.610> spare<00:02:46.300> Lee<00:02:46.450> good<00:02:46.680> probably<00:02:47.680> around<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
is spare Lee good probably around the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.510 
is spare Lee good probably around the
same<00:02:48.130> as<00:02:48.490> other<00:02:48.790> LED<00:02:50.100> flashlights<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.250> use

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
same as other LED flashlights that use

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.730 
same as other LED flashlights that use
one<00:02:51.820> triple-a<00:02:52.270> again<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.380> don't<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.620> the

slightly smaller it's definitely less

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.800 
slightly smaller it's definitely less
thick<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.980> know<00:03:29.980> sorry<00:03:30.489> nice<00:03:30.700> fits<00:03:31.270> in<00:03:31.570> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
thick so you know sorry nice fits in the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.520 
thick so you know sorry nice fits in the
hand<00:03:32.050> very<00:03:32.860> nicely<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.959> can<00:03:35.140> pretty<00:03:35.440> easily

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
hand very nicely you can pretty easily

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.870 
hand very nicely you can pretty easily
use<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.690> manipulate<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.459> it's<00:03:39.459> not<00:03:39.610> too

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
use it to manipulate and it's not too

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.860 
use it to manipulate and it's not too
small<00:03:40.150> but<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.450> think<00:03:43.450> just<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.750> right

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
small but it's I think just the right

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.979 
small but it's I think just the right
size<00:03:45.239> some<00:03:46.239> complaints<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:46.900> have<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:48.010> switch

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
size some complaints I have the switch

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.250 
size some complaints I have the switch
for<00:03:49.989> one<00:03:50.170> because<00:03:50.970> unlike<00:03:51.970> regular<00:03:52.540> switches

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
for one because unlike regular switches

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.190 
for one because unlike regular switches
where<00:03:53.860> it's<00:03:54.190> wired<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:58.750> basically

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
where it's wired that a it's basically

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.640 
where it's wired that a it's basically
wired<00:03:59.530> reverse<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.840> can't<00:04:02.080> really<00:04:02.140> tell

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
wired reverse so you can't really tell

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.410 
wired reverse so you can't really tell
wonder<00:04:03.400> you're<00:04:03.489> just<00:04:03.700> looking<00:04:03.910> at<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:04.180> but

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
wonder you're just looking at this but

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.590 
wonder you're just looking at this but
feeling<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:04.930> pressing<00:04:05.769> down<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:07.090> turn<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.480> on

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
feeling it pressing down to turn it on

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.620 
feeling it pressing down to turn it on
is<00:04:08.220> more<00:04:09.220> difficult<00:04:09.459> than<00:04:09.940> pressing<00:04:10.180> down<00:04:10.480> to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
is more difficult than pressing down to

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.030 
is more difficult than pressing down to
turn<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:10.989> off<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:14.140> just<00:04:14.410> has<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.590> do<00:04:14.830> with<00:04:14.950> the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
turn it off it just has to do with the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.440 
turn it off it just has to do with the
way<00:04:15.160> they<00:04:15.310> wire<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.700> switch<00:04:15.970> I'm<00:04:16.150> not<00:04:16.299> really

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
way they wire the switch I'm not really

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.380 
way they wire the switch I'm not really
sure<00:04:16.570> why<00:04:16.989> they<00:04:17.200> did<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.410> Plus<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.669> way<00:04:18.910> you

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
sure why they did it Plus this way you

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.290 
sure why they did it Plus this way you
can't<00:04:19.750> have<00:04:20.289> momentary<00:04:21.190> illumination<00:04:21.820> you

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
can't have momentary illumination you

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.240 
can't have momentary illumination you
have<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.600> turn<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.960> on<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.740> momentarily

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
have to turn it on you can momentarily

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.880 
have to turn it on you can momentarily
turn<00:04:25.120> it<00:04:25.240> off

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
turn it off

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.000 
turn it off
without<00:04:27.210> clicking<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.540> but<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.470> would<00:04:29.920> have

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
without clicking it but I would have

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.530 
without clicking it but I would have
liked<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.340> see<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.700> opposite<00:04:31.090> way<00:04:31.150> where<00:04:31.510> I

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
liked to see it the opposite way where I

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.560 
liked to see it the opposite way where I
can<00:04:31.900> momentarily<00:04:32.410> turn<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.340> on<00:04:33.490> or<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:33.790> can

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
can momentarily turn it on or I can

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:43.250 
can momentarily turn it on or I can
click<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.050> leave<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.290> on<00:04:38.100> also<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:41.670> the
