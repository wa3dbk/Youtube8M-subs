 saying that she only had one box on that side 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.590

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.400
 thicker slices and more practical 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:52.380
 thick double-sided and also take this 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.120
 here the difference is thicker action 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.820

 It took me some time to understand 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:46.370
 will be the use of the 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:50.349
