00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.949
 clams self made fish 2 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.939
 scraps of the Adriatic 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.340
 if the shrimp tails prawns 2 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:35.700
 medium-sized squid cut already 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.480
 pieces 50 g of butter 5 tomatoes 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 half cut cherry tomatoes 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 chopped parsley to taste 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.960
 ground black pepper salt up to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.539
 about 10 centimeters of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.309
 olive half glass of white wine 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 dry kitchen and we have a 140 grams 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.469
 of carnaroli rice we proceed with the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.920
 preparation first proceeding we put 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:10.100
 to toast the rice we are the butter in 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.490
 pan over low heat and add 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 immediately the rice 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.320
 making it move for about a couple of 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.320
 minutes 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.610
 I take this opportunity to greet the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.650
 housewives at home who called in 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.370
 editorial complimenting these 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.010
 recipes and we are happy with this 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.590
 for our part, however, there is this 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.880
 appreciation 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.460
 continue with our recipe a 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.460
 this point we fade with white wine 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.440
 and let all the rice absorb 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.390
 the dressing then the white linen the 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.580
 butter and begin to shell this 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.280
 this way here is this system 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.950
 serves to make the rice starch lose and 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.720
 so let's say it's a passage that me 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.729
 serves both to predict starch and also 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.810
 to give me a facilitation during the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.899
 cooking 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.280
 now I take a thread out of the fire 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.770
 of garlic oil 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.590
 I use mixed garlic oil for my own 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.330
 preparation and comfort, however, at home 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.010
 you can simply use oil 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.580
 extra virgin olive oil with garlic 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.900
 minced we add both the scampi if 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:33.000
 squid that shrimp all together 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.000
 extra virgin olive oil a wire 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:54.530
 cherry tomatoes let's brown we jump 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:59.660
 slightly after 2 3 minutes of 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.650
 stir fry we add the risen one 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.980
 previously eto'o been pulled with 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.980
 white wine 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.920
 and gradually we go to pour fund 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:23.930
 of fish that would be the fish broth 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.200
 the comic we cover for double the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.200
 its volume 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.590
 let cook on a high heat ever since 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.069
 cover our pan such way 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.380
 that cooking is much more velvety and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.180
 all the aromas we say remain 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.300
 inside the pan making for 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.010
 get out only the alcohol part of the wine 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.010
 previously toasted with the risen 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.390
 at this point we are going to add 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.930
 mussels and lees as the final ingredients 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.930
 clams 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.269
 I want to clarify that in any case the 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.320
 medium risotto cooking around 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:22.350
 to 20 minutes making that speech of 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.150
 toast the rice separately separately 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.500
 I'm going to anticipate a 5 6 minutes of 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.530
 build then a quarter of an hour of 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.449
 cooking and solve will be ready too 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.490
 because it is preferable to remove it a little more 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.290
 raw because the risotto in reverse 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.080
 other pasta in general continues 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.240
 cooking also removed from the heat and will tend 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.790
 anyway to dry then a 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.150
 advice for housewives who are a 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.740
 house to remove it slightly close the 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.350
 risotto because until you go 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.479
 Serve and go to serve will continue 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.449
 however its past culture 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.050
 fifteen minutes or so is the 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.050
 result obtained 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.860
 we leave a couple more minutes 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.410
 dry slightly risen and we can 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.880
 also remove from heat leaving it at 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:13.699
 tidy this up for a few moments 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.699
 point we are ready to implant 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.060
 servant of this kitten to avoid that 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.060
 the fact is dirty 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.380
 this point the dish is ready 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.500
 we love the manager to bring him in 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.500
 table 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.940
 a greeting from cosimo the fisherman and vi 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.750
 I remember when you come into this 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.490
 restaurant zero km is sure you eat 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.970
 fresh fish 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.990
 a tip I want to give advice to 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.510
 all citizens 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.760
 I recommend it when you go to the others 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.490
 restaurants to make sure that the fish 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.790
 really be the rischo like fish 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.920
 which is caught by me is brought to the 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.690
