00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 what goes around comes back crown and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.740
 mrs abbey b hello everyone is 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.809
 welcome to the 2009 net baby chain 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.440
 today I'm going to make a video 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.290
 special 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.880
 tip of the day then tips for 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:22.130
 limit the number of sing-off klum note 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 so do not first trick always 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.760
 sealed his hydration with how to say 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 with a butter actually 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.730
 bear why because when we take 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.790
 the example of shea butter 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 it will weigh down your spikes and so 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.840
 prevent the friction of fibers 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.219
 between them and in particular when 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.129
 little sweaters are open 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.170
 that's where the hair is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.539
 conducive to without twisting 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.329
 that is to say, to mix between creating 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.620
 second knots tips to limit the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.120
 singles i'm not avoiding leaving if his 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.140
 hair in the open when they are 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.049
 wet or wet why because 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.299
 the hair should know that tip 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.650
 that we have them wide or that we have it like that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.990
 then there is movement 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 finally I think so maybe there is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.229
 maybe no movement the part by 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 example when doing an afro can 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.780
 and well the hair plants that are 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.580
 outdoors 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 fring when in contact with 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.650
 moisture so avoid leaving your 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.619
 hair in these states we will say naked 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.720
 in own states he precisely at 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.280
 so shrine hides that they decipher in 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.140
 cage of movements that says movement of the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.079
 friction that says friction says 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.250
 but in fact that's the level of 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.079
 disentangling so 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.479
 so here I think it's the third 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.100
 tips at the detangling level try 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.229
 first to unravel on the finger because 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.990
 this is where you will be able to separate 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.340
 each stem that precisely forms sometimes 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.960
 it's impossible to separate them because 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 that's so much the name is so 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.189
 tight than me what am I doing now 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.380
 it is that I cut the part that I see 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.350
 because here are several ways 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.890
 to cut himself the tips and for example 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.450
 Forks 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.250
 there are people who cut the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.349
 forks 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.700
 how to say that they reserve by 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.410
 example a day where they will cut 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.599
 all the charges they will see in 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.120
 watching TV is the same the same 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.190
 principle for the nodes but that I 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.590
 do not do it all over the head I do it 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.299
 really on the knots that I judge 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.500
 impossible to say to untie 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.420
 last tip make hairstyles 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.920
 protective precisely to avoid 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.079
 precisely rubbing them the shrink 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.400
 age 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.920
 I know that especially the year in which 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.470
 I had the most of not stopping this 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.930
 year because of a shingo king really 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.329
 who was I did not say how 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.340
 that it did not suit the technique 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.000
 wat home 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.440
 it is risky precisely because I 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 I have a lot of hair 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.860
 there are quite a few girls who have 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.400
 different levels of schlink age and me 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.160
 I really have a frieze will go it's in 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.150
 pigtail spring what does that 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.709
 that when I have not created there 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.360
 knots alone in fact that's theirs 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.250
 delirium so that's the last tip but 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.640
 good I think I already have them 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.950
 mentioned cutting his spikes can 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:30.370
 precisely so limited the number of 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.860
 singles one note is against it 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.560
 can not eliminate them completely 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.400
 so this video was in response 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.200
 at faty of course I take I think 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.209
 it's your nickname thou 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.129
 will recognize I know you have opened 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.739
 another channel so I make you 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.700
 big kisses and last little trick 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.890
 wee aa 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.900
 I had to talk about it I did not 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.730
 will pronounce the name no longer because I 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.970
 knew nervous even I talk about it so much 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.920
 that it sucks me no I laugh 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.859
 the coconut cream so to the application 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.930
 So now I use that in either 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.090
 come in at the bottom ie I do not 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.769
 do more bath of coconut cream before 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.030
 my shampoo if I do it is that I 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.769
 not going to shampoo I just 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.230
 rinse or so I'm just going in 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.720
 apply on to the root in very weak 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.070
 quantity and wipe as this way that 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.289
 dry all all alone 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.320
 aulas I had a big bang there of a 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.870
 coconut cream in my skin and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.300
 vaporization like that especially the whole 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.960
 hair here to put in the fridge to 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.490
 the advance of that's cool down his 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.289
 redo my cuticles but good in 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.580
 rinsing anyway if we use 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.380
 hot water its re opens the 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.919
 cuticles that was all for 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.450
 today 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.550
 so here I'm going to do my session 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.550
 shampoo there I am half mast all notes 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.590
 I make you very big kisses thanks to 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.250
 all the people who subscribe to my 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.620
 chain and who finds it great 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.990
 it encourages me even more and I hope 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.680
 come back very soon with in 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.669
 new adventures 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.669
 Hi
