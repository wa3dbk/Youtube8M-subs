I recently changed from EE to giffgaff
like<00:03:26.819> if<00:03:26.940> gaff<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.350> British<00:03:28.530> network

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
like if gaff is a it's a British network

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.180 
like if gaff is a it's a British network
that<00:03:29.280> uses<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.730> o2<00:03:30.560> structure<00:03:31.560> which<00:03:31.799> means

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that uses the o2 structure which means

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.129 
that uses the o2 structure which means
that<00:03:32.340> you've<00:03:32.459> kind<00:03:32.639> of<00:03:32.730> always<00:03:32.910> got<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> signal

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
that you've kind of always got a signal

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.420 
that you've kind of always got a signal
for<00:03:34.260> whatever<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.920> need<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.340> they're

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
for whatever it is you need and they're

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.370 
for whatever it is you need and they're
actually<00:03:35.579> very<00:03:36.000> reasonably<00:03:36.630> priced<00:03:36.720> I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
actually very reasonably priced I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.349 
actually very reasonably priced I
recently<00:03:37.769> switched<00:03:38.040> over<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.489> them<00:03:38.639> for<00:03:39.000> a

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
recently switched over to them for a

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.670 
recently switched over to them for a
number<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.630> reasons<00:03:39.720> one<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.560> they're

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
number of reasons one that they're

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
number of reasons one that they're
cheaper<00:03:41.160> -<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.880> they<00:03:42.000> use<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.389> better<00:03:42.630> network

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
cheaper - that they use a better network

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.680 
cheaper - that they use a better network
so<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.410> get<00:03:43.530> better<00:03:43.680> signal<00:03:44.220> wherever<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.269> go

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
so I can get better signal wherever I go

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.990 
so I can get better signal wherever I go
and<00:03:46.319> also<00:03:46.650> they<00:03:46.769> have<00:03:46.950> an<00:03:47.069> online<00:03:47.250> dashboard

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
out to allow it to do I kind of feel

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.029 
out to allow it to do I kind of feel
that<00:04:21.539> putting<00:04:21.750> out<00:04:22.109> extra<00:04:22.349> features<00:04:22.890> on<00:04:23.010> top

that putting out extra features on top

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.779 
that putting out extra features on top
of<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.400> now<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:24.000> really<00:04:24.450> just<00:04:25.520> overdoing<00:04:26.520> it

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
of that now is really just overdoing it

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.350 
of that now is really just overdoing it
it

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
it

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.540 
it
making<00:04:27.780> something<00:04:27.990> more<00:04:28.439> expensive<00:04:29.099> and<00:04:29.250> well

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
making something more expensive and well

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.399 
making something more expensive and well
even<00:04:29.819> more<00:04:30.030> functional<00:04:30.629> than<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.900> needs<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.259> be

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
even more functional than it needs to be

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.140 
even more functional than it needs to be
I<00:04:31.710> guess<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.069> point<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.400> I'm<00:04:32.550> trying<00:04:32.580> to

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
I guess the point that I'm trying to

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.740 
I guess the point that I'm trying to
make<00:04:33.389> in<00:04:33.689> this<00:04:33.990> video<00:04:34.379> is<00:04:34.979> that<00:04:35.250> often<00:04:35.789> we<00:04:36.090> feel

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
make in this video is that often we feel

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.110 
make in this video is that often we feel
we<00:04:37.139> need<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:37.560> solve<00:04:37.949> problems<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.699> might<00:04:38.909> not

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
we need to solve problems that might not

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.779 
we need to solve problems that might not
necessarily<00:04:39.800> exist<00:04:40.800> feel<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.580> need<00:04:41.759> to

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
necessarily exist feel the need to

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.879 
necessarily exist feel the need to
perhaps<00:04:42.120> hop<00:04:42.509> on<00:04:42.719> bandwagons<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.590> trains

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
perhaps hop on bandwagons and trains

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.469 
perhaps hop on bandwagons and trains
simply<00:04:44.430> because<00:04:44.789> it<00:04:44.939> looks<00:04:45.150> like<00:04:45.330> other

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
simply because it looks like other

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.300 
simply because it looks like other
people<00:04:45.930> are<00:04:46.050> benefiting<00:04:46.229> it<00:04:46.740> from<00:04:46.979> it<00:04:47.129> and

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
people are benefiting it from it and

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.149 
people are benefiting it from it and
therefore<00:04:47.819> we<00:04:48.210> might<00:04:48.479> as<00:04:48.689> well<00:04:48.719> but<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:49.469> think

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
therefore we might as well but I think

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.249 
therefore we might as well but I think
that<00:04:50.460> it's<00:04:50.819> always<00:04:51.210> worthwhile<00:04:51.569> to<00:04:52.080> take

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
that it's always worthwhile to take

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.559 
that it's always worthwhile to take
stock<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.889> look<00:04:53.099> at<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.580> real<00:04:53.939> problems<00:04:54.449> in

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
stock and look at the real problems in

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.899 
stock and look at the real problems in
our<00:04:54.629> life<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:55.080> needs<00:04:55.289> solving<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:56.159> well<00:04:56.610> I

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
our life that needs solving and well I

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.909 
our life that needs solving and well I
guess<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.900> problems<00:04:58.259> that<00:04:58.409> I<00:04:58.500> have<00:04:58.650> in<00:04:58.800> my

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
guess the problems that I have in my

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.469 
guess the problems that I have in my
life<00:04:59.129> aren't<00:04:59.430> really<00:04:59.699> going<00:04:59.849> to<00:04:59.939> be<00:05:00.029> solved<00:05:00.389> by

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
life aren't really going to be solved by

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.110 
life aren't really going to be solved by
