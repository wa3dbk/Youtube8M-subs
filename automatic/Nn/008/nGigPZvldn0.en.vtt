off<00:03:04.760> pulling<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.810> back<00:03:07.870> I'm<00:03:08.870> going<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.109> tie<00:03:09.320> it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
off pulling it back I'm going to tie it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.690 
off pulling it back I'm going to tie it
in<00:03:11.709> firmly

and then I'm just going to gently wind
three<00:03:19.280> turns<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:21.310> they're<00:03:22.310> not<00:03:22.340> on

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
three turns of this and they're not on

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
top of each other one turn goes in front

of<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.640> other<00:03:25.790> one<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.030> I'm<00:03:26.270> folding<00:03:26.569> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
of the other one and I'm folding the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:36.250 
of the other one and I'm folding the
feathers<00:03:27.349> back<00:03:33.730> pulling<00:03:34.730> them<00:03:34.850> back<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:36.080> that

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.229 
counter spinning it spins
counterclockwise<00:04:12.700> when<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.819> finally<00:04:14.090> goes

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
counterclockwise when it finally goes
