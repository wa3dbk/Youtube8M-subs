now<00:00:08.309> let's<00:00:08.550> talk<00:00:08.760> about<00:00:08.820> temperature<00:00:09.660> and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
now let's talk about temperature and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.959 
now let's talk about temperature and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
really enhance the color of the fish

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.870 
really enhance the color of the fish
there's<00:00:40.260> high<00:00:40.590> intensity<00:00:41.100> full<00:00:41.370> spectrum

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880

aquarium

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
aquarium

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.300 
aquarium
there's<00:00:45.540> actinic<00:00:46.170> tubes<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.740> give<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> blue

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
there's actinic tubes that give the blue

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.280 
there's actinic tubes that give the blue
effect<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.450> worth<00:00:48.630> looking<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
effect so it's worth looking at the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.160 
effect so it's worth looking at the
different<00:00:49.620> types<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.010> tubes<00:00:50.310> available<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
different types of tubes available and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.810 
different types of tubes available and
experiment<00:00:52.170> particularly<00:00:52.740> on<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.100> aquarium

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
experiment particularly on your aquarium

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.390 
experiment particularly on your aquarium
and<00:00:53.970> see<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:54.810> ones<00:00:55.080> you<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:56.070> look<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
and see which ones you like the look of

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.890 
and see which ones you like the look of
and<00:00:56.610> which<00:00:56.730> ones<00:00:56.940> bring<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.450> color<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
and which ones bring up the color of

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.560 
and which ones bring up the color of
your<00:00:58.050> fish<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:59.610> not<00:00:59.820> only<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.300> want<00:01:00.480> to

fair bit of algae in the aquarium it can
be<00:01:23.969> worth<00:01:24.149> cutting<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.659> light<00:01:24.810> down<00:01:25.079> if<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
be worth cutting the light down if you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.169 
be worth cutting the light down if you
find<00:01:26.249> that<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.490> plants<00:01:26.789> are<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.030> not
