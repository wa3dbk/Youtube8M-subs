00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.250
 Today we have a new one in the test 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 speaker of rako this 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.290
 Chinese company now very strong too 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.980
 on the german market is on the way 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:21.560
 the whole thing is called 800 is clear 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.789
 bigger than the smaller ones 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.949
 speaker boxes also for each 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 bluetooth are the times for me 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.929
 comparison put the bike tour 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.149
 has previously presented and about that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.510
 sometimes the packaging looks right 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.030
 solid, however, the handle is already 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.180
 broke down during transport is something 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180
 what a shame 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.250
 and here we have the speakers 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 itself a bit bigger as you can see 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.039
 and whether an unusual shape very much 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 pretty and museums 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.170
 also some equipment 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.369
 instructions from our 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.820
 friends used to but the reasonable 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.820
 illustration euro pretty small font 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.869
 I estimate four points 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.280
 namely a speaker cable so a 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.030
 audio cable so only the part only private 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.220
 but also by cable to the pc 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.180
 you can plug the whole thing so will 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 typically paired via bluetooth 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.130
 so speak in abstract for tablets and 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.390
 smartphones thought about the more or 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.030
 less in a reasonably reasonable way 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.729
 to transform music equipment I lead that 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.530
 whole now before the clutch goes 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.780
 namely relatively fast as soon as you get here 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.200
 press the 1 button we will try that 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.770
 one with spotify because of me more often 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.770
 in that you can 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.629
 As I hope my heart belongs to the sound 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.129
 is really full and so full 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.109
 in comparison especially for this 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.209
 smaller bluetooth boxing therapy yes 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.950
 so far it has been done 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.549
 your year so group a little 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.989
 stereo zoom and well I've 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.730
 counted once seven seconds 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.090
 about take to the part then 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.829
 by itself also couples the 800th 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.079
 However, it does not have to be as this 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.349
 smaller boxes so micro so that one 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.689
 it immediately with as a mobile phone handsfree 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.519
 but can at least regulate 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.739
 automatically the volume down if 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.780
 you get the call on the smartphone 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.849
 and of course we see here as well 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.730
 You can also volume and 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.200
 Rule down quickly and express 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.760
 that, of course, somehow important 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.329
 but does it look like this blue lighting 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.849
 down here would be the need that has 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.250
 to make something cool as well 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.829
 Allagui Clausthal can the well 18 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.180
 you look at that part of the national debt rowley 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.180
 and hold off 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.099
