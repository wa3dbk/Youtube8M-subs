you're going to like this one alright
well<00:00:21.689> everything's<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> start<00:00:22.710> out

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
well everything's going to start out

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.320 
well everything's going to start out
pretty<00:00:23.250> typically<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.090> produce

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
opening the only thing you really need

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859 
opening the only thing you really need

to make sure of is to definitely go
scout<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> first<00:00:28.890> probe<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.550> makes

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
scout with the first probe that makes

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
scout with the first probe that makes
your<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.090> pylon<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.050> need<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> get<00:00:31.470> into

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
your first pylon you need to get into

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
your first pylon you need to get into
the<00:00:31.830> Terrans<00:00:32.130> base<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.790> he's<00:00:33.120> getting

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the Terrans base to see if he's getting

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.630 
the Terrans base to see if he's getting
his<00:00:33.510> gas<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:33.960> not<00:00:34.219> we're<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.520> putting

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
his gas or not we're going to be putting

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
his gas or not we're going to be putting
a<00:00:35.820> really<00:00:36.149> early<00:00:36.300> Nexus<00:00:36.809> down<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.230> it's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
a really early Nexus down so it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
a really early Nexus down so it's
important<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:37.950> inside<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> Terran<00:00:38.730> base

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
important to get inside the Terran base

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
important to get inside the Terran base
and<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.510> he<00:00:39.629> has<00:00:39.750> gases<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and see if he has gases or not if you

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.770 
and see if he has gases or not if you
don't<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.520> gases<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.270> pretty<00:00:42.510> safe<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
don't see gases then it's pretty safe to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
don't see gases then it's pretty safe to
assume<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.379> Terran<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> fast

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
assume the Terran is going for a fast

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
assume the Terran is going for a fast
expansion<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> pvt

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
