00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:10.060
 Good people here are with the long night. 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:13.390
 water did not appear on youtube there tiago at 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.480
 Throughout 2008 he came here talking 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.940
 I had to make the engine, right? 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.770
 here we go the wesley of the match there to 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:31.180
 You see here was examining aquino 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:33.730
 stoner and although there is no 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.420
 Scanner fault in treating other 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.149
 top of the new pickup truck 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.069
 the first a look maria no 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.550
 the mechanic denied that he had to do the 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:49.120
 car engine and here in two minutes to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.769
 people have already detected an error at 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.370
 that he complained about our 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.370
 line of lezema too deep not he is 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.559
 one for me is the following the car is not 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.559
 you accelerate shows a little bit 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 a little bit more 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.830
 delay when it accelerates takes too long 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.440
 to drop in which only 17 of the parameters 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.030
 all right and making the actuator 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.369
 slowed down to 8 you have a 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.080
 My daughter's idea 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.540
 we did proceed in this case is 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.310
 that did not solve the gear actuator 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.000
 slow it has a problem is 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.920
 dirty 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.770
 It's cool and you said you had to do it. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.020
 motor 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.450
 after the oil change 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.580
 the oil light streaks and lights up in case 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.190
 now you do not want to do this anymore 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.720
 now there was little red and 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.179
 idling 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.460
 below it drops to 500 rpm and neither 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:56.440
 if it were a car with an air intake 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.869
 something is the gait actuator 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.490
 slow slow the roriz is now coming back 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.030
 See you soon after I went to the 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.640
 scanner aside a melhoradinha now 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.450
 that I can not conceive is the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.640
 mechanic talking has to make a motor 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.760
 what is known there and this vehicle here soon 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.209
 this year 2008 it is very common to obstruct 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.910
 oil pump is a service to be 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.950
 decarbonisation of the engine and 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.660
 cleaning the oil pump and gas 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.660
 approximately 250 reais 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.570
 Just what happens to the engine here? 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.870
 to make at least four thousand reais 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.430
 Look at the difference in value of $ 250 for 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.970
 4 thousand reais 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.049
 That's it, the video is only recorded. 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.820
 the case of James 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.620
 after the decarbonization of the 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.660
 clean the oil pump 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.480
 people will check again and we will see 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.040
 which bug that gives the new oil also have 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.650
 a day of use 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.390
 I sincerely thought that the qualities 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.040
 it's low on the dell sauce fair and 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.660
 spoke that oil was put good more 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.270
 the same person exchanging oil spoke to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.760
 he also did the car engine and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.250
 now I'm kind of suspicious, you're not going to leave 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.170
 hatch more tip for you there long O 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.380
 clogged oil pump motor 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.940
 mechanized mechanic having the 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.350
 Motor is pretty cool, huh? 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.200
 I will try elsewhere had here 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.630
 suddenly at the hour of grace of the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.000
 chopped oil pump did not now 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.160
 now it was directly connected is the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.780
 Speaking guy has to make the engine. 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.780
 Just kidding, we talked.
