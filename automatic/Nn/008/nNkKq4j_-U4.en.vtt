00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.200
 hello to everyone who is watching this 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.870
 I'm Francisco, I'm from Rico, I'm also 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.640
 of the portal portal net like bird ox I'm going to 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.169
 record a video what I'm doing with 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.430
 images because I have problems with the 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.280
 Audio 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.900
 where I want to be my notebook as 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:30.920
 wifi sender but I 'm going to have 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.380
 internet via a USB modem 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.670
 that I have this image where I'm going to 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.010
 connect with the modem 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.649
 but in order to broadcast it needs a 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.019
 program this program I'm going to leave in 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.940
 the description of the video or in the forum what 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.590
 we can carey 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.629
 the program should install it as 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.510
 any next following program 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.149
 blah blah blah then they must activate 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.310
 medicine also comes within 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.460
 Program 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.100
 When you activate it, you must 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.810
 invent an email they can still use 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.360
 the same one that comes in the program and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.680
 generate the code if it does not work 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.050
 you should try again because sometimes 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.159
 the first one does not work once 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.729
 have activated this program they go to 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.590
 right side where you are going to open eye 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.240
 first they must 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.770
 worry that they are sailing like this 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.690
 normally with the modem as they do 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.990
 always after they open this program to 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.460
 to recognize it in case this is 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.040
 does the first time not afterwards there are already 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.990
 something automatic 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.270
 ok then is the program should 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.890
 put a name that will be for 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.650
 that the cell phone 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.030
 the other notebook whatever recognizes the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.850
 network that you are going to be emitting 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.800
 from the notebook in this case I would 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.100
 I put net portal a key of eight 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.760
 digits and below where it says internet 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.850
 should look for the usb modem according to 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.009
 company that have 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.710
 If you do not activate this program will 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.550
 the same options will come out but not 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.070
 it will work 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.070
 then once selecting in this 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.240
 case of the true company we are going to 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.890
 give start and is only corroborate that 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.530
 all this is fine as I am going to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.720
 show then fine then 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.510
 following with this now he has taken a 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.510
 camera to record I am with the program 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.470
 I have my cellphone here 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.480
 true 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.880
 but I want to show also that I'm 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.810
 connected to the usb modem thanks 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.790
 movistar 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.010
 then with the cell phone I've already 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.420
 connected to the portal signal with the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.790
 8-digit key 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.239
 I'm going to test if it's how it works 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.239
 it's internet 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.480
 well there it is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.470
 what is facebook 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.540
 and all good but I also have separate the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.090
 cell phone connected to the internet that 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.300
 is giving the notebook I have another 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.290
 notebook 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:19.100
 with which I want you to see that it comes out 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.080
 what is the portalet signal with a 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.540
 powerful signal strength because they are 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.260
 next right, I'm going to connect now 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.260
 to door 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.530
 the key obviously asks me 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.150
 wants to run simple in this case I 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.150
 I'm going to connect 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.989
 and after a few seconds I should have 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.989
 Internet 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.150
 usually now sailing has walked 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.400
 fast this system 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.500
 will depend on the geographical area where 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400
 it's fine there I'm connected 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.560
 Internet 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.740
 let's see if it is that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.120
 load 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.120
 there he is sailing 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.269
 I certainly have the netbook I have the 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.750
 modem the euro notebook that is doing 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.750
 as a transmitter 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.440
 here I am browsing 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.620
 I hope this helps someone 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.680
 because if it ends up trouble 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.840
 works good I am bea 'rocks subscribe 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.670
 to the channel I'm just beginning to do 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.170
 videos of this type and 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.170
 and have a good week
