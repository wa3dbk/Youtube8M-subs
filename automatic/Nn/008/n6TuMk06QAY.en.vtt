00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 above all cash game player 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.900
 lately i'm always giving by 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.420
 more with the tournaments I had little two 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.210
 results in a corn did it before 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.300
 special runner up the farm after itself 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.570
 I won the sunday million I would use 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.300
 a portion of the prize pool to increase 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.640
 my bankroll and maybe start 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.210
 chat the circuit more frequently 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.429
 live 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.079
 if vincenzi saint emilion i think 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.850
 definitely a part of the money 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 they would go on to flesh out the benq weapons 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 would allow to play 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.170
 quietly the same and there are on 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.820
 dot it a good part in bank roll 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.890
 some special party with friends and 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.229
 girlfriend various things and probably 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.549
 I will also invite you to dinner outside then 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 you have a paid dinner 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.960
 I will do the sun of mile that there will be at 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.110
 short the problem that working farr80 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.680
 effort but surely I will prepare myself 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.869
 eating well by doing some swimming and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.840
 leaving me a lot when I face tournaments 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.540
 like the sun emilio I try to put the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 as convenient as possible to dig a plate of 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.180
 pasta 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.549
 coca cola can never be missing some 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.120
 chocolate type snack focused on 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.640
 all but none 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.470
 and in bed early in the particular food goes 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.200
 and let's play and see how it goes 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.500
 as a strategy I think to start playing 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.830
 immediately many dishes and let's try to look 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.940
 to assert my and post flop there 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.700
 they are crazy differences from the approach 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.930
 thousand it in irl and stage mostly 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.590
 I prefer to flop more shots than three 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.140
 there, people tend not to play 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.030
 one euro therefore most of it 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.310
 people will play fight 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.580
 this does not mean that you have to play 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.130
 super 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.320
 I was various things but you can 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.840
 take advantage of it when the dish becomes 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.920
 more than tot he if you can take advantage in 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.830
 right moments 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.830
 you can fish soon
