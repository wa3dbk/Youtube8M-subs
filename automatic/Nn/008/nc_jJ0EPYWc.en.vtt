especially<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.229> gun<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.310> very

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
especially with this gun it's a very

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
especially with this gun it's a very
very<00:02:03.119> hard<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:04.229> kill<00:02:04.380> someone<00:02:04.590> from<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
very hard to kill someone from a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.260 
very hard to kill someone from a
distance<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.430> you'll<00:02:05.610> definitely<00:02:06.000> need<00:02:06.090> those

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
distance so you'll definitely need those

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.869 
distance so you'll definitely need those
extra<00:02:06.450> bullets<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.459> them<00:02:08.520> from<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
extra bullets to get them from a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.940 
extra bullets to get them from a
distance<00:02:08.989> because<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.170> hammering<00:02:10.800> down

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
distance because I think hammering down

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
distance because I think hammering down
on<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.220> trigger<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.700> centers<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> little<00:02:12.569> bit

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
on this trigger it centers a little bit

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.280 
on this trigger it centers a little bit
better<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:12.989> three

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
better with three

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.259 
better with three
coral<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.739> you'll<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.549> able<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.730> hit<00:02:14.969> him<00:02:15.120> if

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
coral and you'll be able to hit him if

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.490 
coral and you'll be able to hit him if
you're<00:02:15.360> just<00:02:15.599> hammering<00:02:15.900> down<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.230> trigger

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you're just hammering down the trigger

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.949 
you're just hammering down the trigger
otherwise<00:02:17.219> you're<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.659> to<00:02:18.719> want<00:02:18.870> that

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
otherwise you're just going to want that

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.449 
otherwise you're just going to want that
extra<00:02:19.230> amount<00:02:19.409> of<00:02:19.769> bullet<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.159> you<00:02:20.219> don't<00:02:20.370> have

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
extra amount of bullet so you don't have

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.119 
extra amount of bullet so you don't have
to<00:02:20.609> reload<00:02:21.000> as<00:02:21.180> often<00:02:21.510> because<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:22.739> gun<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
to reload as often because this gun is a

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.709 
to reload as often because this gun is a
beast<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.579> weapon<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.909> reload<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.450> takes

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
beast of a weapon to reload it takes

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.240 
beast of a weapon to reload it takes
about<00:02:24.870> two<00:02:25.230> seconds<00:02:25.650> even<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.040> sleight<00:02:26.219> of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
about two seconds even with sleight of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.849 
about two seconds even with sleight of
hand<00:02:26.489> on<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.879> yes<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.079> long<00:02:28.290> time<00:02:28.560> if

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
hand on and yes that's a long time if

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.740 
hand on and yes that's a long time if
you<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.099> not<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.489> secondary<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.239> now<00:02:30.689> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you do not have a secondary on now the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.479 
you do not have a secondary on now the
secondary<00:02:31.379> attachment<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.280> is

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
secondary attachment that we have is

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.460 
secondary attachment that we have is
going<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.970> muzzle<00:02:33.239> brake<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.629> muzzle

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
going to be the muzzle brake and muzzle

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.509 
going to be the muzzle brake and muzzle
brake<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:34.799> definitely<00:02:35.220> come<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.400> handy

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
brake will definitely come in handy

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.069 
brake will definitely come in handy
because<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.060> think<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.299> makes<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.659> maximum

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
because I think it makes the maximum

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.140 
because I think it makes the maximum
drop<00:02:37.319> off<00:02:37.500> point<00:02:37.799> for<00:02:37.920> damage<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> be

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
drop off point for damage is going to be

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.729 
drop off point for damage is going to be
about<00:02:39.239> 65<00:02:39.930> feet<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.319> don't<00:02:40.470> know<00:02:40.530> I'm<00:02:40.620> really

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
about 65 feet I don't know I'm really

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.679 
about 65 feet I don't know I'm really
just<00:02:41.010> guessing<00:02:41.519> here<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.329> it's<00:02:42.450> either<00:02:42.510> going

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
just guessing here so it's either going

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.449 
just guessing here so it's either going
to<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.810> 60<00:02:43.170> or<00:02:43.290> 65<00:02:43.590> feet<00:02:43.829> which<00:02:44.069> will

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
to be 60 or 65 feet which will

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.949 
to be 60 or 65 feet which will
definitely<00:02:44.909> increase<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.420> damage<00:02:45.599> from<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
definitely increase the damage from a

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.960 
definitely increase the damage from a
distance<00:02:46.319> because<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:47.280> some<00:02:47.579> of<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.730> people

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
distance because as some of the people

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.979 
distance because as some of the people
