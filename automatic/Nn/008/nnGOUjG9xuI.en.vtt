00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
understand it and it was that way my

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
understand it and it was that way my
entire<00:00:45.600> life<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.950> never<00:00:47.129> played<00:00:47.489> the

entire life but I have never played the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.709 
entire life but I have never played the
game<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.420> give<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> the

game so I was like I'm gonna give it the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.299 
game so I was like I'm gonna give it the
benefit<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> doubt<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.530> years<00:00:49.950> back<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
benefit of the doubt here years back I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
benefit of the doubt here years back I
finally<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:50.820> fine<00:00:51.239> I'll<00:00:51.570> play<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
played it and it was so well made so I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.950 
played it and it was so well made so I
wouldn't<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:57.360> venture<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.809> say

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
wouldn't even venture to say

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.250 
wouldn't even venture to say
underwhelming<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> here's<00:00:59.370> why<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:03.080> first<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
underwhelming and here's why I first of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219 
underwhelming and here's why I first of
all<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.799> world<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.309> incredibly<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.810> big

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.039 

in<00:01:28.859> my<00:01:29.070> opinion<00:01:33.530> or<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:36.509> really<00:01:36.750> doesn't<00:01:36.960> do

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
in my opinion or it really doesn't do

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
in my opinion or it really doesn't do
anything<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.039> other<00:01:38.490> Zelda's<00:01:38.909> didn't

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
anything like that other Zelda's didn't

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
anything like that other Zelda's didn't
do<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.990> no<00:01:40.079> items<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.770> weren't<00:01:40.920> in

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
do there are no items that weren't in

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.949 
do there are no items that weren't in
the<00:01:41.189> previous<00:01:41.759> else<00:01:41.909> aside<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.420> those<00:01:42.630> shoes

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
the previous else aside from those shoes

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.270 
the previous else aside from those shoes
that<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.499> you<00:01:43.619> slip<00:01:43.799> everywhere<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that like make you slip everywhere that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.309 
that like make you slip everywhere that
are<00:01:44.399> incredibly<00:01:44.909> useless<00:01:45.359> I<00:01:45.630> mean<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.109> guess

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
are incredibly useless I mean I guess

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.749 
are incredibly useless I mean I guess
the<00:01:46.500> time<00:01:46.709> don't<00:01:46.920> handle<00:01:47.219> is<00:01:47.369> cool<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:47.700> it's

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the time don't handle is cool but it's

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.699 
the time don't handle is cool but it's
not<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> Master<00:01:48.630> Sword<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.079> really

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
not like the Master Sword like really

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.199 
not like the Master Sword like really
makes<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> wreck<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.670> bad<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.060> what

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
makes you wreck all that bad like what

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:52.699 
makes you wreck all that bad like what
you've<00:01:51.329> got<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> bigger<00:01:51.719> on<00:01:51.929> sword<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.530> was

you've got the bigger on sword that was
way<00:01:52.979> better<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:53.789> not<00:01:53.880> even<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
way better and that's not even the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.609 
way better and that's not even the
Master<00:01:54.539> Sword<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.959> link<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> past<00:01:55.439> the
