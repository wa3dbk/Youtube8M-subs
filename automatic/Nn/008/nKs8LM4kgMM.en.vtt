00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
said they're trying to implement all

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.460 
said they're trying to implement all
that<00:02:35.080> into<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.680> controller<00:02:36.420> um<00:02:37.420> okay<00:02:38.140> let's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that into this controller um okay let's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.410 
that into this controller um okay let's
start<00:02:38.770> with<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> design<00:02:39.340> itself<00:02:39.460> as<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.180> said

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
start with the design itself as I said

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.530 
start with the design itself as I said
design<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:41.020> ok<00:02:41.710> i<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.910> i<00:02:43.210> wouldn't

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
design is ok i like it and i wouldn't

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.450 
design is ok i like it and i wouldn't
mind<00:02:43.720> having<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.710> my<00:02:44.830> hands<00:02:45.220> playing

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
mind having this in my hands playing

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.300 
mind having this in my hands playing
some<00:02:45.880> games<00:02:46.150> from<00:02:46.390> steam<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.070> as<00:02:48.070> you'll

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
some games from steam and as you'll

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.730 
some games from steam and as you'll
already<00:02:48.490> know<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:49.120> has<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.780> touch<00:02:50.140> pads<00:02:50.440> from

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
already know it has to touch pads from

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.100 
already know it has to touch pads from
sides<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.370> they<00:02:51.550> said<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.150> acts<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:52.990> a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
sides and they said it it acts like a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.340 
sides and they said it it acts like a
mouse<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.430> would<00:02:54.580> actually<00:02:55.240> have<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.870> lot

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
mouse so you would actually have a lot

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.210 
mouse so you would actually have a lot
better<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:58.209> precise<00:02:58.870> movements<00:02:59.590> for<00:02:59.770> example

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
better and precise movements for example

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.620 
better and precise movements for example
if<00:03:00.550> you're<00:03:00.760> playing<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.060> multiplayer<00:03:01.270> game

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
if you're playing a multiplayer game

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.460 
if you're playing a multiplayer game
like<00:03:02.110> let's<00:03:02.320> say<00:03:02.410> bellfield<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.580> call<00:03:03.940> of<00:03:04.030> duty

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
like let's say bellfield or call of duty

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.500 
like let's say bellfield or call of duty
you<00:03:05.470> need<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> really<00:03:05.920> precise<00:03:06.459> movement<00:03:07.360> of

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
you need a really precise movement of

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.030 
you need a really precise movement of
the<00:03:07.570> weapon<00:03:08.140> if<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.470> don't<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.860> that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
the weapon if you don't have that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.920 
the weapon if you don't have that
they're<00:03:09.670> gonna<00:03:09.850> shoot<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.660> won't<00:03:10.870> be

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
they're gonna shoot you and you won't be

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.900 
they're gonna shoot you and you won't be
able<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.200> shoot<00:03:11.320> back<00:03:11.530> because<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.340> can't<00:03:12.610> aim

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
able to shoot back because you can't aim

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.660 
able to shoot back because you can't aim
like<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.680> they<00:03:15.010> said<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.310> with<00:03:15.580> this

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
like but they said it with this

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.400 
like but they said it with this
controller<00:03:16.150> you're<00:03:16.690> gonna<00:03:16.840> you're<00:03:17.170> going<00:03:17.350> to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
controller you're gonna you're going to

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.620 
controller you're gonna you're going to
have<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> better<00:03:17.800> aim<00:03:18.100> better<00:03:18.880> precision<00:03:19.360> and

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
have a better aim better precision and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.920 
have a better aim better precision and
better<00:03:20.110> like<00:03:20.940> reliability<00:03:21.940> in<00:03:22.120> games<00:03:22.420> limit

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
better like reliability in games limit

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.890 
better like reliability in games limit
themselves<00:03:23.760> also<00:03:24.760> if<00:03:25.180> you're<00:03:25.330> wondering<00:03:25.570> are

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
you gonna be able to play all the older

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.550 
you gonna be able to play all the older
games<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.209> this<00:03:28.330> controller<00:03:28.720> they<00:03:28.959> said<00:03:29.230> yes

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
games on this controller they said yes

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.890 
games on this controller they said yes
they<00:03:30.370> you're<00:03:30.730> gonna<00:03:30.880> be<00:03:31.000> able<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.239> play<00:03:31.360> even

they you're gonna be able to play even
older<00:03:32.590> games<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:34.050> controller<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.320> i

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
older games on this controller and i

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.520 
older games on this controller and i
think<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:35.950> by<00:03:36.790> d<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:37.450> when<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.140> comes<00:03:38.290> out

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
think that by d like when it comes out

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.620 
think that by d like when it comes out
and<00:03:38.739> few<00:03:39.280> months<00:03:39.550> later<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:39.970> don't<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.239> able

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
and few months later you don't be able

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.800 
and few months later you don't be able
to<00:03:40.720> play<00:03:40.840> every<00:03:41.709> game<00:03:41.739> from<00:03:42.250> steam<00:03:42.580> with<00:03:43.510> this

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
to play every game from steam with this

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.040 
to play every game from steam with this
control<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.380> doesn't<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:46.180> doesn't<00:03:46.239> really<00:03:46.690> um

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
control it doesn't it doesn't really um

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.729 
control it doesn't it doesn't really um
I<00:03:47.459> don't<00:03:48.459> know<00:03:48.810> here<00:03:49.810> maybe<00:03:49.989> you're<00:03:50.470> gonna<00:03:50.590> be

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
I don't know here maybe you're gonna be

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.710
