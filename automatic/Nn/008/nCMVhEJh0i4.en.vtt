speaking without listening responding
without<00:00:10.430> understanding<00:00:11.230> it's<00:00:12.230> like<00:00:12.500> cutting

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
without understanding it's like cutting

listening<00:00:21.950> we<00:00:22.730> will<00:00:22.910> take<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.150> look<00:00:23.420> at<00:00:23.539> the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
listening we will take a look at the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.500 
listening we will take a look at the
listening<00:00:23.810> process<00:00:24.520> better<00:00:25.520> understand<00:00:26.300> the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
listening process better understand the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.680 
listening process better understand the
challenges<00:00:27.199> we<00:00:27.380> face<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:28.210> identify<00:00:29.210> quick

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
challenges we face and identify quick

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.580 
challenges we face and identify quick
simple<00:00:30.050> solutions<00:00:30.770> to<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.609> challenges<00:00:31.640> ahead

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
simple solutions to the challenges ahead

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.790 
simple solutions to the challenges ahead
so<00:00:33.590> how<00:00:33.829> do<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:34.010> become<00:00:34.280> better<00:00:34.760> listeners

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
so how do we become better listeners

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.619 
so how do we become better listeners
understanding<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:36.890> process<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:37.699> a<00:00:38.120> great

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
understanding the process is a great

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.500 
understanding the process is a great

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
place to start the listening process has

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.259 
place to start the listening process has
