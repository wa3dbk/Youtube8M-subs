 Today I'm here to show you 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.199
 how to create the most 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.720
 credit will start 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.510
 first you will have to go on this link 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 of the application my course is looking for 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.590
 for some reason can're going to come 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.540
 so I come to you there in hard rock and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.460
 here is the strange place that you 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.989
 Wanna both? 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
 the slow processor let's wait 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.200
 finish in beauty 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710
 I took this way to record baroque constructions 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.110
 beauty 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.110
 First you'll need them, will you? 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 need java but it has to be java 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.879
 7 can not be otherwise because otherwise it will 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 give some kind of problem will not open 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.949
 a day care center if everything is open, but if not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.369
 open comes installed here has two casualties 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 64 bit and 32 also have a block 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.110
 notes being aware that to install 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.200
 The cut is necessary to give full version 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.900
 1.1 7,201 internet at least once 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 so you know a normal internet 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.869
 without ford even entered and then say that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.689
 install occurs in this java 7 already 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.909
 I said and you can rest assured that the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.090
 normally needs other operations 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.479
 it will not be just 7.2 7.2 and if 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.829

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.380
 for you to know legal read here the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.480

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.580
 the law so that you will only go 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.850
 stop recording beauty here auto stop 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.270
 video record you leave off because 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:14.140
 This will make the video pay without you. 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:17.440
 that if that 's how you select werley 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.530

 here you will choose the speed 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.280
 ones because you left at 30 that I 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.060
 I always leave on 30 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.060
 if you record a 30 minute video 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:38.130
 in a video will only be a minute of 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.130
 explain it to you is as follows 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.000
 I recorded a video that would have 30 minutes 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.870
 in normal time 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.330

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.300

 only if you leave a speed 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.220
 very low and this will weigh heavily on the 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.820
 Your computer then did not take the show. 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.650
