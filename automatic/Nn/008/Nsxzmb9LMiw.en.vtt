shoulder<00:02:45.130> we're<00:02:45.400> going<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.670> learn<00:02:45.760> both<00:02:45.970> as<00:02:46.600> uh

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
shoulder we're going to learn both as uh

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.650 
shoulder we're going to learn both as uh
also<00:02:48.220> uh<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.820> next<00:02:49.060> tutorial<00:02:49.420> we're<00:02:49.540> going

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
also uh in the next tutorial we're going

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.780 
also uh in the next tutorial we're going
to<00:02:49.750> learn<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.200> pass<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.920> from<00:02:51.100> my<00:02:51.310> shoulder<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
to learn to pass it from my shoulder to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.140 
to learn to pass it from my shoulder to
shoulder

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
shoulder

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.500 
shoulder
so<00:02:52.810> same<00:02:53.740> direction<00:02:54.070> counterclockwise<00:02:54.940> but

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
so same direction counterclockwise but

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.690 
so same direction counterclockwise but
opposite<00:02:56.230> shoulder<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.830> therefore

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
opposite shoulder and therefore

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.470 
opposite shoulder and therefore
completely<00:02:58.270> different<00:02:58.690> timing<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.330> hoop

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
completely different timing so the hoop

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.060 
completely different timing so the hoop
is<00:03:01.630> spinning<00:03:01.900> counterclockwise<00:03:02.020> around<00:03:02.740> your

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.100 
is spinning counterclockwise around your
neck<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.610> time<00:03:03.670> when<00:03:04.240> hoop<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.750> contact

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
neck this time when hoop is in contact

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.720 
neck this time when hoop is in contact

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
shoulder push harden into the right so

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.600 
shoulder push harden into the right so
that<00:03:35.350> you're<00:03:35.590> standing<00:03:35.769> up<00:03:36.040> into<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.430> hoop

that you're standing up into the hoop
once<00:03:36.880> again<00:03:37.150> you'll<00:03:37.360> have<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> pull<00:03:37.780> your

shoulders back underneath the hoop and

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.560 
shoulders back underneath the hoop and
that's<00:03:39.640> just<00:03:39.820> like<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.030> keep<00:03:40.150> shoulder

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
shoulder hooping in this video what I

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.699

going<00:04:37.250> into<00:04:37.370> much<00:04:37.520> detail<00:04:37.790> about<00:04:38.000> but<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:38.720> did

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
going into much detail about but I did

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.970 
going into much detail about but I did
want<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.080> mention<00:04:39.200> that<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.710> biggest

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
want to mention that the biggest

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.620 
want to mention that the biggest
difference<00:04:40.040> between<00:04:40.430> timing<00:04:41.180> of<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.390> left

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
difference between timing of the left

difference between timing of the left
and<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.870> right<00:04:42.050> shoulder<00:04:42.290> duck<00:04:42.650> outs

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
and the right shoulder duck outs

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.250 
and the right shoulder duck outs
horizontal<00:04:43.880> or<00:04:43.940> vertical<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.600> on<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.050> left

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
horizontal or vertical is on the left

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.570 
horizontal or vertical is on the left
shoulder<00:04:45.530> you're<00:04:45.830> essentially<00:04:46.160> ducking<00:04:46.460> out

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
shoulder you're essentially ducking out

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.490 
shoulder you're essentially ducking out
when<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:46.820> hoop<00:04:47.000> is<00:04:47.150> in<00:04:47.300> front<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.050> on

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
when the hoop is in front of you and on

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.810 
when the hoop is in front of you and on
the<00:04:48.590> right<00:04:48.770> shoulder<00:04:49.040> you've<00:04:49.310> got<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.490> duck<00:04:49.670> out

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
the right shoulder you've got a duck out

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.730 
the right shoulder you've got a duck out
while<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.090> hoop<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:50.390> behind<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:51.080> or<00:04:51.560> you

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
while the hoop is behind you or you

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.320 
while the hoop is behind you or you
can't<00:04:52.010> see<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:52.670> it's<00:04:52.820> usually<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.180> little

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
can't see it so it's usually a little

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.700 
can't see it so it's usually a little
trickier<00:04:53.750> for<00:04:53.780> most<00:04:54.050> people<00:04:54.380> because<00:04:54.530> they'll

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
trickier for most people because they'll

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.440 
trickier for most people because they'll
have<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:54.860> tendency<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.370> duck<00:04:55.910> out<00:04:56.090> too<00:04:56.300> late

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
have a tendency to duck out too late

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.060 
have a tendency to duck out too late
they<00:04:56.780> want<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.020> wait<00:04:57.230> until<00:04:57.410> they<00:04:57.620> can<00:04:57.770> see<00:04:57.950> the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
they want to wait until they can see the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.700 
they want to wait until they can see the
hoop<00:04:58.220> don't<00:04:58.820> let<00:04:58.940> this<00:04:59.060> be<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.390> commit<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.590> the

hoop don't let this be you commit to the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.470

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
duck out yes you can do this with a

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.790 
duck out yes you can do this with a
smaller<00:05:02.750> hoop<00:05:02.930> yes<00:05:03.170> you<00:05:03.290> can<00:05:03.410> do<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.620> with<00:05:03.770> a

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
smaller hoop yes you can do this with a

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.200 
smaller hoop yes you can do this with a
bigger<00:05:03.980> hoop<00:05:04.190> but<00:05:04.610> your<00:05:04.760> hoop<00:05:04.850> is<00:05:04.880> going<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.120> be

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
bigger hoop but your hoop is going to be

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.620 
bigger hoop but your hoop is going to be
easier

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
easier

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.080 
easier
