00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.730
 a fire has engulfed in flames the last floor of a building of 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:06.850
 Manhattan in New York 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.459
 from one of the windows a man asks for help has been caught 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.329
 the flames appear outside and the smoke is becoming more suffocating 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.690
 firefighters is thrown from the roof attached to a rope to rescue the victim 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.820
 both begin to descend but the rope is too short to 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.849
 overcome them 11 floors that separate you from the faith 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.590
 the men who were several minutes suspended in the air 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 When faced with the risk of detaching from the tunnel, firefighters choose to break a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.820
 window 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 the firemen come to your aid 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 finally we managed to put assaults on them 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.020
 Chicago firefighters look for an old man in his own home 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.070
 the building has been assaulted a few hours earlier by robbers and the victim of 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 71 years does not show signs of life 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.130
 nobody nobody 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.380
 when they reach the basement they can not believe what they see the old man has been 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.800
 literally stuffed into a ventilation pipe the civil guard keeps 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.450
 stable the thieves wanted to silence the only witness of his crime 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.340
 this race 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.610
 yesterday very carefully the firemen break the metal of the tube where the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 Elder has been in filly 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 all that appears first is the man's legs 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.760
 he is very weak 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.900
 since it takes several hours locked in a very difficult position in a small 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 drawer full of moisture 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.760
 when man is free from his oppressive confinement his first words 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 are to inform firefighters of what has happened 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.010
 I will work 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.010
 everywhere 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.780
 after a first recognition 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.700
 the old man is transferred in an ambulance to a hospital
