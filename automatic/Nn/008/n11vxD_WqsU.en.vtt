just a little bit less um I think
daedric<00:07:13.090> armor<00:07:13.210> looks<00:07:13.810> cooler<00:07:14.080> anyway<00:07:14.440> and<00:07:14.770> so

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
daedric armor looks cooler anyway and so

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.060 
daedric armor looks cooler anyway and so
yeah<00:07:15.540> uh<00:07:16.540> well<00:07:17.260> that's<00:07:17.440> that's<00:07:17.770> about<00:07:17.860> it
