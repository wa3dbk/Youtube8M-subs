00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.059
 good people that I bring you a new video 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.440
 it is a demolition game 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 here on the cardio map in which 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 I get nuclear medal with this weapon 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 what are you seeing on screen in these 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750
 people the main reason why is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 this english i'm going to upload this man for 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.239
 analyze also the demolition responds 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.430
 because it is for me the least difficult way 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.770
 to get the measure of nuclear in 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.210
 this game in black ops 2 and dry for 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.829
 help a lot to get get 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.180
 some measure of nuclear 2 well 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.739
 difficult of the other modes in low 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.120
 confirmed for example is super 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.469
 complicated but here in demolition is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.850
 less difficult I will not say it is 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.920
 easy because it's always difficult to take 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 a nuclear but here as you see thanks 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.060
 to the comment let's analyze the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.310
 answer you are seeing the minimap in a 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.899
 big size here this area that you 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.149
 I'm marking what I call in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.280
 the l this corner of here of the map is 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.360
 where enemies usually reappear 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.160
 when you have to place the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.840
 demolition bomb with what if not 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.640
 invade this area the enemies 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.649
 they will constantly be reborn from 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 there in that little corner and they only have two 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.700
 exits the two stairs that's very 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.049
 easy cornered enemies there but 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.180
 you have to be placed in these 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.260
 points where I'm going to put here in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.970
 screen does not invade a case 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.130
 never goes away from there because if not he 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.870
 answer will appear behind the area 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.330
 of the planes or even in your 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.950
 respawn do not place guardians inside 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.090
 he answers them because that changes 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.090
 I also respond with what is 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.380
 sentries nothing that can interfere in 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.580
 the reappearance of enemies the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.230
 machine if you put a sense of a 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.880
 guardian is not going to reappear there is a 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.400
 enemy because they are literally 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.920
 sold and neither is a bastard to the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.440
 machine are not damn but 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.810
 good having controlled that area you go 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.790
 to see that it is easy to go killing the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.979
 enemies especially if you have a good 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.470
 team 666 friends who is playing 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.670
 together and you carry help streak is more 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.800
 important takes help streak that does not 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.229
 of killing because like that with the clouds over 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.550
 you all have super controlled you see 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.520
 where they are to be reappearing 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.620
 you give information to each other 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.940
 will you help for that are run for help and 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.830
 I think they are more important for 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.270
 get a nuclear that does not do 100 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.340
 losses in a game your cloud is exposed 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.650
 It also has what you do a low star 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.570
 is to change the response constantly 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.130
 they can even reappear behind you 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.250
 because the enemies die a lot and 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.330
 then the game changes the respado 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.069
 randomly so that they are not 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.590
 totally cornered and have some 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.120
 survive with what is best takes 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.670
 to gusts of help you also do 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.499
 many more points as starting each 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.379
 low coffees with dramas are 100 points without 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:34.599
 However a low of 120 or the eurostar me 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.909
 I think they are worth 15 points so 4 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.379
 I dared to imagine the amount of casualties 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.329
 have to do with the extra to do 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.950
 what amounts to a low with the weapon 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.510
 Makes a lot more points and mates with weapons 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.129
 Believe me you can start 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.530
 10,000 11,000 points easily here in 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.099
 demolition if you have the end it gets caught or 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.269
 is the responsbale trod with what 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.010
 Trying it at the beginning will cost 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.109
 a lot is not easy because although we 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.120
 see here that we have it already 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.519
 very coursed especially the people with the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.519
 that I play are very used to 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.169
 doing this is an easy way to 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.669
 win the demolition very easy to win 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.680
 because it is the best way to play 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.109
 demolition people there are people who think 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.750
 that this is playing piggy is such is not 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.919
 simply completely dominate the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.689
 enemy we have totally 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.000
 controlled we will win the game 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.340
 obviously but the first round to the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.739
 time to place the lose what for 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.540
 that there are three rounds the first 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.920
 we lose the second one we won it that 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.959
 defend is easier to defend than 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.000
 attack I already tell you and the third that 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.709
 there is one of an extension an extension 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.180
 to be able to continue making losses in case 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.250
 that lack of casualties for the nuclear 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.980
 Well, it comes from fucking mother as you see me 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.319
 I have saved the pen and use it for 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.660
 next round because first the pen 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.010
 to throw it right away as soon as 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.010
 they started in case the enemy throws water 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.890
 v that a v6 or even to fuck him the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.239
 minimap is the best do not waste the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.260
 streaks of points when you are about to 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.079
 finish a round because it 's a 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.810
 real stupidity and here this respawn 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.180
 it's much more complicated much much more 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.620
 complicated has these points of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.510
 reappearance that I'm going to mark here where 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.209
 children usually reappear there are three more 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.160
 or less located and you have to 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.260
 place more or less in this position 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.269
 say I'm going to mark here here and here 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.010
 even in the bunker in the bunker is 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.299
 convenient to put a guardian so that 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.859
 do not repeat this answer is 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.269
 constantly serving where they are 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.230
 reappearing the enemies that are going to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.570
 make the pump should 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.950
 you put a guardian in there inside the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.300
 bunker so it does not look like it 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.790
 ensures that it appears only in the 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.200
 area where the helicopter is and the 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.350
 others in the boxes are there 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.660
 then it is very difficult to lock 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.760
 here the enemy very very complicated is 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.010
 very easy to get killed because they can 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.290
 reappear in many places and if not 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.730
 there is a 97 in the air and I tell you that 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.620
 it's going to cost a lot to survive here as 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.880
 you have a lot of time abusing the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.830
 position in which you are you have to 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.380
 be constantly killing and killing and 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.850
 moving is to say you kill one or two you 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.370
 move changes position because 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.380
 you know that they appear very very close and 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.300
 if you stay doing four or five 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.340
 Lows in a row you know that the sixth 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.260
 is going to appear somewhere to kill 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.470
 well here I already get the run of 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.840
 implacable as you see linking the sat 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.730
 with counting again with the egg of 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.100
 response with the penis is that is how 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.230
 little by little the streak is getting 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.910
 of nuclear taking out those constantly 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.880
 if your classmates help you very much 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.890
 better but if I'm not in the air in 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.270
 this area is very very very sold already 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.820
 I'm telling you, you can see later that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.500
 I'm left without clouds and I do not even know where 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.120
 the nests walk here and here this moment 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.830
 You see that I do not see where he is fighting 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.500
 I know where the enemies appear 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.170
 placed on the pump has placed the 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.270
 pump in b / n the point must with what 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.950
 which is the most normal if enemy place 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.110
 the bomb in go then go to 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.000
 defend it and look with the comment 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.920
 how are all the enemies in ve 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.930
 taking positions to defend the 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.910
 pump with which to bring the pump must 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.340
 without a clouds to is right now it would be a 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.800
 authentic suicide here I get the ub 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.780
 sad i shot i see they are there instead 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.700
 defending the rubber piratics to this 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.350
 kid who was looking towards the 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.570
 entrance if you arrive to enter without clouds at 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.260
 it kills me brutally that was there 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.270
 hidden 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.280
 pointing to the aircraft and now yes 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.470
 I'm seeing them I have a lot easier 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.630
 get the nuclear is very very very 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.030
 I still could not cool anything 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.560
 It's good when the enemies when you 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.120
 you defend that the enemies put one of 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.980
 the pumps but the second does not come out because 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.510
 if you do not lose obviously but if 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.340
 put one so that the game is 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.230
 lengthen a little longer last three or 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.700
 four more minutes and can followed by 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.680
 time to get a nuclear or something 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.930
 more drunk that I'm looking for here 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.660
 I'm close to the nuclear now 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.010
 very little, I do not want to play it, I know that 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.050
 they are reborn here thanks to 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.060
 lights up a little bit of happy camping and 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.460
 nuclear medal achieved with the one of 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.260
 metal this weapon that is not discussed 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.180
 nothing leaves yet but it's one more than me 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.950
 like mostly medium and long 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.840
 short distance does not convince me so much 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.870
 but here it carries it with silencers 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.250
 Rapid chargers and goes very well to average 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.110
 distance does not have practically 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.520
 recoil than that what I like about a 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.980
 weapon with points at a distance that 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.840
 do not move and it has not cost me much 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.360
 get the nuclear with this weapon then 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.800
 I will upload later a also in 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.440
 low confirmed that he has gotten 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.270
 little bit this week 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.500
 That 's the truth, it's very beautiful 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.420
 that I had a lot of luck came a 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.100
 lots of unstoppable and I'll upload it 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.470
 this perhaps has much more merit than 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.940
 not this but it is also difficult 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.110
 get nuclear here in demolition 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.910
 whatever they say, even if the enemies 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.980
 have controlled but always the 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.780
 Answer is very very thrones I do not guarantee 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.680
 that is super troll if you do not wear it is a 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.550
 good equipment would cost a lot to 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.380
 corner the good ones the game was 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.350
 playing with you are in your whole mouth with 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.520
 snorkel with raúl and I do not know if I'm missing 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.560
 any more of those you have out there 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.880
 added but good the team that 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.650
 usually one of the teams that 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.030
 habitually we play you know that you have 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.040
 that play a lot to catch the stuffing 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.540
 respawn and they got some guys 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.580
 I hope it has served as a lucky help 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.820
 comment and see you next time 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.820
 goodbye
