00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hey niklas in the height and let cinema 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.879
 check it is about child 44 in the movie 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.859
 really that shitty is that you the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.019
 reaction from russia to this film 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:22.130
 prohibition could understand the experience 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:24.029
 You are alone now 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.680
 Do you remember our first one? 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.640
 encounter me you rude him 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.279
 infected me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.570
 I was enchanted by your beauty 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.530
 there will only ever be you for me 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.040
 I came as fast as I could 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.250
 there was an accident 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.590
 alex season was recorded by a train 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.620
 A back he claims to be son 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.210
 was murdered 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.070
 in is sure, clear murder is one 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.070
 exclusively capitalist disease 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.489
 let it be good there is no murder in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 this country there is 1953 in the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.780
 udssr leo the village is as a hero from the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.769
 World War II returned and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.270
 works now at the Soviet 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.280
 secret service mgb 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 he does with his companions 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 hunt on regime opponents and as one 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.820
 Her captive is the name of Leo's wife 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 he will reveal himself with it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.960
 instructed to spy on her 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.759
 In addition, by a comrade of the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.619
 son found dead 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.110
 but murder is not allowed in paradise 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.149
 Stalin says, and what about this 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.360
 the delicate situation you will experience in the 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.740
 cinema child 44 is a book adaptation and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 So the focus should actually be 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.920
 to be firm that's true but not so 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.930
 the filmmakers have some here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.340
 main points differently conceived 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.869
 so hunting is not after the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.570
 child murderer in the foreground but more 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.369
 the gloomy post-war era and that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.380
 act of the soviet secret service 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.149
 Who is surprised that the film is about to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.070
 film launch in russia was banned 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.720
 So you have to almost now the film 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.190
 already look at the two ways 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.899
 one who will have read the book 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.610
 probably be disappointed because 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.130
 through the relocated focus 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.330
 it's just the movie king 44 at the beginning 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.869
 a lot of tension 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.220
 In addition , some arise 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.289
 strands of action and logical consequence 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.179
 not as good as the book in the movie 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.739
 However, without knowing the book 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.000
 he is taken here a gloomy 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.410
 After World War II this is very good 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.810
 also got hit one 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.819
 excellent performance as it was then 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.069
 actually run in the ussr 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.290
 but sometimes the action is the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.760
 Secret services in the movie easy too 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.510
 enormous and you want something 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.670
 variety 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.920
 In addition, the film comes to action 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.209
 scenes are not insane 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.459
 but of course also the genre 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.500
 is owed but you have to say that 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.780
 the sadder it is that the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.690
 individual or the few action scenes 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.099
 there are so shaky and retrospective 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.030
 are that you almost never really 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.220
 can enjoy more 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.629
 that makes the protagonist tom hardy 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.940
 Of course, that's a lot more, too 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.890
 difficult thing from the movie yet 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.110
 rauszuholen where you really have to say 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.849
 that he here its main role his 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.950
 really do roll the main character 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.099
 everything embodies very well in 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.940
 everything is a lengthy one in 44 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.770
 postwar dollar 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.300
 but score with a good atmosphere 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.290
 It can simply be different levels 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.480
 in this movie 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.460
 you learn to hate people but you do 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.740
 is unfortunately very protracted hate 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.180
 that's what I want to say with a better one 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.260
 script or 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.520
 More on the original film would be it 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.470
 certainly run better and 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.050
 that's why the film gets us unfortunately 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.640
 only 5 out of 10 points he is say 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.380
 such a zwischending between cinema 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.480
 movie drama and no cinema cinema movie is 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.220
 really comes here to the audience 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.140
 if he takes something out of the film with it 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.370
 may or not yes so you know what 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.300
 you and your own picture 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.770
 Of course we could do that 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.510
 again a game of chance prepared 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.100
 this time, this game consists of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.750
 three fan packages which in turn exist 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.550
 from a poster and the book to the movie 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.420
 if you want to win that, write us 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.280
 but just down in the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.810
 Comment why you think that 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.480
 Russia has banned this film 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.320
