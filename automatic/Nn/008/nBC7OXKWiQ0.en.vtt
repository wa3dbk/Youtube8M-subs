applied to the carton at the time of
shipping<00:03:31.220> looked<00:03:32.180> at<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.330> lot<00:03:32.660> of<00:03:32.720> different

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
shipping looked at a lot of different

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.160 
shipping looked at a lot of different
solutions<00:03:33.560> we<00:03:34.400> looked<00:03:34.580> at<00:03:34.760> inkjet<00:03:35.569> printers

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
solutions we looked at inkjet printers

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.680 
solutions we looked at inkjet printers
we<00:03:36.530> looked<00:03:36.739> at<00:03:36.950> laser<00:03:37.340> printers<00:03:37.849> where<00:03:38.569> we

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
we looked at laser printers where we

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.240 
we looked at laser printers where we
found<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.170> cost<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.709> size<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
found that the cost and the size of the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.120 
found that the cost and the size of the
clip<00:03:40.489> we're<00:03:40.910> all<00:03:41.060> prohibited<00:03:41.620> we<00:03:42.620> also<00:03:42.769> looked

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
clip we're all prohibited we also looked

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.900 
clip we're all prohibited we also looked
at<00:03:43.280> trifold<00:03:43.910> type<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.569> solution<00:03:45.050> which<00:03:45.910> again

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
at trifold type the solution which again

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.809 
at trifold type the solution which again
the<00:03:47.360> cost<00:03:47.599> of<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.860> application<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.640> it

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
the cost of that the application of it

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.920 
the cost of that the application of it
was<00:03:50.420> just<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:50.840> practical<00:03:51.049> for<00:03:51.350> our<00:03:51.590> uses<00:03:55.930> sada

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
was just not practical for our uses sada

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.020 
was just not practical for our uses sada
provided<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:57.530> solution<00:03:58.310> for<00:03:58.670> us<00:03:58.760> where<00:03:58.940> we

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
provided this solution for us where we

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.699 
provided this solution for us where we
could<00:03:59.209> print<00:03:59.390> on<00:03:59.540> both<00:03:59.569> sides<00:04:00.080> of<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.350> label

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
could print on both sides of the label

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.300 
could print on both sides of the label
we<00:04:01.310> found<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.790> asado<00:04:02.239> had<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.019> thermal<00:04:03.950> printer

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
we found the asado had a thermal printer

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.640 
we found the asado had a thermal printer
that<00:04:05.090> enabled<00:04:05.450> us<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.569> print<00:04:05.900> both<00:04:06.140> sides<00:04:06.440> the

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
that enabled us to print both sides the

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.190 
that enabled us to print both sides the
label<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.239> process<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.660> we<00:04:08.900> also

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
label and in the process that we also

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.470 
label and in the process that we also
found<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:10.040> vendor<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.549> was<00:04:10.700> willing<00:04:10.910> to<00:04:11.299> work

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
found a vendor that was willing to work

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.420 
found a vendor that was willing to work
with<00:04:11.540> us<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:12.019> design<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.380> label<00:04:12.860> that<00:04:13.040> would

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
with us to design a label that would

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.479 
with us to design a label that would
enable<00:04:14.239> us<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.599> peel<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.680> outbound<00:04:16.010> label<00:04:16.370> off

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
enable us to peel the outbound label off
