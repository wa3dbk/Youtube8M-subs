00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
jaw line as well and so we're gonna

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.830 
jaw line as well and so we're gonna
start<00:00:29.039> off<00:00:29.220> into<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> FDA<00:00:29.849> indicated<00:00:30.539> area

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
start off into the FDA indicated area

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
start off into the FDA indicated area
which<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> long<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> cheeks<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.309> lose

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
which is long the cheeks and we lose

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.280 
which is long the cheeks and we lose
cheek<00:00:32.910> volume<00:00:33.300> over<00:00:33.510> time<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.989> when<00:00:34.140> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
cheek volume over time and when that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.709 
cheek volume over time and when that
happens<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:35.280> causes<00:00:35.700> telltale<00:00:36.180> nasolabial

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
happens it causes telltale nasolabial

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
happens it causes telltale nasolabial
folds<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.410> changes<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> lower<00:00:38.219> face<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.180> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
folds and changes in the lower face so I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
folds and changes in the lower face so I
really<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> work<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.200> volumizing<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
really want to work on just volumizing a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.590 
gonna do a little poke on three three
and<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.789> simple<00:00:57.030> technique

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and so this is a really simple technique

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.569 
and so this is a really simple technique
it's<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> little<00:00:59.780> small<00:01:01.579> there's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
it's just a little small there's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
it's just a little small there's
actually<00:01:02.940> numbing<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> voluma<00:01:04.049> itself

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
actually numbing and the voluma itself

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.990 
actually numbing and the voluma itself
so<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.920> quite<00:01:05.070> comfortable<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.880> you're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
so it's quite comfortable when you're

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.940 
so it's quite comfortable when you're
having<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.479> done<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:08.360> typically<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:10.350> patients

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
having it done I typically for patients

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
having it done I typically for patients
like<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> provide<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.659> bit

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
like to provide them with a little bit

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
like to provide them with a little bit
of<00:01:12.869> topical<00:01:13.380> numbing<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.939> they<00:01:17.939> sit<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
of topical numbing and they sit for a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.030 
of topical numbing and they sit for a
little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> even<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> little

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
little bit so that even that little

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980 
little bit so that even that little
initial<00:01:20.549> poke<00:01:20.790> through<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> skin<00:01:21.420> isn't<00:01:21.659> too

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
initial poke through the skin isn't too

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
initial poke through the skin isn't too
bad<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.189> usually<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.759> lidocaine

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
bad and then usually the lidocaine

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.630 
bad and then usually the lidocaine
that's<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.080> Juvederm<00:01:25.560> voluma<00:01:25.650> itself

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that's in the Juvederm voluma itself

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's in the Juvederm voluma itself
really<00:01:26.939> starts<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> kick<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> patients

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
really starts to kick in and patients

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
really starts to kick in and patients
don't<00:01:28.740> feel<00:01:28.920> very<00:01:29.189> much<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.540> very

don't feel very much you want to do very
small<00:01:31.290> amounts<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.009> voluma<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.610> actually

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
small amounts and voluma is actually

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.219 
small amounts and voluma is actually
moldable<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:33.689> what's<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.049> wonderful

tenth really I'm just doing about a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
tenth really I'm just doing about a
twentieth<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> syringe<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.360> any<00:01:48.810> single

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
twentieth of the syringe at any single

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.940 
twentieth of the syringe at any single
point<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> just

different techniques can be used I'm

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.110 
different techniques can be used I'm
using<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.590> Depot<00:02:11.920> technique<00:02:12.370> which<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.910> means

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
using a Depot technique which just means

using a Depot technique which just means
small<00:02:13.510> Alec<00:02:13.959> pots<00:02:14.170> are<00:02:14.440> being<00:02:14.620> placed<00:02:14.920> right

small Alec pots are being placed right

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.190 
small Alec pots are being placed right
on<00:02:15.459> top<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.850> usually<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.420> periosteum<00:02:16.840> which

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
on top of usually the periosteum which

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.800 
on top of usually the periosteum which
is<00:02:17.470> our<00:02:17.620> deep<00:02:17.830> bone<00:02:18.069> in<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.370> area<00:02:18.880> creating<00:02:19.750> a

is our deep bone in that area creating a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.350 
is our deep bone in that area creating a
really<00:02:20.230> strong<00:02:20.620> lift<00:02:20.980> with<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.310> voluma<00:02:21.819> you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
really strong lift with the voluma you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.330 
really strong lift with the voluma you
can<00:02:22.510> also<00:02:22.660> use<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.019> Fanning<00:02:23.560> technique<00:02:24.010> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
can also use a Fanning technique that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.070 
can also use a Fanning technique that
works<00:02:24.550> really<00:02:24.819> well<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.480> product<00:02:25.930> as

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
works really well with this product as

and again just small little dots to the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.470 
and again just small little dots to the
flat<00:02:39.390> sheet<00:02:39.660> cup<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.640> we<00:02:41.820> typically<00:02:42.210> will

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
flat sheet cup and we typically will

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480 
flat sheet cup and we typically will
continue<00:02:42.990> all<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.260> way<00:02:43.560> along<00:02:43.950> what's<00:02:44.280> called

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
continue all the way along what's called

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:53.620 
continue all the way along what's called
the<00:02:44.580> zygoma<00:02:45.210> or<00:02:45.420> sort<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.720> your<00:02:45.900> cheekbone

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.690 

creating<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.470> little<00:02:54.800> bit<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:55.040> volume<00:02:55.250> and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
creating a little bit of volume and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.140 
creating a little bit of volume and
that's<00:02:55.910> creating<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.450> little<00:02:56.660> bit<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.930> left<00:02:58.150> and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
that's creating a little bit of left and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.060 
that's creating a little bit of left and
as<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.540> put<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.870> product<00:03:00.230> there<00:03:00.440> with<00:03:00.680> Angie

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
part of our cheekbone we can then use it

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.860 
part of our cheekbone we can then use it
in<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.070> sub<00:03:30.280> male<00:03:30.490> result<00:03:30.910> which<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.360> this

think she has a really nice balance of
those<00:03:50.440> two<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:51.400> we're<00:03:51.550> just<00:03:51.700> gonna<00:03:51.790> put<00:03:52.030> a

slowly<00:04:30.520> if<00:04:30.940> you're<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.360> right<00:04:31.510> plane<00:04:31.900> this

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
slowly if you're in the right plane this

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.920 
slowly if you're in the right plane this
just<00:04:32.410> feels<00:04:32.590> very<00:04:32.800> nicely<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:34.000> smoothly<00:04:34.360> into

temple and by volumizing this area it
actually<00:04:42.810> overtime<00:04:43.810> can<00:04:44.080> help<00:04:44.290> lift<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.740> brow

probably<00:05:03.430> just<00:05:03.610> about<00:05:03.820> three<00:05:04.150> above<00:05:04.360> in<00:05:04.510> this

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
probably just about three above in this

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.600 
probably just about three above in this
zone<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.470> we'll<00:05:05.650> be<00:05:05.770> done<00:05:05.950> with<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.220> blue<00:05:06.430> on

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.140 
zone and we'll be done with the blue on
this<00:05:06.880> side<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.860> again<00:05:12.250> I'm<00:05:12.370> just<00:05:12.490> using<00:05:12.610> very

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
this side and again I'm just using very

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.750 
this side and again I'm just using very
small<00:05:13.300> mounds<00:05:14.020> about<00:05:14.260> it

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
small mounds about it

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:30.830 
small mounds about it
wait<00:05:15.760> oh<00:05:16.000> five<00:05:16.300> cc's<00:05:17.400> 2.1<00:05:18.400> CC<00:05:18.940> at<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.120> time

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.080 

and<00:05:31.800> as<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.039> can<00:05:32.189> see<00:05:32.340> there's<00:05:32.580> very<00:05:32.669> little

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
and as you can see there's very little

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.999 
and as you can see there's very little
discomfort<00:05:33.419> with<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.199> there's<00:05:34.499> very<00:05:34.770> low

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
discomfort with this there's very low

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.559 
discomfort with this there's very low

techniques

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.010 
techniques
I'll<00:05:38.699> probably<00:05:38.939> just<00:05:39.210> mold<00:05:39.659> this<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.900> little

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
I'll probably just mold this a little

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.659 
I'll probably just mold this a little
more<00:05:40.199> but<00:05:40.409> as<00:05:40.529> you<00:05:40.650> can<00:05:40.800> see<00:05:41.009> it's<00:05:41.219> just<00:05:41.340> a<00:05:41.490> very

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
more but as you can see it's just a very

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.969 
more but as you can see it's just a very
nice<00:05:41.819> sweep<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.509> the<00:05:42.629> cheek<00:05:42.900> get<00:05:43.499> a<00:05:43.529> little<00:05:43.860> bit

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
nice sweep to the cheek get a little bit

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.649 
nice sweep to the cheek get a little bit
of<00:05:44.069> falling<00:05:44.340> back<00:05:44.550> here<00:05:44.879> and<00:05:45.150> created<00:05:45.599> a

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
of falling back here and created a

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.600 
of falling back here and created a
little<00:05:45.779> bit<00:05:45.990> of<00:05:46.110> volume<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:46.680> her<00:05:46.860> temple<00:05:47.310> and

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
little bit of volume and her temple and

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.309 
little bit of volume and her temple and
that's<00:05:47.999> a<00:05:48.180> change<00:05:48.449> if<00:05:48.629> you<00:05:48.749> compare<00:05:49.169> it<00:05:49.199> to

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
that's a change if you compare it to

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.409 
that's a change if you compare it to
