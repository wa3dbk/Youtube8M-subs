been training and working with dogs for
many<00:00:26.590> years<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:28.360> really<00:00:28.720> wanted<00:00:28.960> something

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.270 
the chest with stop lying off and it
works<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:34.060> well<00:02:34.209> because<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.260> dog<00:02:35.530> thinks

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
works really well because the dog thinks

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.040 
works really well because the dog thinks
that<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.670> counter<00:02:37.120> did<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.600> them

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
that the counter did it to them

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050 
that the counter did it to them
because<00:02:38.860> that's<00:02:39.160> kind<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.670> way<00:02:39.790> dogs

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
because that's kind of the way dogs

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.100 
because that's kind of the way dogs
think<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.959> they<00:02:41.650> will<00:02:42.370> stop<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.670> behavior

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
think so they will stop that behavior

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.509 
think so they will stop that behavior
immediately<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.739> my<00:02:44.860> clients<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.400> been

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
immediately so my clients have been

00:02:45.519 --> 00:03:05.490 
immediately so my clients have been
really<00:02:46.060> happy<00:02:46.269> with<00:02:46.420> that

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.560
