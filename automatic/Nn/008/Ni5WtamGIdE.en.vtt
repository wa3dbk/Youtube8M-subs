00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.830 
that appeals to me at all so like I said
this<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.909> probably<00:01:59.909> one<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> first<00:02:00.420> app<00:02:00.689> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
this is probably one of the first app so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.090 
this is probably one of the first app so
I've<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.079> reviewed<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.799> didn't
