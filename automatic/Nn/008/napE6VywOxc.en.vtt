the 4k TVs we're going to see this year
there's<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:52.920> intervening

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
there's going to be some intervening

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
there's going to be some intervening
processing<00:00:53.969> before<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.449> 4k<00:00:54.750> signal

processing before that 4k signal

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.979 
processing before that 4k signal
actually<00:00:55.949> reaches<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> TV<00:00:56.730> screen<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.750> one

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
actually reaches the TV screen this one

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.470 
actually reaches the TV screen this one
is<00:00:58.260> undiluted<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.370> bringing<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
is undiluted and bringing it right to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
is undiluted and bringing it right to
your<00:01:00.629> eyeballs<00:01:00.809> another<00:01:01.770> cool<00:01:01.920> thing<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
your eyeballs another cool thing is that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.810 
your eyeballs another cool thing is that
it<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> 4k<00:01:04.070> resolution<00:01:05.070> input<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.670> if

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it has a 4k resolution input so if

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.850 
it has a 4k resolution input so if
you're<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:06.659> loading<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you're if you're loading up you have a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
you're if you're loading up you have a
4k<00:01:08.100> compatible<00:01:08.630> camcorder<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
4k compatible camcorder you can put that

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.219 
4k compatible camcorder you can put that
content<00:01:10.860> directly<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> TV<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.110> as

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
content directly on the TV and see it as

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
content directly on the TV and see it as
full<00:01:13.470> resolution<00:01:13.820> uncompressed<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
full resolution uncompressed one of the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
full resolution uncompressed one of the
reasons<00:01:15.869> why<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.290> probably<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
reasons why this is probably one of the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
reasons why this is probably one of the
4k<00:01:17.549> TVs<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.240> really<00:01:18.479> pay<00:01:18.630> attention<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.290> is

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
4k TVs to really pay attention to is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
4k TVs to really pay attention to is
because<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.100> coming<00:01:20.400> from<00:01:20.520> Vizio<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.180> brand

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
because it's coming from Vizio a brand

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.410 
because it's coming from Vizio a brand
that<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.710> known<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:22.950> their<00:01:23.729> value<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that is really known for their value and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.719 
that is really known for their value and
really<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:25.229> aggressively<00:01:25.770> pricing<00:01:26.250> their<00:01:26.369> TVs

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
really be aggressively pricing their TVs

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
really be aggressively pricing their TVs
so<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.689> we're<00:01:27.810> looking<00:01:28.049> at<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.140> might<00:01:28.560> just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
so what we're looking at here might just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.749

looking at it right now I can tell you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.690 
looking at it right now I can tell you
that<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.650> picture<00:01:37.890> quality<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.250> beautiful

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that the picture quality is beautiful

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.149 
that the picture quality is beautiful
the<00:01:39.090> content<00:01:39.570> might<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.229> yet<00:01:40.439> 4k

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the content might not be there yet 4k

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.810 
the content might not be there yet 4k
content<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.710> not<00:01:43.710> quite<00:01:43.950> reaching<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
content this is not quite reaching the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
content this is not quite reaching the
mainstream<00:01:45.270> yet<00:01:45.479> what<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.840> were<00:01:45.930> looking<00:01:46.200> at

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
mainstream yet what we were looking at

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.350 
mainstream yet what we were looking at
is<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:47.090> specially<00:01:48.740> requested<00:01:49.820> video<00:01:50.820> clip<00:01:51.119> from

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is a specially requested video clip from

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
is a specially requested video clip from
a<00:01:51.479> dreamworks<00:01:51.869> picture<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.770> slowed<00:01:53.070> down<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
a dreamworks picture that slowed down to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.889 
a dreamworks picture that slowed down to
the<00:01:53.640> half<00:01:53.820> frame<00:01:54.119> rate<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.659> really

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the half frame rate so you can really

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.179 
the half frame rate so you can really
see<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.470> looking<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.770> close<00:01:55.950> here
