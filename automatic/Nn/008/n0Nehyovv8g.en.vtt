 hello I'm ahome 79 77 in this space I will bring you videos of what I like the most 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.260
 that is to cook recipes and already approved ica tested by people of just 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.409
 demanding jejejeje 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.359
 in this video we will see garlic shrimp rather have invested 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.499
 since traditionally the shrimps with garlic give the chili minced very 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.140
 finite but as I am delicate of the stomach the rite acteal my 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.230
 needs that between the original and mine I feel that my version is much 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.980
 greater flavor now that everyone has their tastes hehehe let's start mentioning 

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:34.850
 the ingredients that are 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.210
 dried guajillo chili 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.990
 green pepper oil 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.120
 margarine the shepherd who tequila 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.180
 salt and black pepper to taste and the star the shrimp 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.080
 also known by cameron for cocktail 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.790
 good step 1 first you have to clean the chiles by removing the seeds and 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.430
 penalties 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.220
 be careful when you do it better put a bag in your hands to 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.330
 that are not required 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.900
 After we have cleaned the chiles we put them in a pot with water until 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.990
 cover them with a piece of onion a jito 8 liters of oil and a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.330
 little salt and pepper but green this we put on the fire until the peppers 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.880
 soften this takes about 10 to 15 minutes at a time 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.200
 then we go to step two that explain very finite basses and throw them out if 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 they have not made what they can not substitute for onion of cambra illa 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.119
 onion of the white or anything that knows something towards little gem 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.159
 after the chairlift step that the chilies softened and we already attacked them 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.829
 we let it cool down a bit to liquefy the already when criminals well with everything 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.639
 what we put to him including the water we put in a pan the oil together 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:43.829
 with the margarine a good good chunk the truth depends on the taste jejejeje since 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.359
 we throw that we add the fact to the other in his substitute the onion 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.770
 we hope that this transparent medium and toni we add the liquefied chili and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.869
 After the garlic stir we add the tequila and the shrimp season with 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.679
 salt and black and green pepper then finally we add the epazote 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:01.920
 minced 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.730
 it is not easy to do hehehe good I hope you can accompany it 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.069
 Like me with salty cookies, I anointed him with aguapey and I put the shrimp 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.930
 good delivery now let's move on to the tricks 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.290
 one is prescribing the proportions of each ingredient is said since 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.009
 only cost of people 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.919
 but if they like very tico soles besides chili and if not less garlic equal to me 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.729
 I love them they are a lot and there are people that we like is tastes 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.919
 this recipe good I hope nothing or measures as it came out if they liked 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.790
 if they put something extra that the best or I know 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.379
 hehehe good we'll see you next with shrimp broth or special version 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.639
 green
