00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.470
 Lisa Lisa and Maria Ready 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.470
 the consecutive of Maria you have to 26 22 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.140
 as births is coming up 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.330

 the year is the month and the 12 is the year 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
 22 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.810
 and already be there there are hundreds 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.900
 if the biggest appointment 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.420

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.819
 of 180 kilos more or less 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.220
 this is like saying something because 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.220
 we remove the milk 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.850
 but 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:28.050
 strongly for what 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.050
 but milk of the explorer actor 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.050
 and already after the first month pure milk and 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.420
 the second month replaces them doze 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.810
 half 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.700
 the act and replaced when you start 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.380
 with starts with mana or starts with 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.880
 something with which you prepare 22 of 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.090
 protein in terms of proteins more or 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.090
 less 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.240
 3 % 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.550
 but pellet and comes pelletized 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.550
 had sacks 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.680
 to calves 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:37.139
 you do not have 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:40.210
 also that is not the son of a 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.480
 of a f1 as normalists 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.050
 better because we have invented them 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.050
 in cement 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.539
 there has been a little thing 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.039
 the concentrate that you give to them is 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.300
 you're giving it pelletized that you 're going 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.300
 that you're giving it in the flour 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.650
 like the boats 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.020
 no no 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.449
 three quarters and is that some come out very 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.610
 pigmented other comes out very well 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.169
 do not do not use this with the calves there 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.169
