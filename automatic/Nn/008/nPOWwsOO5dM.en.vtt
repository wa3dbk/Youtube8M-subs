00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.230
 we only talk about that the chrono 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.240
 what exactly is it 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.469
 the inventor is going to explain to us he's in 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.740
 line with us since new york 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.500
 dominique in the sad hello hello that it 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.310
 is very good he is super good then 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.279
 what is the chrono is 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.800
 exactly the trade is a beautiful 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.220
 invention finance in may here in new york 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.949
 and his oils between the croissant and the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.820
 happiness as having lived here okay 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:39.940
 What does it taste like what taste is great 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.640
 good but that the form of a net teen is to 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.829
 7 with a leg the minority a little 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.989
 as between have made a croissant 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.550
 but otherwise it's really specific that 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.649
 requested me not want me to develop 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 the recipe does not draw that is very very 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:58.090
 light and very airy it is one and how much 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.370
 of chords so pretty nourishing kaunas 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.550
 and burly even I dare say no 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.570
 in these four lighten 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.929
 unlike what we can really 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.580
 the interior textures and then you 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.729
 it took two months to find 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.349
 the right recipe finally that's it 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.840
 exactly I work for two 

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:21.700
 month on the recipe tried to y 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.800
 recipes from the field to really make the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.750
 recipe having a dough it's a sim 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.420
 pâquis free and have a dough that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.399
 quite easily millions since 2002 the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.280
 nasa and something that does not absorb 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.349
 step by step and that remains a very 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 slight effusion then every day 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.270
 it's the real madness it's the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.860
 greed that it buy New York 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.259
 I understood that there was a 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.509
 big crowd to sell your shop 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.539
 every morning exactly we open the 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.090
 doors at 8am and before 8am this morning between 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.709
 100 and 150 people waiting and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.880
 pretty much like that since we invented the 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:59.289
 produced since the second day and at and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.629
 we try to do enough to 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:06.270
 everyone and then two hundred and 200 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.890
 people pretty much every morning 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.569
 what is the miracle recipe then for 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.640
 it's a real pastry chef's dream actually 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.170
 all that is exactly the recipe 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.390
 miracle do not know if there is but I 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.160
 think all we pay is the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.400
 pastry is important 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.770
 if there is it's coming the customers that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.620
 the quality of products continue to 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.300
 create the products to count a lot 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.160
 on creativity we change minutes 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.740
 where six to eight weeks for me 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.360
 very important to continue doing this 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.940
 kind of lunar exploration is really 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.260
 discover people things then 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.810
 the gourmont who speaks to you 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.700
 it costs how much does it cost 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.170
 costs $ 5 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.440
 it's not too expensive finally and 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.540
 I believed so holding the tail and so 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.210
 you must limit the number of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.650
 chronicles per person that's it 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.070
 exactly so we limit to 2 by 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.570
 nobody 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.160
 why because we really try 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.780
 to satisfy my clients and 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.590
 serve more people than we can really 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.970
 that people taste it from the races 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.700
 kessel if not cowardly people and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.520
 trépardoux bn is like a girl have 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.680
 a lot night or by 24 and then you in 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.650
 brag about how much a day 2 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.100
 it is crevant sends between 350 and 400 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.850
 per day 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.470
 parents of parents of times I have 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.840
 believed also quickly understand in 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.090
 searching the net that there was 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.560
 also services saas and admits 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.750
 that he proposes is unfortunately 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.630
 services for queuing it was at 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.400
 just explain to them all this is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.870
 a lot here in new york but nice for 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.720
 wait and had bought products in 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:52.300
 fed up Chinese is also why we 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:55.180
 have left Chinese hama at level 2 or 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.130
 The same people have never come 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.560
 buy buy buy our product and 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.350
 resold them in the street to a bought 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.720
 for between 100 and 200 dollars so what 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.150
 and we could also see several 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.370
 several new pastry chefs who 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.989
 were coming to the market with your idea 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.989
 but under different names so we have 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.410
 for example the finger without the 12 cents the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.010
 crown and the french of notes etc 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.169
 you are not afraid of this 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:31.840
 competition precisely I do not think that 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:36.210
 I know it's flattering but people 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.210
 when they even seek to replicate the idea 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.300
 is so if I can ask you 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.220
 what is the next recipe the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.350
 next satisfaction still well empty 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.710
 exchange of menus for the best winter 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.060
 and we always have hundreds and 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.330
 hundreds of ethnicities at the door every 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.010
 days 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.290
 the next on stage I thought 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.870
 continue to do what I love and there is 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.410
 to renew my clientele is to be done 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.310
 come people for new things and 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.600
 and there you are sure what taste 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.889
 precisely because I imagine that 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.460
 your your brain is in full 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.770
 boiling 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.710
 you have what taste there right now in 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.440
 mouth there right now we're working 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.530
 a little on the town on the caramel 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.450
 sure chocolate but during the test 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.810
 winter and then we could also see some 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.610
 stars in your shop 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.280

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.570

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.919
 really a lot of that that came to 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.800
 pastry 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:50.860
 they all waited online that we 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.780
 queued same exception as 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.099
 for my friends but for the people who are 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.070
 know we're asking everyone this is okay 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.630
 better and that's it and everyone 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.700

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.000
