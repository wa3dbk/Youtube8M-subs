00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
with black previous ones will test two

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.850 
with black previous ones will test two
are<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.730> website<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:43.020> i'll<00:00:43.110> zoom<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.590> way

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
are my website so i'll zoom all the way

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
exact same thing on the Galaxy Nexus so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.440 
exact same thing on the Galaxy Nexus so
the<00:01:03.719> zoom<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.960> once<00:01:07.200> again

the zoom all the way out and once again
Camilla<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> read<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
Camilla like that but can you read it

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.200 
Camilla like that but can you read it
mmm<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.490> easier<00:01:14.580> don't

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
mmm not really a little bit easier don't

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.820 
mmm not really a little bit easier don't
get<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.390> wrong<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:16.110> hard<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> try<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.710> show

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
get me wrong it's hard to try and show

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.460 
get me wrong it's hard to try and show
you<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> can

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you that but you can see there you can

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.580 
you that but you can see there you can
read<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.689> see<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> show<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
read it see if we can show you on the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.010 
read it see if we can show you on the
galaxy<00:01:23.130> s2<00:01:24.710> kind<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.890> read<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.570> it's<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.750> as

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
galaxy s2 kind of read it it's not as

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.399 
galaxy s2 kind of read it it's not as
crisp<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> squint<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
crisp but if you squint you can kind of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.289 
crisp but if you squint you can kind of
see<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.369> hard<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> try<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:32.909> show<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.180> on

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
see it it's hard to try and show you on

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.710 
see it it's hard to try and show you on
camera<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> zooming<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.299> both<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
camera so it's a zooming in a both of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.929 
camera so it's a zooming in a both of
them<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> benton<00:01:38.220> rd<00:01:38.369> forms

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
them just on what the benton rd forms

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.330 
them just on what the benton rd forms
are<00:01:39.090> well<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:41.159> actual

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
are well just going to the the actual

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.630 
are well just going to the the actual
benchmarking<00:01:42.210> review<00:01:42.570> we've<00:01:42.720> done<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.640> if

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
benchmarking review we've done here if

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
benchmarking review we've done here if
you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.329> got<00:01:45.450> slightly<00:01:45.689> like

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you can see this it's got slightly like

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.280 
you can see this it's got slightly like
kinda<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.530> blue<00:01:46.770> tinge<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.759> white

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
kinda like a blue tinge up to this white

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
kinda like a blue tinge up to this white
so<00:01:49.640> that's<00:01:50.640> obviously<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.270> every<00:01:51.390> difference

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so that's obviously but every difference

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.530 
so that's obviously but every difference
in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> screens<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.030> here's<00:01:54.329> what

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
in the screens so here we go here's what

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
in the screens so here we go here's what
they<00:01:54.600> look<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.250> side<00:01:56.610> by

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
they look like so there they are side by

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.039 
they look like so there they are side by
side<00:01:58.280> once<00:01:59.280> again<00:01:59.520> will<00:01:59.790> double<00:02:00.270> tap<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
side once again will double tap and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.889 
side once again will double tap and
we'll<00:02:01.229> double<00:02:01.799> tap<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:03.030> was<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.270> brings<00:02:03.540> into

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
we'll double tap so was this brings into

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.920 
we'll double tap so was this brings into
what<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.170> view<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.820> Mulder's<00:02:06.780> will

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
what this view is here so Mulder's will

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.949 
what this view is here so Mulder's will
zoom<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.290> all<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:07.879> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.020> Galaxy<00:02:10.020> Nexus

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
zoom in all the way on the Galaxy Nexus

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.440 
zoom in all the way on the Galaxy Nexus
