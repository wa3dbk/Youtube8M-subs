00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.070 

now<00:00:23.610> unfortunately<00:00:23.790> the<00:00:24.390> first<00:00:24.660> round<00:00:24.870> was

cold and windy with gusts up to 50 km/h

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.720 
cold and windy with gusts up to 50 km/h
making<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:28.860> take<00:00:29.100> off<00:00:29.310> from<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> platform

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
making the take off from the platform

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.540 
making the take off from the platform
all<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.450> more<00:00:30.600> difficult

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.479 

the<00:00:38.090> main<00:00:38.300> problem<00:00:38.690> is<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:38.950> they<00:00:39.950> have<00:00:40.160> they

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
the main problem is that they have they

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:41.799 
the main problem is that they have they
have<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.790> balance<00:00:41.000> at<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.450> edge<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.720> a

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
have to balance at the edge of a

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.110 
have to balance at the edge of a
platform<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.590> even<00:00:43.399> if<00:00:43.520> we're<00:00:43.700> standing

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
platform and even if we're standing

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.090 
platform and even if we're standing
there<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.420> gust<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.870> wind<00:00:44.899> come<00:00:45.379> in<00:00:45.530> you

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
there and the gust of wind come in you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.460 
there and the gust of wind come in you
know<00:00:46.220> it<00:00:46.489> pushes<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:47.269> off<00:00:47.300> balance<00:00:47.629> which

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
know it pushes you off balance which

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.590 
know it pushes you off balance which
means<00:00:48.739> their<00:00:49.129> takeoff<00:00:49.579> has<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.300> be<00:00:50.420> completely

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
means their takeoff has to be completely

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.660 
means their takeoff has to be completely
in<00:00:51.170> balance<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.800> if<00:00:52.010> all<00:00:52.160> of<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.370> sudden<00:00:52.610> the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
in balance and if all of a sudden the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.640 
in balance and if all of a sudden the
gust<00:00:52.879> of<00:00:53.030> wind<00:00:53.059> comes<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:54.019> could<00:00:54.230> be<00:00:54.350> extremely

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
gust of wind comes it could be extremely

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
gust of wind comes it could be extremely
dangerous

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510
