going on around me I feel like I can

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
going on around me I feel like I can
maintain<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.970> good<00:01:24.120> level<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
maintain a pretty good level of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.880 
maintain a pretty good level of
awareness<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.050> when<00:01:25.260> you<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.620> kind<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
awareness you can usually pull out some

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.350 
awareness you can usually pull out some
high<00:01:27.659> streaks<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.920> need<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.210> there<00:01:30.210> are

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
high streaks and you need that there are

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.880 
high streaks and you need that there are
some<00:01:30.570> areas<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> map<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.530> will<00:01:31.710> not

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
some areas of the map that just will not

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.789 
some areas of the map that just will not
suit<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.369> gun<00:01:32.659> whatsoever<00:01:33.659> ctown<00:01:34.649> for

suit your gun whatsoever ctown for
example<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.340> usually<00:01:36.119> try<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.360> stay<00:01:36.600> away<00:01:36.719> from

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
example I usually try and stay away from

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.529 
example I usually try and stay away from
a<00:01:37.140> DOM<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.360> open

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
a DOM and the well because it's all open

and long ranged and that usually doesn't

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.209 
and long ranged and that usually doesn't
suit<00:01:42.719> my<00:01:42.869> gun<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.380> I'm<00:01:43.560> often<00:01:43.770> carrying

the<00:01:47.340> best<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.180> swap<00:01:48.539> out

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the best thing to do is to just swap out

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.300 
the best thing to do is to just swap out
your<00:01:48.810> secondary<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.530> any<00:01:49.649> assault<00:01:49.979> rifles

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you can find lying around and in this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690 
you can find lying around and in this
game<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> found<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> chief<00:01:52.829> basic<00:01:53.219> see<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:53.609> I

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
picked up that's often the smart option

fifty<00:03:20.640> percent<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.120> map<00:03:21.300> just<00:03:21.330> because<00:03:21.750> I

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
fifty percent of the map just because I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.510
