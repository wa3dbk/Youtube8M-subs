technology<00:00:51.719> has<00:00:51.840> been<00:00:51.989> around<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.469> decades

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
technology has been around for decades

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.700 
technology has been around for decades
in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.640> basic<00:00:54.000> form<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.570> basic<00:00:55.079> form<00:00:55.320> being<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
in the basic form a basic form being you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
in the basic form a basic form being you
press<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> key<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.640> completes<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.180> circuit

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
press a key it completes a circuit

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.240 
press a key it completes a circuit
sends<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> binary<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> computer<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
sends the binary to the computer the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
sends the binary to the computer the
computer<00:00:59.370> interprets<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> gives<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
computer interprets that and gives you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.610 
computer interprets that and gives you
your<00:01:01.079> response

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
your response

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.759 
your response
okay<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.059> keyboard<00:01:03.300> fails<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
okay now this keyboard fails at the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.719 
okay now this keyboard fails at the
basic<00:01:05.159> technology<00:01:06.020> ok<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.189> it<00:01:08.189> fails<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
basic technology ok so it fails as a
