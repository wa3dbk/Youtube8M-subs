00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.330 
defending can you the only problem of
our<00:03:24.510> side<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.109> that<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.590> kind<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:25.889> got<00:03:26.010> short

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
our side is that we kind of got short

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.400 
our side is that we kind of got short
defenders<00:03:26.819> at<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.030> moment<00:03:27.389> but<00:03:27.540> here's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
defenders at the moment but here's

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.189 
defenders at the moment but here's
straight<00:03:28.859> after<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.669> is<00:03:30.120> literally<00:03:30.569> on<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
straight after it is literally on the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.770 
straight after it is literally on the
line<00:03:31.230> by<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.709> phone<00:03:32.069> very<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:32.970> close<00:03:33.569> to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
line by the phone very so so close to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.110 
line by the phone very so so close to
actually<00:03:34.109> scoring<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.609> sure<00:03:35.790> we<00:03:35.940> give<00:03:36.090> away

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
actually scoring a but sure we give away

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.569 
actually scoring a but sure we give away
apparently<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:37.680> was<00:03:37.769> kind<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.160> tough

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
apparently it was kind of a tough

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.789 
apparently it was kind of a tough
decision<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.419> I<00:03:39.750> really<00:03:40.049> did<00:03:40.169> not<00:03:40.199> understand

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
decision and I really did not understand

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.199 
decision and I really did not understand
why<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.190> referee<00:03:41.549> was<00:03:41.849> looking<00:03:42.090> out<00:03:42.150> the

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
why the referee was looking out the

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.349 
why the referee was looking out the
first<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:42.810> there<00:03:42.989> suarra<00:03:43.590> steps<00:03:43.949> up<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.400> we

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
first but there suarra steps up and we

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.140 
first but there suarra steps up and we
do<00:03:45.510> save<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.930> with<00:03:46.079> Miller<00:03:46.889> love<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.459> very

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
do save it with Miller love and very

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.420 
do save it with Miller love and very
good<00:03:48.540> watching<00:03:49.379> no<00:03:49.530> go<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:50.040> nail<00:03:50.220> down<00:03:50.370> just

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
good watching no go to nail down just

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.280 
good watching no go to nail down just
before<00:03:50.819> half-time<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.660> we<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.930> kind<00:03:52.139> of

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
before half-time so we can kind of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
before half-time so we can kind of
control<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.739> game<00:03:52.919> in<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.220> set<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.730> after

our<00:03:54.120> pace<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:55.139> we<00:03:55.230> do<00:03:55.379> out<00:03:55.560> start<00:03:55.859> off<00:03:55.949> really

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
our pace but we do out start off really

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.400 
our pace but we do out start off really
well<00:03:56.220> in<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.790> second<00:03:57.090> half<00:03:57.120> 48<00:03:58.019> minutes<00:03:58.290> in
