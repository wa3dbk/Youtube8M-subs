home<00:00:48.059> nation<00:00:49.190> well<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.289> track

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
home nation well I think one is a track

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
home nation well I think one is a track
that's<00:00:52.320> looking<00:00:53.039> quite<00:00:53.219> interesting<00:00:54.210> it's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that's looking quite interesting it's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.810 
that's looking quite interesting it's
very<00:00:54.989> fast<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.440> places<00:00:55.860> too<00:00:56.160> tight<00:00:56.370> corners

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
very fast in places too tight corners

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
very fast in places too tight corners
but<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> really<00:00:57.870> makes<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> track<00:00:58.379> quite

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
but it really makes the track quite

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.549 
but it really makes the track quite
tough<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.670> has<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.870> camber<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
tough is that has this camber on the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.080 
tough is that has this camber on the
road<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.190> real<00:01:02.460> crown<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> road

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
road the really real crown on the road

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.579 
road the really real crown on the road
in<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> center<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> road<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.870> very<00:01:04.110> very

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
in the center of the road is very very

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.700 
in the center of the road is very very
sharp<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> run<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> very<00:01:06.710> quite

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
sharp so you have to run a very quite

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
sharp so you have to run a very quite
high<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.549> height<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.939> car<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.510> avoid

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
high right height in the car to avoid

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.020 
high right height in the car to avoid
bottoming<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> find<00:01:11.369> yourself<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:11.880> no

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
bottoming out and find yourself with no

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.960 
bottoming out and find yourself with no
real<00:01:12.659> tight<00:01:12.900> real<00:01:13.080> touching<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> ground<00:01:13.970> turn

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
real tight real touching the ground turn

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.929 
real tight real touching the ground turn
one<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> 120<00:01:16.380> miles<00:01:16.560> per<00:01:16.650> hour<00:01:16.830> corner<00:01:17.340> with

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
one is a 120 miles per hour corner with

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.280 
one is a 120 miles per hour corner with
a<00:01:17.970> huge<00:01:18.420> bump<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.780> middle<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
a huge bump in the middle of it and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.840 
a huge bump in the middle of it and
there<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.650> no<00:01:19.799> way<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:19.979> avoid<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
there is no way to avoid because the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
there is no way to avoid because the
bump<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> where<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> camber<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> Griffis<00:01:22.710> so

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
bump is where the camber the Griffis so

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.920 
bump is where the camber the Griffis so
you<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> take<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.600> sure<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you have to take it and make sure the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.749 
you have to take it and make sure the
car<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.110> straight<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.979> take<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
car is straight or when you take it you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.330 
car is straight or when you take it you
land<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.659> spot<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
land on the right spot so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
land on the right spot so
we<00:01:29.609> are<00:01:29.729> optimizing<00:01:30.179> the<00:01:30.450> car<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:30.899> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
we are optimizing the car right now to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.499 
we are optimizing the car right now to
