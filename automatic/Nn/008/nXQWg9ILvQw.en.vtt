and I think that creating incentives
like<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.430> prevention<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:42.600> wellness

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
like that for prevention for wellness

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.900 
like that for prevention for wellness
creating<00:00:44.910> cash<00:00:45.149> incentives<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.960> people<00:00:46.110> who

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
creating cash incentives for people who

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.549 
creating cash incentives for people who
wear<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> shows<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.539> they're<00:00:48.899> saving<00:00:49.320> money<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
wear it shows up they're saving money on

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.170 
wear it shows up they're saving money on
their<00:00:49.770> health<00:00:49.950> insurance<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
their health insurance because of it I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.580 
their health insurance because of it I
think<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.840> something<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.260> should<00:00:52.410> be

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
Republicans engaged and involved in this

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.810 
Republicans engaged and involved in this
process<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.900> think<00:02:49.260> early<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:50.040> decision<00:02:50.520> was

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
process I think early on a decision was

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.630 
process I think early on a decision was
made<00:02:51.060> by<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.990> Republican<00:02:52.890> leadership<00:02:53.220> that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
made by the Republican leadership that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.790 
made by the Republican leadership that
said<00:02:53.970> look<00:02:54.600> let's<00:02:54.960> not<00:02:55.110> give<00:02:55.380> him<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> victory

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
said look let's not give him a victory

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.400 
said look let's not give him a victory
maybe<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> replay<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.410> 1993-94

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
maybe we can have a replay of 1993-94

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.680 
maybe we can have a replay of 1993-94
when<00:02:58.710> Clinton<00:02:59.070> came<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.460> he<00:02:59.940> failed<00:03:00.240> on<00:03:00.480> health

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
when Clinton came in he failed on health

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.930 
when Clinton came in he failed on health
care<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:00.930> then<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.260> won<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.610> midterm

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
care and then we won in the midterm

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.060 
care and then we won in the midterm
elections<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:03.660> got<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.050> majority<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.620> I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
elections and we got the majority and I

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.740 
elections and we got the majority and I
think<00:03:05.310> there's<00:03:05.550> some<00:03:06.060> folks<00:03:06.270> who<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.540> taking
