00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 observe how the flow is happening 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.980
 of workers who arrive daily 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.050
 the hotel industry and the industry

 of the construction who are 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 having to choose to walk to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.420
 to be able to reach their work centers 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.420
 where are you going to work 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.900
 from cancún or from fortune 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.070

 we are seeing the flow of workers 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.100
 of the construction that apparently good 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:18.550
 they came in other vehicles and that given the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.560
 fact that occurred on this road 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.479
 federal have had to walk and 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.480
 look for a means of transport to 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.320
 get to their jobs 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.930
 this situation is unusual had not been 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.620
 presented in the history of the past 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.550
 20 years 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.100
 in this in this tourist destination 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.570
 We will continue to see the arrival of 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.080
 some government officials from the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.930
 state that are assessing the damages 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.590
 to make the situation known something 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.619
 particular that we can observe is that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.609
 of water there seems to be water 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.700
 sine that I was in this area that did 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:07.810
 that little by little he left the traveling he 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.110
 and what is the federal highway 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.620
 the estimated width of this of this 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 collapse is 30 meters and there is an area 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.520
 more than 3 meters deep that 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.080
 it's good doing a little bit less towards
