about the newly named animatronic

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.080 
about the newly named animatronic
spring-trap<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:11.099> before<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.490> get<00:00:11.550> into<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.969> if

number one
Scott<00:00:20.789> refers<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.600> new<00:00:21.779> animatronic<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.650> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
Scott refers to the new animatronic as a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.220 
Scott refers to the new animatronic as a
heat<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.310> shown<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.480> indefinitely

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
heat as shown here this indefinitely

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.950 
heat as shown here this indefinitely
confirms<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> spring-trap<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> male<00:00:27.150> this

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
confirms that spring-trap is a male this

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.830 
confirms that spring-trap is a male this
could<00:00:28.260> link<00:00:28.500> back<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.250> purple<00:00:29.640> guy<00:00:29.910> as

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
could link back to the purple guy as

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.229 
could link back to the purple guy as
some<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> writing<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.669> five<00:00:33.210> nights

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
some of the writing in the five nights

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.690 
some of the writing in the five nights
at<00:00:33.570> Freddy's<00:00:33.809> 3<00:00:33.840> trailer<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.469> purple<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
at Freddy's 3 trailer is purple which a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
at Freddy's 3 trailer is purple which a
lot<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> people<00:00:36.210> assume<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
lot of people assume is to do with the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.500 
lot of people assume is to do with the
purple<00:00:37.710> guy<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.489> guess<00:00:38.940> we'll<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
purple guy I guess we'll just have to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270 
purple guy I guess we'll just have to
find<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.200> five<00:00:40.469> nights<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.950> Freddy's<00:00:41.250> 3

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
find out when five nights at Freddy's 3

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.660 
find out when five nights at Freddy's 3
is<00:00:41.700> released<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:43.350> number<00:00:43.590> two<00:00:43.770> as<00:00:44.010> shown<00:00:44.399> here

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
is released for number two as shown here

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.569 
is released for number two as shown here
spring-trap<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.780> five<00:00:46.170> opposable<00:00:46.860> fingers

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
spring-trap as five opposable fingers

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
spring-trap as five opposable fingers
you<00:00:47.789> know<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.090> human<00:00:48.570> fingers<00:00:48.989> which<00:00:49.530> is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you know like human fingers which is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
you know like human fingers which is
different<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> all<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> other<00:00:50.610> animatronics

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
different to all the other animatronics

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.049 
different to all the other animatronics
as<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:51.719> only<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.289> four<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:53.039> Freddy<00:00:53.610> shown

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
as they only have four like Freddy shown

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.330 
as they only have four like Freddy shown
here<00:00:54.360> again<00:00:55.199> setting<00:00:55.590> him<00:00:55.710> apart<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
here again setting him apart from the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
here again setting him apart from the
animatronics<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.660> could<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.079> linked<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
animatronics this could be linked to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.560 
animatronics this could be linked to
something<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> game<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.760> spring-trap

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
something in the game that spring-trap

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.660 
something in the game that spring-trap
doors<00:01:00.870> who<00:01:01.079> knows<00:01:01.350> let<00:01:02.219> me<00:01:02.309> know<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
doors who knows let me know what you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.189 
doors who knows let me know what you
think<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> comments<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.600> again<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.019> guess

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
think in the comments and again I guess

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.690 
think in the comments and again I guess
we'll<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> wait<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.250> until

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
we'll just have to wait and see until

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.660 
we'll just have to wait and see until
until<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> game's<00:01:06.869> released<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:08.430> number

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
until the game's released now number

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.130 
until the game's released now number
three<00:01:08.880> come<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> steam<00:01:09.689> greenlight

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
three come from the steam greenlight

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
three come from the steam greenlight
page<00:01:10.409> where<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> says<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.850> remarkable

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
page where it says a remarkable

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.230

discovery<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:13.290> made<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:14.369> supports<00:01:15.060> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
discovery was made this supports and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.300 
discovery was made this supports and
basically<00:01:15.509> means<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.229> spring-trap<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
basically means that spring-trap was in

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
basically means that spring-trap was in
the<00:01:17.430> previous<00:01:17.880> two<00:01:18.060> games<00:01:18.360> however<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:19.259> didn't

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the previous two games however we didn't

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.130 
the previous two games however we didn't
see<00:01:19.710> him<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.310> maybe<00:01:20.670> he<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.970> hidden<00:01:21.180> many

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
see him because maybe he was hidden many

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
see him because maybe he was hidden many
people<00:01:22.590> including<00:01:22.740> me<00:01:23.250> believe<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.790> he's

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
people including me believe that he's
