00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.429
 hello I'm a little bit sad for the context 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.130
 % and I know it's facebook a great way to get more and more 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.270
 of women but on the quality of the editorial content but also the games 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.789
 competitor contest that it works from the fire of god 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.760
 I believe that good quick simple solutions 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.140
 and the supermarket besides to offer us here the peaceful and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.439
 democratic 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.019
 for this gift that challenges a little in e3 as has been repeated with a platform 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.300
 automated to recreate a quiz at once on facebook on 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
 his website overweight the mobile 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.820
 so still less than five sites appeared can be done aqmi fired at 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.130
 fate to his recent winning commitment it is at his request no skill 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.020
 of development no technical skill a chart that is to say that 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.950
 even though we have no knowledge lanterns of traffic dressing 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.690
 we can not be simply answer 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.210
 to fill in all the data and information that is related to 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.180
 your contests and that by just a little click aided m an image why at the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.980
 mobile version the version very much like the version the facebook makes the three 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.860
 we do 3 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.040
 once and that does not require that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.250
 a work solution that's quite it can 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.130
 for me we really and if the other two design a platform that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.240
 be quick el-fassi isaf for any man 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 a profiler and still from a legal point of view we also manage the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 settlement deposit doubt to be legal both% with the legislation 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.800
 French confess loop all and generate been automated on the 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.409
 platform and all this in less than two a few clicks and heart - a 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.140
 afternoon big maximum the contest game can be the effect is 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.859
 unfurled sweat at his facebook fan page or on his canvases in two words game 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.330
 fills him some songs for 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.600
 present staffing 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.260
 whose mechanics of the game 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.270
 and behind that me 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.500
 designer and generates an application an application against a settlement a 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.790
 regulation quite 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.319
 who validates it only 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.669
 for us it is a usher who is a partner so he comes to connect to 

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:03.549
 the platform pieroni he makes a comment or not and if not ben spies 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.320
 validating takes a click 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.640
 and after purse to children's clothes 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.379
 It takes a lot of time 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.109
 so for me an example if you discover the bandages platform a 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.220
 afternoon you will write all the ways of operation 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.919
 and if after all you are 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.179
 I regularly understand that it can be done in less 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.979
 of one hour 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.339
 it is thanks to precise links and me the question of the cost of the rigged image 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.399
 and what a relationship you have done a lot of collaborative work 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:34.079
 with an amendment contact with a so the facebook part dublin 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.120
 because many have given up having to keep up to date even a constant on 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.199
 the cj the technical changes and all the innovations that are going on 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.519
 in order to appear in the net 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.760
 okay so we're sure the contest sets up wiggins of arak 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.399
 he will conform to the subject of facebook cegeps 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.520
 it's a body 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.680
 because an example just show other examples percent right now 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.910
 there is an e to any contest for an American film festival of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.799
 deauville 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.010
 % we also have another example a contest on the rap the sites the parade 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.619
 class for back to school 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.999
 you can earn% all that is up to 2000 euros worth of vouchers for 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.889
 an effect of shopping in laval 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.069
 % we also have all that can be these works related to this suffering 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.619
 of hockey won the last so the phone galaxy by the galaxy 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.299
 percent s 2 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.329
 % and to predict 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.899
 as you go 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.289
 maybe we have almost nothing to do if I found myself thinking about 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:34.989
 good idea of ​​the congo where he concurs 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.349
 then patrick 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.379
 Mount Ellis 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.659
 so w as city is self-service in question is the point as 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.379
 that's context ap the dot com ap in most question you just have 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.650
 admits to register a lot of good by getting up with facebook or in 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.919
 completing the form and after the student platform 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.299
