00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.809
 hi how about friends in this video 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.250
 I'll teach you how to make a club 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:18.340
 be able to weld lead tin into steel steel 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.240
 stainless the manufacturing process is 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.029
 very easy 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 all we need is oxide of 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.340
 zinc 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.340
 what is that white powder 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.980
 and muriatic acid 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.839
 or hydrochloric 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.559
 let's put a little in this jar 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.559
 zinc oxide 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.140
 and then he is a little 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.729
 that not only 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.220
 and we add 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.750
 the reaction that is going to generate is 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 hydrogen 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.490
 but you have to be very spatial 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.230
 depending on the quality of the acid 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.940
 let's get what is chloride 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.290
 zinc 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.290
 more water 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.910
 and small amounts of muriatic acid 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.910
 we call it reduced 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.500
 must try to 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:24.140
 get a concentrated acid 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.140
 and that I'm not very diluted with water 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.100
 you have to wait for the mixture 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 God 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.600
 to 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.910
 Y 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.799
 You can also buy what you want 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.799
 zinc chloride 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.570
 which is also a white powder 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:52.580
 and that only has it in current mix 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.580
 a liquid accepted an immediate 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.410
 at the time of doing it, you have to 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.710
 be very cautious 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.880
 I'm not wearing gloves but now 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.880
 I know the reaction 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.389
 it says in what quantities to go mixing 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.020
 we are seeing added a little bit of 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.580
 zinc oxide but this one no longer generated 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.780
 no 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.780
 not some reaction 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.520
 then our flux and it is finished 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.510
 if this is very useful for you 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.169
 please share showing your 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.710
 friends 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.730
 that can serve them 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.730
 they need this kind of ideas that 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:24.530
 it's good that 's all friends I hope you follow 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.530
 watching my videos supporting me
