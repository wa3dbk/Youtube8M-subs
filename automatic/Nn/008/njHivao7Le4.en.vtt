00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.590
 hello today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.250
 halloween pumpkin with the technique of 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.250
 papier-mache 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.670
 The materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:20.750
 newspaper paper painting a balloon cola 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.460
 white toilet paper adhesive tape a 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.460
 little boat and a brush 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.590
 we start by inflating a balloon 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.400
 then we take a few pages of newspapers 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.400
 and the others we are 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.440
 when we have a good amount 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.600
 we will start with the mixture 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.570
 we take a boat that we will not use 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.539
 more I used the bottom of a bottle and 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.539
 we put water and double the white glue 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.559
 and we stir well 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.150
 now we put something that serves as our base 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.790
 to keep the globe still 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 and we started to apply mixture of scholastic 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.730
 and water and we put pieces of paper of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.470
 Newspaper and we give it again 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.470
 mix over 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.860
 and so we will always do everything 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.860
 the balloon 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.990
 the more layers they get, the more rigid they will be 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.870
 I in this case gave him two layers of paper 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.330
 newspaper 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.330
 once we find it covered all 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.000
 we let dry until the next day and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.090
 we will begin to cover with the paper 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090
 hygienic 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.380
 and we will follow the same steps and the same 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.330
 technique than newspaper 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.750
 we apply mixtures and on top we put the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.750
 toilet paper 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.729
 I gave him three layers and I stay but 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.729
 moldable 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.049
 on the part where we inflate the globe 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.110
 we will do the tail and I did it with paper 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.080
 I crumple paper pasted 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.590
 vertically with adhesive tape by the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.239
 base and I covered it with only toilet paper 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.239
 I gave him three layers too 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.340
 we take orange paint and we start 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.340
 paint the base 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.170
 taking care not to paint the area of ​​the rabito 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.110
 that turns green once this 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.900
 all painted we let it dry and once 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.370
 dry we will paint the rabito 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.370
 take more green paint 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.720
 and we painted 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.410
 once painted and dry we draw with a 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.560
 permanent marker the face of the cove 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.560
 plus 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.159
 as you will see it is very simple to draw it 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.760
 then you can fill it with the same 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 marker or with paint that is what I 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.780
 Once it's done, it can be left 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.240
 just like that or you can turn it into a 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.240
 Now let me show you how 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.370
 with a cutter I cut his nose and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.370
 low 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.260
 and I cut the top part 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.650
 to make the lid 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.200
 when cut it will burst the balloon so 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.200
 we will take them out 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.910
 and we will be like this two pieces 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.519
 as true inside you see the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.910
 newspaper so what you can do is 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.010
 give him a layer of toilet paper or 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.090
 paint it by giving several layers of a 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.090
 more clarito orange 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.530
 at the end before putting the paper of 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.110
 tell me about yellow paint and I gave him a 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.850
 swept by all the pumpkin also the 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.540
 dark and a little bit to make it more 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.540
 terrifying 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.169
 now we will need orange crepe paper 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.779
 and yellow 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.849
 we put the yellow in the area of ​​the 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.580
 face to look like the lighting of 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.129
 the candles 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.880
 and then we put the oranges in a way 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.290
 that the corners remain outside 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.290
 and we put it well 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.520
 I put the pieces but you can 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.069
 put whatever you like 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.270
 and inside we put the bags of 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.090
 candies 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.629
 loose as you prefer and that's how the 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.629
 pumpkin 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.220
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.220
