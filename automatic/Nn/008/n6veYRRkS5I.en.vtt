00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.780
 basic ideas in the diet of 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.610
 rabbits feeding the rabbit is a 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.380
 herbivore gastric monkey that can 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.660
 eat large amounts of food 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.119
 fibrous with a transit speed 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.800
 adequate in the intestine digests 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.080
 food in the same way as others 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.180
 monogastric animals but elciego 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.950
 has a bacterial flora that ferments 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.440
 in a relatively effective way 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.989
 undigested materials and so uses 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.880
 Fermentation products rabbit 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.620
 has a very developed blind man 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.660
 by which can digest 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 fibrous components do not tie cables 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 the digestive enzymes 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480
 also optimizes the performance of the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.000
 faecal microflora merced to the cec other 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 and the fermentation of food 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.510
 produces energy for synthesis of 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.120
 Bacterial protein and fatty acids 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 volatiles that are absorbed into the blood 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 and contribute to meet the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.329
 energetic needs of the rabbit one 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.489
 of the primary functions that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.619
 performs the rabbit is the cec other fia that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.440
 allows to recycle food waste 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.110
 endogenous secretions microorganisms and 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.940
 products of microbial activity 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.159
 all this is excreted in the form of feces 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.140
 soft that the rabbit eats directly 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.450
 from the anus 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 and nutrients the nutrients in the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 food are essential for an optimal 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.290
 rabbit development the amount of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 nutrients that each food provides 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.800
 It will depend on the chemical composition of the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.560
 same nutritional requirements 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.060
 of the rabbit will depend on the stage of life 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.910
 where it is since the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.259
 needs increase or decrease 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.060
 depending on your production or 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.490
 reproduction 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.950
 types of food feeding 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.869
 traditional breeding traditional 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.299
 rabbit was based on the use of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.399
 forage resources and byproducts more or 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.560
 less complemented with other subjects 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.530
 more concentrated cereals 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.470
 legumes etc. arranged in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.240
 rakes and rudimentary feeders in 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.700
 the traditional breeding can fit several 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
 alternatives from the dough to the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.840
 presentation of raw materials in its 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.290
 traditional form of forage root or 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.300
 grain 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.490
 mixed feeding consisting of 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.530
 supply of granulated compound feed 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.780
 in hopper feeders and forage 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.360
 green or built on rakes or 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.280
 directly on the cage its only 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.650
 advantage is that it reduces expenses by 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.870
 purchase of feed but complicates the handling 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.910
 and it requires a lot more labor for 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.100
 which is rarely used and certainly 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.220
 it is impracticable in farms 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.280
 industrial type 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.590
 and feed with pelleted feed the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.930
 classic system in intensive rabbit breeding 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.060
 consists of exclusively supplying 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.890
 compound feed pellets which 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.500
 often store in silos and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.000
 distribute the animals through 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 more or less automated devices 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.170
 the composition of the feed must 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.780
 allow us to cover the needs 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.490
 nutritious and obtain good yields 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.350
 but at the same time you must ensure the 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.580
 necessary fibrous supply and avoid 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.860
 excess protein 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.780
 and the quality of each food will depend 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.240
 of the ingredients used for their 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.800
 elaboration is why the producer 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.900
 you should keep in mind that a 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.790
 High production will be carried out 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.750
 supplying good quality food 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.750
 to his rabbits
