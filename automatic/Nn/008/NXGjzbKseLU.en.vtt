00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
they were so sort of it was such a

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.010 
they were so sort of it was such a
fright<00:01:23.590> for<00:01:23.830> them<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:25.000> possible<00:01:25.510> we're

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
fright for them it's possible we're

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.230 
fright for them it's possible we're
going<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.200> send<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.890> birds<00:01:27.100> off<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.670> two

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
testing facilities where they'll do Nick

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.300 
testing facilities where they'll do Nick
off<00:01:30.940> seized<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.480> them<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:32.020> we'll<00:01:32.920> find<00:01:33.160> out

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
off seized on them and we'll find out

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.210 
off seized on them and we'll find out
exactly<00:01:33.670> what<00:01:33.880> happened<00:01:34.330> but<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.170> said<00:01:35.560> it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
exactly what happened but this said it's

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.740 
exactly what happened but this said it's
really<00:01:36.520> pointing<00:01:36.850> towards<00:01:37.150> that<00:01:37.330> right<00:01:37.510> now

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
really pointing towards that right now

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.420 
really pointing towards that right now
it<00:01:37.990> obviously<00:01:38.590> could<00:01:38.800> be<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:38.980> weather<00:01:39.220> event

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
it obviously could be a weather event

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.610 
it obviously could be a weather event
but<00:01:39.940> we're<00:01:40.690> kind<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:40.930> leaning<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.290> other<00:01:41.320> way

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
but we're kind of leaning the other way

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.800 
but we're kind of leaning the other way
in<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:42.370> was<00:01:42.550> I<00:01:42.640> mean<00:01:42.910> five<00:01:43.090> thousand<00:01:43.630> Birds

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
in this was I mean five thousand Birds

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.240 
in this was I mean five thousand Birds
that's<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.230> lot<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.500> birds<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.100> they<00:01:45.190> were

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
that's a lot of birds and they were

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.370 
that's a lot of birds and they were
scattered<00:01:45.700> across<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.210> pretty<00:01:46.630> large<00:01:46.810> area<00:01:47.290> as

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
that this isn't entirely it happens from

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.260 
that this isn't entirely it happens from
time<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.220> time<00:02:30.250> although<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.820> is<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> big<00:02:31.180> one

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
time to time although this is a big one

what are the different reasons for a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.640 
what are the different reasons for a
fish<00:02:32.800> kill<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.459> well<00:02:34.470> most<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.560> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
fish kill like this well most of the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.310 
fish kill like this well most of the
time<00:02:35.709> when<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.400> do<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.760> fish<00:02:37.000> kills<00:02:37.300> its<00:02:38.140> low

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
time when we do have fish kills its low

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.840 
time when we do have fish kills its low
oxygen<00:02:38.740> levels<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.080> fish<00:02:41.260> can't<00:02:41.500> breathe

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
oxygen levels the the fish can't breathe

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.840 
oxygen levels the the fish can't breathe
or<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.270> waters<00:02:43.630> too<00:02:43.959> warm<00:02:44.170> for<00:02:44.590> our<00:02:44.860> trout<00:02:45.190> but

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
or the waters too warm for our trout but

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.240 
or the waters too warm for our trout but
they're<00:02:46.030> usually<00:02:46.209> really<00:02:46.570> small<00:02:47.250> sometimes

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
they're usually really small sometimes

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.990 
they're usually really small sometimes
we<00:02:48.580> do<00:02:48.730> have<00:02:48.910> diseases<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:51.700> will<00:02:51.820> kill

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
we do have diseases that that will kill

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.970 
we do have diseases that that will kill
fish<00:02:52.269> but<00:02:52.510> they're<00:02:52.630> usually<00:02:52.660> very<00:02:52.989> small<00:02:53.440> this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
fish but they're usually very small this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.610 
fish but they're usually very small this
was<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.190> pretty<00:02:54.459> wide<00:02:55.209> area<00:02:55.600> about<00:02:55.780> 20<00:02:56.140> miles<00:02:56.320> of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
was a pretty wide area about 20 miles of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.979 
was a pretty wide area about 20 miles of
the<00:02:56.709> Arkansas<00:02:57.100> River<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.450> was<00:02:58.540> only<00:02:58.660> one

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
the Arkansas River but it was only one

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.920 
the Arkansas River but it was only one
species<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.530> fish<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.820> feel<00:03:01.330> like<00:03:01.540> that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
species of fish so we feel like that

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.960 
species of fish so we feel like that
will<00:03:02.440> narrow<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.860> down<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.070> some<00:03:03.459> kind<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.850> a

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
will narrow it down to some kind of a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.330 
will narrow it down to some kind of a
disease<00:03:04.330> what<00:03:05.080> are<00:03:05.170> people<00:03:05.470> in<00:03:05.560> Arkansas<00:03:05.830> same

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
disease what are people in Arkansas same

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.400 
disease what are people in Arkansas same
there<00:03:06.580> Keith<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:07.030> mean<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.110> kind<00:03:08.320> of
