00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.370 

predictably<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.330> was<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.510> step<00:04:40.870> too<00:04:40.900> far<00:04:41.110> for

Aris and traditionally Greek teams don't
travel<00:04:44.350> too<00:04:44.620> well<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:45.160> it<00:04:45.639> was<00:04:45.789> always<00:04:45.970> going

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
travel too well so it was always going

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:57.719 
travel too well so it was always going
to<00:04:46.360> be<00:04:56.070> experience<00:04:57.070> coming<00:04:57.280> here<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.639> the
