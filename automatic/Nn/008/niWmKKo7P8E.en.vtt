00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.179
 hello and welcome my name 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.579
 is important today I'll show you that 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.230
 easter egg on the new examiner break 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.150
 with the designation miss game over 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.860
 I played it all in live 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.840
 stream played in four player mode 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.390
 i have with his ex cuddle and zombie 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
 slayers and yes it is up to you if 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.390
 you make it four and have four 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.260
 Animal fun made that is too 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 sophisticated 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.129
 but you can also in the single in two 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.999
 or three player modes do that 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.679
 is up to you 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.480
 In any case, step one is number one 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.199
 It's a black box from the beginning 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.670
 to take room 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.079
 I do not know if this is a battery 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.370
 should or whatever the end 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 definitely a black box could you 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.460
 you also have to see them now 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.140
 here in the morgue to the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.609
 bring computer simply print and ex 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.269
 then the box appears next to it and one 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.269
 voice says 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 we have to release the security and 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.449
 raffi badges change but first 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 we have to find our identify four 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 we started with kahns out of white 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 how you do that is up to you 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.009
 There is no exact order how to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.990
 that must do 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.670
 for kans ID you have so long 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 play in an infected so far 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 round since this yes, mostly eight round 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.380
 or nine and I'll give you a tip 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.000
 kill all infected except for 23 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.410
 and let you live and do this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.240
 then walked away completely because you have to 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.119
 be infected and if you get infected 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.399
 since every player of you has to do one like that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.899
 press a switch 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.729
 that the only important thing is a player 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.009
 can press a switch in the four 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.330
 player mode in single player must 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.979
 of course a player all turn around 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.479
 Two players must each two 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.200
 make in the three players must have one 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.729
 make more yes here are the switches 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.800
 As I said, it is very important everyone 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.039
 players only a switch and the 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.729
 last switch was up here here 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.729
 we are already infected 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.929
 yes as I said if you are little infected 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.179
 then it's easiest to go here 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.619
 I had been infected for a while now because 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.959
 we left what I have 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.220
 press my switch so i was 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.810
 I think so too are the last ones now 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.700
 all ready and you can do this here 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.500
 take away card but that can 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.510
 Of course only can take away so you have to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.450
 there can see vulcano four yes 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.000
 it continues with his ID for it 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.120
 all four players need the extra ex 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 slam and a weapon so you should 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.080
 be armed because you have to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.360
 here in this room on one on one 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.800
 Pistons shoot four players mode 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 it takes a bit longer 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.580
 solo, the team is not easy yes you 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.800
 need here so long suggests to 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.129
 the piston until he disappears 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.140
 and then probably the last step 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.430
 that you have installed here so this one 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.959
 Stepping in has me something like that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.560
 annoying that was no more 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.269
 normal because you have to be so meticulous 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.390
 at the same time do everything and the 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.769
 just annoying so in the single player 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.209
 this step is much easier here 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.920
 and you have to jump up now 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.660
 and all four players have to 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.730
 at the same time an exo slam down here 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.620
 do it and that's as good as 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.960
 impossible 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.190
 that was really the right time we cost 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.150
 have not really sat there but forever 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.590
 then we finally made it 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.870
 have given us next to each other 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.060
 jumped high jumped on it and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.330
 then came here to take this box yard 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.260
 could rust his keycard next to it 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.030
 This step really annoyed me 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.110
 I'm really crazy 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.850
 because you are so meticulous 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.590
 has to be at the same time has one 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.890
 a little annoyed on we go with the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.420
 key card from lilly lly fse badge is 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.180
 by far the easiest for it 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.130
 you only need the m1 laser weapon measures 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.319
 pay 1000 points to 3d print ag 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.720
 and shoot on it then appears already 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.000
 the identity card they can also see the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.610
 cannes ran now and so yes 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.069
 So that's what she had her card on 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.950
 let 's go with the kiekert von decker year 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.750
 You also have to go to decca if you are in four 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.370
 Player mode is must have two players 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.860
 at the same time the trash cans operate it 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.660
 There are two extra room and an extra 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.730
 one near the beginning of the room 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.720
 they must be pressed simultaneously 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.520
 then you come here in this 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.180
 Incinerator I just would 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.459
 say it's such a garbage 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.330
 incineration room and here you have to 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.090
 shoot the ground 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.590
 it does not necessarily have to work out 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.600
 The first time worked out here 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.970
 what else with the marriage mainz tries if 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.400
 you do not have to load it I have to press 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.660
 all the time iks along with me 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.130
 when the kicker gets out of the ground 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.150
 I would pick it up 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.979
 that would not work so well 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.289
 and now I try the whole thing with the 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.130
 sc 3 i dont know how to change you 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.750
 to pronounce 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.849
 because this is also in the boat I can 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.729
 shoot permanently and one will always 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.590
 it's pretty cool 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.060
 almost like the m1 I need 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.440
 actually not to load and 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.870
 hereby I then I managed to have 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.130
 shot on the ground and then had 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.560
 I can see the map now 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.930
 Yes, that was what I think after that 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.120
 third time I got her and 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.650
 so we all have kitas yes now 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.240
 All four players have to be that long 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.340
 kill zombies and over the corpses 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.099
 run until you all have a 49 on yours 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.479
 this card can take a bit of time in 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.550
 claim if you play with four 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.830
 but it is not difficult anyway 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.300
 if we did that you have to do yours 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.470
 security release 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.360
 and for that you have to go to this 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.710
 Fingerscanner will go the first 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.590
 finger scanner here near by 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.099
 At first there is room for a boat there can be nothing 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.190
 to press 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.539
 the second finger scanner is nearby 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.400
 So the mortuary is in the 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.009
 Leichenhalle that's here you can 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.240
 also just see who is here for liv 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.389
 has to press the latics 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.759
 the third is for decker who is in 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.860
 expo room near the ex dream 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:39.539
 you just have to go up the stairs 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.520
 go up here next to the credit 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.449
 vending machines here is mine 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.060
 I was decker and the last one 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.490
 Fingerscanner is next to keeps so next to 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.900
 i believe in healing 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.460
 German 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.870
 next to the healing machine yes that is 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.909
 here is the last one for out and about 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.430
 if you did that then you are 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.830
 yes already as good as finished now 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.990
 you just go to the mortuary 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.719
 go back to the computer and also 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.020
 press again and then one speaks 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.020
 voice 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.229
 electricity in the exo test facility 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.509
 Restored yes that means you should 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.740
 to the exotics 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:36.449
 we are now in four player mode 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.979
 That's why we all have four 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.500
 hired here i dont know if it is 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.120
 is enough if it makes a single one 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.080
 In any case you have to go to ex 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.150
 to press 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:54.810
 and if everything was right then say 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:56.759
 a voice caution vehicle 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.389
 yes, that's how he explains himself 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.310
 the end 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.870
 Now all four players can still be in 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.060
 walk and watch the room at the beginning 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.949
 how the submarine arrived that was 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.069
 the easter egg gets you 50 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:11.430
 the games choir miss game over has solved that 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.990
 all the noa of the curious link 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.219
 also in the video description pretty much 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.840
 cool the guy has about 17 hours 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:18.180
 pulled through to solve the whole 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.009
 here you can see now how such 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.509
 the helicopter is shot down and 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:24.210
 now you get already the success 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:28.500
 yes I have to say so for the first ex combo 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:31.770
 was not cool right now 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.150
 so difficult to do that though 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.219
 I think so 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.690
 difficult as I said I have nothing 

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:38.460
 more to do that was the noa the in 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.319
 I hope you enjoy this 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.650
 again, when chilling and skin 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:42.650
 purely
