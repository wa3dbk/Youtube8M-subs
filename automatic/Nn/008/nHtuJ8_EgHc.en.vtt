00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.100
 while I was following the money I realized 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.109
 that almost all the ideas I had 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.109
 about capital are not true 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.220
 It is curious the fact that we 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.770
 we pose very few questions about 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.900
 everyday things like for example when 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.930
 we go to a bank and we ask for a loan 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.210
 of say 50 mentors or 50,000 pounds 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.730
 what's really happening, let's see a lot 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.740
 people live life based on some 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.440
 ideas that are far from reality 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.870
 what really happens is that if you ask 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.149
 50,000 pounds write that in your account 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 there are 50,000 pounds that's all that 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.829
 They do not mint coins or print 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.609
 tickets do not use any metal 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.890
 beautiful 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.019
 simply write on a screen 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.620
 computer that your account has 50,000 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.719
 pounds way from my man 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.280
 from that moment you start paying 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.889
 interests on a quantity of money 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.470
 that has never existed that does not exist and 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.870
 that will not exist 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.060
 It turns out that banks lend 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.160
 nine times more money than the amount 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.020
 that they actually keep in their cameras and 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.140
 this is possible thanks to the loan 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.730
 known as fractional reserve 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.590
 works in the following way to the 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.780
 federal reserve or the central bank of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.640
 any country is allowed to determine 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.240
 the amount of money that a bank should 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.250
 have in their reserves in the USA now 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 same is about 10% 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.900
 so if you deposit ten thousand dollars in 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.690
 the bank the bank separates the 10 by 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.880
 hundred is to say thousand dollars and then 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.650
 operates in the market with the rest for 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.630
 example now reaches another person to 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.150
 bank and asks for a loan of nine thousand 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.100
 dollars to buy a car in that 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.660
 moment the bank lends nine thousand 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.320
 dollars of the deposit that you had 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.540
 created the nine thousand dollars disappear 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.850
 then the person requesting the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.770
 loan pays the seller of the car and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.720
 he enters the amount in another bank 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.690
 that is part of the same system 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.150
 central bank these nine thousand dollars 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.640
 they are considered a new deposit and so 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.830
 the process continues on the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.509
 money is re-deposited and it becomes 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.610
 to lend until the initial deposit 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.119
 of ten thousand dollars becomes one hundred 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.119
 thousand dollars 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.349
 the banking system has just created 90 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.110
 One thousand dollars 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.070
 simply by lending the money 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.650
 apparently everything started with the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.080
 goldsmiths of the 17th century when people 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.760
 He looked to them to trade gold 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.950
 gold was too heavy to carry it from a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.750
 site to another so people started to 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.420
 save it on cameras and traded with 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.880
 receipts those receipts were the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.530
 first bills as only a few 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.630
 they withdrew their gold at moments 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.210
 determined the owners of the cameras 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.860
 basically the new bankers 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.040
 they started creating gold receipts that in 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.140
 actually they did not have then they lent 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.690
 those receipts and they applied them 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.810
 interests to the money lent to the gold that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.650
 they did not really have that way our 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.079
 fractional reserve system 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.579
 in this system the bankers get 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.930
 make money from where there is nothing 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.200
 while the rest of us 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.760
 we have to work to earn this 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.890
 has brought about a modern way of 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.810
 servitude where the mass of society 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.140
 work to pay off your debt with the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.140
 banks
