Kakashi was going through and I feel as
though<00:00:51.989> Minato<00:00:52.620> could<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.920> probably<00:00:53.100> tried

something<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.329> different<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.750> try<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
something a bit different to try to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.689 
something a bit different to try to
comfort<00:00:55.379> his<00:00:55.530> student<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> end

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
comfort his student because at the end

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
comfort his student because at the end
of<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> day<00:00:57.000> putting<00:00:57.480> him<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> ANBU<00:00:58.500> while

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
of the day putting him in the ANBU while

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.200 
of the day putting him in the ANBU while
he<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.250> trying<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.670> his<00:00:59.760> mind<00:00:59.940> off<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
he was trying to get his mind off of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
he was trying to get his mind off of
things<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.629> guess<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.930> backfired<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.590> look

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
things I guess it backfired because look

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.039 
things I guess it backfired because look
he<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.280> went<00:01:02.670> worse<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.359> felt<00:01:03.600> worse<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
he just went worse and he felt worse and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
he just went worse and he felt worse and
so<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.559> prey<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.979> he<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.489> crazy

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so the prey would he just going crazy

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.399 
so the prey would he just going crazy
killing<00:01:06.270> people<00:01:06.540> left<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:06.900> killing

weren't<00:02:01.110> around<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.219> got<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.460> thinking

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
weren't around it really got me thinking

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
weren't around it really got me thinking
like<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.270> were<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
like you know what were they up to and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.870 
like you know what were they up to and
you<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.590> guess<00:02:04.890> we'll<00:02:05.219> probably<00:02:05.460> never

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
you know I guess we'll probably never

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.910 
you know I guess we'll probably never
know<00:02:06.030> unless<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:06.630> add<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> filler<00:02:07.290> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
know unless they add in the filler and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400 
know unless they add in the filler and
expand<00:02:08.340> upon<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:08.879> going<00:02:09.119> down

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
expand upon what was going down

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.200 
expand upon what was going down
because<00:02:09.860> I'd<00:02:09.980> always<00:02:10.130> made<00:02:10.370> me<00:02:10.460> think<00:02:10.670> yo<00:02:10.850> did

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
because I'd always made me think yo did

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.030 
because I'd always made me think yo did
they<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.570> something<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.080> do<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.380> well<00:02:12.650> with

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
they have something to do as well with

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070 
they have something to do as well with
the<00:02:13.100> QB<00:02:13.490> attack<00:02:13.760> obviously<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:14.630> because<00:02:14.840> we

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the QB attack obviously not because we

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.420 
the QB attack obviously not because we
never<00:02:15.260> got<00:02:15.380> any<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.740> in<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.280> actual

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
never got any of that in the actual

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.610 
never got any of that in the actual
series<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.450> always<00:02:17.600> left<00:02:17.870> me<00:02:17.990> thinking<00:02:18.140> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
series so it always left me thinking and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.410 
series so it always left me thinking and
this<00:02:18.860> episode<00:02:19.220> reminded<00:02:19.640> me<00:02:19.700> again<00:02:19.880> like<00:02:20.060> damn
