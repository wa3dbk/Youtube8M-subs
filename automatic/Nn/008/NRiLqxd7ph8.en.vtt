 procedure of this bracelet we are going to

 start getting mostacilla girl 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 silver about 15 centimeters 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.469
 of wounded mostacillas 102 and mostacillas 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.090
 depending on the size of the mothers 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.220
 in nylon it is cut 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.850
 a meter and a half so you do not leave 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.850
 of the story 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.020
 after we have the bracelet of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.380
 big let's insert a crystal 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.000
 swarovski 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.090
 of the color that is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090
 ah 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.490
 here the end of the first strip we can 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.950
 place a glass to prevent it from 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.800
 run the same chair and now we start 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.780
 knit from top to bottom we put 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.360
 then 3 mostacilla and we take out and the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.540
 glass of any color and we 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.190
 We return on the mostacilla on the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.730
 first many of them without touching the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.730
 crystal 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.460
 staying this way we go down again 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.490
 three notes and you are and we take out 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.450
 we do the same procedure 3 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.450
 mostacillas 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.549
 A crystal 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.760
 and we return on the first the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.349
 first mostacilla without touching the glass 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.030
 to have it like this we lower 3 little beads 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.030
 more and we take out 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.590
 and we are staying as a kind of 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.590
 tools 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.960
 no matter what they do not also want to have 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.960
 nothing 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.800
 3 of it then you will not see 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.950
 approximately the crystals 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:54.519
 are between 35 and 36 of these little ones in 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.489
 one and only one row at the end of this 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.330
 row let's make another completely 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.700
 same 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.950
 another two and it will be like that 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.430
 eye I want to put the second one in the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.940
 second row we have to put the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.100
 needle on glass number 10 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.910
 on the mostacilla 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.760
 on the one cap and we give back 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.570
 just like we did with the first one and we 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.340
 there are two centuries left 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.190
 we have a thread but no one nor what 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.500
 the other and we start sewing the second and 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.030
 in that and that same procedure what 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.670
 we do for the third one because if we do not 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.360
 will be seeing the nylon already when 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.240
 we have the bracelet 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.509
 we do not have the three rows we're going to 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.250
 braid here we start making a 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.250
 plait of the normalistas 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.139
 to our bracelet 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.210
 and we removed the crystals that 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.819
 we put at the end 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.819
 in nylon cut a little 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.280
 and we make the beginning again 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.229
 we place a crystal of the color that 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:34.500
 we want it to be by all the lines that 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:37.139
 we were left after the glass 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.389
 stage 1 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.180
 in this we do not put the mostacilla 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.600
 because it is impossible that we have corridor 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.210
 per tunnel 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.660
 in nylon 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.129
 and we place 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.099
 chin 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.490
 all three go for all the children that 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.460
 we have spare 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.820
 here we make a nice one for more 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.380
 security 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.500
 if we press for chin 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.860
 for what 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.000
 we cut what we have left 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.590
 the last 2 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.660
 and we close the lid none 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:21.200
 at the end of the day 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:24.820
 The tap often placed a gold title 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.820
 or the brooch of your choice 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.410
 to which place a alcoyano 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.350
 these rings do not go black 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.440
 we close 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.440
 in this way our 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.690
 multicolored bracelet these are the others 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.450
 milestones brooches that we can use if 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.490

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.340

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.880
