00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
chord that's we're going to focus on in

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.870 
chord that's we're going to focus on in
terms<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.480> building<00:00:15.630> up<00:00:15.840> the<00:00:15.960> solo<00:00:16.400> but<00:00:17.400> at<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
terms of building up the solo but at the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.640 
terms of building up the solo but at the
beginning<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> solo<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.140> create<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.440> little

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
beginning of the solo to create a little

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.460 
beginning of the solo to create a little
room<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.570> we're<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> pull

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
room for all of that we're going to pull

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.560 
room for all of that we're going to pull
it<00:00:22.560> back<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.550> pentatonic<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it back and just do pentatonic for the

it back and just do pentatonic for the
first<00:00:24.779> chorus<00:00:25.230> there's<00:00:26.039> only<00:00:26.130> three<00:00:26.430> chords

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
first chorus there's only three chords

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.900 
first chorus there's only three chords
just<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.180> four<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.449> five<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.430> we<00:00:29.430> can<00:00:29.580> still

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
just one four and five and we can still

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.009 
just one four and five and we can still
do<00:00:30.180> something<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> minor<00:00:30.840> pentatonic

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
do something with the minor pentatonic

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.680 
do something with the minor pentatonic
that<00:00:31.590> deals<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> chords<00:00:32.669> by<00:00:33.210> targeting

that deals with the chords by targeting
the<00:00:33.809> root<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.140> each<00:00:34.260> chord<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.670> we

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the root of each chord so that if we

the root of each chord so that if we
play<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> basic<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> minor<00:00:37.860> pentatonic<00:00:38.190> lick

you've got some chord tones and some

you've got some chord tones and some
scale<00:03:50.250> tones<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.640> could<00:03:56.939> play<00:03:56.970> through

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
scale tones so you could play through

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.599 
scale tones so you could play through
using<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.109> different<00:03:58.379> mixolydian<00:03:58.709> scale<00:03:58.890> for

using a different mixolydian scale for

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
each chord and finally this suspended

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.440 
each chord and finally this suspended
sound<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.680> also<00:04:04.889> be<00:04:05.190> arrived<00:04:05.609> at<00:04:05.819> doing<00:04:06.359> this

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
sound can also be arrived at doing this

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.920 
sound can also be arrived at doing this
kind<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:07.250> that's<00:04:08.629> kind<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:11.930> little

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
kind of that's kind of a little

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.349 
kind of that's kind of a little
convoluted<00:04:13.319> but<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.739> makes<00:04:13.920> sense<00:04:14.299> once<00:04:15.299> you

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
convoluted but it makes sense once you

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.300 
convoluted but it makes sense once you
played<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> few<00:04:16.500> times<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.919> heard<00:04:17.070> what<00:04:17.220> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
played it a few times and heard what it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.330 
played it a few times and heard what it
does<00:04:17.489> if<00:04:17.760> you're<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.449> an<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.780> chord<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:20.010> you

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
does if you're on an a chord and you

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.210 
does if you're on an a chord and you
want<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.579> get<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.760> sound<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.120> an<00:04:21.209> ace<00:04:21.600> us<00:04:22.220> you

want to get the sound of an ace us you

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.219 
want to get the sound of an ace us you
can<00:04:23.370> start<00:04:23.699> by<00:04:23.789> playing<00:04:24.530> going<00:04:25.530> up<00:04:25.650> five<00:04:27.229> scale

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
can start by playing going up five scale

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.930 
can start by playing going up five scale
steps<00:04:28.910> from<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.090> root

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
steps from the root

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.080 
steps from the root
start<00:04:32.900> on<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.080> note<00:04:33.320> which<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.590> e<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.100> play

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
start on that note which is e and play

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:43.930 
start on that note which is e and play
an<00:04:35.480> E<00:04:36.260> minor<00:04:36.530> 7<00:04:37.010> chord<00:04:37.930> new<00:04:38.930> minor<00:04:39.110> 7<00:04:39.440> arpeggio

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.740 

and<00:04:44.270> then<00:04:44.810> resolve<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.620> third<00:04:46.630> what<00:04:47.630> that

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
and then resolve to the third what that

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.250 
and then resolve to the third what that
does<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:47.990> it<00:04:48.200> spells<00:04:48.590> out<00:04:48.770> an<00:04:49.040> E<00:04:49.220> minor<00:04:49.340> 7<00:04:49.520> chord

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
does is it spells out an E minor 7 chord

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260 
does is it spells out an E minor 7 chord
or<00:04:51.260> it's<00:04:51.800> also<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.220> arpeggio<00:04:52.490> that<00:04:52.790> goes<00:04:52.970> with

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
or it's also the arpeggio that goes with

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.990 
or it's also the arpeggio that goes with
an<00:04:53.510> E<00:04:54.200> Dorian<00:04:54.740> scale

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.710 

and<00:05:00.330> then<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.690> can<00:05:00.810> resolve<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.610> third

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
and then you can resolve it to the third

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.300 
and then you can resolve it to the third
of<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.840> a7<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.470> it's<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:04.800> playing<00:05:05.130> the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
of the a7 so it's just like playing the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.960 
of the a7 so it's just like playing the
chord<00:05:05.640> an<00:05:06.360> ace<00:05:06.630> escort<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.470> resolving<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.190> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
chord an ace escort and resolving it the

chord an ace escort and resolving it the
same<00:05:09.210> thing<00:05:09.420> will<00:05:09.540> work<00:05:09.570> on<00:05:09.960> D<00:05:10.520> go<00:05:11.520> up<00:05:11.820> five

same thing will work on D go up five

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.750 
same thing will work on D go up five
steps<00:05:12.480> d<00:05:14.630> to<00:05:15.630> an<00:05:15.750> a<00:05:15.990> note<00:05:16.260> play<00:05:16.950> an<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.220> minor<00:05:17.460> 7

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
steps d to an a note play an a minor 7

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.820 
steps d to an a note play an a minor 7
arpeggio<00:05:18.030> or<00:05:18.450> an<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.780> Dorian<00:05:19.260> scale

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.020 

and<00:05:24.230> resolve<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.410> to<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.490> third<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.880> D

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
and resolve it to the third of the D

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.810 
and resolve it to the third of the D
chord<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.540> then<00:05:28.410> on<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.650> e<00:05:28.680> coordinate<00:05:29.310> go<00:05:29.700> up

five<00:05:30.060> steps<00:05:31.940> play<00:05:32.940> a<00:05:32.970> Dorian<00:05:33.420> scale<00:05:33.570> off<00:05:33.870> of

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
five steps play a Dorian scale off of

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
five steps play a Dorian scale off of
that<00:05:34.200> note<00:05:34.860> which<00:05:35.370> is<00:05:35.610> B<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:37.320> minor<00:05:37.680> 7

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
that note which is B and minor 7

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.960 
that note which is B and minor 7
arpeggio<00:05:38.280> or<00:05:39.200> or<00:05:40.200> B<00:05:40.890> Dorian<00:05:41.220> scale<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.970> that

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
arpeggio or or B Dorian scale and that

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.020 
arpeggio or or B Dorian scale and that
will<00:05:45.120> resolve<00:05:45.450> so<00:05:46.350> playing<00:05:46.770> that<00:05:47.070> sequence<00:05:47.700> of

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
will resolve so playing that sequence of

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.890 
will resolve so playing that sequence of
a<00:05:48.710> Dorian<00:05:49.710> scale<00:05:49.980> or<00:05:50.280> pgo<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.970> fifth<00:05:51.540> up<00:05:51.750> and

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
a Dorian scale or pgo a fifth up and

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.530 
a Dorian scale or pgo a fifth up and
then<00:05:51.990> resolving<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:53.150> will<00:05:54.150> give<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.390> that

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
then resolving it will give you that

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.090 
then resolving it will give you that
sound

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.680 

you

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.690 

so<00:06:06.690> for<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.380> extended<00:06:07.680> solo<00:06:08.100> we'll<00:06:08.370> start<00:06:08.640> off

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
so for the extended solo we'll start off

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.520 
so for the extended solo we'll start off
just<00:06:09.030> with<00:06:09.180> root<00:06:09.690> targeting<00:06:11.990> then<00:06:12.990> move<00:06:13.260> on<00:06:13.410> to

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
just with root targeting then move on to

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:21.650 
just with root targeting then move on to
playing<00:06:14.600> mixolydian<00:06:15.600> scales<00:06:18.890> and<00:06:20.480> then<00:06:21.480> end

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
playing mixolydian scales and then end

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.719 
playing mixolydian scales and then end
up<00:06:21.750> playing<00:06:22.610> minor<00:06:23.610> 7<00:06:23.910> arpeggios

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.390 

that<00:06:29.729> resolve<00:06:30.139> to<00:06:31.139> the<00:06:31.560> dominant<00:06:31.949> chord<00:06:32.190> that

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
that resolve to the dominant chord that

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.409 
that resolve to the dominant chord that
you're<00:06:32.520> on<00:06:33.379> so<00:06:34.379> we'll<00:06:34.620> do<00:06:34.770> each<00:06:35.669> chorus<00:06:36.210> will

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
you're on so we'll do each chorus will

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.029 
you're on so we'll do each chorus will
sort<00:06:36.720> of<00:06:36.780> take<00:06:36.960> it<00:06:37.050> up<00:06:37.169> another<00:06:37.319> notch<00:06:37.680> and

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
sort of take it up another notch and

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.219 
sort of take it up another notch and
then<00:06:38.639> maybe<00:06:38.819> the<00:06:39.060> end<00:06:39.180> do<00:06:39.509> a<00:06:39.539> course<00:06:39.960> where

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
then maybe the end do a course where

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.080 
then maybe the end do a course where
anything<00:06:40.740> goes<00:06:40.770> including<00:06:41.520> maybe<00:06:41.669> some<00:06:41.849> open

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
anything goes including maybe some open

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.219 
anything goes including maybe some open
strings<00:06:42.389> and<00:06:42.659> going<00:06:42.840> back<00:06:42.960> to<00:06:42.990> some

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
strings and going back to some

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.890 
strings and going back to some
pentatonic<00:06:43.770> so<00:06:44.699> let's<00:06:45.449> put<00:06:45.629> all<00:06:45.780> that

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
pentatonic so let's put all that

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.280 
pentatonic so let's put all that
together<00:06:46.050> into<00:06:46.500> an<00:06:46.590> extended<00:06:46.830> solo
