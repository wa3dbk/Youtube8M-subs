00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 what does that mean for germany if 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.500
 Brazil , you shock me 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.660
 the team now or it is 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.360
 really a shock for me is clear 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.020
 The chances are for Germany 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.600
 gone up 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.600
 not only because of new but of course 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 also because of thiago silva the real one 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.359
 right defender is and I think 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.210
 that you can see it clearly in the game 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.149
 has seen that the brazilians over 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.000
 So they fit in first 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.950
 half a tempo that they played 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 could not hold after 55 minutes 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.190
 I said, there's something about it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.070
 that always has more 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.300
 the 2 1 was the logical consequence of the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610
 could no longer have a ball in midfield 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 they do not have the game 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.879
 can determine more 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.379
 and I'll tell you when the scolari 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.610
 that can not stop then we have 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.100
 anyway a chance and just needs 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.930
 play patiently and wait until tired 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.460
 are and then the crucial ones 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.630
 to look for the decisive appearance 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.680
 but the point that nena could fall 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.960
 even an advantage 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.750
 a small advantage for brazil 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.900
 because they are closer together, of course 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.060
 missing this genius but I believe that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.510
 you as a team a reaction 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.220
 develop 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.229
 but I do not think that it 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.810
 Participants will be replaced by one 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.800
 single player or must is that 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.900
 do collectively as you say so nicely 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.370
 Italy of this category are not from 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 to replace others that would be yes 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.060
 mean that the brazilians are still three 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.080
 others would have been sitting on the bench 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.250
 you can see in the storm, too 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.619
 fred since before should be the best 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.280
 be a brazilian striker 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.190
 that's a bit 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.190
 scary then rather no than that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.619
 given jointly and 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.729
 do any political things 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.310
 but hopefully finally comes the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.990
 second follows say so 60 or so hope 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.580
 he already smiles more 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.410
 a bit not that just on 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.810
 tuesday is right twice 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.759
 That's why I think that's it 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.050
 only that goes collectively and 1 think so 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.819
 the most important thing for our team 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.319
 will pay to go into this game to 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.840
 to know what is going on in the environment 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.880
 So this stadium if so 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.590
 because what you like many spectators in belo 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.870
 horizons in the stadium grasp what is there for 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.910
 will be an emotionality and there 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.500
 Keep your cool at this pace 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.300
 what the brazilians will do 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.760
 how they did that in all games 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.590
 I have to prepare for it 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.420
 believe this is the key at the end of the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.760
 brazilian first time to run empty 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.250
 as well as the dieter has to punish 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.690
 then just about that over the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.819
 in addition to game play 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.800
 would like to come back to that 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.140
 for that the player takes over into conversation 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.340
 threw namely the name of jago the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.099
 most important defender of the locked 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.349
 is now deep into the cellar 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.030
 this is not the case of bavaria munchen 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.040
 equivalent replacement no I believe 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.080
 not so tiago we have seen that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.700
 is a leader who stands in the back 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.260
 71 percent of his battles won 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.390
 this is the best brazilian in 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.069
 puncto fight leads the band 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.780
 he has a great charisma 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.700
 I think it was the dumbest yellow 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.390
 map of the wm we saw there 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.569
 as he then the goalkeeper at 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.080
 you want to block the tee 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.080
 do not replace
