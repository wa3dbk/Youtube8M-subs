 generous 13 megapixel camera 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.350

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.570

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.150
 tiny 2 megapixel and both with 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.830

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.980

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.790

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.170
 at the software level it comes with living 4.1 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.240
 and the manufacturer has also integrated a 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.729
 sort of shortcut that 's here 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.120
 where you can access four buttons 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.800
 direct 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.020
 that button can be moved as we want 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.680
 and we can place it in the place that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.680
 we like it 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.630

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.630
 and the truth is that it feels very good in 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.030
 hands so good this is the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.760
