little cool Jack skeleton print using
Rao<00:00:06.029> charge<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:07.220> glow-in-the-dark<00:00:08.220> ink<00:00:08.610> so

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
Rao charge and glow-in-the-dark ink so

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.540 
Rao charge and glow-in-the-dark ink so
Rao<00:00:09.870> charges<00:00:10.349> ink<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.099> actually<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
Rao charges ink that actually is a

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.690 
Rao charges ink that actually is a
plastisol<00:00:12.360> hybrid<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.500> an<00:00:13.620> emulsion<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
plastisol hybrid with an emulsion so the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.369 
plastisol hybrid with an emulsion so the
Rio<00:00:14.880> charge<00:00:15.210> mixes<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:15.990> any<00:00:16.170> color

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
Rio charge mixes in with any color

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.080 
Rio charge mixes in with any color
plastisol<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.460> we're<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.699> try<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.940> out

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
plastisol and we're going to try it out

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.580 
plastisol and we're going to try it out
with<00:00:18.330> plastics<00:00:19.109> all<00:00:19.199> glow-in-the-dark

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
with plastics all glow-in-the-dark

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.349 
with plastics all glow-in-the-dark
glow-in-the-dark<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> phosphorescent

glow-in-the-dark as a phosphorescent
agent<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.830> pigment<00:00:22.830> mixed<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
agent or a pigment mixed into it so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
agent or a pigment mixed into it so
basically<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.080> see<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> shirt<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.650> the

light it kind of looks like you know an
off-white<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.500> right

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
off-white like you see in the can right

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.019 
off-white like you see in the can right
there<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.039> when<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> dark<00:00:29.820> it

there but when you see it in the dark it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.359 
there but when you see it in the dark it
glows<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:30.840> bright<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.679> gets<00:00:31.859> charged<00:00:32.219> up

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
glows really bright it gets charged up

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.040 
glows really bright it gets charged up
by<00:00:32.489> light<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.910> then<00:00:33.149> glows<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.660> dark<00:00:33.719> so

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
by light and then glows in the dark so

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.209 
by light and then glows in the dark so
it's<00:00:34.170> awesome<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.860> sorts<00:00:35.190> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
it's awesome for all sorts of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.910 
it's awesome for all sorts of
applications<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.290> with<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> route<00:00:37.590> charge

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
applications and with the route charge

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.020 
applications and with the route charge
we're<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.309> how<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.850> really

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
we're going to see how it like really

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.639 
we're going to see how it like really
gets<00:00:39.329> into<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> shirt<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> looks

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
gets into the shirt and what it looks

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.920 
gets into the shirt and what it looks
like<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> discharge<00:00:42.120> effect<00:00:42.780> because

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
like with the discharge effect because

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
like with the discharge effect because
we've<00:00:43.050> never<00:00:43.140> tried<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> before<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> first

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we've never tried that before so first

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.760 
we've never tried that before so first
of<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> mix<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> 50/50<00:00:46.620> s<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
of all we got to mix that 50/50 s the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.080 
of all we got to mix that 50/50 s the
way<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.980> Rio<00:00:47.160> charger<00:00:47.489> works<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:47.969> your

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
way we Rio charger works you take your

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360 
way we Rio charger works you take your
Rio<00:00:48.270> charge<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.110> mix<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> 50/50<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.190> any

Rio charge you mix it 50/50 with any
plastisol<00:00:51.059> inning

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
plastisol inning

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.180 
plastisol inning
so<00:00:51.840> let's<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.829> an<00:00:52.949> empty

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so let's actually we got an empty

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
so let's actually we got an empty
container<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> scale<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.320> we're

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
container on here on the scale so we're

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
container on here on the scale so we're
going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> zero<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:57.210> we're

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
going to zero that out and then we're

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.760 
going to zero that out and then we're
going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> put<00:00:58.079> we're<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> use<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
going to put we're not going to use a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.229 
going to put we're not going to use a
lot<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> ink<00:00:59.250> today<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.579> we're<00:00:59.879> just<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
lot of ink today so we're just going to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
lot of ink today so we're just going to
mix<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.570> bit<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.320> glow<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> dark<00:01:02.190> ink

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
mix a little bit of glow in the dark ink

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
mix a little bit of glow in the dark ink
glow<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> dark<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> already<00:01:03.930> pretty<00:01:04.110> runny

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
glow in the dark is already pretty runny

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.429 
glow in the dark is already pretty runny
and<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:05.820> 39<00:01:06.360> grams<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and then so that's 39 grams so that

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
and then so that's 39 grams so that
means<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> take<00:01:08.040> 40<00:01:08.549> grams<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
means we're going to take 40 grams of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.830 
means we're going to take 40 grams of
the<00:01:09.420> Rio<00:01:09.659> charge<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.820> mix<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.090> 40<00:01:12.479> grams<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the Rio charge and mix in 40 grams of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.210 
the Rio charge and mix in 40 grams of
red<00:01:13.020> jars<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.799> 80<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:15.470> /<00:01:16.470> 5050

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
red jars so we get up to 80 there / 5050

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.270 
red jars so we get up to 80 there / 5050
very<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.729> easy<00:01:17.970> mixing<00:01:18.420> instructions<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
very very easy mixing instructions and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.300 
very very easy mixing instructions and
then<00:01:20.280> we're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> mix<00:01:20.659> 5%<00:01:21.659> agent<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
then we're going to mix 5% agent so the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.060 
then we're going to mix 5% agent so the
agent<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.780> discharge<00:01:25.140> activating

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
agent is actually a discharge activating

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.890 
agent is actually a discharge activating
agent<00:01:26.780> there<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:29.509> we're<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> mix

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
agent there we go and we're going to mix

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.480 
agent there we go and we're going to mix
four<00:01:31.290> grams<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> agent<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.280> we're<00:01:32.369> going

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
four grams of the agent so we're going

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
four grams of the agent so we're going
to<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> 84<00:01:36.110> now<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to go up to 84 now this is a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.160 
to go up to 84 now this is a
formaldehyde<00:01:38.220> base<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:39.990> use

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
formaldehyde base so you do want to use

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
formaldehyde base so you do want to use
it<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> ventilated<00:01:41.100> area<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> don't<00:01:41.729> want

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
it in a ventilated area you don't want

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.319 
it in a ventilated area you don't want
to<00:01:41.970> use<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:43.170> closed<00:01:43.560> area<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> closet

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to use it in a closed area like a closet

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
to use it in a closed area like a closet
or<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.799> small<00:01:46.799> small<00:01:47.460> room<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.850> small<00:01:48.090> bedroom

or a small small room or small bedroom
open<00:01:49.170> ventilated<00:01:49.560> area<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.950> we're<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.220> today

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
open ventilated area like we're in today

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
open ventilated area like we're in today
works<00:01:51.210> great<00:01:51.750> alright<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.409> we've<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.619> five

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
works great alright so we've got five

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.710 
works great alright so we've got five
percent<00:01:53.189> agent<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:54.420> we're<00:01:54.630> going

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
percent agent in there now we're going

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
percent agent in there now we're going
to<00:01:54.780> take<00:01:55.049> our<00:01:55.290> mixing<00:01:55.890> tool<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> mix<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.030> all

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
to take our mixing tool and mix this all

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.230 
to take our mixing tool and mix this all
up<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> Rio<00:02:02.130> charge<00:02:02.490> mixes<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
up so the Rio charge mixes in with the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.749 
up so the Rio charge mixes in with the
agents<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.560> thing<00:02:04.770> about<00:02:04.950> Rao<00:02:05.189> charge<00:02:05.549> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
agents the thing about Rao charge is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029 
agents the thing about Rao charge is
that<00:02:05.909> only<00:02:06.119> lasts<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.750> couple<00:02:06.780> hours<00:02:07.170> once

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that only lasts for a couple hours once

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.800 
that only lasts for a couple hours once
you<00:02:08.220> mix<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.849> only<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.509> mix<00:02:09.660> as

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you mix it so you only want to mix as

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.889 
you mix it so you only want to mix as
much<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.349> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.560> you

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
much as you're going to be you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.960 
much as you're going to be you
so<00:02:11.650> that's<00:02:11.860> why<00:02:12.069> right<00:02:12.099> now<00:02:12.340> we<00:02:12.489> have<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> very

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
so that's why right now we have a very

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.199 
so that's why right now we have a very
small<00:02:13.390> amount<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.930> mixed<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:16.030> got

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
small amount of it mixed up and we got

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.750 
small amount of it mixed up and we got
allow<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.569> Asian<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.409> activate<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.220> about

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
allow that Asian to activate for about

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.149 
allow that Asian to activate for about
couple<00:02:19.480> two<00:02:19.750> or<00:02:19.900> three<00:02:20.110> minutes<00:02:20.319> you'll<00:02:21.069> see

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
couple two or three minutes you'll see

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.920 
couple two or three minutes you'll see
the<00:02:21.430> ink<00:02:21.580> start<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.909> bubble<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:22.360> kind<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.810> like

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
the ink start to bubble up kind of like

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.830 
the ink start to bubble up kind of like
it<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:23.440> when<00:02:24.129> it's<00:02:24.250> mixed<00:02:24.519> in<00:02:24.849> dissolved

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
it is then when it's mixed in dissolved

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080 
it is then when it's mixed in dissolved
then<00:02:26.290> we<00:02:26.409> can<00:02:26.530> go<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.680> press<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.879> we<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.060> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
then we can go to press so we have a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.490 
then we can go to press so we have a
round<00:02:28.360> charge<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.959> our<00:02:29.019> glowing<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.409> are

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
round charge and our glowing that are

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.710 
round charge and our glowing that are
mixed<00:02:29.769> up<00:02:30.010> let's<00:02:30.670> put<00:02:30.909> it<00:02:31.000> on<00:02:31.120> press<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.599> see

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
mixed up let's put it on press and see

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.280 
mixed up let's put it on press and see
what<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:31.900> get

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
what we get

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.710 
what we get
so<00:02:32.709> we've<00:02:32.860> post<00:02:33.129> hardness<00:02:33.700> using<00:02:34.090> harden<00:02:34.450> next

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
so we've post hardness using harden next

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.809 
so we've post hardness using harden next
screen<00:02:35.440> harder<00:02:35.829> because<00:02:35.980> Rauh<00:02:36.250> charge<00:02:36.640> is

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
screen harder because Rauh charge is

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.539 
screen harder because Rauh charge is
more<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.239> an<00:02:37.360> aggressive<00:02:37.599> ink<00:02:38.110> very<00:02:38.549> similar

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
more of an aggressive ink very similar

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.890 
more of an aggressive ink very similar
to<00:02:39.640> discharge<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.329> if<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.510> use<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:40.870> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
to discharge so if we use it on a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.059 
to discharge so if we use it on a
standard<00:02:41.200> emulsion<00:02:41.470> we<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.769> print<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> couple

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
standard emulsion we can print a couple

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.680 
standard emulsion we can print a couple
shirts<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.940> will<00:02:43.030> start<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.390> eat<00:02:43.540> down

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
shirts that will start to eat down

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.839 
shirts that will start to eat down
standard<00:02:44.170> emulsion<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:45.129> we'll<00:02:45.280> flood<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.760> you

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
standard emulsion so we'll flood it you

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.819 
standard emulsion so we'll flood it you
can<00:02:46.000> see<00:02:46.269> that<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.569> discharge<00:02:47.019> is<00:02:47.170> activated

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
can see that this discharge is activated

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.970 
can see that this discharge is activated
and<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.819> we'll<00:02:49.480> do<00:02:49.690> two<00:02:50.319> prints<00:02:50.769> back<00:02:51.250> flood

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
and then we'll do two prints back flood

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.229 
and then we'll do two prints back flood
make<00:02:53.980> sure<00:02:54.129> that<00:02:54.220> we<00:02:54.340> get<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.549> good<00:02:54.790> transfer

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
make sure that we get a good transfer

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.569 
make sure that we get a good transfer
there<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:59.260> there's<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.590> rau<00:02:59.739> charge<00:03:00.099> without

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
there so there's the rau charge without

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.729 
there so there's the rau charge without
being<00:03:01.060> cured<00:03:01.390> or<00:03:01.840> run<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.290> underneath<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
being cured or run that underneath the

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.149 
being cured or run that underneath the
flash<00:03:03.010> dryer<00:03:03.989> we're<00:03:04.989> using<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.560> forced<00:03:06.010> air

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
flash dryer we're using a forced air

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.610 
flash dryer we're using a forced air
flash<00:03:06.459> dryer<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.480> cure<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> ink<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.260> can

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
flash dryer to cure the ink and you can

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.979 
flash dryer to cure the ink and you can
actually<00:03:08.829> see<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:10.150> discharge<00:03:10.720> process

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
actually see the discharge process

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.990 
actually see the discharge process
happening<00:03:11.799> right<00:03:11.950> now<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:14.319> can<00:03:14.440> see<00:03:14.709> that

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
happening right now so you can see that

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.129 
happening right now so you can see that
discharge<00:03:16.000> effect<00:03:16.359> starting<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.810> take<00:03:16.930> place

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
discharge effect starting to take place

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.430 
discharge effect starting to take place
as<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.440> shirts<00:03:17.769> heating<00:03:18.160> up<00:03:18.900> there<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:20.049> go<00:03:20.200> as

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
as the shirts heating up there we go as

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.800 
as the shirts heating up there we go as
it<00:03:20.680> basically<00:03:21.370> gets<00:03:21.700> looked<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.120> unwed<00:03:22.569> look

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
it basically gets looked the unwed look

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.349 
it basically gets looked the unwed look
goes<00:03:23.109> away<00:03:23.440> that's<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.459> discharge<00:03:24.940> actually

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
goes away that's the discharge actually

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.159

the advantage to using a Rayo charge or

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.250 
the advantage to using a Rayo charge or
discharge<00:03:33.819> ink<00:03:34.629> is<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:34.959> don't<00:03:35.109> have<00:03:35.230> a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
discharge ink is that you don't have a

the light table because you need to

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.319 
the light table because you need to
