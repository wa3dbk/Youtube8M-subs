00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.580
 already at this point over one 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.019
 possible weather situation due to 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.360
 Constant rain in the northeast and east 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.010
 Germany informs we have now 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.539
 new insights so that we can 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.199
 bring up to date again 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.150
 want 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.340
 the cause of the emerging 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.199
 Constant rain is a low pressure area has 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.750
 currently from belarus direction 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.240
 Poland will be relocated tomorrow 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.730
 presumably with its core above the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.950
 northeastern Germany are then 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.440
 we also expect the strongest rain 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.360
 yes and only on monday it will be deep 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.770
 then weaken it again so that's it 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.770
 its influence on our weather 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.840
 loses until then we expect a lot 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.850
 he already has rain in the northeast 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.770
 started increases then in the course today 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.289
 of the day further south and south 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.910
 widen the west so today 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.949
 especially from Pomerania over 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.600
 brandenburg to resin with longer 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.610
 have to expect continued rain 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.979
 in the course of the night it spreads 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.539
 then rain in the middle of germany 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.369
 and also tomorrow there with the 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.740
 heavy precipitation 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.179
 mainly due to the northern 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.079
 currents in the north latitude of 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.920
 Northern Central Mountains 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.719
 appropriate warnings against continuous rain 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.539
 were already spent for one 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.779
 relatively large area in the east and 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.340
 Divide the middle of Germany in the 

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:29.369
 orange areas you have to with the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.979

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.270

 precipitation amounts between 60 and 80 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.509
 liter per square meter possible one

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.889

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:54.279

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.169
