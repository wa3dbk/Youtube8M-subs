00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
but basically my technology situation is

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.490 
but basically my technology situation is
not<00:00:12.059> good<00:00:12.330> right<00:00:12.570> now<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.139> binaural

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
not good right now and my binaural

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.490 
not good right now and my binaural
microphones<00:00:14.070> aren't<00:00:14.400> working<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.500> I'm

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
microphones aren't working so I'm

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380 
microphones aren't working so I'm
upgrading<00:00:16.949> my<00:00:16.980> technology<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.910> I'm<00:00:18.180> using

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
upgrading my technology and I'm using

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.970 
upgrading my technology and I'm using
going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.020> be<00:00:19.080> using<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> same<00:00:19.590> recording

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
going to be using the same recording

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.070 
going to be using the same recording
device<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.580> all<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> big<00:00:21.210> SM<00:00:21.660> artists

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
device that all of the big SM artists

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.509 
device that all of the big SM artists
use<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.439> should<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:22.949> exciting

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
use which should be really exciting

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.849 
use which should be really exciting
because<00:00:23.670> I'll<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> big<00:00:25.410> upgrade<00:00:25.590> in

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
because I'll have a big upgrade in

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.400 
because I'll have a big upgrade in
quality<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:28.109> been

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
quality when I get it but it it's been

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.880 
quality when I get it but it it's been
really<00:00:28.890> long<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.670> confusing<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:31.019> looks<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
really long and confusing and looks to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.270 
really long and confusing and looks to
be<00:00:31.980> kind<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.309> an<00:00:32.430> expensive<00:00:32.759> project<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:34.410> bear

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
get my binaural microphones back working

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.590

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.270 
what I filmed are some role plays that
are<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.059> binaural<00:00:51.539> um<00:00:51.840> they're<00:00:52.350> stereo<00:00:52.920> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
are not binaural um they're stereo so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
are not binaural um they're stereo so
the<00:00:53.640> quality<00:00:53.910> should<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.149> okay<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> I'm

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the quality should be okay and I'm

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720 
the quality should be okay and I'm
working<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.559> my<00:00:55.590> Movie<00:00:55.980> Editor<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> try<00:00:56.610> and
