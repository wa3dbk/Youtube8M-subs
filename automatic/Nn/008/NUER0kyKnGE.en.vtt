00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.440
 what do you do when you first get video footage from developer Bethesda 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.120
 Yarn get that but only two and a half minutes, you just just something 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.349
 talk faster so please excuse it if a bit hectic 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.180
 Picture books are impressively the pictures are already the game world of the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.449
 potential role-playing is no longer so prevalent in Northern Italy 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.699
 generic as in the predecessor Oblivion 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.869
 there exploring on foot or as here on OW must have fun women talking 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.410
 However, as usual, use the fast way function that costs now 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 but money 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.590
 nice to see that there is trouble in filling the world with life 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.350
 The villages the NPCs were doing their daily work were Feil or provide us 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.350
 with rumors and ninth graders in midfield 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.990
 even more beautiful oil and then at least the end that we have seen so far 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.230
 did not seem to be so modular Messi composed as Noble viruses 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.440
 but lovingly hand built small waterfalls or this natural 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.780
 Skylights make a lot of noise 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610
 fight roleplay treacherous first applies aggressively widening their duties 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.230
 Depending on ours, one of the hero is occasionally staged in slow motion 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.450
 finishing moves are important inventory anyway by mere 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.040
 Thread on a flower pot to advertise about this process locality 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.260
 Slowed that time around him then in peace injury shock from the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.630
 Slippers sizzle LeNoble their talent automatically when 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.060
 We use them about 3 4 million a glove he then held against 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 should 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 Hertha gradually this damage from the MoMA which can also be 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.800
 Combine what helps shopping at Swiss Life or powerful 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.550
 Boss opponent with these things Magician Finn we with lifeblood follow-up work he think 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.909
 nothing better to do 3 5 a hotter to face the Inntal in the way 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.340
 mostly cool LeNoble will be rewarded also Leisetreter so pretend attacks 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.740
 the ambush of flowers especially hurt 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.770
 if that's the case with these giants and pet mammoths too we dare to 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.759
 but doubt the view neutral guy Cry for me whenever 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.600
 our behavior 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.460
 it's just that this dragon intersperses the biggest one 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.880
 Innovation of Skyrim and also the most dangerous because the critters are 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.799
 enormously difficult to manage variant one with Kay controlled soldiers in the 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.060
 direct melee bad idea if the guys are going to get things off 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.490
 summarily grilled by the herb and percent flung away 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.779
 as a distraction to the computer soldiers but always 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:14.469
 because variant two is so alone and only with strikes on it is anyway 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.879
 not necessarily to be recommended variant three the employment of so-called words of the 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.900
 That's the goal we have already experienced in the halls 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:25.079
 Extract and create particularly powerful spells this thunderstorm 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:25.969
 combine 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.120
 a lightning strike later and already sets the dragon a spectacular 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.259
 Crash landing 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:34.149
 only a courageous boy push and already heard this Lindwurm soul 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.469
 and Prof that our path is now also impressive on Saubande
