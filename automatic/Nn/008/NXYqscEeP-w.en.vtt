00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello everyone often ask me what 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.920
 do with a spring that falls when 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.150
 disassembling it in the form of such a flat 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.939
 metal strip 2 millimeter two 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:33.030
 two and a half meters in width from 1 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:37.070
 millimeter thickness 20 men to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:42.469
 it serves to preload carriage stroke 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:46.170
 arrange the convex side out and 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.710
 carriage rests more fully on top here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.710
 guiding 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:59.760
 one end is placed between space 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.980
 protrusion second end here here too 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.899
 performed with massively eat up so he 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.899
 reached at the head 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.150
 Before putting on the carriage when here 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 disassembled the machine to wear and insert it 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.440
 then the spring here here is one edge here friend 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.470
 between the protrusions of space fix it 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.560
 finger and carriage itself is amazing 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.890
 spring 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:40.880
 this slot in the carriage should get on 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.600
 spring all the way apart 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.460
 there fix with those who are metal 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.460
 tighten it and then put your 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.240
 installation is no big deal
