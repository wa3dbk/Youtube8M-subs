00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
breakdown video today we'll be talking

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.780 
breakdown video today we'll be talking
about<00:00:19.450> the<00:00:19.630> ACR<00:00:20.259> and<00:00:20.290> e-type<00:00:20.860> 95<00:00:21.279> hands-down

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
about the ACR and e-type 95 hands-down

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.790 
about the ACR and e-type 95 hands-down
probably<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.540> most<00:00:22.720> powerful<00:00:23.169> assault

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
probably the most powerful assault

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.740 
probably the most powerful assault
rifles<00:00:24.160> in<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.489> game<00:00:24.669> and<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.419> reason<00:00:25.660> why

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
rifles in the game and the reason why

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.060 
rifles in the game and the reason why
I'm<00:00:25.869> actually<00:00:25.989> comparing<00:00:26.470> these<00:00:26.560> two<00:00:26.739> weapons

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
I'm actually comparing these two weapons

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.979 
I'm actually comparing these two weapons
is<00:00:27.309> first<00:00:27.610> off<00:00:27.820> a<00:00:28.029> lot<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.540> people<00:00:28.750> wanted<00:00:28.930> to

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
is first off a lot of people wanted to

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.630 
is first off a lot of people wanted to
see<00:00:29.079> a<00:00:29.169> breakdown<00:00:29.529> of<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.739> type<00:00:29.919> 95<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.610> I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
see a breakdown of the type 95 and I

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.519 
see a breakdown of the type 95 and I
definitely<00:00:30.820> want<00:00:31.149> to<00:00:31.180> compare<00:00:31.450> it<00:00:31.540> to<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.779> m16

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
definitely want to compare it to the m16

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.350 
definitely want to compare it to the m16
to<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.190> fact<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:33.730> lot<00:00:33.910> of<00:00:34.000> people<00:00:34.180> will

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
to the fact that a lot of people will

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.819 
to the fact that a lot of people will
know<00:00:34.540> that<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.840> tight<00:00:35.050> 95<00:00:35.380> is<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.590> little<00:00:35.739> bit

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
know that the tight 95 is a little bit

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.500 
know that the tight 95 is a little bit
more<00:00:35.980> powerful<00:00:36.399> so<00:00:36.520> I<00:00:36.579> decided<00:00:36.880> to<00:00:37.030> give<00:00:37.300> it<00:00:37.420> a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
more powerful so I decided to give it a

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.209 
more powerful so I decided to give it a
little<00:00:37.660> bit<00:00:37.780> more<00:00:37.930> competition<00:00:38.590> which<00:00:39.070> would

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
little bit more competition which would

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.400 
little bit more competition which would
be<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.430> ACR<00:00:40.089> and<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.390> ACR<00:00:40.870> is<00:00:40.899> hands<00:00:41.230> down

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
be the ACR and the ACR is hands down

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.380 
be the ACR and the ACR is hands down
once<00:00:41.739> again<00:00:41.829> probably<00:00:42.550> up<00:00:42.879> there<00:00:42.910> with<00:00:43.210> one<00:00:43.239> of

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
once again probably up there with one of

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.240 
once again probably up there with one of
the<00:00:43.539> most<00:00:43.660> overused<00:00:44.109> kind<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.710> little<00:00:44.949> guns<00:00:45.100> in

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
so first off with the damage now the ACR

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.570 
so first off with the damage now the ACR
has<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.270> base<00:01:10.479> damage<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:10.990> 45<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.590> 30<00:01:11.830> so<00:01:12.040> 3<00:01:12.340> bolts

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
has a base damage of 45 to 30 so 3 bolts

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.250 
has a base damage of 45 to 30 so 3 bolts
from<00:01:12.640> close<00:01:12.880> range<00:01:13.000> about<00:01:13.690> 4<00:01:13.930> bullets<00:01:14.200> from

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
from close range about 4 bullets from

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.790 
from close range about 4 bullets from
long<00:01:14.500> range

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
long range

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.590 
long range
now<00:01:15.250> with<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.520> type<00:01:15.670> 95<00:01:15.970> it's<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.420> lot

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
now with the type 95 it's a lot

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.210 
now with the type 95 it's a lot
different<00:01:16.780> because<00:01:17.080> this<00:01:17.380> is<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.560> burst<00:01:17.950> fire

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
different because this is a burst fire

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.890 
different because this is a burst fire
weapon<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:18.730> it's<00:01:18.880> shooting<00:01:19.150> 3<00:01:19.390> bullets<00:01:19.720> per

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
weapon so it's shooting 3 bullets per

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.900 
weapon so it's shooting 3 bullets per
burst<00:01:20.200> now<00:01:20.920> if<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.160> want<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.370> translate<00:01:21.760> that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
burst now if you want to translate that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.400 
burst now if you want to translate that
a<00:01:21.970> little<00:01:22.210> bit<00:01:22.300> it's<00:01:22.420> gonna<00:01:22.570> be<00:01:22.750> doing<00:01:22.990> 55

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
a little bit it's gonna be doing 55

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.650 
a little bit it's gonna be doing 55
damage<00:01:24.070> per<00:01:24.280> bullets<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:25.090> one<00:01:25.330> burst<00:01:25.510> from

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
damage per bullets so one burst from

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.270 
damage per bullets so one burst from
close<00:01:25.870> range<00:01:26.020> about<00:01:26.500> 2<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.800> 3<00:01:26.980> bursts<00:01:27.220> from

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
close range about 2 to 3 bursts from

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.990 
there they'll unlock level on the ACR is
about<00:01:43.900> level<00:01:44.140> 50<00:01:44.530> while<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.460> tight<00:01:45.850> 95

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
about level 50 while the on the tight 95

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.400 
about level 50 while the on the tight 95
it's<00:01:46.390> about<00:01:46.600> level<00:01:46.900> 32

you guys already did that

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.290 
you guys already did that
now<00:01:54.250> if<00:01:54.400> we<00:01:54.490> take<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.640> look<00:01:54.760> at<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:54.970> reload<00:01:55.270> time

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.730 
now if we take a look at the reload time
this<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.960> kind<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.200> where<00:01:56.410> it<00:01:56.500> gets<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:56.650> little

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
this is kind of where it gets a little

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.160 
this is kind of where it gets a little
drastic<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.460> ACR<00:01:57.940> has<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.150> pretty<00:01:58.570> fast<00:01:58.750> reload

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
tight 95 now this is gonna play a key

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.250

as<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.990> can<00:03:11.110> see<00:03:11.260> here<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> sights<00:03:11.800> are

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
as you can see here the sights are

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.350 
as you can see here the sights are
pretty<00:03:11.980> clear<00:03:12.460> they're<00:03:12.670> pretty<00:03:12.820> transparent

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
pretty clear they're pretty transparent

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.910 
pretty clear they're pretty transparent
and<00:03:13.450> they're<00:03:13.540> very<00:03:13.660> easy<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.050> see<00:03:14.260> through<00:03:14.440> so

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
and they're very easy to see through so

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.170 
and they're very easy to see through so
I'm<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.070> really<00:03:15.430> big<00:03:15.580> fan<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.760> them<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.090> they're

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
I'm a really big fan of them and they're

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.120 
I'm a really big fan of them and they're
not<00:03:16.210> too<00:03:16.450> obstructive<00:03:17.020> now<00:03:17.620> if<00:03:17.830> we<00:03:17.920> take<00:03:18.070> a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
not too obstructive now if we take a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.590 
not too obstructive now if we take a
look<00:03:18.250> at<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.460> time<00:03:18.670> 95<00:03:19.090> you're<00:03:19.300> gonna<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.540> a

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
look at the time 95 you're gonna have a

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.030 
look at the time 95 you're gonna have a
little<00:03:19.780> bit<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.080> harder<00:03:20.350> time<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.740> work<00:03:20.890> with

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
little bit of a harder time to work with

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.260 
little bit of a harder time to work with
these<00:03:21.130> because<00:03:21.640> there's<00:03:21.790> actually<00:03:21.880> two

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
these because there's actually two

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.340 
these because there's actually two
different<00:03:22.300> sites<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.840> have<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:23.020> look<00:03:23.170> through

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
different sites you have to look through

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.870 
different sites you have to look through
there's<00:03:23.590> one<00:03:23.710> up<00:03:23.830> close<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.400> there's<00:03:24.760> also

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
there's one up close and there's also

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.790 
there's one up close and there's also
one<00:03:25.120> far<00:03:25.390> away<00:03:25.420> so<00:03:25.690> from<00:03:26.080> long<00:03:26.230> range<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.650> from

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
one far away so from long range in from

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.230 
one far away so from long range in from
medium<00:03:27.040> range<00:03:27.220> it's<00:03:27.670> gonna<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.880> kind<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.180> hard

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
medium range it's gonna be kind of hard

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.610 
medium range it's gonna be kind of hard
to<00:03:28.450> use<00:03:28.570> this<00:03:28.660> weapon<00:03:28.990> so<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.140> would<00:03:29.260> highly

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
and that is pretty much a wrap of one so

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.300 
and that is pretty much a wrap of one so
to<00:03:34.810> talk<00:03:34.990> about<00:03:35.050> my<00:03:35.380> personal<00:03:35.800> opinion<00:03:36.130> with

tight<00:03:38.740> 95<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.310> only<00:03:39.550> maps<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:39.910> really<00:03:40.180> enjoy

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
tight 95 the only maps I really enjoy

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.570 
tight 95 the only maps I really enjoy
using<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.080> our<00:03:41.290> interchange<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.130> falling

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
using it on our interchange and falling

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.400 
using it on our interchange and falling
maps<00:03:43.090> with<00:03:43.330> very<00:03:43.510> long<00:03:43.780> lines<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.170> sights

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
maps with very long lines of sights

maps with very long lines of sights
because<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.740> can<00:03:44.860> do<00:03:44.950> very<00:03:45.220> well<00:03:45.430> with<00:03:45.580> this
