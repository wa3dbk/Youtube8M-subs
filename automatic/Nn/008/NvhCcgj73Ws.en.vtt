00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
Erin low to find out how we benefit from

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.100 
Erin low to find out how we benefit from
eating<00:04:02.310> smaller<00:04:02.670> more<00:04:03.090> frequent<00:04:03.330> meals<00:04:03.780> each

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
Americans but is it the best way to

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.200 
Americans but is it the best way to

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
your demanding day but what we're really

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.800 
your demanding day but what we're really
learning<00:04:17.610> is<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.780> body<00:04:19.050> doesn't<00:04:19.530> really

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
learning is that the body doesn't really

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.970 
learning is that the body doesn't really
metabolically<00:04:21.810> doesn't<00:04:22.200> work<00:04:22.500> as<00:04:22.710> well<00:04:22.740> on

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
metabolically doesn't work as well on

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.490 
metabolically doesn't work as well on
three<00:04:23.520> big<00:04:23.700> meals<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:24.060> day<00:04:24.090> as<00:04:24.450> it<00:04:24.870> actually<00:04:25.080> as

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
three big meals a day as it actually as

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.890

it does on smaller evenly spaced milk
throughout<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.230> day<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:28.680> why<00:04:28.860> does<00:04:29.130> your<00:04:29.340> body

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
throughout the day so why does your body

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.370 
throughout the day so why does your body
seem<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.000> prefer<00:04:30.120> smaller<00:04:30.810> more<00:04:31.170> frequent

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380
