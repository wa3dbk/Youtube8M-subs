00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 aerated laying first row for 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.470
 building houses with walls of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.809
 aerated concrete blocks 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.969
 most often two types are used 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.170
 foundations monolithic belt 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.980
 foundation or solid slab with ribs 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.699
 stiffness 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.260
 or without them in this clip as 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.439
 carrier house 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.349
 monolithic reinforced concrete is used 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.599
 foundation tape with a plate thickness of 160 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.600
 millimeters regardless of type 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
 the foundation is necessary so that the top 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.230
 part of the foundation to be 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.989
 draw all the walls of the house was 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 horizontal and differences between the most 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.809
 the highest and lowest angles were not 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.270
 over 30 millimeters for this before 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.640
 the beginning of laying with the help of a level and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.850
 slats determine the maximum differential 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.610
 heights at the corners of the building being erected 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.829
 If this requirement is not fulfilled the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.039
 need to produce additional 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.809
 leveling the top of the foundation 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 the solution is recommended to arrange 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.600
 the height of the basement part of the foundation is not 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.270
 less than 500 millimeters from the blind area 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 to prevent masonry getting wet 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.180
 with snow when it dawns also for 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.430
 prevent capillary suction of water 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.560
 from the side of heavy concrete between 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.810
 foundation and masonry necessary 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.110
 waterproof it over it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 marks waterproofing is performed either with 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.159
 using roll 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.360
 waterproofing material or 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.430
 solutions made from dry 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.130
 waterproofing mixtures further 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.530
 start laying the first row of blocks 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.159
 from the quality of the first row of masonry 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.679
 aerated concrete blocks 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.090
 depends largely on the quality of the whole house 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.030
 and and perform especially the part first row 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.810
 blocks always fit on your 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.490
 cement-sand mortar outside 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.119
 depending on the type of pounds 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.619
 all vertical seams of the first row of masonry 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.319
 smeared with glue for aerated concrete 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.329
 the laying of the first row of blocks begins with 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.399
 installation at the corners of the building in a single 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.610
 horizontal plane of lighthouse blocks 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.430
 and checking the geometry of the erected 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.099
 perimeter in accordance with the project for 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.290
 this using a tape measure or another 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.629
 measuring instrument spend 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.120
 measurements of the sides and diagonals 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.980
 first achieve a length match 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.819
 parallel sides of the building contour 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.190
 then compare the diagonals and with their 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.349
 mismatch correct position 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.970
 lighthouse blocks 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.430
 after bringing the perimeter of the building into 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.220
 according to the project is carried out 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.010
 installation of berthing quay cords 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.769
 the cord is attached to the corner beacon 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.310
 blocks the contour of the building and is pulled over by 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.579
 perimeter 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.889
 if the side exceeds 10 meters 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.799
 it is set in the middle 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.530
 intermediate blogs 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.609
 installation of each aerated concrete block 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 controlled by level and 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.410
 cord mooring 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 the log is first aligned in the plane 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.230
 then in height and after o berthing 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.760
 menu to adjust the position 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.910
 aerated concrete block is used 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.970
 rubber mallet when closing the first 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.060
 row of blocks if necessary 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.700
 make installation additional block length 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.760
 complementary blocks specify the mark 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.909
 measuring fence blocks 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.810
 Part of the standard by cutting. 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:37.299
 hacksaw for aerated concrete between adjacent 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.019
 blocks of 1 row of masonry should not 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.060
 stay level differences when 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.890
 appearance of their local elevations 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.379
 must be removed with 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.709
 special plane for aerated concrete 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.709
 after leveling fine 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.819
 dirt and dust are removed with a brush
