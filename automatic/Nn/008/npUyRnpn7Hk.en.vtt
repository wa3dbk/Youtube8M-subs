00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.430 
gunpowder and coal now this seems a
little<00:03:28.579> bit<00:03:28.760> overpowered<00:03:29.269> right<00:03:29.449> now<00:03:29.629> as<00:03:29.900> its

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
little bit overpowered right now as its

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.559 
little bit overpowered right now as its
stackable<00:03:31.069> it<00:03:31.489> doesn't<00:03:31.940> have<00:03:32.060> any<00:03:32.180> durability

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
stackable it doesn't have any durability

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.479 
stackable it doesn't have any durability
and<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.290> can<00:03:33.410> just<00:03:33.590> keep<00:03:33.739> using<00:03:33.949> it<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.310> light

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
and you can just keep using it to light

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.640 
and you can just keep using it to light
things<00:03:34.669> on<00:03:34.879> fire<00:03:35.049> so<00:03:36.049> I'm<00:03:36.139> not<00:03:36.260> sure<00:03:36.319> what's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
things on fire so I'm not sure what's

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.720 
things on fire so I'm not sure what's
going<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:36.859> happen<00:03:37.129> with<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.549> future

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
going to happen with that in the future

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.909 
going to happen with that in the future
but<00:03:38.510> hopefully<00:03:39.139> that's<00:03:39.349> the<00:03:39.440> nerve<00:03:39.620> store

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
but hopefully that's the nerve store

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.099 
but hopefully that's the nerve store
that<00:03:40.069> has<00:03:40.190> some<00:03:40.459> other<00:03:40.579> use<00:03:40.910> what<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.840> think<00:03:42.019> it

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
that has some other use what I think it

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.140 
that has some other use what I think it
may<00:03:42.199> be<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.349> little<00:03:42.470> harder<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.889> craft<00:03:43.459> another

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
may be a little harder to craft another

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.460 
may be a little harder to craft another
thing<00:03:44.389> i'm<00:03:44.480> not<00:03:44.599> sure<00:03:44.750> if<00:03:44.840> they<00:03:44.959> added<00:03:45.199> in<00:03:45.290> this

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
thing i'm not sure if they added in this

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.470 
thing i'm not sure if they added in this
snapshot<00:03:45.739> or<00:03:46.099> last<00:03:46.370> snapshot<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.060> they've

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
snapshot or last snapshot is they've

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.330 
snapshot or last snapshot is they've
added<00:03:47.720> additional<00:03:47.989> leave<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.949> you<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.069> see

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
added additional leave so you can see

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.339 
added additional leave so you can see
that<00:03:49.370> all<00:03:49.669> the<00:03:49.910> leaf<00:03:50.090> blocks<00:03:50.540> are<00:03:50.780> here<00:03:51.199> i

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
that all the leaf blocks are here i

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.400 
that all the leaf blocks are here i
don't<00:03:52.069> know<00:03:52.190> if<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:52.609> is<00:03:52.870> brand<00:03:53.870> new<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.199> the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
don't know if this is brand new to the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.250 
don't know if this is brand new to the
snapshot<00:03:54.919> but<00:03:55.400> i<00:03:55.790> think<00:03:56.690> that's<00:03:56.840> pretty<00:03:57.019> cool

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
snapshot but i think that's pretty cool

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.990 
snapshot but i think that's pretty cool
nonetheless<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.919> can<00:03:58.069> take<00:03:58.310> some<00:03:58.519> jungle

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
nonetheless you can take some jungle

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.210 
nonetheless you can take some jungle
leaves<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.599> you<00:03:59.660> can<00:03:59.840> spawn<00:04:00.799> them<00:04:00.980> wherever

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
leaves and you can spawn them wherever

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.089 
leaves and you can spawn them wherever
so<00:04:01.970> very<00:04:02.180> cool<00:04:02.419> now<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.230> image<00:04:03.409> you're<00:04:03.829> seeing

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
so very cool now the image you're seeing

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.740 
so very cool now the image you're seeing
on<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.400> screen<00:04:04.549> now<00:04:04.970> was<00:04:05.359> found<00:04:05.599> by<00:04:05.720> a
