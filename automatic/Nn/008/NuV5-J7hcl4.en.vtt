the flick keyboard as shown right here

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.930 
the flick keyboard as shown right here
and<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.070> essentially<00:00:41.550> I'll<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.760> go

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and this so essentially I'll just go

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
and this so essentially I'll just go
over<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.329> flick<00:00:42.480> keyboard<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.100> as<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
over what the flick keyboard is as you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.690 
over what the flick keyboard is as you
can<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.149> has<00:00:45.570> eight<00:00:46.379> primary<00:00:47.040> buttons

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
can see it has eight primary buttons

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
can see it has eight primary buttons
with<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:48.690> different<00:00:49.079> symbols<00:00:49.559> and

alphabet<00:00:50.340> letters<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.940> rather<00:00:51.750> than

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
alphabet letters on it rather than

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.840 
alphabet letters on it rather than
having<00:00:52.230> an<00:00:52.710> individual<00:00:53.280> button<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.700> every

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
having an individual button for every

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.010 
having an individual button for every
single<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.149> activate<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> letter

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
single one and so to activate a letter

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.459 
single one and so to activate a letter
you'll<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:59.309> example<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> press<00:01:00.180> F

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
you'll for example if we want to press F

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
you'll for example if we want to press F
you<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.649> tap<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you just tap it like that if you want to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.729 
you just tap it like that if you want to
go<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> E<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.870> tap<00:01:04.289> and<00:01:04.589> then

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
go to E you're gonna tap and then

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.030 
go to E you're gonna tap and then
diagonally<00:01:05.250> swipe<00:01:05.789> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> e<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.680> advantage

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
diagonally swipe to the e the advantage

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.289 
diagonally swipe to the e the advantage
of<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.909> don't<00:01:09.060> need<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
separate button right next to the F that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.320 
separate button right next to the F that
you<00:01:11.640> could<00:01:11.820> easily<00:01:12.030> miss<00:01:12.630> click<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:14.240> same<00:01:15.240> for

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
mean if you want to type in a letter you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.300 
mean if you want to type in a letter you
don't<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.260> aim<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.410> well<00:02:55.799> look<00:02:56.010> how<00:02:56.130> big

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
don't have to aim that well look how big

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the square is just type in an F you get

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.830 
the square is just type in an F you get
hit<00:02:58.680> there<00:02:58.890> or<00:02:59.340> there<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.180> mean<00:03:00.450> it's<00:03:00.660> really

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
hit there or there I mean it's really

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.570

hard to miss same with J or whatever and
even<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.760> letters<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.299> that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
even with the letters that are that

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.059 
even with the letters that are that
aren't<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.650> aren't<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.950> main

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.460 
aren't on the that aren't the main
letters<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.849> side<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.900> said<00:03:10.080> forty

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
letters so on the side like I said forty

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.979 
letters so on the side like I said forty
I<00:03:10.500> mean<00:03:10.860> look<00:03:11.130> how<00:03:11.250> big<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.489> space<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.630> hit

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
I mean look how big the space is to hit

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.170 
I mean look how big the space is to hit

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
QWERTY layout but I also think this one

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.160 
QWERTY layout but I also think this one
would<00:03:49.590> be<00:03:49.650> pretty<00:03:50.190> darn<00:03:50.370> fast<00:03:50.780> if<00:03:51.780> you're

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
would be pretty darn fast if you're

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.720 
would be pretty darn fast if you're
willing<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.560> take<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.859> time<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.100> understand

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.559 
willing to take the time to understand
how<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.600> use<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.670> but<00:03:56.670> for<00:03:56.730> those<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.329> who

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
how to use it but for those of you who

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.930 
how to use it but for those of you who

as<00:04:03.060> patient<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.750> would<00:04:03.810> suggest<00:04:04.049> just<00:04:04.380> going

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
as patient I would suggest just going

with<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.750> flick<00:04:06.750> keyboard<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:07.739> still<00:04:07.950> in

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
with the flick keyboard it's still in

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.309 
with the flick keyboard it's still in
the<00:04:08.100> QWERTY<00:04:08.370> layout<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.420> saves<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:10.019> lot<00:04:10.260> of

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
the QWERTY layout and it saves a lot of

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.750 
the QWERTY layout and it saves a lot of
space<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.889> well<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.639> your

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
space as well because you have your

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.680 
space as well because you have your
symbols<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.480> numbers<00:04:12.630> as<00:04:13.049> well<00:04:13.829> as<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.160> your

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
symbols and numbers as well as all your

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.479 
symbols and numbers as well as all your
letters<00:04:15.690> on<00:04:15.989> one<00:04:16.440> single<00:04:16.769> keyboard<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.400> you

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
letters on one single keyboard so you

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.770 
letters on one single keyboard so you
don't<00:04:17.639> need<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.789> switch<00:04:17.940> between<00:04:18.120> keyboards

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
and they're equally as easy to select

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.659 
and they're equally as easy to select
without<00:04:21.780> having<00:04:22.139> any

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669

without having any
errors<00:04:23.389> in<00:04:23.419> selection<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:25.250> that's<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.240> review

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
errors in selection so that's the review

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.050
