00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.680 
the whole bite right now is good I think
you<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.400> see<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.580> won<00:02:44.819> my<00:02:44.970> heat<00:02:45.120> race<00:02:45.180> today<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
you can see I won my heat race today and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.809 
you can see I won my heat race today and
I<00:02:45.750> won<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.050> race<00:02:46.170> last<00:02:46.440> week<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:46.920> we're<00:02:47.610> doing

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
I won the race last week so we're doing

00:02:47.819 --> 00:03:01.150 
I won the race last week so we're doing
something<00:02:48.030> right

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.440 

the<00:03:02.160> engine<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.460> pretty<00:03:02.730> different<00:03:02.910> compared

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
the engine is pretty different compared

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.350 
the engine is pretty different compared
to<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> protection<00:03:04.050> bike<00:03:04.350> actually<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
to a protection bike actually the the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.240 
to a protection bike actually the the
biggest<00:03:06.540> part<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> power<00:03:07.500> we've

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
biggest part of it is the power we've

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.060 
biggest part of it is the power we've
got<00:03:08.460> more<00:03:08.700> than<00:03:08.910> 60<00:03:09.270> old<00:03:09.420> power<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.440> it's<00:03:10.950> going

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
got more than 60 old power so it's going

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.590 
got more than 60 old power so it's going
to<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.280> difficult<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.670> most<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.270> people

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
to be difficult for most of the people

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.630 
to be difficult for most of the people
to<00:03:12.690> handle<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.140> only<00:03:14.010> few<00:03:14.190> people<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.550> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
to handle this only few people in the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.490 
to handle this only few people in the
world<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:15.000> do<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.570> actually<00:03:16.110> we<00:03:16.410> are

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
world can do that and actually we are

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
world can do that and actually we are
lucky<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.830> have<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.010> couple<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.340> those

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.940 

those<00:03:21.060> pipe<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.540> one<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.320> most<00:03:22.650> special

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
those pipe is one of the most special

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.410 
those pipe is one of the most special
part<00:03:23.250> probably<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.210> made<00:03:24.360> just

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
part probably because it's made just

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.810 
part probably because it's made just
just<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:25.530> us<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.980> purpose<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.670> our

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
just for us on purpose on our

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.800 
just for us on purpose on our
specification<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.760> it's<00:03:29.760> made<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.330> for

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
specification and it's made just for

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.650 
specification and it's made just for
increase<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.200> power

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.840 

we<00:03:34.990> have<00:03:35.200> quite<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.560> lot<00:03:35.800> parts<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.520> titanium

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
we have quite a lot parts in a titanium

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.960 
we have quite a lot parts in a titanium
and<00:03:37.330> also<00:03:37.750> carbon<00:03:38.260> fiber<00:03:38.650> we've<00:03:39.250> got<00:03:39.520> probably

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
and also carbon fiber we've got probably

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.640 
and also carbon fiber we've got probably
more<00:03:40.630> than<00:03:40.840> 30<00:03:41.650> balls<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.720> titanium<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.110> some

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
more than 30 balls in titanium and some

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.060 
more than 30 balls in titanium and some
carbon<00:03:45.100> parts<00:03:45.400> as<00:03:45.490> you<00:03:45.610> can<00:03:45.760> see<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.180> tank<00:03:46.690> or

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
carbon parts as you can see the tank or

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:55.530 
carbon parts as you can see the tank or
the<00:03:48.070> suffering<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:50.400> front<00:03:51.400> disc<00:03:51.670> cover

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.600 

well<00:03:56.469> as<00:03:56.620> difficult<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.129> have<00:03:57.250> an<00:03:57.340> idea

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
well as difficult to have an idea

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.520 
well as difficult to have an idea
because<00:03:57.939> it<00:03:58.299> depends<00:03:58.629> if<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.930> consider<00:03:59.349> also

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
because it depends if you consider also

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.589 
because it depends if you consider also
the<00:03:59.739> hour<00:03:59.859> we<00:04:00.189> spend<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.670> put<00:04:00.939> it<00:04:01.060> together<00:04:01.180> but

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
the hour we spend to put it together but

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.679 
the hour we spend to put it together but
I<00:04:01.840> know<00:04:02.140> let's<00:04:02.650> say<00:04:02.799> maybe<00:04:03.299> fifty<00:04:04.299> thousand

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
I know let's say maybe fifty thousand

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.170 
I know let's say maybe fifty thousand
euros<00:04:04.989> only<00:04:05.230> for<00:04:05.379> the<00:04:05.439> part<00:04:05.790> but<00:04:06.790> anyway<00:04:07.120> you

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
euros only for the part but anyway you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.660 
euros only for the part but anyway you
can<00:04:07.420> buy<00:04:07.599> it

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:29.420 

you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.520 

you
