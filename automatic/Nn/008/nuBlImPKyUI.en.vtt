well I guess the games glitch for some
reason<00:05:29.930> but<00:05:30.920> anyway<00:05:31.370> for<00:05:31.640> some<00:05:31.790> reason<00:05:32.000> is

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
reason but anyway for some reason is

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.790 
reason but anyway for some reason is
switch<00:05:32.360> for<00:05:32.630> me<00:05:32.660> but<00:05:33.260> if<00:05:33.380> you<00:05:33.500> lose<00:05:33.620> them

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
is pretty weird which suggests that this

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.990 
is pretty weird which suggests that this
