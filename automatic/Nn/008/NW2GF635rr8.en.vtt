dev team it's they're just guessing at
this<00:02:40.030> right<00:02:40.210> now<00:02:40.360> they<00:02:40.990> saw<00:02:41.230> something<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.710> the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
this right now they saw something in the

iOS 5 the betas that can intends that

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.100 
iOS 5 the betas that can intends that
this<00:02:44.980> might<00:02:45.190> happen<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.790> but<00:02:46.750> they<00:02:46.840> are<00:02:46.960> just

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
this might happen and but they are just

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.210 
this might happen and but they are just
guessing<00:02:47.470> they're<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:47.710> positive<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.190> is

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
guessing they're not positive it is

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.620 
guessing they're not positive it is
they're<00:02:48.790> not<00:02:48.880> positive<00:02:49.240> this<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.390> going<00:02:49.570> to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
they're not positive this is going to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.510 
they're not positive this is going to
happen<00:02:49.750> yet<00:02:50.110> next<00:02:50.680> paragraph<00:02:51.040> states<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
happen yet next paragraph states the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.150 
happen yet next paragraph states the
geohawk<00:02:51.760> slamming<00:02:52.240> exploit<00:02:53.200> takes<00:02:53.530> effect

geohawk slamming exploit takes effect

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.430 
geohawk slamming exploit takes effect
before<00:02:54.370> any<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.300> particular<00:02:55.660> checks<00:02:56.080> are<00:02:56.230> made

before any a particular checks are made

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.980 
before any a particular checks are made
so<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.130> means<00:02:57.400> devices<00:02:58.390> can<00:02:58.690> still<00:02:58.900> be

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
so that means devices can still be

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.260 
so that means devices can still be
jailbroken<00:02:59.470> besides<00:03:00.130> ipad<00:03:00.520> 2<00:03:00.670> because<00:03:01.000> the
