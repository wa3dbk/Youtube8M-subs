 these basic commodities on the internet and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 look at the prices frankly it's not 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550

 all that to say that the price the budget 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.710

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:43.350

 there apart from that I got little tricks 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.990

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.200
 benefits of being a blogger 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 so I received two men I have not 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 very good and I put them in the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:14.010
 worries to give taste and pep 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.319
 vegans or even save money 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.269
