here's<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.770> final<00:00:04.950> trick<00:00:05.279> I'm<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.640> show

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
here's the final trick I'm going to show

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.789 
here's the final trick I'm going to show
you<00:00:05.850> with<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.210> image<00:00:06.390> it's<00:00:06.899> not<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:07.710> I'm

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
you with this image it's not how I'm

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.530 
you with this image it's not how I'm
going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.069> use<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.550> image<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.150> final

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
going to use the image in the final

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.959 
going to use the image in the final
layout<00:00:09.719> but<00:00:10.349> it's<00:00:11.040> something<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.849> know

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
layout but it's something that you know

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.730 
layout but it's something that you know
probably<00:00:12.509> would<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.139> interest<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.679> I

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
probably would be of interest and I

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740 
probably would be of interest and I
think<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.040> photo<00:00:14.309> would<00:00:14.910> look<00:00:15.089> great<00:00:15.210> using

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
think this photo would look great using

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.930 
think this photo would look great using
it<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.500> would<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.680> having<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.550> black<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
it and that would be having a black and

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
it and that would be having a black and
white<00:00:17.970> photo<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:18.840> color<00:00:19.080> added<00:00:19.529> into

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
white photo with some color added into

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.560 
white photo with some color added into
it<00:00:19.980> which<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.910> know<00:00:20.939> fairly<00:00:21.240> popular

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
it which is you know fairly popular

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.710

here's<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> quick<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.380> easy<00:00:25.439> way<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:26.279> that

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
here's a quick and easy way to do that

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.800 
here's a quick and easy way to do that
in<00:00:26.699> Photoshop<00:00:27.650> with<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> colored<00:00:29.039> image<00:00:29.810> and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

in Photoshop with a colored image and
what<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> would<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.769> would<00:00:31.800> take<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
what I would do is I would take the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.280 
what I would do is I would take the
original<00:00:32.820> layout<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:33.960> that's<00:00:34.140> been

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
original layout the one that's been

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.119 
original layout the one that's been
edited<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.980> where<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.280> want<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.890> I'm<00:00:37.890> going

edited to where we want it and I'm going
to<00:00:38.190> make<00:00:38.910> another<00:00:39.210> copy<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:43.140> top<00:00:43.379> layer<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
to make another copy and the top layer I

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.029 
to make another copy and the top layer I
am<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.600> select<00:00:46.260> image<00:00:47.480> adjustments

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
desaturate and that is going to turn it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.470 
desaturate and that is going to turn it
black<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.520> white<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.699> what<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> do

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
black and white and what I'm going to do

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.619 
black and white and what I'm going to do
also<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.020> I'm<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.980> add<00:00:59.640> a<00:01:00.270> little<00:01:00.359> bit

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
also is I'm going to add a little bit

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.260 
also is I'm going to add a little bit
more<00:01:00.809> contrast<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> image<00:01:03.690> by<00:01:04.470> selecting

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
more contrast to the image by selecting

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.929 
more contrast to the image by selecting
brightness<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.420> contrast<00:01:06.510> feature<00:01:07.080> just

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
brightness and contrast feature just

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.920 
brightness and contrast feature just
going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> bump<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:09.990> bit

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.990 

a<00:01:13.960> lot<00:01:14.620> of<00:01:14.650> its<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:14.950> trying<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.490> out<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.790> see

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
a lot of its just trying it out to see

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.160 
a lot of its just trying it out to see
how<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.390> looks

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.620 

and<00:01:21.380> then<00:01:21.860> essentially<00:01:22.460> i'm<00:01:22.880> going<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.450> take

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
and then essentially i'm going to take

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.310 
and then essentially i'm going to take
my<00:01:23.840> eraser<00:01:23.990> tool<00:01:25.479> because<00:01:26.479> we<00:01:26.780> are<00:01:26.900> going<00:01:27.140> to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
my eraser tool because we are going to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.350 
my eraser tool because we are going to
reveal<00:01:27.890> his<00:01:28.100> shirt<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.000> red<00:01:29.180> is

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
reveal his shirt so that the red is

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.950 
reveal his shirt so that the red is
popping<00:01:29.720> up<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:34.130> select<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.520> larger<00:01:35.180> brush<00:01:35.390> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
popping up to select a larger brush the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.539 
popping up to select a larger brush the
most<00:01:36.200> part<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:40.039> again<00:01:42.549> definitely

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
most part of it and again definitely

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.300 
most part of it and again definitely
like<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.880> scroll<00:01:44.240> or<00:01:44.840> zoom<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.500> as<00:01:45.710> much<00:01:46.250> as

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
like to scroll or zoom and as much as

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.450 
like to scroll or zoom and as much as
possible<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.299> i<00:01:47.330> have<00:01:47.840> more<00:01:48.560> control<00:01:48.740> over<00:01:49.039> my

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
possible so i have more control over my

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.970 
possible so i have more control over my
work<00:01:49.670> area<00:01:51.430> i'm<00:01:52.430> just<00:01:52.640> going<00:01:52.789> to<00:01:52.820> go<00:01:52.909> ahead

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.290 

I'm<00:01:58.520> also<00:01:58.790> going<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.440> adjust<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.830> opacity

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
I'm also going to adjust the opacity

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.140 
I'm also going to adjust the opacity
just<00:02:02.300> a<00:02:02.450> bit<00:02:02.660> that<00:02:03.050> way<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:04.250> red<00:02:04.460> isn't<00:02:04.730> too

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
just a bit that way the red isn't too

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:14.760 
just a bit that way the red isn't too
saturated<00:02:05.450> against<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.500> black<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.980> white

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.440 

I'm<00:02:15.100> going<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> go<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:16.120> start

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I'm going to go in and just start

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.680 
I'm going to go in and just start
erasing

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.750 

now<00:02:22.260> be<00:02:22.410> careful<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:23.010> you're<00:02:23.160> using<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
now be careful if you're using a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.680 
now be careful if you're using a
feathered<00:02:24.180> brush<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.560> might<00:02:25.920> actually

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
feathered brush as this might actually

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.390 
feathered brush as this might actually
erase<00:02:27.690> more<00:02:28.260> than<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:28.950> want<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.370> to

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
erase more than you really want it to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:03:12.380 
erase more than you really want it to
just<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.610> slow<00:02:32.910> steady<00:02:33.240> hand

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.860 

and<00:03:12.990> that's<00:03:13.140> all<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.410> need<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.710> do
