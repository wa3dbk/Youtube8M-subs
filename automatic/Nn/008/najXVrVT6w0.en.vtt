technique which is stippling before me I

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.530 
technique which is stippling before me I
have<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> couple<00:00:11.219> different<00:00:11.340> tools<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.240> come

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
have a couple different tools that come

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.310 
have a couple different tools that come
in<00:00:12.690> really<00:00:12.870> handy

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
in really handy

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.250 
in really handy
these<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:14.160> stippling<00:00:14.580> brushes<00:00:15.260> obviously

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
these are stippling brushes obviously

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500 
these are stippling brushes obviously
one<00:00:16.650> will<00:00:16.859> cover<00:00:17.100> more<00:00:17.340> territory<00:00:17.580> than<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
one will cover more territory than the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.670 
one will cover more territory than the
other<00:00:18.660> one

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
other one

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.349 
other one
there's<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.490> big<00:00:20.699> difference<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
there's a big difference with the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.019 
there's a big difference with the
brushes<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:21.960> do<00:00:22.020> make<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> very<00:00:23.039> refined<00:00:23.550> look

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
brushes they do make a very refined look

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.019 
brushes they do make a very refined look
of<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.449> stipple<00:00:25.340> however<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.789> quite

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
of a stipple however they can get quite

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.000 
of a stipple however they can get quite
heavy<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.630> you're<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:27.990> pounding<00:00:28.890> at

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
wall and you're going in section so

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.090 
wall and you're going in section so
let's<00:02:04.759> say<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.060> go<00:02:05.180> into<00:02:05.299> section<00:02:05.750> here<00:02:06.170> then

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
let's say you go into section here then

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.040 
let's say you go into section here then
go<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.549> section<00:02:07.789> here<00:02:08.300> then<00:02:08.600> work<00:02:08.780> back

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
go to the section here then work back

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.170 
go to the section here then work back
onto<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:09.590> edge<00:02:09.890> even<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.610> long<00:02:10.819> thin

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
onto this edge even if it's a long thin

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.570 
onto this edge even if it's a long thin
section<00:02:11.690> as<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.959> go<00:02:12.110> down<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.459> can

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
section as you go down so that you can

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.400 
section as you go down so that you can
kind<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.910> keep<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.180> as<00:02:14.269> wet<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.540> possible<00:02:15.290> as

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
kind of keep it as wet as possible as

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.880 
kind of keep it as wet as possible as
you<00:02:15.560> move<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.760> once<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.180> get<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.769> is

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
you move so once you get this all it is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.610 
you move so once you get this all it is
is<00:02:19.190> literally<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:21.250> dabbing<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:27.410> makes

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
is literally just dabbing and it makes

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.940 
is literally just dabbing and it makes
like<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> little<00:02:28.280> dinky<00:02:28.640> polka<00:02:28.850> dot<00:02:29.799> kind<00:02:30.799> of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
like a little dinky polka dot kind of

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.900 
like a little dinky polka dot kind of
look<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.860> want<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.459> be<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> little

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
look if you want it to be a little

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.520 
look if you want it to be a little
darker<00:02:35.209> than<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:35.900> put<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.319> little

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
darker than just put it on a little

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.220 
darker than just put it on a little
thicker<00:02:36.769> but<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.360> basically<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.019> brush

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
thicker but that is basically the brush

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.070 
thicker but that is basically the brush
and<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:40.610> can<00:02:40.880> sometimes<00:02:41.540> can<00:02:41.750> get<00:02:41.870> very

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
and it can sometimes can get very

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.050 
and it can sometimes can get very
consistent<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.100> do<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.519> watch<00:02:43.700> this

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
consistent but you do have to watch this

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.460 
consistent but you do have to watch this
edge<00:02:44.269> here<00:02:44.299> so<00:02:44.690> like<00:02:44.930> if<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.140> were<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.410> to

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
edge here so like if you were going to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.650 
edge here so like if you were going to
then<00:02:45.680> do<00:02:45.830> your<00:02:46.010> next<00:02:46.250> section<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.000> you're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
then do your next section and you're

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.250 
then do your next section and you're
going<00:02:47.690> over<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.620> do<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:52.570> again<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:53.750> like<00:02:54.109> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
going over to do it again I like the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.930 
going over to do it again I like the
irregular<00:02:54.769> look<00:02:55.070> better<00:02:55.340> than<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.579> straight

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
irregular look better than a straight

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.699 
irregular look better than a straight
up-and-down<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.810> just<00:02:56.989> makes<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.350> better<00:02:57.410> in

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
up-and-down it just makes it better in

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.819 
up-and-down it just makes it better in
the<00:02:57.829> long<00:02:57.980> run<00:02:59.200> you<00:03:00.200> go<00:03:00.380> back<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:03.290> your<00:03:03.470> next

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
the long run you go back in to your next

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:11.849 
the long run you go back in to your next
sit<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:05.170> then<00:03:06.170> just<00:03:06.350> work<00:03:06.500> right<00:03:06.680> back<00:03:06.920> over

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.280 

and<00:03:12.859> it<00:03:13.280> all<00:03:13.400> blends<00:03:13.670> out<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.690> again<00:03:14.959> don't

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
and it all blends out but again don't

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.620 
and it all blends out but again don't
work<00:03:15.530> too<00:03:15.829> huge<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.549> start<00:03:16.820> with<00:03:17.000> or<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.329> will

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
work too huge to start with or you will

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.530 
work too huge to start with or you will
not<00:03:18.290> be<00:03:18.590> happy<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.820> anyway<00:03:20.150> I'm<00:03:20.269> going<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.450> show

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
with a towel the biggest difference with

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.759 
with a towel the biggest difference with
the<00:03:25.850> towel<00:03:26.060> instead<00:03:27.019> it's<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.290> whole<00:03:27.530> lot

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
keep them wet longer the trays meet

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.790 
keep them wet longer the trays meet
trays<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:14.420> vegetable<00:04:14.900> trays<00:04:15.110> all<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.530> stuff

works really well for all of your

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.020 
works really well for all of your
pallets<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:17.720> stuff<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:19.160> anyway<00:04:19.280> with<00:04:19.850> the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
pallets and stuff so anyway with the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.789 
pallets and stuff so anyway with the
towel<00:04:20.239> as<00:04:20.510> smooth<00:04:20.810> as<00:04:20.959> possible<00:04:21.019> watch<00:04:21.530> out

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
towel as smooth as possible watch out

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.460 
towel as smooth as possible watch out
for<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.070> edges<00:04:22.490> here<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:23.960> over<00:04:24.140> it<00:04:24.320> if

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
for the edges here you can go over it if

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.320 
for the edges here you can go over it if
they<00:04:24.560> do<00:04:24.620> hit<00:04:24.950> but<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.610> want<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:25.850> kind<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.120> try

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
they do hit but you want to kind of try

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.480 
they do hit but you want to kind of try
to<00:04:26.360> tuck<00:04:26.630> them<00:04:26.810> under<00:04:27.110> at<00:04:27.740> least<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:28.100> little<00:04:28.250> bit

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
to tuck them under at least a little bit

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.330 
to tuck them under at least a little bit
and<00:04:28.730> so<00:04:29.480> you<00:04:29.900> basically<00:04:30.080> do<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.710> Zac<00:04:31.100> same

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
and so you basically do the Zac same

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.520 
and so you basically do the Zac same
thing<00:04:32.470> now<00:04:33.470> with<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:33.980> with<00:04:34.490> your<00:04:34.790> actual

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
thing now with this with your actual

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.140 
thing now with this with your actual
towel<00:04:36.530> what<00:04:36.980> will<00:04:37.130> happen<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.670> it<00:04:37.910> will<00:04:37.940> start

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
towel what will happen is it will start

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.400 
towel what will happen is it will start
to<00:04:38.390> accumulate<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:38.930> I'm<00:04:39.020> going<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.200> do<00:04:39.290> this

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
to accumulate and I'm going to do this

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.910 
to accumulate and I'm going to do this
again

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
again

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.490 
again
it'll<00:04:40.580> accumulate<00:04:41.180> more<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:41.450> more<00:04:41.630> glaze<00:04:42.140> and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
it'll accumulate more and more glaze and

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.280 
it'll accumulate more and more glaze and
get<00:04:43.370> really<00:04:43.670> thick<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.150> gloppy<00:04:44.480> so<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:44.990> will

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
get really thick and gloppy so you will

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.700 
get really thick and gloppy so you will
have<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.590> change<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:47.110> relatively<00:04:48.110> frequently

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
have to change it relatively frequently

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.400 
have to change it relatively frequently
once<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.760> gets<00:04:49.910> really<00:04:50.120> thick<00:04:50.450> and<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:51.200> mean

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
once it gets really thick and I mean

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.850 
once it gets really thick and I mean
thick<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:53.830> just<00:04:54.830> want<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.100> show<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.400> again

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
thick so I just want to show you again

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.250 
thick so I just want to show you again
on<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.920> little<00:04:58.340> sample<00:04:58.820> like<00:04:58.970> this<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.900> fine

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
on a little sample like this it's fine

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.890 
on a little sample like this it's fine
if<00:05:00.560> you're<00:05:01.130> doing<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.760> room<00:05:02.300> that's<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.600> size

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
if you're doing a room that's the size

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.450 
if you're doing a room that's the size
of<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.140> living<00:05:03.410> room<00:05:03.590> you're<00:05:04.100> going<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.310> go

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
of a living room you're going to go

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.920 
of a living room you're going to go
through<00:05:04.640> a<00:05:04.700> couple<00:05:04.910> of<00:05:05.180> towels<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:05.690> won't<00:05:05.870> be

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
through a couple of towels you won't be

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.150 
through a couple of towels you won't be
able<00:05:06.020> to<00:05:06.080> go<00:05:06.170> through<00:05:06.320> one<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.960> basically

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
able to go through one so basically

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.370 
able to go through one so basically
that's<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:11.000> know<00:05:11.120> using<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.630> towel<00:05:11.870> versus

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
that's you know using the towel versus

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.140 
that's you know using the towel versus
the<00:05:12.410> brush<00:05:12.800> they're<00:05:13.160> pretty<00:05:13.460> don't<00:05:13.760> they're

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
the brush they're pretty don't they're

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.170 
the brush they're pretty don't they're
pretty<00:05:14.450> close<00:05:14.780> on<00:05:15.050> most<00:05:15.290> instances<00:05:16.040> now<00:05:16.970> as

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
pretty close on most instances now as

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.730 
pretty close on most instances now as
you<00:05:17.300> can<00:05:17.419> see<00:05:17.660> where<00:05:17.870> it's<00:05:18.080> darker<00:05:18.560> in<00:05:18.590> the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
you can see where it's darker in the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.590 
you can see where it's darker in the
center<00:05:19.250> or<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.640> just<00:05:19.820> messed<00:05:20.210> up<00:05:20.360> they're

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
center or I just messed up they're

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:28.240 
center or I just messed up they're
hitting<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.140> you<00:05:21.980> dab<00:05:22.220> your<00:05:22.580> brush<00:05:26.980> to<00:05:27.980> try

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
hitting that you dab your brush to try

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.090 
hitting that you dab your brush to try
to<00:05:28.310> get<00:05:28.580> rid<00:05:28.820> of<00:05:28.850> that<00:05:29.120> line<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:30.410> same<00:05:30.740> thing

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
to get rid of that line the same thing

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.530 
to get rid of that line the same thing
works<00:05:32.770> when<00:05:33.770> you're<00:05:33.950> doing<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.430> in<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.640> edges

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
works when you're doing it in the edges

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.659 
works when you're doing it in the edges
so<00:05:35.960> like<00:05:36.200> let's<00:05:36.440> say<00:05:36.650> you're<00:05:37.010> actually<00:05:37.220> your

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
so like let's say you're actually your

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.600 
so like let's say you're actually your
you're<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.900> edge<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.230> your<00:05:39.290> wall<00:05:39.500> is<00:05:39.650> here<00:05:40.010> you

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
you're the edge of your wall is here you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.250 
you're the edge of your wall is here you
will<00:05:40.640> need<00:05:40.880> this<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.830> dab<00:05:42.830> into<00:05:43.160> that<00:05:43.760> space

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
will need this to dab into that space

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.230 
will need this to dab into that space
same<00:05:45.260> thing<00:05:45.500> with<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.710> corners<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.370> can't<00:05:47.060> do

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
same thing with the corners you can't do

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.610 
same thing with the corners you can't do
it<00:05:47.300> with<00:05:47.419> this<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.870> you<00:05:47.960> can't<00:05:48.230> do<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:48.470> with

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
it with this and you can't do it with

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.200 
it with this and you can't do it with
this<00:05:48.800> they'll<00:05:49.160> just<00:05:49.340> smush<00:05:49.610> right<00:05:49.880> into

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
this they'll just smush right into

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.050 
this they'll just smush right into
everything<00:05:50.630> so<00:05:51.190> that<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.340> a<00:05:52.370> these<00:05:52.850> are<00:05:52.880> all

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
everything so that is a these are all

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.880 
everything so that is a these are all
useful<00:05:53.390> tools<00:05:53.840> for<00:05:53.960> doing<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.350> stippling<00:05:54.770> and

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
useful tools for doing a stippling and

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.710 
useful tools for doing a stippling and
making<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.280> look<00:05:55.340> really<00:05:55.400> cool<00:05:55.640> you<00:05:56.300> can<00:05:56.330> make

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
making it look really cool you can make
