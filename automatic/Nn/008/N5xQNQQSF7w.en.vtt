see this would be this would be a clan
see<00:01:03.479> that<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.719> probably<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.470> seed<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.810> probably

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
see that was probably a seed in probably

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.540 
see that was probably a seed in probably
March<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.830> been<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.070> spreaded

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
March it would have been and spreaded

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.140 
March it would have been and spreaded
about<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> quarter<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.450> inch<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.840> size<00:01:09.870> and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
about a quarter of an inch in size and

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.730 
about a quarter of an inch in size and
it's<00:01:12.150> grown<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.050> guess<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:13.530> probably

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it's grown up to I guess that's probably

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.650 
it's grown up to I guess that's probably
half<00:01:14.070> three-quarters<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.940> an<00:01:15.150> inch<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.600> size

here now then who else you got well then
these<00:01:19.860> these<00:01:20.280> clamps<00:01:20.580> were<00:01:21.090> probably<00:01:21.510> seated

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
these these clamps were probably seated

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.860 
these these clamps were probably seated
here<00:01:22.410> a<00:01:22.470> year<00:01:22.770> ago<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:27.090> these<00:01:27.540> clams

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
here a year ago and then the these clams

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.610 
here a year ago and then the these clams
it's<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.710> little<00:01:28.980> hard<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> tell<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:30.590> they<00:01:31.590> were

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
it's a little hard to tell if they were

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.130 
it's a little hard to tell if they were
probably<00:01:31.890> seated<00:01:32.340> two<00:01:32.520> years<00:01:32.760> ago<00:01:32.970> okay<00:01:33.690> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
probably seated two years ago okay so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
probably seated two years ago okay so
those<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.560> big<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:34.890> big<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.190> they<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.550> well

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
those are big how big do they get well

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.570 
those are big how big do they get well
they'll<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.380> let's<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.920> dad<00:01:38.160> if<00:01:38.460> you
