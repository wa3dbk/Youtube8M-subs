cooking well an induction cooktop uses a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.010 
cooking well an induction cooktop uses a
magnetic<00:00:26.220> coil<00:00:26.520> which<00:00:26.820> transfers<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.630> energy

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
magnetic coil which transfers the energy

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.140 
magnetic coil which transfers the energy
directly<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> base<00:00:29.430> of<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> saucepan

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
directly to the base of the saucepan

four to five hours at a very very gentle

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.900 
four to five hours at a very very gentle
heat<00:01:34.680> it'll<00:01:35.160> look<00:01:35.370> like<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:35.610> block<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
heat it'll look like a block of

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.460 
heat it'll look like a block of
chocolate<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.690> second<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.110> touch<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
chocolate but the second you touch it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
chocolate but the second you touch it
with<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.620> spoon<00:01:37.980> it'll<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.850> fall<00:01:39.060> apart

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
with a spoon it'll just fall apart

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.260 
with a spoon it'll just fall apart
that's<00:01:40.140> how<00:01:40.440> gentle<00:01:40.890> induction<00:01:41.340> cooktop<00:01:41.790> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
that's how gentle induction cooktop can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:52.970 
that's how gentle induction cooktop can
maintain<00:01:42.479> heat

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.070 

so<00:01:53.670> there's<00:01:53.850> some<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.240> key<00:01:54.390> features<00:01:54.420> and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
so there's some of the key features and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.080 
so there's some of the key features and
benefits<00:01:55.230> of<00:01:55.620> induction<00:01:55.920> cooking<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.580> hope<00:01:56.970> you
