00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
mixed opinions on the one hand those who

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.969 
mixed opinions on the one hand those who
have<00:02:01.509> never<00:02:01.659> played<00:02:01.899> eight<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.409> now<00:02:02.500> do<00:02:02.560> so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
have never played eight can now do so

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.499 
have never played eight can now do so
but<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.670> other<00:02:03.729> hand<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:04.149> doesn't

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
but on the other hand this doesn't

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.550 
but on the other hand this doesn't
really<00:02:04.630> seem<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.840> add<00:02:05.020> much<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.469> way<00:02:05.500> of

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
really seem to add much in the way of

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.620

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
replay value so it's not really bringing

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.419 
replay value so it's not really bringing
