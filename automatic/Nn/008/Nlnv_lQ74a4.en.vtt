 work because good of Santander 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.560
 we will not lose importance of this world 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800
 South well is presented 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.870
 what's 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.710
 if you basically choose the impression because good to the study of a body to 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.260
 the veneer that sheet directing a poor or much more had broken at the time of 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.360
 make the painting are chosen precisely so that all the rest 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.810
 after the victory of much more 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.310
 soft 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 if what you are looking for with airbrush your good beauty precisely the block 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.149
 we have to be also with the basketball material 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.239
 the leader of the realization process that is due a floor for this work 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.429
 it was all advanced 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.339
 as steps to paint 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:28.259
 generally the kiss was a background all the tones are very similar to each other at 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.669
 be working, manuel sada the process of doing 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.790
 all the bottom first and start to highlight contours 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.409
 it makes us bring the image is a 0-1 on the scoreboard 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.120
 because he did not use a blessing because the guarapo of a person 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:50.249
 very smooth volumes is not a robot that is not going to give a cut lasted by means of 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.299
 a gale 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.979
 jose bono we worked from the state 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.079
 the stroke will be much more useful much smoother 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.679
 and when it comes to achieving a skin 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.729
 we go this one is used and that rise that has the body 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.359
 and now the project with a overhead projector commander the size of 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:07.870
 the rivers 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.859
 illustration 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.009
 this is presented are passed outlines 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.779
 and then 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:19.059
 is to work the advanced and staff employees and heals in Rome having 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.609
 what the activist is about the transfer of days a grid 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.519
 lilia bejarano 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.709
 the New York market at the time 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.209
 In this way, what I do is speed up the work 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.889
 Too much faster 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.439
 measure 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.219
 nothing has been the same 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.219
 enough for 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.249
 at the time of work 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.899
 itself but to be clear we will be in two years we will do and be able 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.029
 observe 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:57.309
 against a decade the price in this range that are fundamental what has not 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.469
 given the image something very realistic 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:01.819
 It varies a lot 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.639
 when they changed positions that each one played 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.839
 or a light a probe follows 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:11.439
 all lights based watching many fear giving everything that you are seeing from a 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.029
 real photography 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.999
 what he has done in a particularly 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.449
 p additionally this 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.789
 all the research that has been done for 20 years 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.729
 in each process of what was expected and working this service doing what 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.099
 is taking out the sector has dedicated to painting 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.099
 All the material you are using are long which 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.680
 they do a spray when I came back and that I returned only two of subtracting power but the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.870
 definition of your regulator always always always balear or add up so 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.400
 for now everything I've done is giving a service 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.690
 this one expressly to know that I will be symbol said that he will give me a 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.250
 impurity on the surface the chamba that happens with the theme of the cloth 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.770
 monterrey one of the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.490
 Towers for your friend 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.210
 by white bassem and lighter shades up back to the lights 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.960
 I think it healed like rosso 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.120
 and thus achieve 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.240
 wrinkles 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.740
 but it has been fundamental that we take into account where we are presenting the 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.069
 light 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.830
 paint more options from behind 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.830
 that is going to be what will make the image take off 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.889
 Laura 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.749
 each entry and exit work 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.529
 it costs to detach 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.610
 I wish I could have a lot of local lots of things that you have to 

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:41.309
 good that I did and that to everything it deposits a joke 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.789
 to even now unlike a person who sells something efe pacho 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.059
 and this is not going to depor corpacho steam studio 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:53.740
 one more question 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.170
 more rooted mm there is nothing that one is painting is lending 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.869
 very much 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:04.429
 the eyes that jump by sounded to reflect what he has done at that moment 

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:06.520
 pulse 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.169
 It is the desire of 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.990
 of happiness that I want your home to have 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.009
 st
