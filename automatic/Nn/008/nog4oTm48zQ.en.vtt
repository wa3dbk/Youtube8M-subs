00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.429
 it is now for the treasure hunt and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.719
 yesterday I could not record because 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.880
 I was with my friend and we 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.360
 BBQ was with a colleague and we 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 had a great day and yes because of that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.390
 i could also be sorry though 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.250
 I think all of us have that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.619
 get the warm up for home direct 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.350
 at the back of the tunnel where still here at the back 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.480
 not the new card has been expanded 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.080
 is and I 'm curious what we are today 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 have to do and we start now 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.260
 where do you look from this you see this building 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.309
 which consists of the cost of all stones 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.809
 today the treasure is in the area 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.129
 I just hid those 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 please give notice sweetheart 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.930
 turn around to me okay that is now 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.820
 again a big mystery yesterday 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.030
 It was very easy for me that I had 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.500
 then quickly search out the treasure 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.480
 Hidden system where you are on sweet 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.739
 this building is the largest of all 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.420
 stones up what's with the lock it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.650
 is gray you can actually see it from 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.760
 everywhere or not 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.450
 Let's ride there and have a look 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.610
 I'm curious 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.479
 So it really fits it is gray 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.740
 is big and you can see it everywhere 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.740
 take a look and have a look 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.970
 I have to do that on my own 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.840
 So here I have no tips so that is 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.369
 it's not online from my friends list 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.939
 That's why I have to do it myself now 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.799

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.700
 looks bad 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.670
 okay okay the lock it seems 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.930
 not to be 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.619
 but it is not down somehow 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.060
 in the frame without wisdom never that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:57.899
 mechanically doll carriage means down 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:02.869
