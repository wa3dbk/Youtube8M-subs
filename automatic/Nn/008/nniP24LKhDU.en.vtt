that<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.119> spinning<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> first<00:00:28.949> what

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that it's not spinning so first what

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009 
that it's not spinning so first what
we're<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> go<00:00:29.699> ahead<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.970> put<00:00:30.900> on

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
we're going to do is go ahead and put on

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.150 
we're going to do is go ahead and put on
the<00:00:31.140> spin<00:00:31.380> cycle<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.130> actually

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the spin cycle to see if it actually

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:54.300 
the spin cycle to see if it actually
does<00:00:32.669> spin

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.100 

okay<00:00:55.310> firstly<00:00:55.760> down<00:00:55.970> so<00:00:56.570> it's<00:00:56.690> not<00:00:56.809> spinning

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
okay firstly down so it's not spinning

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.229 
okay firstly down so it's not spinning
first<00:00:57.830> thing<00:00:57.980> we<00:00:58.070> want<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.280> do<00:00:58.400> is<00:00:58.550> pop<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.090> off

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
first thing we want to do is pop the off

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.660 
first thing we want to do is pop the off
let<00:00:59.600> some<00:00:59.750> panel<00:01:00.080> off<00:01:00.200> there's<00:01:00.950> two<00:01:01.100> mushrooms

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
let some panel off there's two mushrooms

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.079 
let some panel off there's two mushrooms
out<00:01:01.879> flips<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.570> hold<00:01:02.840> upon<00:01:03.080> panel<00:01:03.440> on<00:01:04.089> want

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
out flips that hold upon panel on want

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.030 
out flips that hold upon panel on want
to<00:01:05.150> go<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.360> locate<00:01:05.540> them<00:01:08.229> let's<00:01:09.229> locate<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.830> go

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
to go and locate them let's locate it go

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:24.960 
to go and locate them let's locate it go
ahead<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.310> push<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.900> pull<00:01:11.900> out

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.300 

without<00:01:25.210> spinning<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:26.680> I've<00:01:26.800> found<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:27.250> far

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
without spinning what I've found so far

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.160 
without spinning what I've found so far
is<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.700> on<00:01:28.030> these<00:01:28.150> wire<00:01:28.390> connection<00:01:28.900> on<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
is that on these wire connection on the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.170 
is that on these wire connection on the
motor<00:01:29.350> itself<00:01:29.740> knowledge<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.730> from<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.000> age

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
motor itself knowledge is from the age

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.720 
motor itself knowledge is from the age
and<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.600> vibration<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.950> up<00:01:33.130> should<00:01:33.370> loose<00:01:33.580> a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
and the vibration it up should loose a

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.130 
and the vibration it up should loose a
little

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
little

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.380 
little
so<00:01:34.680> what<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:35.040> gonna<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.310> about

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.969 

again<00:01:41.540> okay<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:43.320> we're<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.800> fill

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
again okay now we're just going to fill

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.330 
again okay now we're just going to fill
up<00:01:44.130> water<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.740> small<00:01:46.740> slowed<00:01:47.100> size

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
up water just see a small slowed size

00:01:47.340 --> 00:02:00.950 
up water just see a small slowed size
here

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.720 

the<00:02:01.410> right<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.830> we're<00:02:01.950> doing<00:02:02.160> is<00:02:02.280> we're

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
the right now what we're doing is we're

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.280 
the right now what we're doing is we're
rebuilding<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.390> water<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> hand<00:02:04.080> wash

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
rebuilding the water on a hand wash

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.570 
rebuilding the water on a hand wash
cycle<00:02:04.740> fill<00:02:05.400> up<00:02:05.550> some<00:02:05.670> water<00:02:05.730> looks<00:02:06.660> like

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
cycle fill up some water looks like

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580 
cycle fill up some water looks like
looks<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.820> was<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.380> we're

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
looks like it was up here so now we're

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.850 
looks like it was up here so now we're
just<00:02:10.710> training<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.070> out<00:02:11.270> when<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.420> does<00:02:12.570> Oh

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
just training it out when it does Oh

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
just training it out when it does Oh
spin<00:02:13.860> cycle<00:02:14.250> antenna<00:02:14.520> drain<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:14.880> most<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
spin cycle antenna drain out most of the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.530 
spin cycle antenna drain out most of the
water<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.080> Joel

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
water and Joel

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.539 
water and Joel
in<00:02:17.959> there<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.409> then<00:02:18.590> it'll<00:02:18.769> start<00:02:19.069> wrapping<00:02:19.430> up

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
in there so then it'll start wrapping up

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.280 
in there so then it'll start wrapping up
and<00:02:19.730> spin<00:02:20.030> then<00:02:20.209> it'll<00:02:20.420> stop<00:02:20.629> again

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
and spin then it'll stop again

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.459 
and spin then it'll stop again
a<00:02:21.319> lot<00:02:21.859> of<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.980> water<00:02:22.129> is<00:02:22.250> set<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.670> bottom

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
a lot of the water is set to the bottom

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.929 
a lot of the water is set to the bottom
to<00:02:24.469> spin<00:02:24.799> again<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.219> do<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.400> same<00:02:25.579> thing<00:02:25.819> as

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
to spin again and do the same thing as

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.069 
to spin again and do the same thing as
going<00:02:26.090> straight<00:02:26.480> all<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.659> way

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
going straight all the way

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.569 
going straight all the way
once<00:02:27.439> it's<00:02:27.650> trained<00:02:27.890> all<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.040> way<00:02:28.219> it<00:02:28.489> will

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
once it's trained all the way it will

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.660 
once it's trained all the way it will
continue<00:02:28.700> with<00:02:29.120> high-speed<00:02:29.540> spin<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.980> when<00:02:31.579> we

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
continue with high-speed spin so when we

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.459 
continue with high-speed spin so when we
come<00:02:31.879> up<00:02:31.909> this<00:02:32.120> washer<00:02:32.569> today<00:02:32.689> was<00:02:33.079> there<00:02:33.379> was

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
come up this washer today was there was

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.530 
come up this washer today was there was
a<00:02:33.500> loose<00:02:33.680> wire

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
a loose wire

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.270 
a loose wire
we<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:36.019> push<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.379> wire<00:02:36.500> terminal<00:02:36.950> all<00:02:37.129> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
we just push the wire terminal all the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.339 
we just push the wire terminal all the
way<00:02:37.340> through<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.700> lowest<00:02:38.000> connector<00:02:38.540> make

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
way through the lowest connector make

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.990 
way through the lowest connector make
sure<00:02:39.379> that<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.860> would<00:02:40.010> seat<00:02:40.310> properly<00:02:40.819> into

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
sure that it would seat properly into

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.690 
sure that it would seat properly into
the<00:02:41.060> motor<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.900> now<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:43.010> dispensed<00:02:43.430> beam

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
the motor so now we have dispensed beam

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.300 
the motor so now we have dispensed beam
it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
it

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.890 
it
that<00:02:45.940> will<00:02:46.060> take<00:02:46.209> care<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.569> problem<00:02:48.900> thank

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
that will take care of a problem thank
