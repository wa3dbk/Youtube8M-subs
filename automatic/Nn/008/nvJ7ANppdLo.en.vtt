00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello my name is Vladimir I 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.040
 specialist organization provided 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.719
 like Zaporizhia 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.049
 today we have a volkswagen car 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 touran 2013 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.440
 two - liter turbo diesel means host 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.240
 this car turned burden 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.070
 workshop you use will protect you 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.279
 mobile from theft and or charge on it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.080
 winter warming but not the way 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.740
 implementation of remote start a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.500
 by 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.890
 rewind regular installed 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.450
 autonomous heater webasto which 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.130
 default let's say so factory 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.020
 picking only works in hit 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.790
 we mode that is only when running 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.920
 engine that is after the product 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.770
 we have work this regular heater 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.520
 that is, it became full and it can 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.180
 export 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.830
 separately here I am running the engine 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.190
 there is information everything is working was the call 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.320
 on the regular buttons means the car is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.570
 how does the whole aggregate figure us 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 keep mx red all this work 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.260
 in the following way 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.130
 it means the production takes place 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.150
 keychain that is then locked 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.080
 pieces of glass that is car but it 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.110
 fully protection means activation 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.720
 autonomous heater in the bass possible 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.399
 thriller in various ways that is 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.200
 the first way is activation 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.149
 what is the staff keychain car 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.700
 volkswagen i.e. country pushing 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.530
 buttons to lock that is exactly the same goes 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.909
 activation ie side pressing 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.509
 buttons from before means 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 the second is heater activation by 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.780
 open reception of regular buttons that is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.399
 which is inside the car if the owner 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.979
 car is inside he can 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.479
 without starting the engine, that is, if it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.540
 waiting for someone in the car that is either 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.670
 need him winter time 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.460
 stay inside the car that is like 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.070
 be without starting the engine, it can 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.330
 keep the salon warm to her 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.570
 the engine also warms up exactly and then 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.370
 the third way to activate it is by 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.680
 mobile device via mobile 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.300
 car owner phone gives the command 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.050
 Ie calls on security complex 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.540
 exelent give the command that is happening 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.730
 activation either on duty march autonomous 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.230
 heater webasto means showing how 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.370
 working car is in security 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.810
 from a regular remote control autonomous heater 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.640
 activated that is secrets by pressing 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:37.560
 buttons to lock when the car is in 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.760
 protection shows 1 3 see that 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.920
 windshield 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.050
 that is, the indicator lights up 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.030
 LED means autonomous 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.260
 the heater has started ie it will be 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.030
 warm up the engine and will sell 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.820
 that is, on the heating of the show where to me that is 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.560
 how it happens there is running 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.840
 autonomous heater through the host 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.660
 car from default running time 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.340
 heater you slept for 30 minutes it can 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.659
 this time may vary by 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.560
 10 minutes to two hours means when here 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:19.750
 we hear that the heater is working 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.750
 car owner without protection 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.780
 getting into the car here we see that 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.300
 everything works off until 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.520
 the shield is silent, that is, it works only 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.130
 air conditioning and that is 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.420
 blowout occurs interior that is as though 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.570
 Initially climate control when 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.350
 activation of the autonomous dog heater 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.360
 turns on in that mode 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.980
 in which she was left after 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.860
 engine shutdown pre 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.959
 so in this case we are now seeing 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.950
 what happens the system works in 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.380
 auto mode 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.500
 she was left in it therefore in 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.100
 In this case, the engine is warming up first 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.810
 what is he doing 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.760
 regular air conditioning system 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.010
 installed it warms up the windshield 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.310
 the glass after which one switches to 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.090
 legs 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.330
 well, or if it remains sealed 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.859
 stop and and will leave in another condition 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.760
 that is, it will turn on in that state in 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.300
 where does she mean us now 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.460
 autonomous occurs blowing means 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.680
 switching off the autonomous heater 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.979
 it also happens war can it 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.680
 turn off triple tap well or 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.600
 as follows angel host 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.919
 comes he needs to go he is 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.919
 includes ignition 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.360
 then after the ignition is turned off 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.400
 are we an autonomous heater 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.770
 turns off means the second option means 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.410
 This is the activation of the regular heater when 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.110
 mobile help, I guess you don't need it 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.090
 in the demonstration and the second option which 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.220
 I would like to show it inside 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.590
 car when the car owner to 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.720
 example he needs some time let's say 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.280
 so in the winter time to stay in the car 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.850
 but at the same time, how not to spend 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.740
 resources to run that is to run 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.770
 engine so being inside 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.050
 car that is it can regular 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.180
 buttons namely the lock button on 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.470
 driver's door that is pressing and 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.430
 hold for more than two seconds that is after 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.110
 this happens 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.210
 we see that the climate started 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.640
 installation and autonomous heater also 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.640
 starts that is 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.330
 Well, that's all
