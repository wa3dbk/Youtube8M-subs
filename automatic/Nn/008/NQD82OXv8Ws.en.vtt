00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
special holidays that are coming up I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.380 
special holidays that are coming up I
was<00:00:28.050> hoping<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.250> would<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
was hoping that they would do the that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.299 
was hoping that they would do the that
event<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:31.289> actually<00:00:31.619> change<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> event

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
event or actually change the event

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.060 
event or actually change the event
around<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.850> obviously<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
around because obviously you know the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.910 
around because obviously you know the
only<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.550> person<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:38.309> sword<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
only one person can get this sword and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
only one person can get this sword and
obviously<00:00:40.920> you're<00:00:41.399> competing<00:00:41.700> with<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.059> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
obviously you're competing with a lot of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
obviously you're competing with a lot of
people<00:00:42.540> i<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.379> there's<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> million

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
people i know there's not like a million

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.810 
people i know there's not like a million
people<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.450> feels<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
people but I you know feels like it and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.720 
people but I you know feels like it and
I<00:00:48.379> just<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> wrong<00:00:50.070> way<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> go

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
I just think that's the wrong way to go

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
I just think that's the wrong way to go
but<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.420> let's<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
but we're here let's take a look at the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.670 
but we're here let's take a look at the
event<00:00:52.770> info<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> comp<00:00:54.180> secret<00:00:54.870> part

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
event info this is the comp secret part

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.049 
event info this is the comp secret part
1<00:00:56.899> again<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.859> event<00:00:59.340> these

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
1 again I do think this event these

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.750 
1 again I do think this event these
events<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.140> are<00:01:01.350> hard<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.729> yeah<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
events like this are hard and yeah a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
events like this are hard and yeah a
bunch<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> stuff<00:01:06.510> milestone<00:01:07.229> rewards<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.950> don't

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
bunch of stuff milestone rewards I don't

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.000 
bunch of stuff milestone rewards I don't
think<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> rewards<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.119> handsome<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
think the rewards are as handsome as it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.690 
think the rewards are as handsome as it
used<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.880> used<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.750> better<00:01:13.700> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
used to be it used to be much better and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.899 
used to be it used to be much better and
get<00:01:14.909> back<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.610> see<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.790> have

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
and definitely not going to go in there
with<00:01:52.500> bumblebee<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.250> guess<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.119> might<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.360> well

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
with bumblebee I guess we might as well

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
with bumblebee I guess we might as well
go<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.110> with<00:01:55.229> iron<00:01:55.500> hi<00:01:55.829> let's<00:01:56.159> try

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
go in there with iron hi let's try

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.920 
go in there with iron hi let's try
Ironhide<00:01:58.009> now<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> events<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.780> they

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
Ironhide now I like the events but they

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.690 
Ironhide now I like the events but they
gotta<00:02:01.200> make<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.500> easier<00:02:02.360> obviously<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:04.320> not

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
gotta make it easier obviously it's not

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.540 
gotta make it easier obviously it's not
doing<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> well<00:02:06.500> because<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.039> events<00:02:08.429> are

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
doing that well because the events are

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.290 
doing that well because the events are
too<00:02:08.700> hard<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:09.959> rewarding<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
too hard it's not rewarding I think

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.880 
too hard it's not rewarding I think
that's<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.840> thing<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.200> bothers

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
that's one thing that bothers

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:32.000 
that's one thing that bothers
people

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.580 

all<00:02:32.670> right<00:02:32.819> I'm<00:02:33.299> pretty<00:02:33.720> sure<00:02:33.959> we<00:02:34.110> will<00:02:34.349> get

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
all right I'm pretty sure we will get

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.429 
all right I'm pretty sure we will get
3,000<00:02:35.400> scored<00:02:35.700> isn't<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.209> high<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.840> don't

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
3,000 scored isn't that high I don't

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.569 
3,000 scored isn't that high I don't
think<00:02:37.500> they're<00:02:37.769> going<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.950> make<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.280> change

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
think they're going to make the change

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.630 
think they're going to make the change
the<00:02:38.970> game<00:02:39.200> because<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.769> movie<00:02:41.220> has<00:02:41.459> been

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
the game because the movie has been

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.839 
the game because the movie has been
released<00:02:41.909> for<00:02:42.260> roughly<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.409> year<00:02:43.530> now<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.370> it's

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
released for roughly a year now and it's

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.509 
released for roughly a year now and it's
really<00:02:45.030> hard<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.870> push<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.920> game<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> new

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
really hard to push the game to a new

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.460 
really hard to push the game to a new
level<00:02:47.790> or<00:02:48.060> actually<00:02:48.480> change<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> entire

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
level or actually change the entire

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.589 
level or actually change the entire
mechanics<00:02:50.129> around<00:02:50.370> because<00:02:51.090> most<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
mechanics around because most of the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.800 
mechanics around because most of the
events<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.620> essentially<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.629> know

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
events are essentially just I don't know

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.110 
events are essentially just I don't know
it's<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.829> like<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.489> been<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.940> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
it's just like that it's been like that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.509 
it's just like that it's been like that
for<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.629> long<00:02:57.840> time<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.650> me<00:02:58.799> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
for a very long time and to me the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.849 
for a very long time and to me the
events<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.030> hardly<00:03:00.329> join<00:03:00.659> them<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.019> if<00:03:01.379> I<00:03:01.530> join

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
events I hardly join them and if I join

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.470 
events I hardly join them and if I join
them<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.780> only<00:03:03.780> play<00:03:04.220> for<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.489> bonuses<00:03:06.180> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
them I only play for the bonuses the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.140 
them I only play for the bonuses the
milestone<00:03:07.079> bonuses<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.709> never<00:03:08.069> play<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
milestone bonuses I never play to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.020 
milestone bonuses I never play to
compete<00:03:09.569> with<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.810> other<00:03:09.840> players<00:03:11.030> because

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
compete with the other players because

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.390 
compete with the other players because
one<00:03:12.299> person<00:03:12.840> out<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.049> like<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> lot<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.040> people

think I should do that you know making a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.819 
think I should do that you know making a
little<00:03:40.650> run<00:03:40.829> it's<00:03:41.579> kind<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:41.970> weird<00:03:42.560> go<00:03:43.560> on<00:03:43.650> in

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
little run it's kind of weird go on in

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:51.110 
little run it's kind of weird go on in
here<00:03:48.379> yeah<00:03:49.379> anyways<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.370> pretty<00:03:50.849> much<00:03:51.060> it

fact in fact I I stopped playing or I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
played it much less than before due to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.909 
played it much less than before due to
the<00:04:03.239> event<00:04:03.540> because<00:04:04.019> every<00:04:04.260> time<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.470> look<00:04:04.769> at

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
the event because every time I look at

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.439 
the event because every time I look at
this<00:04:05.099> thing<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.609> know<00:04:05.669> that<00:04:06.030> I'm<00:04:06.120> not<00:04:06.150> gonna

get there I'm just saying why even try
that's<00:04:11.099> essentially<00:04:11.730> what<00:04:11.910> i<00:04:11.940> say<00:04:12.359> i<00:04:12.599> think<00:04:12.870> a

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
that's essentially what i say i think a

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.899 
that's essentially what i say i think a
lot<00:04:13.199> of<00:04:13.230> people<00:04:13.349> say<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.949> as<00:04:14.160> well<00:04:14.400> why<00:04:14.669> even

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
lot of people say that as well why even

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.120 
lot of people say that as well why even
try<00:04:15.090> because<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.629> difficult<00:04:16.109> but<00:04:16.829> anyways

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
try because it difficult but anyways

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.920 
try because it difficult but anyways
that<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.400> about<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.510> little<00:04:18.539> news

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.560 
haven't leveled up ironhide in fact is
he<00:04:26.070> still<00:04:26.280> at<00:04:26.400> level<00:04:26.669> 10<00:04:26.960> we<00:04:27.960> could<00:04:28.139> use<00:04:28.169> some

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
he still at level 10 we could use some

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.310 
he still at level 10 we could use some
shards<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.810> upgrade<00:04:31.199> him<00:04:32.990> all<00:04:33.990> right<00:04:34.110> let's

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
shards to upgrade him all right let's

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.490 
shards to upgrade him all right let's
upgrade<00:04:34.470> him<00:04:34.770> once<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:36.080> don't<00:04:37.080> think<00:04:37.260> we<00:04:37.380> need
