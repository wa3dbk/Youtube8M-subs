during<00:00:10.730> a<00:00:10.970> darkness<00:00:11.660> all<00:00:12.520> I'm<00:00:13.520> gonna<00:00:13.730> begin<00:00:13.969> by

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
during a darkness all I'm gonna begin by

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.480 
during a darkness all I'm gonna begin by
doing<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:15.559> I<00:00:15.650> will<00:00:15.710> shape<00:00:16.570> I'm<00:00:17.570> using<00:00:17.810> dots

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
doing and I will shape I'm using dots

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.350 
doing and I will shape I'm using dots
mat<00:00:19.490> that<00:00:19.700> much<00:00:19.939> light<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:22.490> I'm<00:00:22.670> also<00:00:22.849> using<00:00:23.029> a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.990 

you're<00:00:49.650> creating<00:00:50.130> links<00:00:50.460> which<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.670> look

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you're creating links which will look

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.170 
you're creating links which will look
like<00:00:51.180> stubby<00:00:51.810> fingers

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.630

wavy line draw and the need the waving
line<00:01:33.870> will<00:01:34.080> become<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.440> parallel<00:01:34.980> line<00:01:35.190> when

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
line will become a parallel line when

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.170 
line will become a parallel line when
you<00:01:36.240> add<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:36.870> on<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.980> other<00:01:38.010> side<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.730> the

you add it and on the other side of the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.469 
you add it and on the other side of the
dinosaurs<00:01:39.810> neck

using<00:01:48.200> wavy<00:01:48.409> lines<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:49.039> an<00:01:49.189> important

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
using wavy lines is an important

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.840 
using wavy lines is an important
technique<00:01:50.560> can<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.710> see<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.070> space<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.789> I

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
technique can you see the space that I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.179 
technique can you see the space that I
have<00:01:52.880> between<00:01:53.450> watching<00:01:53.659> parallel<00:01:54.350> lines

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
excusing the wavy line technique I'm

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:13.600 
excusing the wavy line technique I'm
going<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.679> draw<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.159> town

the<00:02:37.329> last<00:02:37.540> part<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.739> add<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.310> eyes<00:02:39.489> and

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
the last part is to add the eyes and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
practicing wavy and parallel lines will

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.379 
practicing wavy and parallel lines will
make<00:04:03.799> it<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.219> much<00:04:04.280> easier<00:04:04.519> for<00:04:04.939> you<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.209> draw

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
make it so much easier for you to draw

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.250 
make it so much easier for you to draw
your<00:04:05.420> curved<00:04:05.959> shapes<00:04:07.510> they<00:04:08.510> require<00:04:08.900> some

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
your curved shapes they require some

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.190 
your curved shapes they require some
imagination<00:04:13.329> but<00:04:14.329> it's<00:04:14.510> important<00:04:15.019> to<00:04:15.079> be

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
imagination but it's important to be

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.409 
imagination but it's important to be
able<00:04:15.499> to<00:04:15.590> create<00:04:15.889> bumps<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.699> things<00:04:16.940> as<00:04:17.269> you

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
able to create bumps and things as you

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.050 
able to create bumps and things as you
go<00:04:17.449> around<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.139> skeletons<00:04:21.759> but<00:04:22.759> in<00:04:22.910> the
