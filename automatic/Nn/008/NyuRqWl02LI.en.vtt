running<00:04:01.890> your<00:04:02.070> prototype<00:04:02.730> you've<00:04:03.000> been

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
running your prototype you've been

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.759 
running your prototype you've been
really<00:04:03.600> perfecting<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:04.380> these<00:04:04.560> guys

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
really perfecting it with these guys

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.800 
really perfecting it with these guys
yeah<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.610> right<00:04:06.090> now<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.480> said<00:04:06.540> we're

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
yeah so right now like I said we're

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.509 
yeah so right now like I said we're
running<00:04:06.870> prototype<00:04:07.440> versions<00:04:07.890> which<00:04:08.250> is

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
running prototype versions which is

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.400 
running prototype versions which is
slightly<00:04:09.480> bigger<00:04:09.750> than<00:04:09.900> what<00:04:10.170> we're<00:04:10.290> running

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
slightly bigger than what we're running

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.229 
slightly bigger than what we're running
we're<00:04:10.769> gonna<00:04:10.860> run<00:04:11.070> in<00:04:11.190> production<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.910> it's

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
we're gonna run in production but it's

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.940 
we're gonna run in production but it's
gonna<00:04:12.360> have<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.600> same<00:04:12.870> futures<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.500> have<00:04:13.680> our

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
gonna have the same futures we have our

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.860 
gonna have the same futures we have our
we<00:04:14.670> used<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.880> have<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.030> standalone<00:04:15.330> quick<00:04:15.660> shift

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
we used to have a standalone quick shift

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.479 
we used to have a standalone quick shift
system<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:16.530> pretty<00:04:16.680> much<00:04:16.769> integrate<00:04:17.370> it

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
system that we pretty much integrate it

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.460 
system that we pretty much integrate it
into<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.209> now<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:18.630> three<00:04:18.690> units<00:04:19.260> put<00:04:19.410> it

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
into it so now it's three units put it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.890 
into it so now it's three units put it
into<00:04:19.680> one<00:04:19.919> box<00:04:20.250> which<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> fuel<00:04:21.510> controller

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
into one box which is a fuel controller

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.230 
into one box which is a fuel controller
quick<00:04:22.290> shift<00:04:22.500> system<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.070> tracks<00:04:23.340> control<00:04:23.850> so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
quick shift system and tracks control so

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.650 
quick shift system and tracks control so
you<00:04:24.840> get<00:04:24.960> three<00:04:25.230> units<00:04:25.530> all<00:04:25.680> in<00:04:25.830> one<00:04:26.090> now<00:04:27.090> are

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
you get three units all in one now are

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.120 
you get three units all in one now are
there<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.870> lot<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.169> sensors<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.800> come<00:04:28.980> with

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
there a lot of sensors that come with

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.770 
there a lot of sensors that come with
this<00:04:29.250> traction<00:04:29.730> controller<00:04:30.120> does<00:04:30.450> it<00:04:30.600> pretty

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
this traction controller does it pretty

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.570 
this traction controller does it pretty
much<00:04:30.930> run<00:04:31.200> off<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.530> what<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.040> engine<00:04:32.430> is

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
much run off of what the engine is

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.970 
much run off of what the engine is
telling<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.330> ECU<00:04:33.900> well<00:04:34.320> what<00:04:34.560> we<00:04:34.680> do<00:04:34.830> is

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
telling the ECU well what we do is

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.010 
telling the ECU well what we do is
pretty<00:04:35.130> much<00:04:35.340> read<00:04:35.640> three<00:04:36.030> basic<00:04:36.450> sensors<00:04:36.870> are

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
pretty much read three basic sensors are

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.240 
pretty much read three basic sensors are
on<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.350> bike<00:04:37.560> which<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.950> going<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.130> be<00:04:38.220> a

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
on the bike which is going to be a

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.810 
on the bike which is going to be a
throttle<00:04:38.700> position<00:04:38.820> rpm<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.050> gear<00:04:40.290> position

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
throttle position rpm and gear position

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.490 
throttle position rpm and gear position
each<00:04:41.820> one<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.150> those<00:04:42.240> senses<00:04:42.750> plays<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.169> part

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
each one of those senses plays this part

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.440 
each one of those senses plays this part
just<00:04:44.010> because<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.400> can<00:04:44.610> we're<00:04:44.850> not<00:04:45.000> adding<00:04:45.210> any

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
just because we can we're not adding any

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.030 
just because we can we're not adding any
wheel<00:04:45.660> sensor<00:04:46.110> or<00:04:46.410> any<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.800> type<00:04:47.010> of

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
wheel sensor or any of that type of

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.659 
wheel sensor or any of that type of
stuff<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.400> that's<00:04:48.240> what<00:04:48.450> we're<00:04:48.570> doing

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
stuff so that's what we're doing

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.290 
stuff so that's what we're doing
okay<00:04:50.419> so<00:04:50.479> tell<00:04:50.930> us<00:04:50.960> what<00:04:51.860> bikes<00:04:52.189> your<00:04:52.819> systems

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
okay so tell us what bikes your systems

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.050 
okay so tell us what bikes your systems
are<00:04:53.719> on<00:04:54.259> right<00:04:54.710> now<00:04:54.830> we're<00:04:55.280> focusing<00:04:55.789> on<00:04:55.909> the

are on right now we're focusing on the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.149 
are on right now we're focusing on the
four<00:04:56.270> main<00:04:56.449> manufacturers<00:04:57.169> in<00:04:57.469> the<00:04:57.530> bouzouki

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 
four main manufacturers in the bouzouki

your<00:05:01.129> popular<00:05:01.490> sports<00:05:01.759> bike<00:05:01.969> like<00:05:02.150> your<00:05:02.270> 600

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:02.779 
your popular sports bike like your 600

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.580 
your popular sports bike like your 600
750<00:05:03.229> s<00:05:03.469> and<00:05:03.590> 1000<00:05:04.159> s<00:05:05.080> pretty<00:05:06.080> much<00:05:06.199> what<00:05:06.469> it<00:05:06.560> is

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
750 s and 1000 s pretty much what it is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.790 
750 s and 1000 s pretty much what it is
-<00:05:07.039> we<00:05:07.909> have<00:05:07.939> the<00:05:08.300> bikes<00:05:08.539> -<00:05:08.779> where<00:05:08.960> we<00:05:09.469> have<00:05:09.650> the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
- we have the bikes - where we have the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.439 
- we have the bikes - where we have the
harnesses<00:05:10.249> bike<00:05:10.430> specific<00:05:10.639> they're

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
harnesses bike specific they're

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.749 
harnesses bike specific they're
plug-and-play<00:05:11.889> so<00:05:12.889> all<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.490> pretty<00:05:13.610> much

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
plug-and-play so all you pretty much

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.339 
plug-and-play so all you pretty much
have<00:05:13.969> to<00:05:14.029> do<00:05:14.210> is<00:05:14.389> unplug<00:05:14.689> each<00:05:14.990> one<00:05:15.139> of<00:05:15.259> the

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
have to do is unplug each one of the

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.019 
have to do is unplug each one of the
sensors<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:15.979> plug<00:05:16.219> our<00:05:16.430> connectors<00:05:16.999> right

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
sensors and plug our connectors right

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.570 
sensors and plug our connectors right
back<00:05:17.419> into<00:05:17.629> it<00:05:17.930> they<00:05:18.379> all<00:05:18.529> go<00:05:18.740> in<00:05:19.009> line<00:05:19.279> it's<00:05:19.520> a

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
back into it they all go in line it's a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.790 
back into it they all go in line it's a
piggyback<00:05:19.879> system<00:05:20.539> so<00:05:21.050> it's<00:05:21.229> easy<00:05:21.439> to<00:05:21.529> plug

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
piggyback system so it's easy to plug

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.619 
piggyback system so it's easy to plug
it's<00:05:22.069> easier<00:05:22.279> to<00:05:22.340> connect<00:05:22.669> it<00:05:23.000> just<00:05:23.270> if<00:05:23.449> you

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
it's easier to connect it just if you

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.089 
it's easier to connect it just if you
couldn't<00:05:24.080> do<00:05:24.169> minor<00:05:24.409> work<00:05:24.620> on<00:05:24.770> your<00:05:24.889> bike<00:05:25.069> you

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
couldn't do minor work on your bike you

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.509 
couldn't do minor work on your bike you
pretty<00:05:25.490> much<00:05:25.669> plug<00:05:25.879> the<00:05:26.029> system<00:05:26.360> in
