00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.340
 I have entered 4 world races from S1 to the present. 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.020
 Then there is a guy named Dyrus who has also entered four times. 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 But I heard that there is a watch called Korea in Korea? 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 Has he entered three times? 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.940
 Watch? Who is he? 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.120
 You do not know who I am? 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.560
 Watch? I am not sure I know who the watch is. 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.140
 You do not know who I am? 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.460
 Watch? 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.220
 You really don't know who I am? 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.880
 First in Asia, entering the world for three consecutive years 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 I have already scored twice in the world. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.140
 However, many overseas fans or players do not seem to know me very much. 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.480
 S2 is really a pity season 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.340
 At the time of the quarter-finals, MakNooN helped us draw lots. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.740
 The Snoopeh player is also drawn with him. 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.260
 Later they decided to exchange, MakNooN also agreed 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.080
 CLG.EU draws WE, we draw TPA 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.520
 At that time, I wanted to say "NICE!" 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.380
 We should not encounter too many difficulties before we reach the semi-finals. 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.100
 But just when we played the quarterfinals 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.460
 Whether it's online or in the field of vision 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
 TPA is perfect to suppress us 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.040
 After the TPA eliminated us, I was a little overwhelmed. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.040
 Really a little hard 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.880
 When S3 is on SKT T1 K, we are very focused 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.860
 When we hit 2:1, I felt that we would win by that power. 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.920
 I think we should be able to enter the finals. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.060
 We are very focused and playing very well. 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.360
 But after the SKT T1 K state suddenly recovered, I am very sad 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.920
 If this happens again, what would it feel like? 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.240
 The feeling of disappointment, I still can't linger 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.260
 I am honored to be the first Asian player to enter the world three times. 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.320
 I very much hope to make the third consecutive World Tour, so I feel that I must work harder to achieve my goal. 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.080
 When I stood on the pitch, my heart beat faster and I felt full of strength. 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.880
 Desire? Probably like that. 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.980
 I want to show it to not only Korea but the world. 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.900
 Najin White Shield's hard work and determination 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.240
 In fact, whether it is at S2 or S3 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.140
 I didn't want to get the attention, there was no Yuyu at the time. 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.180
 Until now, the third time I entered the world, there are still many people who donâ€™t remember who I am. 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.180
 After this world race 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.800
 When people think of "Jungler", I will let them also think of "Watch"
