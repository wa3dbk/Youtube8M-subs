00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:32.830 

find<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.650> hole<00:02:26.049> see<00:02:27.049> I<00:02:30.220> used<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.940> take<00:02:32.450> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
find that hole see I used it to take the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.770 
find that hole see I used it to take the
film<00:02:33.200> when<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.530> was<00:02:37.900> climbing<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:41.299> was<00:02:41.420> kind

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
film when I was climbing it it was kind

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
of steady but it kept falling so I

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.180 
of steady but it kept falling so I
thought<00:02:46.639> I<00:02:46.850> could<00:02:46.970> use<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.720> rubber<00:02:48.109> band<00:02:48.290> coming

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190

out from here and to my shoulders but I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.360 
out from here and to my shoulders but I
don't<00:02:52.280> have<00:02:53.410> more<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.680> these<00:02:54.889> so<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:57.370> used

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370
