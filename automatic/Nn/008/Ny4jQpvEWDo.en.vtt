and<00:01:52.020> pragmatic<00:01:52.649> character<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.640> plot<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and pragmatic character so plot like I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
different universes but he also seems to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.930 
different universes but he also seems to
have<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> bit<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> Winona<00:02:00.329> Ryder's

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
and keeps breaking the one rule of

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.060 
and keeps breaking the one rule of
travelling<00:02:04.690> between<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.050> universes<00:02:05.650> which

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
travelling between the universes which

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.040 
travelling between the universes which
is<00:02:06.250> not<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.700> take<00:02:06.910> anything<00:02:07.270> from<00:02:07.720> one

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
universe into another and this ends up

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.640 
universe into another and this ends up
creating<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.500> lot<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.070> issues<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.290> rest<00:02:14.500> of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
in this book and what I thought was so

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.390 
in this book and what I thought was so
amazing<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.460> no<00:03:04.270> matter<00:03:04.480> how<00:03:04.780> small<00:03:05.650> or

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
amazing is that no matter how small or

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.260 
amazing is that no matter how small or
seemingly<00:03:06.940> small<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.360> character<00:03:08.110> was<00:03:08.290> each

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
seemingly small a character was each

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.199 
seemingly small a character was each
person<00:03:10.270> was<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.620> incredibly<00:03:12.190> distinct<00:03:12.850> no<00:03:13.030> one

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
person was so incredibly distinct no one

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.350 
person was so incredibly distinct no one
ever<00:03:13.420> felt<00:03:14.310> standard<00:03:15.310> or<00:03:15.580> run-of-the-mill<00:03:15.970> it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
ever felt standard or run-of-the-mill it

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.070 
ever felt standard or run-of-the-mill it
all<00:03:16.540> felt<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.520> incredibly<00:03:18.520> immersive

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
all felt so incredibly immersive

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.820 
all felt so incredibly immersive
especially<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.170> world<00:03:20.320> or<00:03:20.620> all<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
especially the world or all the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.979 
especially the world or all the
universes<00:03:21.430> each<00:03:21.730> one<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.360> every<00:03:22.600> time<00:03:22.810> she

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
universes each one that every time she

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.229 
universes each one that every time she
would<00:03:23.080> write<00:03:23.320> about<00:03:24.100> one<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.459> universes<00:03:25.030> I

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239

could see it I could feel it like

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150 
could see it I could feel it like
