00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.529
 and after the first two I personally responded 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.279
 some years ago 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.480
 he needs 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.480
 this is history 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.970
 thought he would never fall 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.310
 Special attention 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.310
 in case of his fault 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 most likely I want 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 2 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.140
 after this year 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.480
 few 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.220
 Doll 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 now we could not without cancer 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.770
 according to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.960
 Yury Lutsenko 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 its cost 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460
 according to Kudrin 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.039
 according to him in 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.779
 documents 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.779
 according to the head of the department g 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:55.549
 specially designed 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.549
 areas 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.939
 Novgorod state 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.309
 I do not know 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.060
 almost everything is ok 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.009
 but here's a paradox 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.039
 we have no right
