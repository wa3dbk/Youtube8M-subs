00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.530
 on the morning of October 14th in acids 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.780
 shop 26 mechanic sergey 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.150
 Karpenko was supposed to repair 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.879
 pipeline valves for nitrogen supply 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.769
 acid locksmith who produced 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.260
 repairs 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.530
 but the acid did not make sure 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.960
 pipeline let's say then unscrew all 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.260
 bolts on valves 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.600
 Unscrewed on the valve but apparently 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.590
 residual pressure pipeline acid 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 gave a shot and all the acid through the open 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.020
 valve valves 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.270
 I have started to follow the storage room 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.770
 There are where there are containers given the fact that 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.170
 acid began to flow sharply she hit 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.090
 on a new renovated floor covered 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.390
 rza me to our notice when connecting with 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.489
 nitric acid burns therefore went 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.739
 less often smoke was immediately turned on 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.140
 ventilation is a consequence of which 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.390
 mounted instantly means left 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.250
 the room 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.990
 splashes of acid fell on his hand 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.120
 first aid was provided 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.740
 Sergey Karpenko was hospitalized 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.350
 City Surgical Department 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.330
 hospitals today are his medical condition 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.700
 rated as close to 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.570
 satisfactory entered men 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 after the accident for 20 pieces in the workshop 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.930
 with a chemical burn burn 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.540
 acid this burn causes education 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.970
 thick forearm film 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560
 percent a little less than three percent 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.830
 the forearm will therefore treat 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.020
 surgical department 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.440
 how many 10 14 days 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.650
 ibid under the situation leaked acid 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.990
 occurred at 10:15 and in the accident zone 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.060
 11:00 was recorded minor 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.729
 exceeding the maximum permissible 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.369
 pollutant concentrations in 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.869
 air ten percent in the first 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.570
 minutes after the emergency 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.380
 staff were evacuated shops number 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.630
 85 and 35 c 15 put reinforced posts 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.940
 cordon off the territory to ensure 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.649
 security and staff of several 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.840
 nearby acid storage 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.120
 production units were 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.660
 evacuated and whistles and when 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.390
 evacuated the kindness of 35 in building 6 all 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.019
 possessed 30 before everyone gave sue there 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.000
 yellow employees central 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.519
 testing laboratory management 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.989
 environmental protection system 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.580
 the production environment was measured 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.130
 air we take away every half hour 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.989
 20 minutes fire squad 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.450
 security samples will be 22 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.600
 the man went to the localization of dangerous 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.720
 Chaga immediately as in children 29 entered 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 emergency report 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.920
 certain mainstream and 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.720
 the main task is 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.440
 how to say provide termination 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.630
 water supply to acid to stop 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.819
 nitric acid leak couples which 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.160
 a dangerous link has been created 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.020
 gas and smoke protection services where they entered 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.690
 Head of Calculation Alexander Nikonov 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.330
 fireman Alexander Maslov and a mechanic of the shop 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.730
 26 Vladimir Savelev Special 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.860
 Chemical protection suits people from action 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.560
 which depended the success of the operation 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.930
 penetrated the infected area today 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.180
 special suits having taken an alkaline shower already 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.610
 rest Alexander Nikonov 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.620
 and Vladimir Savelev we will build them again 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.989
 told us about what's left 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.299
 hidden behind the envy of the acid cloud 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.640
 of course did not know what the risk to them 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.560
 have to go well of course you feel 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.319
 when u went bill can there 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.970
 happen may not come back 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.280
 little I said rideable be careful I 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.750
 already when went to the city already knew 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.760
 Ie kindergarten phoned my mother not 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.280
 the head of the static disc works to sing 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.959
 where warned that at the factory such 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.299
 accident of course call you said 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.090
 carefully but still someone had to 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.579
 doing how to set yourself up is very simple 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.370
 I do not think this is just heroism 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.400
 probably in general, in principle, this is mine 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.290
 work probably had to do but 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.420
 firefighters do not get themselves the more 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.519
 people do not know what equipment but 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.079
 they accompanied me so I myself 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.670
 set up that twenty odd years 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.370
 back when the fire cock came 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.859
 they worked in a bunch of nikons and kept 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.169
 lantern and key saveliev who knows every 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.200
 centimeter acid storage unscrew 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.660
 nuts and air system in principle 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.520
 elementary unleash 4 bolts and all on 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.650
 it took about ten minutes 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.470
 considering that dark smoke did not even break through 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.229
 the light from the lantern guys coped successfully 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.960
 I want to particularly note here is Savelyev 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.160
 here is a repairman that is a man 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.870
 was on vacation 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.610
 came as if to work yes we dressed him 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.340
 in specially this equipment 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.200
 separate on him the air apparatus but 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.780
 this is a tool that allows 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.440
 grandson breathes it as it is and in the infected 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.110
 environment that is generally a clever guy 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.890
 time and in the city were notified 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.630
 heads of educational institutions 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.330
 to the street 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.990
 archival and Ustinova specialists left 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.600

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.360
 poisonous substances 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.400
 excess was not recorded 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.260
 the situation was on constant 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.340
 control of the crisis management center

 through the media that 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.390
 there was a certain chips if and 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.640
 the radio was on television posted

 information on the Internet 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.930
 placed those necessary measures which 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.610
 must be taken when arising

 an alert has been given 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.480
 emergency then people already knew 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.200
 what needs to be done to seal the doors 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.320
 close all windows and wet windows 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.680
 wet napkin and attach it to your face 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.530
 don't go out now got here 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.840
 task from senior management

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.240
 carry out once again the calculations of all forces of all 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.800
 means whether they are sufficient ie 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.480
 is this confirmed by our documents 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.150
 or need some extra 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.400
 measures to bring us to the city well given 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.190
 the accident already principle she showed that the world 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.660
 it is enough that there was even a reserve 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.530
 there was not involved federally

 fire safety squad you 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.840
 they are 12-15 days of pouring acid in acids 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.760
 the repository has been localized 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.060
 then using milk of lime 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.130
 acid neutralization has already been done 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.610
 on Monday, the valve on the pipeline 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.350
 the falling acid was repaired on 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.260
 today there is no danger today we 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.120
 We are preparing to issue the acid to the workshop at 14 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.250
 local time on monday
