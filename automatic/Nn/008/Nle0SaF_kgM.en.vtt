god<00:01:27.930> damn<00:01:28.170> hardest<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.340> goal<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.790> tried

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
god damn hardest to get a goal I tried

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
god damn hardest to get a goal I tried
so<00:01:30.689> hard<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.590> over<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> last<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so hard I was all over in for the last I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.100 
so hard I was all over in for the last I
was<00:01:32.759> even<00:01:32.880> ultra<00:01:33.180> attacking<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
was even ultra attacking and in the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.590 
was even ultra attacking and in the
final<00:01:34.409> second<00:01:34.950> 90<00:01:35.369> minutes<00:01:35.610> plus<00:01:35.880> 4<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> think

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600

nightmare<00:03:05.310> managed<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.090> get<00:03:06.180> back<00:03:06.360> into<00:03:06.570> it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
nightmare managed to get back into it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.630 
nightmare managed to get back into it
slightly<00:03:06.990> as<00:03:07.320> we<00:03:07.830> make<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.190> 3-2<00:03:08.460> but

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
slightly as we make it 3-2 but

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.220 
slightly as we make it 3-2 but
unfortunately<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> did<00:03:09.750> everything<00:03:09.990> right

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
unfortunately I did everything right

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.990 
unfortunately I did everything right
here<00:03:10.470> put<00:03:10.620> hey<00:03:10.770> Z's<00:03:10.950> mass<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.460> his<00:03:11.520> left<00:03:11.790> foot

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
here put hey Z's mass on his left foot

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.390 
here put hey Z's mass on his left foot
so<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.630> was<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:12.870> his<00:03:12.960> weaker<00:03:13.350> foot<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:14.100> he

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
so it was on his weaker foot but he

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.680 
so it was on his weaker foot but he
absolutely<00:03:14.520> spanks<00:03:15.180> into<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.420> back<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
absolutely spanks into the back of the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.180 
absolutely spanks into the back of the
net<00:03:15.840> nothing<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.380> could<00:03:16.530> do<00:03:16.620> about<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.860> and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
net nothing I could do about that and

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.370 
net nothing I could do about that and
you<00:03:17.490> can<00:03:17.610> see<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.850> game<00:03:18.000> does<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.570> 42<00:03:19.200> that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
you can see the game does in 42 that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.530 
you can see the game does in 42 that
does<00:03:19.560> mean<00:03:19.740> we<00:03:19.890> are<00:03:20.040> now<00:03:20.250> knocked<00:03:20.700> out<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
does mean we are now knocked out of the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.410 
does mean we are now knocked out of the
world<00:03:22.170> cup<00:03:22.410> now<00:03:22.800> my<00:03:22.950> idea<00:03:23.130> was<00:03:23.910> every<00:03:24.209> time

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
world cup now my idea was every time

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.880 
world cup now my idea was every time
that<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.870> knocked<00:03:25.110> out<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.530> world<00:03:25.740> cup

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
that we get knocked out of the world cup

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.350 
that we get knocked out of the world cup
we<00:03:26.250> go<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.580> try<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.850> win<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.180> with<00:03:27.330> a

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
we go and try and win it with a

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.030 
we go and try and win it with a
different<00:03:27.900> continent<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:28.709> started<00:03:28.950> off

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
different continent so we started off

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.620 
different continent so we started off
with<00:03:29.100> Europe<00:03:29.490> then<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:29.970> was<00:03:30.180> hoping<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.570> we

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
with Europe then I was hoping that we

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.970 
with Europe then I was hoping that we
can<00:03:30.720> move<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.110> like<00:03:31.140> Asia<00:03:31.530> or<00:03:31.920> South

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
can move on to like Asia or South

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.550 
can move on to like Asia or South
America<00:03:32.840> unfortunately<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:34.230> haven't<00:03:34.380> got

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
America unfortunately we haven't got

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.560 
America unfortunately we haven't got
enough<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:35.070> any<00:03:35.340> other<00:03:35.610> continent<00:03:36.420> to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
enough of any other continent to

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.240 
enough of any other continent to
actually<00:03:36.870> build<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.290> team<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.920> we've<00:03:38.100> got

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
actually build a team like we've got

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.310 
actually build a team like we've got
three<00:03:38.520> goalkeepers<00:03:38.820> in<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.660> Asian<00:03:40.050> squad

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
three goalkeepers in the Asian squad

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.530 
three goalkeepers in the Asian squad
every<00:03:40.680> other<00:03:40.800> world<00:03:41.610> continent<00:03:42.150> doesn't<00:03:42.300> have

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
every other world continent doesn't have

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.940

enough<00:03:42.750> players<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.230> doesn't<00:03:43.410> even<00:03:43.500> have<00:03:43.620> 11

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
enough players it doesn't even have 11

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.590 
enough players it doesn't even have 11
players<00:03:44.070> yet<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.640> actually<00:03:44.760> start<00:03:45.180> building<00:03:45.540> a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
players yet to actually start building a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.030 
players yet to actually start building a
team<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.170> gonna<00:03:46.320> have<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.530> stick<00:03:46.770> with<00:03:46.800> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
team so gonna have to stick with the

team so gonna have to stick with the
European<00:03:47.520> team<00:03:47.760> hopefully<00:03:48.240> we<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.780> sort<00:03:48.959> of

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
European team hopefully we can sort of

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.750 
European team hopefully we can sort of
build<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.380> those<00:03:49.620> players<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.430> reserves

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
in the sort of bank and then hopefully

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.890 
in the sort of bank and then hopefully
we<00:03:53.130> can<00:03:53.250> try<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.580> have<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> crack<00:03:54.300> at<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.750> world

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900
