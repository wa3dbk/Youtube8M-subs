 Guitar lessons for beginners today 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.800
 In this lesson, I will show you over 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.260
 the fingers on the guitar outfits four 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.870
 finger means at the same time that lay 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.690
 Game and location is where my finger 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.280
 sets the first error denote the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.680
 really for example here on the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.379
 First point and my fingers are here 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.510
 I am in the first position who thinks 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.359
 first finger here on the second floor 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.190
 the judge two days the finger here 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:59.329
 as the third point which were the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.339
 and so on slows down so the first 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.980
 finger puts on the first bunch on the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.350
 second finger sits on the second bunch 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.080
 but always close to the collar 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.230
 the third finger sits in front of the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 third goal on it and the fourth finger 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:23.480
 set up before the fourth reason as 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.920
 the first second warden are already flying 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.610
 diligent they just lie back 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.310
 fourth and second first 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.510
 you can be calm with the right hand 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:44.780
 the thumb stop next time two 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.780
 words and back and so on 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.800
 the first finger i always show the situation 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.330
 So if you have the four fingers here 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.890
 I always have to be the first look that is 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.810
 the first location here would be me now 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.759
 I would be in the third position here 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.750
 second lay where my first finger 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.750
 lay is the situation 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.150
 and so I play with 14 45 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.530
 The same thing can be done with the index finger 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.530
 middle finger make the change strong 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.920
 if you have problems that means where 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.930
 I can not get that finger so far 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.580
 then spread it is in your hand 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.460
 position in paris so something forward 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.330
 go and hand parallel to here 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.540
 thigh 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.320
 You can also practice it at least completely 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.630
 at the beginning 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.240
 first the finger exposing the guitars 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.820
 cello between the thighs and 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.820
 now only the finger and 2 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.980
 furthermore i can just finger it 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.820
 So I was much further away from Switzerland 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.820
 but that only serves 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.760
 how do you see your fingers clean for 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.760
 I'll go to the collar 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.090
 come back and have my fingers in 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.140
 the right mood 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.910
 but now I can always be yours 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.290
 Films first play two fingers who left 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.349
 Now I just go with the first 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.890
 I find changing the situation on location 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.840
 the fifth and further 24 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.209
 I do not have a finger anymore now 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.840
 just switch back to finger 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.229
 the 10th 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.229
