00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
chance there is experience III comp it's

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.100 
chance there is experience III comp it's
at<00:04:00.290> four<00:04:01.290> point<00:04:01.530> six<00:04:01.770> inches<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.780> said

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
at four point six inches so that said

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.220 
at four point six inches so that said
and<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.440> back<00:04:04.620> goes<00:04:04.890> like<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:06.050> it's<00:04:07.050> got<00:04:07.200> a

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
and the back goes like that it's got a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.860 
and the back goes like that it's got a
glassy<00:04:07.560> gloss<00:04:08.040> finish<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.240> back<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.840> it

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
glassy gloss finish in the back so it

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.280 
glassy gloss finish in the back so it
will<00:04:10.350> catch<00:04:11.160> your<00:04:11.430> fingerprint<00:04:12.209> like<00:04:12.510> magnets

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
will catch your fingerprint like magnets

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:21.290 
will catch your fingerprint like magnets
so<00:04:13.650> beware<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.550> that<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:17.060> here<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.150> goes

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.870 

it's<00:04:22.300> got<00:04:22.450> a<00:04:22.480> very<00:04:22.660> thin<00:04:23.170> profile<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.130> although

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
it's got a very thin profile so although
