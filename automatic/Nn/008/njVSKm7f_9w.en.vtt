00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.060
 I live in new york known new york 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.160

 mexico chilango as they say fixte 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.580
 that he always had that interest in living 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.170
 out of Mexico the water that has always been 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.840
 a person with very restless always 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.570
 been like in from work and as in 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.739
 my personal life has always been like 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.300
 moving from one place to another I'm like 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.210
 a very patient person not put in a 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.100
 side as always static and I like 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.650
 pretend something that I am not simply 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.310
 I try to be myself to be the most 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.270
 relaxed to convey this 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.380
 convenient at that clear moment that I 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.360
 like to be presentable the truth that 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.970
 He has always liked me to dress well 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.310
 I try to see well 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.290
 I have always liked the master of 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.790
 follow it but also always said that 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.120
 from fashion what suits you I do not say 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.880
 also already it realized new 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.330
 york and in Mexico this I can tell you that 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.600
 here the love is coming entering a 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 This road is very positive and very big and 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.550
 that we have Mexican designers that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.980
 they are coming very very high indeed and 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.330
 I was talking to you with a friend 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.640
 designer who will present in fashion 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.840
 week the only difference you are looking for 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.390
 improvement and in new york there are people a 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.970
 bit more daring but as soon as 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.500
 style I for example of towns has 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.260
 exactly the same here as new york and 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.860
 well I not see the big difference Rome 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.910
 example that is taking a boom 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.180
 incredible where where the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.940
 gastronomy with artists with designers 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 then the truth that usually 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.790
 when well tourists or friends of mine 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.410
 I do not have time because they always come 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.240
 better five days a week and good 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.800
 always this one fall down wanting 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.140
 come back so I teach them more I've 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.080
 tried to leave my car in my case in 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.670
 some point and walk the cities 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.320
 and find new places 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.160
 restaurants then know the truth 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.470
 my lifestyle is a little 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.780
 as it is given without planning so much 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.310
 but always enjoying the day the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.420
 moment and what is happening almost 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.420
