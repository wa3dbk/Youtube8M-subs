00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
saying all of that it doesn't mean that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
taste professional any of that it's
actually<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.250> opposite<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.420> I'm
