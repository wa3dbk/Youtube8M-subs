00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.679
 where the match yes 3 0 won for 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.900
 feyenoord 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.070
 i had it i must honestly say i had 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.750
 it dare to dream I actually had 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 a good feeling to or for the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.250
 competition and that just said center 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.650
 middle fantastic good feeling because we 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.630
 just yeah whole we have what we what 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.250
 we had to do start was beautiful 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.470
 beautiful purple moisander on fisscher 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.210
 and yes it finishes it like it already 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.040
 for years in the primary thieves john 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.809
 namely plays we say a big 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.190
 compliment to victor 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.809
 the evidence to that point not for nothing 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 just had a lot of talent 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.320
 has in it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.940
 if at that time you order such 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940
 high voltage and so remains calm 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.829
 I am actually going to feel that I am in it 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.750
 this was going to save I thought that who 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.559
 would go right back for me mike i had 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.449
 hit him and they went slider and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.820
 then I was 1 on 1 with the keeper and me 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.129
 so found it very close to the role 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.379
 I think passed by and yes then that is 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.309
 the rest actually easy and then the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.939
 three zero 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.820
 now it actually makes him yes I already saw one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.590
 screen looked like i made one but 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.450
 I think it just went through no 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 I'm not him really touched me 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.500
 could be on ice like mother was 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 Kenneth also has a major role to play 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 vermeer 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 yes times when he had to be there 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.540
 so that you were just after a zero the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.799
 chance of, after all, the penalty 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.439
 is of course also crucial 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.210
 the 3rd is it does not necessarily have to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.040
 mean that you then play draws on 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.280
 freezer 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.380
 yes, but I can do it in a dangerous way 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.260
 that dave that fantastic booty it was 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.820
 stone cold but by the atmosphere and the stand 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.490
 the temperatures came above zero point yes 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.780
 like me were there and why the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.810
 snow melted a bit and feel the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.760
 so back up it respects it well 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.560
 done I think in front of the public and 3 0 against 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.520
 Feyenoord everyone will too 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.080
 exactly that we think we of course it is 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.120
 what they have deposited too 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.100
 have actually unpacked because that 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.020
 is of course it's nice that she is 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.030
 naturally do you competition 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.730
 must itself have three points to tackle 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.600
 have done is we can soon a 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.600
 restaurant with you
