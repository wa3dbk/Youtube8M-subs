five<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.810> an<00:00:00.989> interesting<00:00:01.230> camp<00:00:01.620> every

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
five this is an interesting camp every

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.139 
five this is an interesting camp every
is<00:00:02.010> because<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.399> think<00:00:02.460> he's<00:00:02.669> just<00:00:02.790> gonna<00:00:02.939> with

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
is because I think he's just gonna with

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.289 
is because I think he's just gonna with
this<00:00:03.300> pulled<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.600> lot<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.220> I<00:00:05.299> also

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
this pulled a lot and I also

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.820 
this pulled a lot and I also
occasionally<00:00:06.720> raise<00:00:07.080> hands<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.470> about<00:00:07.560> you

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
occasionally raise hands for about you

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.940 
occasionally raise hands for about you
and<00:00:08.330> I<00:00:11.269> have<00:00:12.269> decent<00:00:12.840> could<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.290> five<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.920> I

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
and I have decent could be five but I

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.589 
and I have decent could be five but I
don't<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.280> good<00:00:14.400> enough<00:00:14.639> equity<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.089> float

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
don't have good enough equity to float

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.590 
don't have good enough equity to float
so<00:00:16.590> if<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.160> want<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> play<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.789> head<00:00:18.270> at<00:00:18.420> all<00:00:18.570> I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so if I want to play this head at all I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.800 
so if I want to play this head at all I
have<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.140> raise<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.310> flop<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> three

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
have to raise the flop and you three

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.429 
have to raise the flop and you three
bets<00:00:22.020> me<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.570> for<00:00:24.570> my<00:00:24.660> past<00:00:24.869> experiences<00:00:25.380> with

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
bets me and for my past experiences with

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.439 
bets me and for my past experiences with
him<00:00:25.859> he'd<00:00:26.220> been<00:00:26.460> mostly<00:00:26.730> playing<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> fit

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
him he'd been mostly playing kind of fit

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.820 
him he'd been mostly playing kind of fit
or<00:00:27.480> fold<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> turn<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.349> decided<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
or fold on the turn so I decided to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.529 
or fold on the turn so I decided to
float<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.119> pretty<00:00:30.359> questionable

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
float and this is pretty questionable

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.269 
float and this is pretty questionable
that<00:00:31.109> means<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> am<00:00:31.650> getting<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:32.040> sick

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that means that I am getting really sick

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.350 
that means that I am getting really sick
odds<00:00:32.630> may<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.660> shoving<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:38.120> I'm<00:00:39.120> getting

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
odds may be shoving but I'm getting

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
odds may be shoving but I'm getting
really<00:00:39.540> sick<00:00:39.719> thoughts<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.500> hopes<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.280> he

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
really sick thoughts and hopes that he

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.970 
really sick thoughts and hopes that he
took<00:00:41.579> hold<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> turn<00:00:42.120> she<00:00:42.329> tends<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.890> he

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
took hold to turn she tends to do or he

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.680 
took hold to turn she tends to do or he
has<00:00:44.100> been<00:00:44.129> doing<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> past<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.570> he's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
has been doing in the past when he's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.279 
has been doing in the past when he's
done<00:00:45.840> similar<00:00:46.170> things<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> turn<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
done similar things it on the turn I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.459 
done similar things it on the turn I
really<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.129> he<00:00:50.309> ever<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:51.030> sex

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
really don't think he ever has a sex

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.600 
really don't think he ever has a sex
because<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.280> he<00:00:53.430> probably

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
because well first of all he probably

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.619 
because well first of all he probably
just<00:00:53.789> call<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> flop<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.870> sex<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.969> as<00:00:56.969> for

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
just call a flop with a sex and as for

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.430 
just call a flop with a sex and as for
like<00:00:57.840> better<00:00:58.050> hands<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:59.899> Jack's<00:01:00.899> seven

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
like better hands are like Jack's seven

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.789 
like better hands are like Jack's seven
even<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.370> kings<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.379> think<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:04.680> would

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
even like kings I think that he would

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
even like kings I think that he would
tend<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> check<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> turn<00:01:05.990> for<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.110> experience

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
tend to check the turn for my experience

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.660 
tend to check the turn for my experience
he's<00:01:07.950> mostly<00:01:08.220> tracking<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> same<00:01:09.270> spots<00:01:09.570> even

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
he's mostly tracking the same spots even

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.969 
he's mostly tracking the same spots even
well<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.060> even<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.570> he<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:12.990> raised

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
well that is even if he actually raised

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
well that is even if he actually raised
the<00:01:14.280> flop<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> thought<00:01:15.150> oh<00:01:17.360> actually<00:01:18.360> has

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the flop so I thought oh actually has

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.859 
the flop so I thought oh actually has
something<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.369> thought<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.030> he

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
something here but I thought that he

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
something here but I thought that he
think<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.619> carts<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> wolf<00:01:23.130> card

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
think that this carts the wolf card

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.680 
think that this carts the wolf card
that's<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.270> he's<00:01:24.420> consistently<00:01:24.960> doing<00:01:25.170> this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
that's what he's consistently doing this

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.110 
that's what he's consistently doing this
it's<00:01:25.960> consistently<00:01:26.470> barely<00:01:26.800> like<00:01:27.430> over<00:01:27.880> cards

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
it's consistently barely like over cards

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.930 
it's consistently barely like over cards
and<00:01:28.240> cards<00:01:28.450> like<00:01:28.540> this<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:29.010> it's<00:01:30.010> well<00:01:30.580> not<00:01:30.850> so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
and cards like this and it's well not so

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.150 
and cards like this and it's well not so
much<00:01:31.030> spots<00:01:31.300> like<00:01:31.480> this<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:31.930> general<00:01:32.410> so<00:01:33.130> I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
much spots like this but general so I

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.950 
much spots like this but general so I
particularly<00:01:33.970> thought<00:01:34.240> you'd<00:01:34.450> go<00:01:34.600> for<00:01:34.660> card

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
particularly thought you'd go for card

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.580 
particularly thought you'd go for card
like<00:01:35.080> this

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
like this

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.200 
like this
and<00:01:35.910> I<00:01:36.910> just<00:01:37.210> thought<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:39.520> extremely

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
and I just thought that is extremely

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.880 
and I just thought that is extremely
likely<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:40.660> it<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:40.870> very<00:01:41.170> dispersed<00:01:41.470> here

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
likely that it is very dispersed here

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.620 
likely that it is very dispersed here
and<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.790> river<00:01:42.940> is<00:01:43.060> actually<00:01:43.150> really<00:01:43.480> good

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
and the river is actually really good

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.330 
and the river is actually really good
River<00:01:43.840> for<00:01:44.170> me<00:01:44.290> not<00:01:44.680> only<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:45.040> flush<00:01:45.310> draw

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
River for me not only the flush draw

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.590 
River for me not only the flush draw
mesh<00:01:45.760> this<00:01:46.390> which<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.960> possible<00:01:47.760> but<00:01:48.760> um<00:01:48.970> now

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
mesh this which is possible but um now

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.390 
mesh this which is possible but um now
it's<00:01:49.840> as<00:01:49.960> likely<00:01:50.140> as<00:01:50.260> King<00:01:50.620> X<00:01:50.830> would<00:01:51.040> beat<00:01:51.250> me

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
it's as likely as King X would beat me

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's as likely as King X would beat me
on<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.610> turn

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
on the turn

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.460 
on the turn
look<00:01:52.120> if<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.330> had<00:01:52.420> like<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.720> doll<00:01:53.020> suit<00:01:53.260> was

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
look if you had like a doll suit was

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.690 
look if you had like a doll suit was
doing<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:54.640> beat<00:01:55.150> me<00:01:55.270> on<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.450> turn<00:01:55.660> now

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
doing this you beat me on the turn now

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.280 
doing this you beat me on the turn now
specialist<00:01:57.700> likely<00:01:57.910> has<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.480> because

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
specialist likely has that because
