00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey guys I just wanted to show you a

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.460 
hey guys I just wanted to show you a
little<00:00:02.610> something<00:00:02.879> here<00:00:03.270> sharing<00:00:04.259> my

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
little something here sharing my

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.650 
little something here sharing my
triumphs<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.779> i7<00:00:06.779> 750<00:00:07.940> we<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.179> get<00:00:09.389> four

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
triumphs the i7 750 we just get four

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.080 
triumphs the i7 750 we just get four
gigabytes<00:00:10.230> with<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.190> seems<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> be

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
gigabytes with it and it seems to be

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.509 
gigabytes with it and it seems to be
running<00:00:12.330> pretty<00:00:12.599> solid<00:00:13.110> right<00:00:13.290> now<00:00:13.349> I'm<00:00:14.250> just

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
running pretty solid right now I'm just

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.050 
running pretty solid right now I'm just
gonna<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> simple<00:00:14.990> SuperPi<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.060> we'll

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
gonna do a simple SuperPi here and we'll

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.769 
gonna do a simple SuperPi here and we'll
see<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.510> performs<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.320> speed<00:00:19.650> we'll

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
see how it performs at this speed we'll

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:37.889 
see how it performs at this speed we'll
do<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.080> Meg<00:00:22.430> calculation

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.069 

okay<00:00:38.500> there<00:00:39.010> we<00:00:39.160> go<00:00:39.190> ten<00:00:39.910> seconds<00:00:40.449> of<00:00:40.690> ten

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
okay there we go ten seconds of ten

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.350 
okay there we go ten seconds of ten
point<00:00:41.320> four<00:00:41.530> three<00:00:41.739> seconds<00:00:42.219> less<00:00:42.850> than<00:00:43.120> ten

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
point four three seconds less than ten

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.270 
point four three seconds less than ten
and<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.540> half<00:00:43.660> seconds<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:44.829> we're<00:00:44.980> gonna<00:00:45.070> do

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
and a half seconds so we're gonna do

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.400 
and a half seconds so we're gonna do
some<00:00:45.489> stability<00:00:45.699> testing<00:00:46.480> on<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:46.809> check

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
some stability testing on it check

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.020 
some stability testing on it check
temperatures<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.190> stuff<00:00:48.399> we're<00:00:48.640> idling

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
temperatures and stuff we're idling

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.990 
temperatures and stuff we're idling
about<00:00:49.300> mid<00:00:50.110> 30s<00:00:50.710> right<00:00:50.890> now<00:00:51.250> we're<00:00:51.850> gonna

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
about mid 30s right now we're gonna

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.840 
about mid 30s right now we're gonna
stress<00:00:52.570> test<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:53.199> see<00:00:53.649> how<00:00:54.370> it<00:00:54.519> holds<00:00:54.790> up

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
stress test it and see how it holds up

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.009 
stress test it and see how it holds up
at<00:00:55.059> this<00:00:55.180> speed<00:00:57.180> hey<00:00:58.180> guys<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.629> got<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.839> little

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
at this speed hey guys I got a little

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.270 
at this speed hey guys I got a little
update<00:00:59.829> on<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.430> overclocking<00:01:01.329> on<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:02.589> Dragon

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
update on the overclocking on the Dragon

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.120 
update on the overclocking on the Dragon
Rider<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:05.080> did<00:01:05.259> have<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.560> back<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.920> down<00:01:06.070> a

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
Rider we did have to back it down a

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.969 
Rider we did have to back it down a
little<00:01:06.369> bit<00:01:06.580> unfortunately<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:08.080> 4.0

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
little bit unfortunately the 4.0

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.990 
little bit unfortunately the 4.0
gigahertz<00:01:09.490> was<00:01:10.149> just<00:01:11.020> tough<00:01:11.259> to<00:01:11.289> get<00:01:11.619> stable

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
gigahertz was just tough to get stable

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.419 
gigahertz was just tough to get stable
wasn't<00:01:13.000> worth<00:01:13.179> the<00:01:13.210> additional<00:01:14.100> voltages<00:01:15.100> and

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
wasn't worth the additional voltages and

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.669 
wasn't worth the additional voltages and
eat<00:01:15.729> that<00:01:16.000> we<00:01:16.149> needed<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.539> try<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.020> stabilize

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
eat that we needed to try to stabilize

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.760 
eat that we needed to try to stabilize
it<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.479> basically<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.630> just<00:01:19.899> backed<00:01:20.140> it<00:01:20.320> down<00:01:20.500> to

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
it so basically I just backed it down to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.180 
it so basically I just backed it down to
3.6<00:01:21.310> it's<00:01:21.940> actually<00:01:22.300> three<00:01:22.649> three<00:01:23.649> point<00:01:23.920> six

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
3.6 it's actually three three point six

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.590 
3.6 it's actually three three point six
one<00:01:24.399> two<00:01:24.610> right<00:01:24.970> now<00:01:25.149> with<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.800> multiplier<00:01:26.800> 21

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
one two right now with a multiplier 21

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.399 
one two right now with a multiplier 21
bus<00:01:28.600> speed<00:01:28.890> 172<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.780> we<00:01:31.990> were<00:01:32.140> able<00:01:32.229> to

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
bus speed 172 this we were able to

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.370 
bus speed 172 this we were able to
achieve<00:01:32.619> at<00:01:33.100> just<00:01:33.310> over<00:01:33.610> one<00:01:33.819> point<00:01:34.060> two<00:01:34.330> volts

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
achieve at just over one point two volts

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.740 
achieve at just over one point two volts
as<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.530> can<00:01:35.649> see<00:01:35.800> it's<00:01:35.979> 1.20<00:01:36.759> hate<00:01:37.210> running

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
as you can see it's 1.20 hate running

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.160 
as you can see it's 1.20 hate running

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
688 with a 9/10 10:25 timing so we're

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.010

temperatures at 3.6 gigahertz it's a

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.320 
temperatures at 3.6 gigahertz it's a
nice<00:02:02.009> overclock<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.220> about<00:02:03.429> a<00:02:03.459> gigahertz<00:02:03.849> and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
nice overclock of about a gigahertz and

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.919 
nice overclock of about a gigahertz and
we're<00:02:05.200> able<00:02:05.349> to<00:02:05.619> do<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.979> at<00:02:06.220> less<00:02:07.149> than<00:02:07.179> stock

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
we're able to do it at less than stock

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.960 
we're able to do it at less than stock
voltage<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.560> think<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.860> default<00:02:09.039> voltage<00:02:09.759> on

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
voltage I think the default voltage on

voltage I think the default voltage on
this<00:02:10.119> processor<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:11.280> 1.25<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:13.060> we're<00:02:13.180> running

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
this processor is 1.25 and we're running

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.260 
this processor is 1.25 and we're running
at<00:02:13.629> one<00:02:13.780> point<00:02:13.989> 208<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.459> actually<00:02:15.879> under

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
at one point 208 so it's actually under

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.000 
at one point 208 so it's actually under
bolted<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.780> little<00:02:17.020> bit<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.410> were<00:02:17.530> still<00:02:17.830> able

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
bolted a little bit we were still able

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.660 
bolted a little bit we were still able
to<00:02:18.220> achieve<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.819> gigabyte<00:02:19.379> worth<00:02:20.379> overclock<00:02:21.220> so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
to achieve a gigabyte worth overclock so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.479 
to achieve a gigabyte worth overclock so
just<00:02:22.510> wanted<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> update<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.349> that<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:24.340> I

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
just wanted to update you on that if I

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.790 
just wanted to update you on that if I
have<00:02:24.700> any<00:02:24.730> new<00:02:25.180> developments<00:02:25.900> if<00:02:26.019> I'm<00:02:26.170> able<00:02:26.349> to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
have any new developments if I'm able to

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.430 
have any new developments if I'm able to
get<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> better<00:02:27.940> cooler<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.690> maybe<00:02:28.870> try<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.200> get

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
get a better cooler and maybe try to get

4.0<00:02:30.160> stabilized<00:02:30.849> I'll<00:02:31.120> let<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.450> know<00:02:31.599> but<00:02:31.900> for

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
4.0 stabilized I'll let you know but for

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.020 
4.0 stabilized I'll let you know but for
right<00:02:32.680> now<00:02:32.739> we're<00:02:33.160> just<00:02:33.310> going<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.580> run<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.910> at

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
right now we're just going to run it at

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.010 
right now we're just going to run it at
3.6<00:02:34.629> because<00:02:35.319> the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
3.6 because the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.350 
3.6 because the
performance<00:02:36.830> difference<00:02:37.310> going<00:02:38.000> up<00:02:38.150> from

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
performance difference going up from

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.510 
performance difference going up from
here<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.750> very<00:02:39.050> minimal<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.160> amount<00:02:40.400> of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
here is very minimal but the amount of

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.270 
here is very minimal but the amount of
voltage<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.120> heat<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.720> quite<00:02:42.380> extreme<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.190> go

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
voltage and heat is quite extreme to go

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.450 
voltage and heat is quite extreme to go
past<00:02:43.550> 36<00:02:44.120> unless<00:02:44.960> we<00:02:45.230> switch<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.040> one<00:02:46.250> over

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
past 36 unless we switch this one over

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.610 
past 36 unless we switch this one over
the<00:02:46.550> water<00:02:46.700> cooling<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.360> that's<00:02:48.290> going<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.500> be

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the water cooling so that's going to be

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.210 
the water cooling so that's going to be
it<00:02:48.710> for<00:02:48.890> now<00:02:48.920> thanks<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:49.850> watching
