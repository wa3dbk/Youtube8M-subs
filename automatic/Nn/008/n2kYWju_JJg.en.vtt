00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.509
 color pencil effect 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.710
 so it's that you do not leave because if 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.710
 you do not miss it 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.370
 a warm greeting for 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.190

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.520
 congratulations for you brothers 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.250
 if it continues like this I want 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.530
 ok then we start and they're going to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.410
 surprise how easy it is to do 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.830
 this effect once you have opened 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.250
 your picture you are going to press control j 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.910
 to duplicate it 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.380
 now we press the uppercase keys 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.300
 shift that is the same control and the three 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.640
 keys at the same time 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.510
 let's duplicate this layer again mind 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510
 control j 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.650
 here in the fusion options we're going 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:21.030
 to the split option 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.720
 let's filter blur blur 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.720
 gauss no longer 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.940
 and for this image I'm going to put it 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.680
 60-pixel radio as usual 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.100
 I will leave in the description of the video 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.450
 so they can practice ok 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.240
 that is, if you choose another photograph 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.850
 you are going to have to measure 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.960
 learn how you like on the radio 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.659
 here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.520
 you slide the handler 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.539
 I'm going to put it in 60 pixels 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.539
 come on ok 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.320
 having that layer selected 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.960
 let's press control 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.590
 to join them 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.670
 now let's create an adjustment layer 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.670
 of gradient 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.400
 and you're going to find a preset that you like 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.060
 for example I'm going to use this but you 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.010
 you can use anyone or edit it or here 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.109
 clicking on it in granite you can 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.800
 find more present here in the part 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.790
 down 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.790
 we give him ok 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.219
 now in the layer merge mode 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.219
 up here let's put it in soft light 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.720
 If you like it you can leave it like this or 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.740
 you can lower the opacity that's already going to 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.740
 depend on you too 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.629
 now for those who have the cs5 version 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.209
 or previous 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.840
 the method is different I will undo 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.840
 All this 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.540
 and let's start again we're going to 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.540
 press control j 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.930
 same we press capital letters control 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.330
 normally control j 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.530
 now control 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.840
 to invest 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.430
 let's put the merge mode 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:33.050
 of exposing color 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.500
 we 're going to filter out of focus 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.500
 Gaussian blur 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.110
 equally the radio application that you 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.610
 want me to then leave in 60 pixels 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:51.240
 we give ok we press again control 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.260
 to join those two layers now let's 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.810
 create a new layer 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.200
 the same fusion mode we put it what 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.200
 soft 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.470
 here in the color commutator or here 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.500
 in the color samples that is here 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.319
 Above you can choose the color by 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.349
 example 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.349
 this red we take the brush 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:23.790
 we have illuminated the parts that we 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.790
 interest now make a green color 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.050
 it takes a yellow color 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.430
 it took a purple color 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:43.099
 and so you can play with 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.099
 the colors that you like ok 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.700
 and this is easy 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.580
