00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
think it's just the point was to show

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.009 
think it's just the point was to show
with<00:02:20.790> other<00:02:20.970> people<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.390> say<00:02:21.540> look<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.870> was

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
uh to to other places uh it was not

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.339 
uh to to other places uh it was not
nearly<00:03:08.879> as<00:03:09.030> crazy<00:03:09.299> they<00:03:09.629> have<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.930> Venus<00:03:10.200> de

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
nearly as crazy they have the Venus de

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.649 
nearly as crazy they have the Venus de
Milo<00:03:10.379> at<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> Louvre<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.400> well<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:11.790> lot<00:03:12.629> of

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
Milo at the Louvre as well a lot of

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.330 
Milo at the Louvre as well a lot of
pictures<00:03:12.930> were<00:03:13.200> being<00:03:13.409> taken<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:13.920> not<00:03:14.220> as

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
pictures were being taken there not as

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.520 
pictures were being taken there not as
many<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:14.849> actually<00:03:15.780> makes<00:03:15.989> more<00:03:16.200> sense

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
many and that actually makes more sense

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.470 
many and that actually makes more sense
to<00:03:16.709> me<00:03:16.829> because<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.430> interesting<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.239> see

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
to me because it's interesting to see

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.250 
to me because it's interesting to see
the<00:03:18.750> Venus<00:03:19.470> de<00:03:19.620> Milo<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:21.209> don't<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.049> it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
the Venus de Milo and I don't know it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.170 
the Venus de Milo and I don't know it
doesn't<00:03:22.799> make<00:03:22.889> that<00:03:23.160> much<00:03:23.220> sense<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.849> me<00:03:24.030> but

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
doesn't make that much sense to me but

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
doesn't make that much sense to me but
still<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.720> would<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.169> were<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.440> take<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
still I would if I were to take a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.009 
still I would if I were to take a

sculpture<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.799> mean<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.540> potentially<00:03:51.540> get

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
sculpture I mean you can potentially get

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.289 
sculpture I mean you can potentially get
a<00:03:51.840> very<00:03:52.199> unique<00:03:52.590> photograph<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.699> it<00:03:53.849> depending

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
a very unique photograph of it depending

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.930 
a very unique photograph of it depending
on<00:03:54.449> your<00:03:54.540> angle<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.440> whatever<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.910> I

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
on your angle and and whatever so I

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.109 
on your angle and and whatever so I
think<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.480> makes<00:03:57.750> way<00:03:57.870> more<00:03:57.900> sense
