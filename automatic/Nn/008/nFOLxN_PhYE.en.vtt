be coming up a little bit later but the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.580 
be coming up a little bit later but the
second<00:01:15.540> class<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.990> pretty<00:01:16.170> much<00:01:16.380> identical

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
second class is pretty much identical

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.640

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
except for this ballista class does have

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.440 
except for this ballista class does have
hardwired<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.090> why<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
hardwired because I don't know why I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.730 
hardwired because I don't know why I
just<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:21.840> feel<00:01:22.080> comfortable<00:01:22.290> using

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
just don't feel comfortable using

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
just don't feel comfortable using
dexterity<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> ballista<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.210> don't

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
dexterity with the ballista I don't

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.200
