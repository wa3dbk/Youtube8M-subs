00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
machinima so we're pretty packed

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.460 
machinima so we're pretty packed
throughout<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.640> next<00:05:15.790> month<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:16.360> think<00:05:17.050> for

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
throughout the next month I think for

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.690 
throughout the next month I think for
the<00:05:17.560> rest<00:05:17.800> of<00:05:17.860> these<00:05:17.950> tournaments<00:05:18.340> for<00:05:18.520> the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
the rest of these tournaments for the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.670 
the rest of these tournaments for the
rest<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.030> year<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.210> think<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:20.020> mean<00:05:20.560> pretty

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
rest of the year I think I mean pretty

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.320 
rest of the year I think I mean pretty
much<00:05:20.800> our<00:05:21.010> hardpoint<00:05:21.400> game<00:05:21.580> looked<00:05:21.820> good<00:05:22.090> I

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
much our hardpoint game looked good I

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.170 
much our hardpoint game looked good I
think<00:05:22.900> from<00:05:23.320> from<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:24.220> changes<00:05:24.610> we<00:05:24.730> made<00:05:24.940> I

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
think from from the changes we made I

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.970 
think from from the changes we made I
think<00:05:25.510> we<00:05:25.570> got<00:05:25.690> a<00:05:25.720> block<00:05:26.050> spawns<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.620> little<00:05:26.830> bit

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
think we got a block spawns a little bit

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.790 
think we got a block spawns a little bit
better<00:05:27.300> probably<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:29.290> that's<00:05:29.410> really<00:05:29.620> yeah

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
better probably and that's really yeah

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.560 
better probably and that's really yeah
just<00:05:30.040> hold<00:05:30.160> Hills<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.700> little<00:05:30.910> bit<00:05:31.030> better<00:05:31.180> not

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
just hold Hills a little bit better not

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.040 
just hold Hills a little bit better not
really<00:05:31.990> forced<00:05:32.380> too<00:05:32.560> much<00:05:32.770> gun<00:05:33.490> battle<00:05:33.850> wise

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
really forced too much gun battle wise

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.690 
really forced too much gun battle wise
search<00:05:35.050> it's<00:05:35.260> really<00:05:35.560> just<00:05:35.680> about<00:05:35.890> playing

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
search it's really just about playing

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.670 
search it's really just about playing
with<00:05:36.940> bit<00:05:37.090> smarter<00:05:37.630> I<00:05:37.840> mean<00:05:38.230> we<00:05:38.320> get<00:05:38.470> man

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
with bit smarter I mean we get man

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.380 
with bit smarter I mean we get man
advantage<00:05:39.100> almost<00:05:39.400> every<00:05:39.670> time<00:05:39.880> it's<00:05:40.150> just<00:05:40.270> a

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
advantage almost every time it's just a

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.060 
advantage almost every time it's just a
matter<00:05:40.540> of<00:05:40.720> whether<00:05:40.930> we<00:05:41.140> use<00:05:41.170> it<00:05:41.500> chloro<00:05:41.770> and

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
matter of whether we use it chloro and

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.270 
matter of whether we use it chloro and
it's<00:05:42.250> or<00:05:42.520> not<00:05:42.840> kinda<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.140> mean<00:05:44.560> seats<00:05:44.860> yet<00:05:45.040> we

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
it's or not kinda I mean seats yet we

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.860 
it's or not kinda I mean seats yet we
haven't<00:05:45.430> lost<00:05:45.670> really<00:05:46.000> CT<00:05:46.360> up<00:05:46.450> since<00:05:46.660> Anna

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
haven't lost really CT up since Anna

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.110 
haven't lost really CT up since Anna
high<00:05:47.050> when<00:05:47.290> I<00:05:47.380> think<00:05:47.620> of<00:05:47.680> it<00:05:47.740> but<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:48.850> renata

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
high when I think of it but it's renata

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.060 
high when I think of it but it's renata
treedome<00:05:49.810> we<00:05:49.960> have<00:05:50.050> a<00:05:50.080> most<00:05:50.290> essentially

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
treedome we have a most essentially

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.460 
treedome we have a most essentially
going<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.280> have<00:05:51.430> lots<00:05:51.670> of<00:05:51.820> CTF<00:05:52.240> yet<00:05:52.510> so<00:05:52.780> I<00:05:53.020> mean

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
going to have lots of CTF yet so I mean

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.840 
going to have lots of CTF yet so I mean
I<00:05:53.590> don't<00:05:53.950> really<00:05:53.980> think<00:05:54.160> there's<00:05:54.430> too<00:05:54.610> much<00:05:54.700> we

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
I don't really think there's too much we

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.810 
I don't really think there's too much we
go<00:05:54.970> to<00:05:55.030> change<00:05:55.330> their<00:05:55.720> so<00:05:56.140> yeah<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.800> mean<00:05:57.340> we

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
go to change their so yeah I mean we

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.010
