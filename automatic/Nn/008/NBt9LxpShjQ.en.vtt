like it sings and that's the only box
out<00:00:59.969> west<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:01.260> lever<00:01:02.270> sticky<00:01:03.270> piston

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
out west for me a lever sticky piston

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.969 
out west for me a lever sticky piston
redstone<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:06.479> recommend<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.770> torch<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.979> one

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
redstone and I recommend a torch so one

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
redstone and I recommend a torch so one
set<00:01:13.430> just<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.939> little<00:01:15.270> bit<00:01:15.450> faster

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
set just to make it a little bit faster

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.179 
set just to make it a little bit faster

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
basically go to up piston face seemed

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
basically go to up piston face seemed
down<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:39.320> then<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.340> I'll<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> lever
