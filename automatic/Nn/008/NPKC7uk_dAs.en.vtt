00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
restore vision then there's every hope

that further research will actually

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
that further research will actually
yield<00:01:46.829> some<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.220> good<00:01:47.310> results<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:48.479> more

yield some really good results the more
