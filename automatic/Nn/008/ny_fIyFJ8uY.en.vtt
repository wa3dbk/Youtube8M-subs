00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.550 
fundamental drives we do the four FS
which<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:02.850> feeding<00:02:03.149> fighting<00:02:03.840> fleeing<00:02:04.259> and

which are feeding fighting fleeing and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.980 
which are feeding fighting fleeing and
mating<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> deeper<00:02:05.939> question<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.479> do

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
mating but the deeper question is do

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.779 
mating but the deeper question is do
they<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.140> emotions<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.190> drive<00:02:08.520> these
