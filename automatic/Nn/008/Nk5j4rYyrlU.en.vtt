00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.920
 Donetsk we hear tank breaks 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.680
 despite being somewhere in 5 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.890
 kilometers from the Donetsk airport where 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 Now the Ukrainian army has begun 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.920
 counterattack by hacks and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.649
 Avdeevki on the information that we 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.899
 possess at least 15 tanks 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.840
 breaks on the runway 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.149
 to the new terminal where I repeat already 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.520
 some days there are fighters 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.829
 divisions of sparta building itself from 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.109
 Ukrainian military cleaned about it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.020
 We repeatedly reported on our broadcasts. 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.600
 this information was confirmed by the commanders 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.880
 the militia including motorola just 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.280
 we managed to contact him literally for 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.409
 few minutes before live 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 reported that the counteroffensive 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.509
 large enough forces now 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.610
 held that is in addition to 15 tanks 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.520
 running heavy artillery it 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.189
 self-propelled artillery installation 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.369
 the hail of the city is often heard 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.100
 units that protect the terminal 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.659
 and his surroundings I mean 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 including the old terminal there is 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.560
 Somali Givi unit as well 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 battalion east which is located 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 a little in the rear at the forefront of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.470
 provides fire support when 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 storms are now losing 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.860
 the number of wounded is specified about the dead 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.930
 no information yet 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.680
 counteroffensive bind commander 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.549
 the militia with the fact that despite 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.399
 actual documentary evidence 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.060
 the fact that no cyborgs in the new 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.909
 the terminal there is no guide Ukraine exactly 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.039
 Kiev declares to its citizens through 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.720
 media what's new 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.660
 the terminal is controlled though by 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.470
 fact it is not so emphasizes the commander 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.320
 the militia 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.240
 on with this purpose to repel the terminal and 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.880
 confirm 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.490
 let's say so conditionally heels 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.700
 cite not my own judgment 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.200
 to the word of the militia commanders 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.850
 own lies lie means 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.950
 Ukrainian authorities about the fact that 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.500
 they control the new terminal but if 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.880
 on the counteroffensive is developing 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.610
 fast enough 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.210
 I repeat for the last 15 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.600
 maybe 20 minutes tank breaks are heard 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.310
 even here in the city center Julia 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.170
 I want to clarify how Simeon is ready 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:57.150
 the militia would have been to such a counter 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:58.850
 so have something to answer orbit and well there 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.350
 Kiev militias also naturally there 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.670
 certain 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.830
 units quantity for us personally 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.650
 not disclosed too based nearby 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.590
 from the airport at the airport of course 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.420
 create fortifications here 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.420
 so large to reflect 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.660
 tank attacks to the full yet 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.430
 did not have time to erect but this afternoon 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.060
 erected we showed it too our 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.040
 on air 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.820
 the militia naturally retreat not 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.310
 assemble and ready from various 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.680
 anti-tank weapons beat this 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.000
 attack 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.130
