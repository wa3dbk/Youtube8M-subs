00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.309
 G8 summit opened 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.139
 world leaders will discuss recovery 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.730
 economy after the crisis and the situation in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.099
 hot spots discussion on this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 question promises to be hot course 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.699
 because of Syria the civil war in which 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.710
 seems to be entering a crucial stage the doctor and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.990
 many participants have already arrived at the sucker and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
 debunked them the day before got into the press 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 information about the surveillance that the US special services and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.070
 Britain four years ago allegedly 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.380
 led the delegation members on a similar 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.329
 summit in london that will surely cause 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.710
 questions to the British authorities Anton 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.210
 Volsky dreams to us in direct 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.899
 something but how is voltage there 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.730
 I feel that all participants 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.680
 today's summit just skillfully 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.379
 hide this stress in particular 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 barrack obama for example here tax and resort 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.789
 Lokhin came in full force 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 families that is, he brought a wife and two 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.360
 daughters are now in school 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.070
 vacation in these same minutes david 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.059
 kemeron welcomes all participants 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.140
 summit who came without ties to 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.789
 discovery themselves ie they came to that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.170
 the building itself where the next hours will start 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.540
 discuss all the most burning 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.299
 questions nevertheless the British press 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.330
 today writes that 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.520
 Russian-American relations 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 experiencing new coil in quotes 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.850
 cold war and the cold reception is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.290
 heights the meaning of the word 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.930
 since the Russian president 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.119
 will have to swim in cold water deal 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.770
 in the fact that both Obama and Putin in the morning 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.900
 will prove to like to swim in the pool but 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.509
 Obama turned out to be quicker and booked 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.009
 the first pool of his hotel, Vladimir 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.900
 Putin therefore had no choice 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.119
 do as he probably will tomorrow 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.920
 swim in this lake writes British 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.930
 the lake press and he is famous for its icy 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.670
 water but meets the British press 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.740
 british newspaper sun 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 and even in this situation, Vladimir Putin 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.869
 looks more advantageous because 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.729
 background 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.500
 from the gentle barrack of Obama who will 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.000
 indulge in the indoor gym he 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.009
 will swim practically in Siberian 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.140
 river but all this of course touches 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.299
 which just relax the atmosphere 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 tense summit atmosphere after 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.509
 scandal that got infected here 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.310
 the day before it became known that 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.200
 four years ago american 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.899
 special services auditioned Russian 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.120
 President of all this certainly poisoned 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.560
 the atmosphere themselves 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.450
 according to the Guardian newspaper during 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.160
 summit twenty in london four years 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.290
 back American intelligence agencies tried 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.670
 listen to telephone conversations Dmitry 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.380
 Medvedev it was the first meeting 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.540
 Russian President with barrack Obama 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.120
 that's when they started rebooting 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.070
 Russian- American relations 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.780

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.170
 it became known very recently the largest 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.270
 in the world it is located on the territory 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.130
 britain americans not only 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.170
 scheme found presidential communication but also 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.030
 tried to listen to the negotiations Dmitry 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.770
 Medvedev on satellite channels and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.540
 despite the fact that according to the Russian 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.850
 special services listen to presidential communication 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.980
 impossible scandal overshadowed the beginning 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.390
 the current summit british prime 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.160
 the minister declined to comment 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.620
 saying that he never discusses in public 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.840
 the work of security services baraka Obama 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.310
 hardly get away from the answer in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.140
 a few hours he meets with 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.760
 Vladimir Putin and according to some 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.860
 going to reassure russian 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.920
 president in his best intentions 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.209
 however, all this will remain behind the scenes 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.459
 the main topics of the G8 talks 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.560
 international trade waiver 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.540
 economic protectionism and of course 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 same series barack obama and david cameron 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.739
 seek to soften the Russian position in 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.410
 respect of the conflict and force Moscow 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.239
 refuse to supply c-300 to Damascus 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.700
 however, Vladimir Putin said that Russia 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.590
 fulfills a military contract without breaking 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.660
 international law and recalled that to 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.360
 those who support the Syrian opposition 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.049
 have questions i think you wont 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.130
 deny that it is hardly worth 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.280
 supports people who are not only 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.320
 kill their enemies but hide their bodies 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.720
 and eat their insides in front of 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.299
 public and under the cameras you want 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.110
 support these people you want these 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.400
 people supply weapons but then 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.019
 apparently hardly has any relation 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.849
 to humanitarian values ​​that are already 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.500
 hundreds of years 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.569
 preaching to confess in in europe 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.480
 in any case in russia on such 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.220
 can't imagine we should be on 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.260
 side of the Syrians seeking to 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.299

 western countries are adamant british 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.560
 the prime minister has already said he is confident 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.989
 the use of chemical weapons by troops 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.690
 asad it may be the basis for 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.160
 more decisive coalition action 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.740
