00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
chain leave as a coordinator so we had

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.570

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
kind of my approach to it was where as

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.790 
kind of my approach to it was where as
long<00:04:39.419> as<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.720> can<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.020> get<00:04:40.139> back<00:04:40.289> as<00:04:40.410> fast<00:04:40.470> as<00:04:40.680> I

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
can but that kind of I kind of failed

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.360 
can but that kind of I kind of failed
because<00:04:42.720> he<00:04:43.050> was<00:04:43.199> like<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.590> got<00:04:43.889> back<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.340> I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
because he was like I got back and I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.300
