00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
we try to keep the vigor moderate now in

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.789 
we try to keep the vigor moderate now in
California<00:00:03.090> where<00:00:03.750> they<00:00:03.899> have<00:00:04.259> will<00:00:04.440> control

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
California where they have will control

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.889 
California where they have will control
water<00:00:05.069> that's<00:00:05.460> quite<00:00:05.670> easy<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.240> they<00:00:06.660> just

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
water that's quite easy to do they just

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.890 
water that's quite easy to do they just
kind<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.560> tweak<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.980> by<00:00:08.130> irrigation<00:00:08.730> we<00:00:09.690> don't

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
kind of tweak it by irrigation we don't

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.610 
kind of tweak it by irrigation we don't
have<00:00:10.340> control<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.460> water<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.480> some<00:00:13.200> years<00:00:13.380> we

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
have control of water so some years we

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.440 
have control of water so some years we
might<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.950> more<00:00:14.099> growth<00:00:14.340> than<00:00:14.370> others<00:00:14.790> which

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
might get more growth than others which

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.810 
might get more growth than others which
is<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:16.500> learned<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:17.070> cover<00:00:17.460> crops

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
is how I've learned about cover crops

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.890 
is how I've learned about cover crops
and<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.630> grass<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.740> called<00:00:20.900> creeping

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and this grass here is called creeping

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.290 
and this grass here is called creeping
red<00:00:22.050> fescue<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.519> plant<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
red fescue and I plant that in the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.740 
red fescue and I plant that in the
vineyard<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.320> let<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.590> regulate<00:00:26.750> according

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
vineyard and I let it regulate according

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.599 
vineyard and I let it regulate according
to<00:00:27.930> how<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> vine<00:00:28.380> growth<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:28.920> fine<00:00:29.250> growth<00:00:29.429> is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
to how the vine growth if fine growth is

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
to how the vine growth if fine growth is
very<00:00:29.670> fast<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.330> let<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> grass<00:00:30.840> grow<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
very fast I let the grass grow more to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
very fast I let the grass grow more to
compete<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> vine<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.329> slow

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
compete with the vine if it's very slow

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.440 
compete with the vine if it's very slow
I<00:00:34.020> might<00:00:34.590> ill<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.190> herbicide<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> grass<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
I might ill or herbicide the grass in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.750 
I might ill or herbicide the grass in
order<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.410> compete<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.920> much<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.520> cover

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
order to not compete as much the cover

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
order to not compete as much the cover
crop<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> main<00:00:39.510> way<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> weed

competition is the main way that we

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.170 
competition is the main way that we
control<00:00:43.129> again<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.219> California<00:00:44.399> by<00:00:44.910> using

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
control again in California by using

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
control again in California by using
water<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.870> tweak<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:47.100> sometimes

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
water they can tweak it and sometimes

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.990 
water they can tweak it and sometimes
you<00:00:47.610> can't

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you can't

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600 
you can't
and<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.629> fact<00:00:48.809> behind<00:00:49.620> us<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> planting<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and in fact behind us is a planting a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.950 
and in fact behind us is a planting a
Carmenere<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:52.350> I'm<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.840> it's<00:00:54.840> an

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
Carmenere and I I'm I it's an

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
Carmenere and I I'm I it's an
experimental<00:00:55.440> planting<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.239> very

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
experimental planting and it's a very

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
experimental planting and it's a very
high<00:00:57.719> vigor<00:00:57.960> vine<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.710> worried<00:00:59.100> about

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
high vigor vine and I was worried about

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
high vigor vine and I was worried about
that<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> fact<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.780> block<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that and in fact my block that's in the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.820 
that and in fact my block that's in the
clay<00:01:02.390> where<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.840> using<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.500> different

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
clay where I'm using some different

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.960 
clay where I'm using some different
pruning<00:01:05.129> techniques<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
pruning techniques because it is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
pruning techniques because it is
starting<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> control<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.500> I'm

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
starting to get out of control and I'm

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.850 
starting to get out of control and I'm
not<00:01:07.770> sure<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.250> control<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.470> Jim<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.830> a

system even though they rarely use it in
France<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.640> was<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> developed<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
France it was kind of developed in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.760 
France it was kind of developed in
Bordeaux<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.970> sits<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> late

Bordeaux and it sits back in the late
80s<00:01:29.310> early<00:01:29.820> 90s<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.479> planted<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.259> our

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
80s early 90s we planted a lot of our

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710 
80s early 90s we planted a lot of our
vineyards<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.280> system<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.909> don't<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
vineyards on this system I don't use it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.530 
vineyards on this system I don't use it
much<00:01:33.990> anymore<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.670> reason<00:01:35.700> was<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.390> our

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
much anymore and the reason was is our

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.749 
much anymore and the reason was is our
vines<00:01:36.780> were<00:01:36.990> growing<00:01:37.290> very<00:01:37.500> vigorously<00:01:38.040> again

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
vines were growing very vigorously again

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.179 
vines were growing very vigorously again
mentioning<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.320> rainfall<00:01:40.860> bun<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
mentioning the the rainfall bun the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
mentioning the the rainfall bun the
rainfall<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> clay<00:01:42.570> soils<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> give<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
rainfall and the clay soils to give a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.580 
rainfall and the clay soils to give a
lot<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.829> vigour<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> idea<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.810> take

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
lot of vigour so the idea was to take

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
lot of vigour so the idea was to take
all<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.009> inherent<00:01:47.790> natural<00:01:48.000> vigor<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
all that inherent natural vigor and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
all that inherent natural vigor and
divide<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.770> into<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.280> separate<00:01:50.759> training

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
divide it into two separate training

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.600 
divide it into two separate training
systems<00:01:51.600> being<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> same<00:01:52.619> vine<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.250> their

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
systems being the same vine and their

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.660 
systems being the same vine and their
split<00:01:54.090> into<00:01:54.420> two<00:01:55.170> distinct<00:01:55.979> canopies<00:01:56.460> like

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
split into two distinct canopies like

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.940 
split into two distinct canopies like
two<00:01:56.820> different<00:01:57.149> solar<00:01:57.390> panels<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.619> way<00:01:58.740> the

two different solar panels the way the
liar<00:01:59.369> works<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.079> see<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
liar works is that as you can see this

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.190 
liar works is that as you can see this
is<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.770> grapevine<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.780> split

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
is one grapevine but it's split

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.370 
is one grapevine but it's split
immediately<00:02:04.890> into<00:02:05.280> two<00:02:06.180> different<00:02:06.420> panels<00:02:07.170> if

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
immediately into two different panels if

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.440 
immediately into two different panels if
you<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.970> course<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> winter

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you will and of course in the winter

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
you will and of course in the winter

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
time it's hard to visualize this but

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.760 
time it's hard to visualize this but
this<00:02:12.000> series<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.599> wires<00:02:12.810> here<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.319> be<00:02:13.440> one

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this series of wires here will be one

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
this series of wires here will be one
panel<00:02:14.190> will<00:02:14.340> roll<00:02:14.520> train<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.000> shoots<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.570> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
sure that it stays very thin and it's a

sure that it stays very thin and it's a
distinct<00:02:20.670> panel<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.600> we'll<00:02:21.720> do<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.990> exact

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
distinct panel then we'll do the exact

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.650 
distinct panel then we'll do the exact
same<00:02:22.260> thing<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> other<00:02:22.920> side<00:02:23.240> making<00:02:24.240> sure

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
same thing on the other side making sure

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.050 
same thing on the other side making sure
that<00:02:24.930> all<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.650> area<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.190> here<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.460> completely

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
that all this area in here is completely

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.360 
that all this area in here is completely
free<00:02:27.480> from<00:02:27.660> any<00:02:27.930> leaves<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
free from any leaves so that the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.280 
free from any leaves so that the
sunlight<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:30.150> hit<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.630> air<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:31.080> move

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
sunlight can hit it the air can move

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.230 
sunlight can hit it the air can move
around<00:02:31.500> things<00:02:32.220> aren't<00:02:32.430> bunched<00:02:32.790> up<00:02:32.910> because

around things aren't bunched up because

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.260 
around things aren't bunched up because
again<00:02:33.720> remember<00:02:33.900> dew<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.950> rainfall<00:02:35.520> causes

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
again remember dew and rainfall causes

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.870 
again remember dew and rainfall causes
wetness<00:02:36.960> which<00:02:37.170> causes<00:02:37.560> fungus<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.670> want<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
wetness which causes fungus so we want a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.390 
wetness which causes fungus so we want a
thin<00:02:39.180> canopy<00:02:39.750> very<00:02:39.990> Airy<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:40.980> dry<00:02:41.220> out

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
thin canopy very Airy you can dry out

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.240 
thin canopy very Airy you can dry out
quickly<00:02:41.760> after<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.240> dew<00:02:42.480> or<00:02:42.690> rain<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.100> as

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
quickly after a dew or rain but with as

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
going to be on both sides now the fruit

going to be on both sides now the fruit
all<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> fruit<00:02:49.860> will<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.010> right<00:02:50.280> where<00:02:50.430> my

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
all the fruit will be right where my

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.760 
all the fruit will be right where my
hand<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:51.000> right<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.480> zone<00:02:51.540> here<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
hand is right in this zone here and the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.950 
hand is right in this zone here and the
key<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.430> again<00:02:53.640> uniformity<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
key is again uniformity that all the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.950 
key is again uniformity that all the
fruit<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.430> same<00:02:56.670> place<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.810> where

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
fruit is in the same place this is where

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.250 
fruit is in the same place this is where
we<00:02:58.080> will<00:02:58.200> pull<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> leaves<00:02:58.710> away<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.220> keep<00:02:59.610> air

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
we will pull the leaves away to keep air

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.840 
we will pull the leaves away to keep air
and<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.680> actually<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:02.160> leaf<00:03:02.340> pulling<00:03:02.700> for

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
and we actually like leaf pulling for

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.660 
and we actually like leaf pulling for
example<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:04.500> very<00:03:04.740> important<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.370> define

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
example is it's very important to define

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.500 
example is it's very important to define
flavor<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:07.050> is<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.380> west<00:03:07.620> side<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:09.000> this

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
flavor this is the west side and we this

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.210 
flavor this is the west side and we this
is<00:03:09.690> Chardonnay<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.500> wouldn't<00:03:10.830> want<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.010> pull

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
is Chardonnay I wouldn't want to pull

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.740 
is Chardonnay I wouldn't want to pull
the<00:03:11.400> leaves<00:03:11.580> from<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> west<00:03:12.090> side<00:03:12.240> Chardonnay

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the leaves from the west side Chardonnay

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.330 
the leaves from the west side Chardonnay
because<00:03:12.960> you'd<00:03:13.080> have<00:03:13.110> direct<00:03:13.530> Sun<00:03:13.800> you'd<00:03:14.220> have

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
because you'd have direct Sun you'd have

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.040 
because you'd have direct Sun you'd have
more<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.700> cooked<00:03:14.970> baked<00:03:15.270> flavor<00:03:15.660> more

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
more of a cooked baked flavor more

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.440 
more of a cooked baked flavor more
caramelized<00:03:16.710> and<00:03:17.100> you'd<00:03:17.490> lose<00:03:17.670> more<00:03:17.940> acidity

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
caramelized and you'd lose more acidity

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.710 
caramelized and you'd lose more acidity
so<00:03:18.630> we<00:03:19.050> would<00:03:19.200> pull<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.620> east<00:03:19.920> side

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
so we would pull it on the east side

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.510 
so we would pull it on the east side
right<00:03:21.720> away<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:22.440> order<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.770> get<00:03:22.890> air<00:03:23.130> but<00:03:23.370> we'd

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
right away in order to get air but we'd

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.460 
right away in order to get air but we'd
leave<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.060> low<00:03:24.209> as<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.600> call<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> hat<00:03:25.140> on

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
leave the low as we call it the hat on

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.920 
leave the low as we call it the hat on
top<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.980> them<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.130> keep<00:03:26.310> them<00:03:26.370> shaded<00:03:27.330> but<00:03:27.780> then

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
top of them to keep them shaded but then

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.949 
top of them to keep them shaded but then
if<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.200> season<00:03:28.620> gets<00:03:29.130> cooler<00:03:29.550> later<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.480> say

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
if the season gets cooler later on say

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.620 
if the season gets cooler later on say
in<00:03:31.380> early<00:03:31.980> September<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:33.180> feel<00:03:33.390> we<00:03:33.420> need

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
in early September and we feel we need

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.020 
in early September and we feel we need
the<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.470> grapes<00:03:35.010> taste<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> little<00:03:35.490> green<00:03:35.760> and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
the the grapes taste a little green and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.690 
the the grapes taste a little green and
a<00:03:36.510> lot<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.380> concentration<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:38.040> malic<00:03:38.310> acid

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
a lot of concentration of malic acid

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.100 
a lot of concentration of malic acid
we'll<00:03:39.060> go<00:03:39.150> through<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.450> pull<00:03:39.630> those<00:03:39.840> leaves

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
we'll go through and pull those leaves

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.170 
we'll go through and pull those leaves
once<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.980> Sun<00:03:41.160> gets<00:03:41.340> lower<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.760> snot<00:03:42.030> is

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
once the Sun gets lower and snot is

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.800 
once the Sun gets lower and snot is
intense

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
intense

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.880 
intense
I<00:03:44.510> grow<00:03:45.510> all<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.810> Bordeaux<00:03:46.140> red<00:03:46.320> varieties

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
I grow all the Bordeaux red varieties

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.920 
I grow all the Bordeaux red varieties
and<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.520> that's<00:03:47.730> that's<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.270> region<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.570> focus

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
and so that's that's the region I focus

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.080 
and so that's that's the region I focus
on<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.260> Reds<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.709> my<00:03:49.860> my<00:03:50.280> cellar<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.790> mostly

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
on for Reds and my my cellar is mostly

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.810 
on for Reds and my my cellar is mostly
Bordeaux's<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.350> also<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.590> purchased<00:03:53.430> lesser

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
Bordeaux's and I also I purchased lesser

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.310 
Bordeaux's and I also I purchased lesser
ears<00:03:54.150> I'm<00:03:54.540> not<00:03:54.720> interested<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:55.200> great

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
ears I'm not interested in great

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.320 
ears I'm not interested in great
vintages<00:03:55.860> because<00:03:56.520> great<00:03:56.730> vintages<00:03:57.120> don't

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
vintages because great vintages don't

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
vintages because great vintages don't
teach<00:03:57.540> me<00:03:57.570> anything

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
teach me anything

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.380 
teach me anything
so<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.830> lesser<00:03:59.190> vintages<00:03:59.670> are<00:03:59.850> where<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.060> learn

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
so the lesser vintages are where I learn

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.420 
so the lesser vintages are where I learn
what<00:04:00.570> did<00:04:00.690> they<00:04:00.840> do<00:04:00.900> where<00:04:01.709> they<00:04:01.740> had<00:04:01.980> trouble

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
what did they do where they had trouble

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.680 
what did they do where they had trouble
because<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.760> have<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> lot<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.150> trouble<00:04:03.450> here<00:04:03.600> we

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
because we have a lot of trouble here we

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.540 
because we have a lot of trouble here we
don't<00:04:03.810> have<00:04:04.020> great<00:04:04.200> weather<00:04:04.410> we<00:04:05.220> have<00:04:05.340> weather

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
don't have great weather we have weather

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.130 
don't have great weather we have weather
very<00:04:05.820> similar<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.330> them<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.600> have<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.930> couple

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
very similar to them we have a couple

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.720 
very similar to them we have a couple
great<00:04:07.440> years<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.800> decade<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.340> then<00:04:08.490> I've<00:04:08.580> got<00:04:08.700> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
great years a decade and then I've got a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.610 
great years a decade and then I've got a
lot<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:08.880> mediocre<00:04:09.270> years<00:04:09.780> what<00:04:10.230> can<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.440> do<00:04:10.530> in

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
lot of mediocre years what can you do in

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.290 
lot of mediocre years what can you do in
the<00:04:10.709> mediocre<00:04:11.220> years<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.700> make<00:04:11.850> great<00:04:12.090> wine

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
the mediocre years to make great wine

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.420 
the mediocre years to make great wine
because<00:04:12.810> they<00:04:12.930> do<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.890> said<00:04:14.190> something

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
because they do that you said something

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.030 
because they do that you said something
about<00:04:15.109> looking<00:04:16.109> at<00:04:16.230> these<00:04:16.350> producers<00:04:16.799> that

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
about looking at these producers that

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.710 
about looking at these producers that
may<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.430> have<00:04:17.640> had<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:17.940> same<00:04:18.330> amount<00:04:18.660> of

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
may not have had the same amount of

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.800 
may not have had the same amount of
respect<00:04:19.910> recognition<00:04:20.910> something<00:04:21.600> like<00:04:21.690> that

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
respect recognition something like that

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.060 
respect recognition something like that
why<00:04:21.900> was<00:04:22.080> that<00:04:22.109> important<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
why was that important to you

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.610

Virginia does Virginia have a lot of

in<00:04:27.629> the<00:04:27.720> wine<00:04:27.870> world<00:04:27.900> no<00:04:30.740> what<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:31.949> it<00:04:31.979> so<00:04:32.460> I'm

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
in the wine world no what is it so I'm

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.629 
in the wine world no what is it so I'm
sort<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.479> in<00:04:33.599> the<00:04:33.629> same<00:04:33.870> situation<00:04:34.650> I'm<00:04:34.979> much

been doing it for generations so you

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.089 
been doing it for generations so you
know<00:04:39.539> I've<00:04:39.900> got<00:04:39.930> I'll<00:04:40.379> never<00:04:40.650> catch<00:04:40.860> up<00:04:40.889> to

know I've got I'll never catch up to
them<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.270> question<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.139> get<00:04:43.620> inside

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
them but the question is to get inside

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.129 
them but the question is to get inside
their<00:04:44.129> head<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.729> not<00:04:44.909> you<00:04:45.539> know<00:04:45.629> how<00:04:45.750> long<00:04:45.990> do

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
their head it's not you know how long do

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.330 
their head it's not you know how long do
you<00:04:46.199> keep<00:04:46.409> it<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.680> barrel<00:04:46.860> what<00:04:47.129> kind<00:04:47.280> of

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
you keep it in the barrel what kind of

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.070 
you keep it in the barrel what kind of
barrels<00:04:47.639> you<00:04:47.729> use<00:04:47.879> that's<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.810> means

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
barrels you use that's that means

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.070 
barrels you use that's that means
nothing<00:04:49.560> that's<00:04:50.219> the<00:04:50.789> questions<00:04:51.509> you<00:04:51.629> ask<00:04:51.810> is

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
nothing that's the questions you ask is

nothing that's the questions you ask is
not<00:04:52.110> what<00:04:52.800> what<00:04:53.069> you<00:04:53.189> do<00:04:53.340> but<00:04:53.610> why<00:04:53.759> you<00:04:53.819> do<00:04:54.300> it

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
not what what you do but why you do it

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.589 
not what what you do but why you do it
what<00:04:54.659> what<00:04:55.229> are<00:04:55.379> the<00:04:55.469> reasons<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.219> so<00:04:56.789> if<00:04:57.449> I

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
what what are the reasons and so if I

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.059 
what what are the reasons and so if I
can<00:04:57.780> spend<00:04:57.990> some<00:04:58.169> time<00:04:58.379> with<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.590> producer<00:04:59.009> and

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
can spend some time with a producer and

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.439 
can spend some time with a producer and
really<00:04:59.280> understand<00:04:59.729> what<00:04:59.789> they<00:05:00.030> feel<00:05:00.330> is

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
really understand what they feel is

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.230 
really understand what they feel is
important<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.379> gives<00:05:02.219> me<00:05:02.520> much<00:05:03.030> more

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
important that gives me much more

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.360 
important that gives me much more
information<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.110> that's<00:05:04.500> why<00:05:04.710> it's<00:05:05.190> the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
information and that's why it's the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.729 
information and that's why it's the
vineyard
