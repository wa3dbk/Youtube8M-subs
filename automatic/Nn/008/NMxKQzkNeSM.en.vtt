replicate let me know so I'm going to go

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970 
replicate let me know so I'm going to go
by<00:00:33.059> pages<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.230> case<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
by pages just in case so this was the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.340 
by pages just in case so this was the
first<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:36.000> been<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
first one that it's been here and this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.410 
first one that it's been here and this
is<00:00:37.410> page<00:00:37.710> number<00:00:38.070> five<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.210> nice

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
is page number five and it's nice

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.240 
is page number five and it's nice
because<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:40.469> also<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.680> I<00:00:43.680> guess<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because it also has the and I guess the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.810 
because it also has the and I guess the
instructions<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.510> tutorial<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:47.340> how<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> do

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
