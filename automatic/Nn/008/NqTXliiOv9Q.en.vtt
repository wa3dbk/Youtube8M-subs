Dodge has made some changes to the old
Hemi<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:07.590> I<00:00:07.620> asked<00:00:08.069> Motoman<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.669> bring<00:00:08.879> one

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
Hemi and so I asked Motoman to bring one

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.810 
Hemi and so I asked Motoman to bring one
ends<00:00:09.240> because<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.599> could<00:00:09.780> see<00:00:09.959> for<00:00:10.169> myself<00:00:10.820> the

all these bolts holding it together you

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.950 
all these bolts holding it together you
think<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.160> was<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> Rolls<00:01:14.610> Royce<00:01:14.960> these

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
think it was the Rolls Royce these

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.870 
think it was the Rolls Royce these
rubber<00:01:16.380> couplings<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.310> interesting

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
rubber couplings are very interesting

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.630 
rubber couplings are very interesting
they<00:01:18.420> take<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> place<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.520> America

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
they take the place of what in America

you'd<00:01:21.240> call<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.540> u-joint<00:01:22.100> now<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.370> like<00:01:23.640> I

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
you'd call a u-joint now there like I

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.149 
you'd call a u-joint now there like I
said<00:01:23.790> they're<00:01:24.120> made<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> rubber<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.950> they

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
said they're made of rubber and so they

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
said they're made of rubber and so they
don't<00:01:26.460> transmit<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.840> vibration<00:01:28.530> from

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
don't transmit the vibration from

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.250 
don't transmit the vibration from
component<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> component<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.840> actually

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
component to component they actually

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.950 
component to component they actually
dampen<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.100> vibration<00:01:32.760> and<00:01:32.970> they're<00:01:33.690> very

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
dampen the vibration and they're very

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
dampen the vibration and they're very
strong<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.350> they're<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:34.860> durable<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
strong and they're very durable and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.750 
strong and they're very durable and
they're<00:01:36.390> very<00:01:36.720> inexpensive<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:38.280> first<00:01:38.520> time

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
they're very inexpensive the first time

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.240 
they're very inexpensive the first time
I<00:01:38.790> saw<00:01:39.090> these<00:01:39.330> couplings<00:01:39.870> I<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> young<00:01:41.070> man

noticing the car the way it was

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.760 
noticing the car the way it was
constructed<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.960> different<00:01:55.409> than<00:01:55.590> what<00:01:55.740> I

hemispherical<00:04:13.200> shape<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.980> cylinder<00:04:14.459> head

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
hemispherical shape of the cylinder head

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.539 
hemispherical shape of the cylinder head
still<00:04:15.700> nearly<00:04:16.389> a<00:04:16.870> full<00:04:17.380> hemispherical<00:04:18.280> shaped

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
still nearly a full hemispherical shaped

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.719 
still nearly a full hemispherical shaped
cylinder<00:04:18.940> head<00:04:19.060> but<00:04:19.359> not<00:04:19.509> quite<00:04:19.919> but<00:04:20.919> they've

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
cylinder head but not quite but they've

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.110 
cylinder head but not quite but they've
gained<00:04:22.120> more<00:04:22.900> volumetric<00:04:23.590> efficiency<00:04:24.120> by

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
gained more volumetric efficiency by

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.779 
gained more volumetric efficiency by
being<00:04:25.479> able<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.870> use<00:04:25.990> larger<00:04:26.710> valves<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.610> they

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
being able to use larger valves so they

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.060 
being able to use larger valves so they
end<00:04:27.940> up<00:04:28.120> with<00:04:28.270> more<00:04:28.479> horsepower<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:29.500> question

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
end up with more horsepower the question

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.490 
end up with more horsepower the question
was<00:04:30.539> what<00:04:31.539> is<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.810> Hemi

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
was what is a Hemi

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.100 
was what is a Hemi
well<00:04:32.979> back<00:04:33.250> in<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.580> muscle-car<00:04:34.000> days<00:04:34.419> when

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
well back in the muscle-car days when

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.050 
well back in the muscle-car days when
guys<00:04:35.320> were<00:04:35.530> arguing<00:04:35.740> over<00:04:36.009> Fords<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.610> Chevys

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
guys were arguing over Fords and Chevys

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.930 
guys were arguing over Fords and Chevys
a<00:04:37.330> Hemi<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.320> what<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.949> ended<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.400> arguments

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
a Hemi is what you ended the arguments

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.580 
a Hemi is what you ended the arguments
with<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:43.330> they<00:04:43.479> told<00:04:43.720> me<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.080> Dodge<00:04:44.320> and
