00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.629
 the army 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.119
 It is difficult to move forward a little more in just two years of life 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.890
 I have met expectations created by the public that tracks the title 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.089
 directly with great forum 4 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.580
 but of course the guilt of this link does not give rise to the respectable, much less is it 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.300
 the people of thq the one that eddie ceded fire match of the patron who had 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 made rockstar 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.960
 and that will inevitably lead to comparison 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.140
 it is possible that they are introduced where they challenge series like the title of rockstar 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.980
 and it is also possible that technically it is not up to it but the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.200
 complaints at home just like it did then and if at the end of the story the 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.190
 podium is very similar 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.900
 the action of inflated two start out the first part the first thing that 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.930
 we will make it to our character with a complete editor that we 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.380
 will allow to change from the smallest details of the physical handle 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.550
 example the voice 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.020
 and we do not have to start the adventure 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.660
 the structure as we say is the same as those who are not people at 4 there is an arc 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.190
 story that tells the story mission by mission and alternatives for 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.240
 degrease commissions a little more absurd than the guerrilla and respect 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.370
 because if something is important in centers 2 is respect 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.520
 not only do we have to get ahead economically as important as the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 money we have are the friends we can make for our band and the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.690
 psychological pressure that our enemies always have two bands of 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.490
 the city 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.880
 the argument in any case is correct but too deep 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.250
 and the other missions a thousand days in two groups in one of them we will choose 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.180
 the regions depending on the rival band that came to attack 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.340
 and the rest simply arandilla of the general hospital 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.080
 and in the last oars of everything from killing someone to stealing certain car 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.570
 even more crazy things like dirty in the city with a waste water truck 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 fox and reach certain district of the city 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.150
 the navigation menu is calcadito of his older brother there is a general map that 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.240
 our city with all the places at thousands of interest including the locals 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.069
 fast food stores that clothes for example alcohol and drugs 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.469
 and our will make a place to sleep and change clothes 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.909
 there are also places called polleros because there is fear of our 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.180
 search and capture order for a small fee how to get rid of the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.149
 police entered when we go up to the neck 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:25.439
 did not miss the phone with his memories go to the friends of the gps 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.210
 supposed 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.959
 that will help us reach any point on the map 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.239
 the mechanical section of sensor knows I started quite games very easy to 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.959
 handle and after the date when the movements 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.989
 It must be said that it is much easier to throw yourself general 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.650
 driving for example is much more affordable bearable and it is very difficult 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.869
 that the army although we are doing the goat in the most dangerous crisis 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.889
 and technically how do you do well is not correct but neither is it 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.049
 there are two parts of the city visually lowered injury after 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.979
 and the movement of the characters despite being excluded on occasion 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.249
 they are quite unnatural 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.729
 summarizing census offers us a complete gaming experience at a 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.820
 long and intense single-player campaign 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.150
 and the triple box that provide online multiplayer mode either 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.209
 cooperative confrontation 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.059
 I know that the comparisons are odious but I did like the experience of 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.569
 game dgt to four 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 you can take a look at this game 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.029
 afp 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:21.649
