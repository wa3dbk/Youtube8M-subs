00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello friends look what we have here 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.880
 here we have two tudela buds for 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.790
 those who do not know him 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.820
 they are a kind of lettuce that are very 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.660
 very compact very tight and that 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.360
 traditionally they are usually put 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.880
 split in half with garlic anchovies 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.640
 and olive oil these are the three 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.490
 ingredients that are traditionally 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.170
 they put the buds spread over the 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.910
 half but we're going to make a 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.970
 form with the same ingredients of a 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.440
 different way that we think it stands out 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.370
 much more the taste 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.370
 let's see 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.579
 Well, we already have them well cleaned 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.399
 we have opened these here the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.469
 we have opened in three pieces and these 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.239
 they are open in the middle that is the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.539
 traditional way that is always usual 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.790
 present and now let's go here we have 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:09.910
 the goalkeeper and we are going to crush the eyes 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.910
 with oil and anchovies 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.770
 Well, here we have garlic and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.110
 anchovies we already see clearly and we will keep 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.570
 well we have been adding a little bit 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.950
 the oil so that they go well 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.090
 the sauce 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.690
 and now we only have one 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.260
 teaspoon put and pour it over the 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.300
 elbows 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.970
 Well, you see, we've thrown all the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.460
 mixture of oil, garlic and anchovies 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 above 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 which for us has much more flavor 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.880
 because the oil is impregnated is 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.210
 remember the anchovies and they are much better 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.100
 and how 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.049
 optional if you think a little oil 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.049
 Well, we just spray 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.610
 with a little oil with a drop of 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.920
 oil 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.920
 each of the parts of the buds 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.600
 and least indirectly us 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.009
 let's go to the table to do them because of 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.560
 true that the difference to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.950
 crush the anchovies and I hope that you 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.950
 have liked and until next time 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.950
 goodbye
