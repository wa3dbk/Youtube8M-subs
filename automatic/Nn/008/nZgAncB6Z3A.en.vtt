00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay so and we can see that by looking

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.440 
okay so and we can see that by looking
at<00:00:07.250> it<00:00:09.010> okay<00:00:10.010> so<00:00:10.070> it's<00:00:10.370> been<00:00:10.549> adding<00:00:10.910> adding

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
at it okay so it's been adding adding

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.600 
at it okay so it's been adding adding
extra<00:00:11.990> detail<00:00:12.379> and<00:00:12.590> extra<00:00:12.860> creases<00:00:13.129> in<00:00:13.459> here

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
extra detail and extra creases in here

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.890 
extra detail and extra creases in here
by<00:00:13.789> adding<00:00:14.299> mesh<00:00:14.570> to<00:00:14.780> the<00:00:14.869> low<00:00:15.020> poly

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.330 

right<00:00:20.560> okay<00:00:20.980> so<00:00:21.960> let's<00:00:22.960> add<00:00:23.230> a<00:00:23.260> few<00:00:23.560> more<00:00:23.619> maybe

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
right okay so let's add a few more maybe

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.760 
right okay so let's add a few more maybe
we<00:00:24.730> wanted<00:00:25.060> this<00:00:25.210> piece<00:00:25.539> up<00:00:25.779> on<00:00:25.960> top<00:00:26.170> creased

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
we wanted this piece up on top creased

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.580 
we wanted this piece up on top creased
and<00:00:26.949> right<00:00:27.130> now<00:00:27.279> it's<00:00:27.460> very<00:00:27.520> smooth<00:00:28.529> okay<00:00:29.529> so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
and right now it's very smooth okay so

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.060 
and right now it's very smooth okay so
what<00:00:30.279> if<00:00:30.369> we<00:00:30.430> try<00:00:30.730> that<00:00:31.710> I'm<00:00:32.710> going<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.890> grab

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
what if we try that I'm going to grab

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.150 
what if we try that I'm going to grab
both<00:00:33.280> of<00:00:33.460> those<00:00:33.579> edges<00:00:33.970> on<00:00:34.059> each<00:00:34.210> side<00:00:35.010> ring<00:00:36.010> it

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
both of those edges on each side ring it

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:45.270 
both of those edges on each side ring it
and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.780> connect<00:00:43.620> okay<00:00:44.620> so<00:00:44.680> if<00:00:44.860> I<00:00:44.949> pinch

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
and then connect okay so if I pinch

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.020 
and then connect okay so if I pinch
those<00:00:45.519> together<00:00:47.519> you<00:00:48.519> can<00:00:48.699> now<00:00:48.910> see<00:00:49.329> that<00:00:49.710> it's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
those together you can now see that it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.609 
those together you can now see that it's
you<00:00:52.030> know<00:00:52.119> it's<00:00:52.239> a<00:00:52.420> it's<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.750> peak<00:00:53.019> now<00:00:53.290> instead

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
you know it's a it's a peak now instead

00:00:53.619 --> 00:01:00.810 
you know it's a it's a peak now instead
of<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.830> rounded<00:00:54.190> curve<00:00:59.129> you<00:01:00.129> know<00:01:00.220> this<00:01:00.549> area

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
of a rounded curve you know this area

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.000 
of a rounded curve you know this area
looks<00:01:01.150> can<00:01:01.659> really<00:01:02.049> really<00:01:02.290> terrible<00:01:02.680> so

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
looks can really really terrible so

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
looks can really really terrible so
let's<00:01:03.400> check<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:03.879> out<00:01:04.500> let's<00:01:05.500> look<00:01:05.680> at<00:01:05.830> these

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
let's check that out let's look at these

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.219 
let's check that out let's look at these
these<00:01:07.689> edges<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.290> here<00:01:09.299> oops<00:01:10.299> from<00:01:10.659> wrong

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
these edges in here oops from wrong

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.920 
these edges in here oops from wrong
object<00:01:11.710> selected<00:01:15.420> okay<00:01:16.420> right<00:01:16.630> now<00:01:16.750> we've<00:01:16.900> got

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
object selected okay right now we've got

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.719 
object selected okay right now we've got
this<00:01:17.229> crease<00:01:17.619> edge<00:01:17.830> at<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.070> top<00:01:18.310> but<00:01:18.580> there's

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
this crease edge at the top but there's

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.570 
this crease edge at the top but there's
no<00:01:18.850> supporting<00:01:19.390> edges<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:19.840> let's<00:01:20.110> grab<00:01:20.320> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
no supporting edges so let's grab this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.030 
no supporting edges so let's grab this
edge<00:01:21.580> and<00:01:22.180> will<00:01:22.570> ring<00:01:22.930> that<00:01:24.150> connect<00:01:26.010> okay<00:01:27.010> I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
edge and will ring that connect okay I

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.090 
edge and will ring that connect okay I
mean<00:01:27.220> already<00:01:27.430> it's<00:01:28.440> it's<00:01:29.440> showing<00:01:29.830> a<00:01:29.920> lot<00:01:30.040> of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
mean already it's it's showing a lot of

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.160 
mean already it's it's showing a lot of
promise<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:31.240> what<00:01:31.390> we've<00:01:31.510> done<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.720> right<00:01:32.050> now

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
promise so what we've done is right now

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.660 
promise so what we've done is right now
we've<00:01:32.350> added<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:32.770> crease<00:01:33.190> right<00:01:33.370> down<00:01:33.550> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
we've added this crease right down the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.430 
we've added this crease right down the
middle<00:01:33.730> or<00:01:34.300> this<00:01:34.480> extra<00:01:34.870> edge<00:01:34.960> on<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.260> middle

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
middle or this extra edge on the middle

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.920 
middle or this extra edge on the middle
and<00:01:36.070> I'm<00:01:36.550> going<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.790> slide<00:01:37.120> that<00:01:37.360> up<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.750> down

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
and I'm going to slide that up and down

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.230 
and I'm going to slide that up and down
to<00:01:38.080> show<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.800> effects<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:39.790> moving

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
to show you the effects of moving

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.770 
to show you the effects of moving
geometry<00:01:41.430> using<00:01:42.430> this<00:01:42.760> this<00:01:43.330> method<00:01:43.570> of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
geometry using this this method of

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.120 
geometry using this this method of
modeling<00:01:45.270> okay<00:01:46.560> never<00:01:47.560> put<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.860> up<00:01:47.980> to<00:01:48.010> a

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
modeling okay never put it up to a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.180 
modeling okay never put it up to a
hundred<00:01:48.370> because<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.570> will<00:01:49.780> just<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:51.100> know

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
hundred because that will just you know

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.770 
hundred because that will just you know
you'll<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:51.490> have<00:01:51.729> overlapping<00:01:52.180> edges<00:01:52.450> and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
you'll just have overlapping edges and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.690 
you'll just have overlapping edges and
overlapping<00:01:53.140> birds<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:53.890> will<00:01:54.010> make<00:01:54.640> it

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
overlapping birds and that will make it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.630 
overlapping birds and that will make it
really<00:01:55.390> tough<00:01:55.600> when<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.870> go<00:01:56.050> back<00:01:56.260> to<00:01:56.640> select

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
really tough when you go back to select

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.719 
really tough when you go back to select
or<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.090> edit<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.040> want<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.280> go<00:02:00.370> close

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
or to edit it so if you want to go close

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.850 
or to edit it so if you want to go close
dating<00:02:01.450> on<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.600> mid-90s<00:02:02.320> something<00:02:02.740> like

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
dating on the mid-90s something like

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.880 
dating on the mid-90s something like
that<00:02:03.870> I'm<00:02:04.870> going<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.110> use<00:02:05.200> two<00:02:05.380> segments<00:02:05.799> at

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
that I'm going to use two segments at

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.979 
that I'm going to use two segments at
this<00:02:06.040> point<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:08.560> pinch<00:02:08.950> those<00:02:09.190> out<00:02:09.489> so<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
this point and just pinch those out so I

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.720 
this point and just pinch those out so I
can<00:02:11.080> get<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.260> same<00:02:11.560> kind<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.920> pinch<00:02:12.340> detail

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
can get the same kind of pinch detail

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.830 
can get the same kind of pinch detail
down<00:02:12.970> at<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.150> bottom<00:02:13.299> as<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.659> do<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.959> top

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
down at the bottom as I do at the top

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.720 
down at the bottom as I do at the top
and<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:17.379> okay<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:19.180> top<00:02:19.540> part<00:02:20.099> i'm<00:02:21.099> going<00:02:21.580> to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
and here okay this top part i'm going to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.080 
and here okay this top part i'm going to
inset<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:24.069> get<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> other<00:02:24.400> supporting<00:02:24.970> edge

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
inset to get the other supporting edge

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.580 
inset to get the other supporting edge
in<00:02:25.269> there

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.330 

and<00:02:30.940> I'm<00:02:31.940> going<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> do<00:02:32.360> another<00:02:32.630> one<00:02:33.340> around

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
and I'm going to do another one around

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:44.310 
and I'm going to do another one around
here<00:02:37.750> bring<00:02:38.750> connect<00:02:40.450> sheriff<00:02:41.450> looks<00:02:41.870> fine

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.260 

all<00:02:45.320> right<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:45.800> we've<00:02:45.950> got<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> much<00:02:46.700> nicer

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
all right so now we've got a much nicer

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.990 
all right so now we've got a much nicer
looking<00:02:47.920> piece<00:02:49.930> maybe<00:02:50.930> I'll<00:02:51.170> lower<00:02:52.040> lower

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
looking piece maybe I'll lower lower

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:05.710 
looking piece maybe I'll lower lower
this<00:02:53.240> down<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:58.570> something<00:02:59.570> like<00:02:59.600> that<00:03:04.720> now

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
this down but something like that now

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.660 
this down but something like that now
this<00:03:05.840> edged<00:03:06.140> isn't<00:03:06.590> isn't<00:03:06.800> quite<00:03:07.130> working<00:03:07.280> for

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
this edged isn't isn't quite working for

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.610 
this edged isn't isn't quite working for
me<00:03:07.820> it<00:03:07.940> looks<00:03:08.150> kind<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.480> two<00:03:08.959> rounded<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.470> too

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
me it looks kind of two rounded and too

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.360 
me it looks kind of two rounded and too
narrow<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.360> let's<00:03:11.360> quickly<00:03:11.510> look<00:03:11.750> at<00:03:11.990> that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
narrow so let's quickly look at that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:20.949 
narrow so let's quickly look at that
before<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.400> threw<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:14.740> press<00:03:15.740> stop<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:16.459> here<00:03:19.959> I'm

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
before I threw a press stop on here I'm

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.170 
before I threw a press stop on here I'm
going<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.200> select<00:03:21.320> all<00:03:21.650> these<00:03:22.040> edges<00:03:22.430> these

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
going to select all these edges these

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.100 
going to select all these edges these
three<00:03:23.540> edges<00:03:24.610> bring<00:03:25.610> them<00:03:25.790> all<00:03:26.920> do<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:27.980> connect

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
three edges bring them all do a connect

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:39.460 
three edges bring them all do a connect
with<00:03:31.660> 28<00:03:32.660> pinch<00:03:33.170> out<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:36.440> hit<00:03:36.860> okay<00:03:38.470> suddenly

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
with 28 pinch out and hit okay suddenly

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.920 
with 28 pinch out and hit okay suddenly
there<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.800> go<00:03:39.950> now<00:03:40.280> that's<00:03:40.550> it's<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.300> much<00:03:41.540> nicer

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
there we go now that's it's a much nicer

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.350 
there we go now that's it's a much nicer
it's<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.530> thicker<00:03:43.010> edge<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> little<00:03:43.580> stronger

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
it's a thicker edge a little stronger

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.930 
it's a thicker edge a little stronger
looking<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:46.040> might<00:03:46.220> want<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.430> move<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.730> whole

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
looking we might want to move this whole

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.509 
looking we might want to move this whole
object<00:03:47.120> back<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:48.080> a<00:03:48.140> little<00:03:48.260> bit<00:03:48.440> sticking<00:03:49.280> out

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
object back in a little bit sticking out

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:57.060 
object back in a little bit sticking out
too<00:03:49.700> far<00:03:54.489> okay<00:03:55.489> what<00:03:55.640> we<00:03:55.760> could<00:03:55.940> do<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.390> know

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
too far okay what we could do you know

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.420 
too far okay what we could do you know
instead<00:03:58.070> of<00:03:58.130> adding<00:03:58.640> in<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:59.000> sphere<00:03:59.720> on<00:03:59.870> top

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
instead of adding in a sphere on top

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.590 
instead of adding in a sphere on top
adding<00:04:01.430> another<00:04:01.670> extrude<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.150> there<00:04:02.300> we<00:04:02.450> could

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
adding another extrude in there we could

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.350 
adding another extrude in there we could
just<00:04:02.720> even<00:04:02.900> put<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.050> sphere<00:04:05.200> okay<00:04:06.200> align<00:04:06.800> it<00:04:06.980> I

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.490 

know<00:04:11.360> it's<00:04:11.510> in<00:04:11.660> there<00:04:11.690> I'm<00:04:11.900> just<00:04:12.019> going<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.230> pop

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
know it's in there I'm just going to pop

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.229 
know it's in there I'm just going to pop
it<00:04:12.709> out

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:35.670 

ok<00:04:20.380> now<00:04:21.380> let's<00:04:21.889> give<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:23.080> one<00:04:24.080> color

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.439 

maybe<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.370> slight<00:04:37.440> blue<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:43.150> will<00:04:43.270> turn

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
maybe a slight blue to it it will turn

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:50.270 
maybe a slight blue to it it will turn
up<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.660> spec

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.950 

right<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.060> so<00:04:51.180> there<00:04:51.330> we<00:04:51.450> go<00:04:51.510> we've<00:04:51.810> got<00:04:51.840> a

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
right and so there we go we've got a

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.700 
right and so there we go we've got a
really<00:04:52.139> simple<00:04:52.500> rim<00:04:53.690> again<00:04:54.690> not<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.080> not<00:04:55.680> the

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
really simple rim again not the not the

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.220 
really simple rim again not the not the
most<00:04:55.920> complicated<00:04:56.639> rim<00:04:57.120> out<00:04:57.270> there<00:04:57.480> but<00:04:58.110> at

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
most complicated rim out there but at

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.900 
most complicated rim out there but at
least<00:04:58.320> it<00:04:58.530> gives<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.770> an<00:04:58.889> idea<00:04:59.010> about<00:04:59.340> using

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
least it gives you an idea about using

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.879 
least it gives you an idea about using
sub<00:05:00.120> D<00:05:00.270> modeling<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:02.870> yeah<00:05:03.870> there<00:05:04.200> we<00:05:04.290> go<00:05:04.320> you

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
sub D modeling and yeah there we go you

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.800 
sub D modeling and yeah there we go you
can<00:05:05.010> always<00:05:05.130> make<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.490> back<00:05:05.669> for<00:05:06.000> it<00:05:06.120> using

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
can always make it back for it using

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.450 
can always make it back for it using
similar<00:05:07.110> methods<00:05:08.510> right<00:05:09.510> now<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.980> know<00:05:11.070> i'm

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
similar methods right now you know i'm

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.360 
similar methods right now you know i'm
not<00:05:11.639> going<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:12.169> again<00:05:13.169> similar<00:05:13.830> methods<00:05:14.190> to

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
not going to again similar methods to

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.740 
not going to again similar methods to
make<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.639> back<00:05:14.820> it's<00:05:15.240> just<00:05:15.419> a<00:05:15.510> matter<00:05:15.630> of

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
make the back it's just a matter of

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.490 
make the back it's just a matter of
executing<00:05:16.200> pieces<00:05:16.650> in<00:05:16.770> words<00:05:17.990> but<00:05:18.990> there<00:05:19.410> we

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
executing pieces in words but there we

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:30.310 
executing pieces in words but there we
go<00:05:19.730> hope<00:05:20.730> you<00:05:20.850> enjoyed<00:05:21.090> it

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.380 

you
