00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
4.4.4 as you can see here it is a little

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.720 
4.4.4 as you can see here it is a little
bit<00:00:24.330> laggy<00:00:24.949> that's<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.220> due<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
bit laggy that's just due to the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.550 
bit laggy that's just due to the
hardware<00:00:27.029> limitations<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.320> phone

there's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.939> tweak<00:00:30.300> I've<00:00:30.539> been<00:00:30.660> doing

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
there's a little tweak I've been doing

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.880 
there's a little tweak I've been doing
what<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> performance<00:00:34.530> control

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
what you do is go to performance control

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.860 
what you do is go to performance control
and<00:00:35.190> raise<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.670> minimum<00:00:36.030> speed<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.480> little<00:00:36.719> bit

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and raise the minimum speed a little bit

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.030 
and raise the minimum speed a little bit
I<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> raised<00:00:37.890> about<00:00:38.100> 810<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> also<00:00:40.980> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I have it raised about 810 and also you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.720 
I have it raised about 810 and also you
can<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> little<00:00:41.520> bit<00:00:41.730> farther<00:00:42.290> for<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
can go a little bit farther for the

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
can go a little bit farther for the
maximum<00:00:44.730> speed<00:00:45.000> there

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
maximum speed there

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.410 
maximum speed there
I<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:47.010> find<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.320> faster

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
I do find this to be a little bit faster

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.939 
I do find this to be a little bit faster
you<00:00:51.420> know<00:00:51.840> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.800> maximum

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you know if you want if you want maximum

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
you know if you want if you want maximum
battery<00:00:53.370> life<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.879> set<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> lowest

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
battery life just set it to the lowest

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
battery life just set it to the lowest
but<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.469> you're<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:55.739> home<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:56.340> close

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
but if you're at home and you're close

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
but if you're at home and you're close
to<00:00:56.699> wall<00:00:57.510> adapter<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.109> don't<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.379> care

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to wall adapter you don't really care

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
to wall adapter you don't really care
about<00:00:58.770> battery<00:00:59.219> life<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:01:00.000> raise<00:01:00.149> this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
about battery life you can raise this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.520 
about battery life you can raise this
and<00:01:00.629> makes<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.230> much<00:01:01.620> much<00:01:01.829> faster<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:03.300> not

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
and makes it much much faster it's not

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.130 
and makes it much much faster it's not
overclocking<00:01:04.640> but<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> racism<00:01:06.360> minimum<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
overclocking but the racism minimum so
