first<00:05:20.320> and<00:05:20.680> then<00:05:21.400> favorite<00:05:21.790> it<00:05:21.910> on<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.270> top<00:05:22.510> I

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
first and then favorite it on the top I

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.320 
first and then favorite it on the top I
actually<00:05:24.250> go<00:05:24.790> back<00:05:25.060> to<00:05:25.300> TV<00:05:25.540> shows<00:05:26.820> and<00:05:27.820> here

actually go back to TV shows and here

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.300 
actually go back to TV shows and here
yeah<00:05:28.930> right<00:05:29.110> there<00:05:29.380> I<00:05:29.410> need<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.770> press<00:05:30.070> the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
yeah right there I need to press the

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.160 
yeah right there I need to press the
star<00:05:30.550> on<00:05:30.730> the<00:05:30.850> top<00:05:31.030> here<00:05:31.300> instead<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.780> going

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
star on the top here instead of going

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.620 
star on the top here instead of going
straight<00:05:32.560> away<00:05:33.250> from<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.670> list<00:05:33.880> so<00:05:34.420> I<00:05:34.450> would

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
straight away from the list so I would

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.750 
straight away from the list so I would
like<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:35.080> be<00:05:35.170> implemented<00:05:35.680> also<00:05:36.130> if<00:05:36.520> the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
like that to be implemented also if the

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.310 
like that to be implemented also if the
screen<00:05:37.000> is<00:05:37.060> turned<00:05:37.360> off

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
screen is turned off

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.320 
screen is turned off
you<00:05:38.680> will<00:05:38.830> not<00:05:38.980> buffer<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.520> video<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:40.090> don't

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
you will not buffer the video so don't

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.090 
you will not buffer the video so don't
think<00:05:40.660> you<00:05:41.200> could<00:05:41.350> just<00:05:41.380> turn<00:05:41.620> off<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.800> video

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
think you could just turn off the video

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.700 
think you could just turn off the video
and<00:05:42.490> allow<00:05:43.480> yourself<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.930> stream<00:05:44.290> it<00:05:44.440> because
