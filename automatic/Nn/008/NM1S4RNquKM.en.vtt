00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.390 

basically<00:00:19.900> we're<00:00:20.170> designing<00:00:20.920> and<00:00:21.189> building

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
basically we're designing and building

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.060 
basically we're designing and building
and<00:00:21.849> now<00:00:22.000> testing<00:00:22.509> a<00:00:22.660> human<00:00:23.470> powered<00:00:23.650> off-road

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
and now testing a human powered off-road

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.189 
and now testing a human powered off-road
vehicle<00:00:24.490> it's<00:00:25.179> mainly<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.630> design<00:00:25.929> project

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
vehicle it's mainly a design project

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.790 
vehicle it's mainly a design project
that<00:00:26.800> runs<00:00:27.660> shows<00:00:28.660> our<00:00:28.839> capabilities<00:00:29.439> as

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
that runs shows our capabilities as

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.519 
that runs shows our capabilities as
design<00:00:30.490> engineers<00:00:30.999> it's<00:00:31.779> a<00:00:31.900> very<00:00:32.110> realistic

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
design engineers it's a very realistic

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.470 
design engineers it's a very realistic
process<00:00:33.160> to<00:00:33.280> what<00:00:33.400> we<00:00:33.490> do<00:00:33.640> in<00:00:33.760> industry<00:00:34.000> really

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
process to what we do in industry really

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.600 
process to what we do in industry really
I've<00:00:34.660> really<00:00:35.020> enjoyed<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.490> enjoyed<00:00:36.490> the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
I've really enjoyed the enjoyed the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.070 
I've really enjoyed the enjoyed the
process<00:00:36.970> because<00:00:37.240> it<00:00:37.360> is<00:00:37.420> very<00:00:37.720> much<00:00:37.870> like

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
process because it is very much like

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.570 
process because it is very much like
what<00:00:38.320> we<00:00:38.350> would<00:00:38.500> be<00:00:38.560> doing<00:00:38.680> in<00:00:38.980> industry<00:00:39.370> and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
what we would be doing in industry and

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.660 
what we would be doing in industry and
it's<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.210> good<00:00:40.800> stepping<00:00:41.800> stone<00:00:41.950> into<00:00:42.370> actually

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
it's a good stepping stone into actually

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.160 
it's a good stepping stone into actually
doing<00:00:42.700> it<00:00:43.030> yeah<00:00:43.570> it's<00:00:43.750> been<00:00:43.840> a<00:00:43.870> very<00:00:44.080> good

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
doing it yeah it's been a very good

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.020 
doing it yeah it's been a very good
project<00:00:44.650> and<00:00:44.740> we've<00:00:45.310> had<00:00:45.460> some<00:00:45.610> problems<00:00:45.880> with

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
project and we've had some problems with

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.820 
project and we've had some problems with
our<00:00:46.090> design<00:00:46.390> it's<00:00:46.570> not<00:00:46.630> ideal<00:00:46.870> but<00:00:47.080> and<00:00:47.560> we're

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
our design it's not ideal but and we're

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.229 
our design it's not ideal but and we're
getting<00:00:47.920> past<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.310> now

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.479 

well<00:00:55.110> basically<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:56.100> did<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
well basically we did a lot of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
well basically we did a lot of
brainstorming<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.870> different<00:00:58.170> things<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
brainstorming and different things and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.080 
brainstorming and different things and
trying<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.860> original<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> main<00:00:59.820> thing

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
trying to be original was the main thing

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.509 
trying to be original was the main thing
and<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:01.290> thinking<00:01:01.559> outside<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.920> box<00:01:02.129> like

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
and it's thinking outside the box like

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.100 
and it's thinking outside the box like
we<00:01:02.790> haven't<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.480> conventional<00:01:03.930> steering

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we haven't got conventional steering

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
we haven't got conventional steering
we've<00:01:04.350> gone<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.739> some<00:01:05.040> hydraulic<00:01:05.700> steering

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we've gone for some hydraulic steering

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.219 
we've gone for some hydraulic steering
which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.330> quite<00:01:06.600> nuanced<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.050> just<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
which is quite nuanced with just a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.680 
which is quite nuanced with just a
little<00:01:07.380> vehicle<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.580> quite<00:01:08.729> yeah<00:01:09.450> trying

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
little vehicle so it's quite yeah trying

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.690 
little vehicle so it's quite yeah trying
to<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.869> innovative<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.650> different<00:01:11.190> was<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to be innovative and different was that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
to be innovative and different was that
what<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.030> were<00:01:12.119> thinking<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:13.110> been<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
what we were thinking it's been a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.790 
what we were thinking it's been a
difficult<00:01:14.190> process<00:01:14.220> yeah<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.390> design

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
difficult process yeah the the design

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.590 
difficult process yeah the the design
going<00:01:16.800> from<00:01:17.190> designing<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.149> making<00:01:18.450> sure

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
going from designing it and making sure

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.790 
going from designing it and making sure
the<00:01:18.720> end<00:01:18.840> product<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.290> right

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
the end product was right

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.370 
the end product was right
they<00:01:20.100> took<00:01:20.340> there<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> him

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
they took there was a bit of him

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.749 
they took there was a bit of him
workshop<00:01:22.380> activity<00:01:22.860> after<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.610> got

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
workshop activity after we actually got

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850 
workshop activity after we actually got
it<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> working<00:01:25.050> but

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it back to get it right and working but

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
it back to get it right and working but
yes<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.910> an<00:01:27.060> enjoyable<00:01:27.270> project<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.840> too

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
yes it's an enjoyable project not too

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.660 
yes it's an enjoyable project not too
difficult<00:01:28.229> deadlines<00:01:28.890> were<00:01:29.039> quite<00:01:29.190> hard<00:01:29.429> but

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
difficult deadlines were quite hard but

00:01:29.670 --> 00:02:04.300 
difficult deadlines were quite hard but
it<00:01:30.570> kept<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.929> off<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> kept<00:01:31.560> his<00:01:31.710> focus<00:01:31.890> and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.059 

well<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.610> started<00:02:06.060> back<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.299> September<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.320> by

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
well we started back in September and by

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.219 
well we started back in September and by
the<00:02:08.160> way<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> team<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:09.539> broke<00:02:10.050> up

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the way as a team and we all broke up

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.630 
the way as a team and we all broke up
into<00:02:10.500> subsections<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.580> designs<00:02:12.360> our<00:02:13.170> buggy

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
into subsections and designs our buggy

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.670 
into subsections and designs our buggy
so<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:14.970> good<00:02:15.120> today<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.319> test

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so it's really good today to get to test

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.460 
so it's really good today to get to test
it<00:02:16.920> finally<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.640> them<00:02:17.930> yeah<00:02:18.959> I've<00:02:19.200> learned

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
it finally in them yeah I've learned

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680 
it finally in them yeah I've learned
that<00:02:19.620> working<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> team<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:21.150> very<00:02:21.450> easy

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
that working as a team is not very easy

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.090 
that working as a team is not very easy
not<00:02:22.290> easy<00:02:23.600> it's<00:02:24.600> been<00:02:24.780> good<00:02:24.989> though<00:02:25.140> it's

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
not easy it's been good though it's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.020 
not easy it's been good though it's
actually<00:02:26.520> doing<00:02:27.000> real<00:02:27.209> engineering<00:02:28.760> all<00:02:29.760> our

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
actually doing real engineering all our

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.290 
actually doing real engineering all our
other<00:02:30.209> modules<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:32.030> theoretical<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.180> is

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
other modules are theoretical this is

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.050 
other modules are theoretical this is
actually<00:02:33.660> using<00:02:33.930> all<00:02:34.019> those<00:02:34.200> modules<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
actually using all those modules and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.699 
actually using all those modules and
completing<00:02:36.060> an<00:02:36.209> engineering<00:02:36.900> task<00:02:37.200> which<00:02:37.470> is

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
completing an engineering task which is

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.830 
completing an engineering task which is
much<00:02:38.220> more<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.790> real<00:02:38.970> world<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.600> it's

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
much more like the real world so it's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240 
much more like the real world so it's
sort<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.050> preparing<00:02:40.560> us<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.709> industry<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
sort of preparing us for industry I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.729 
sort of preparing us for industry I
suppose<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.790> could<00:02:41.940> say<00:02:42.049> so<00:02:43.049> yeah<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:43.680> really

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
suppose you could say so yeah I'm really
