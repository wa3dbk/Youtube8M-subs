00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
are really pink I think that it would be

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.350 
are really pink I think that it would be
good<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.600> prototype<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:11.340> absolutely<00:03:12.209> have

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
good as a prototype to absolutely have

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.640 
good as a prototype to absolutely have
different<00:03:12.690> colors<00:03:12.959> because<00:03:13.200> then<00:03:13.410> they're<00:03:13.620> a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
different colors because then they're a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.710 
different colors because then they're a
little<00:03:13.829> more<00:03:13.920> detail<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.730> can<00:03:15.239> see<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
little more detail you can see the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.630 
little more detail you can see the
little<00:03:15.870> details<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.590> bit<00:03:16.829> better<00:03:17.070> so

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
little details a little bit better so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.289 
little details a little bit better so
this<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.450> okay<00:03:19.019> too<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.380> guess<00:03:20.120> also<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
this is I okay too I guess also the

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.560 
this is I okay too I guess also the
brush<00:03:21.660> was<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:22.560> more<00:03:22.680> aqua<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.910> think<00:03:24.480> we

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
brush was a little more aqua I think we

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.590 
brush was a little more aqua I think we
