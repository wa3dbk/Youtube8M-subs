00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
what but pretty much the group might be

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.190 
what but pretty much the group might be

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
splintering off because you know one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.910 
splintering off because you know one
dude<00:01:51.409> pull<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.950> herschel<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:53.500> he's<00:01:54.500> infected

going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.610> happen<00:02:30.640> in<00:02:31.000> episode<00:02:31.570> 2<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.760> what<00:02:33.760> do

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
going to happen in episode 2 and what do

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.600 
going to happen in episode 2 and what do
you<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:34.210> about<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.690> soda<00:02:35.560> 1<00:02:35.770> how<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.010> turned

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
you think about a soda 1 how that turned

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.940 
you think about a soda 1 how that turned
out<00:02:36.990> did<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.080> know<00:02:38.200> there's<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:38.800> lot<00:02:38.830> of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
out did you know there's a lot of

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.650 
out did you know there's a lot of
bandits<00:02:39.490> everywhere<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:42.480> think<00:02:43.480> that's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
bandits everywhere and I think that's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.090 
bandits everywhere and I think that's
more<00:02:43.870> dangerous<00:02:44.050> than<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.500> walkers<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.010> be

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
more dangerous than the walkers to be

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.470 
more dangerous than the walkers to be
honest<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:51.280> probably<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.730> met<00:02:51.970> matter<00:02:52.330> of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
honest it's probably one I met matter of

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.210 
honest it's probably one I met matter of
time<00:02:52.720> before<00:02:53.260> people<00:02:53.680> moved<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> new

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
time before people moved to a new

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.060 
time before people moved to a new
location<00:02:55.170> because<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.380> always<00:02:56.530> happens<00:02:57.010> like

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070
