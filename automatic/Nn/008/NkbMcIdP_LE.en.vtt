00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.979 

I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.730> pretty<00:00:44.940> damn<00:00:45.059> clean<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I think it's pretty damn clean the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.169 
I think it's pretty damn clean the
condition<00:00:46.969> well<00:00:47.969> he<00:00:48.210> looks<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> Mack

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
condition well he looks like a Mack

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:58.160 
condition well he looks like a Mack
looks<00:00:51.179> like<00:00:51.479> the<00:00:51.719> VAIO<00:00:56.839> this<00:00:57.839> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.049> only

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
looks like the VAIO this is the only

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.660 
looks like the VAIO this is the only
side<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.739> any<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.609> intake<00:01:00.799> holes<00:01:04.489> but<00:01:05.489> if

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
side with any like intake holes but if

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.529 
side with any like intake holes but if
you<00:01:05.759> notice<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.740> mainly<00:01:08.039> the<00:01:08.159> battery<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
you notice it's mainly the battery that

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.010 
you notice it's mainly the battery that
lays<00:01:10.110> along<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:12.000> hard<00:01:12.179> the<00:01:12.780> hard

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
lays along there and the hard the hard

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560 
lays along there and the hard the hard
drives<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> top<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.179> cooling

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
drives at the top or the for the cooling

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
drives at the top or the for the cooling
holes<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:16.460> inside<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> bottom<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.090> adjust

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
holes are inside the bottom to adjust

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.649 
holes are inside the bottom to adjust
the<00:01:18.420> optical<00:01:18.810> drive<00:01:18.929> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> batteries<00:01:19.710> so

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
the optical drive in the batteries so

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
the optical drive in the batteries so
that's<00:01:21.659> why<00:01:21.840> there's<00:01:22.049> no<00:01:22.200> vents<00:01:22.590> along<00:01:22.890> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that's why there's no vents along that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.330 
that's why there's no vents along that
side<00:01:25.220> there's<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.429> exhaust<00:01:26.819> port<00:01:28.159> looks<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
side there's the exhaust port looks to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.480 
side there's the exhaust port looks to
be<00:01:29.490> removable<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> could<00:01:32.130> clean<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
be removable so you could clean the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.660 
be removable so you could clean the
eight<00:01:32.610> sink<00:01:38.270> yeah<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> magic<00:01:41.220> gate

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
eight sink yeah you got a magic gate

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.559 
eight sink yeah you got a magic gate

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
fun but that was all wrinkly like that

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.300 
fun but that was all wrinkly like that
one<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> two<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.860> battery<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
one of the two is for the battery and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.990 
one of the two is for the battery and
another<00:02:35.640> one's<00:02:35.819> for<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.120> doc<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:38.000> sheet

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
another one's for the doc the sheet

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.750 
another one's for the doc the sheet
battery<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.420> removable<00:02:43.580> just<00:02:44.580> four

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
battery this is removable just four

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.930 
battery this is removable just four
screws<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:46.700> think<00:02:47.700> these<00:02:47.850> are<00:02:48.060> little<00:02:49.940> little

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
screws I think these are little little

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.490 
screws I think these are little little
places<00:02:51.209> for<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.570> sheet<00:02:51.870> battery<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.380> hook

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
places for that sheet battery to hook

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.140 
places for that sheet battery to hook
into<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.890> does<00:02:56.070> fit<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.430> Machine<00:02:56.850> pretty

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
into so it does fit the Machine pretty

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.729 
into so it does fit the Machine pretty
nice<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.660> be<00:02:57.810> sure<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:59.300> get<00:03:00.300> about<00:03:00.470> four<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
nice and be sure I get about four and a

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.250 
nice and be sure I get about four and a
half<00:03:02.180> hours<00:03:03.180> out<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.690> thing<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:06.390> one

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
half hours out of this thing on one

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.680 
half hours out of this thing on one
charge<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.680> you'll<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.510> hard<00:03:12.510> drive

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
charge and you'll see in the hard drive

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.380 
charge and you'll see in the hard drive
on<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.870> RAM<00:03:13.050> video<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.850> battery<00:03:15.209> isn't

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
on the RAM video that the battery isn't

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.479 
on the RAM video that the battery isn't
very<00:03:15.750> big<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.530> size<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> machine

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
very big for the size of the machine

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.210 
very big for the size of the machine
