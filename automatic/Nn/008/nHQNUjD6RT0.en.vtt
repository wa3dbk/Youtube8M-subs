00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.350
 I said I have to do a review to my

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.949
 its high-impact restoration and is 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.119
 made with eye oil all 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.439
 products that I will teach in this 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.480
 you can find them on the page 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.790
 web brazil beauty that the truth is that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.559
 they are professionals within the sector 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.269
 capillary is more I do not know if you remember 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.339
 when I had my website the 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.979
 mercadito de sba also sold 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.930
 hair products and I got them from 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.519
 this web page they were my 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.530
 suppliers so therefore it is a 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.210
 page on which I trust 100% and the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.710
 products are wonderful as you 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.379
 I was commenting this treatment is done to 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.500
 eye oil base I pronounced it 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.780
 eye because it has no accent in the last 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.460
 or if it would not be an eye but well I would 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.460
 pronounced with hope it's like that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.750
 this oil with this name so 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.670
 super is more moisturizing even the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.560
 argan oil or macadamia oil and 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.630
 gets from a chestnut that grows in a 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.830
 typical palm tree from central america on 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.600
 everything is very effective against 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.580
 curling so it's ideal for 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.350
 hot and humid climates so like 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.820
 has been here in Alicante that in 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.740
 How much do you do something in your hair? 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.240
 Snoop as you neglect give a like to 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.189
 this video if you also get the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 iwo hair first thing you have to 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.360
 to do is to wash your hair with a shampoo 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.830
 without salt in this case I used this 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.020
 also from brazil and beauty that in 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.990
 concrete is from the oil line of 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.819
 eyes so I do not know I thought that way 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.380
 everything more effect but let's go you can 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.509
 use any other unsalted shampoo 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.369
 to make sure that your shampoo 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.200
 house for example you do not have to 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.880
 search the list of ingredients 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.380
 next word the component that I'm going 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.090
 to put here because it costs me a little 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.950
 pronounce it so what we would have 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.409
 what to do is use the unsalted shampoo 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.939
 let it act for two minutes and 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.679
 then clarify in this way then the 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.360
 hair is going to be free of waste and 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.159
 say they are using this shampoo 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.530
 the eye oil line is a 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.260
 wonder stays super smooth and makes 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.030
 foam as well as leafy the hair is 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.590
 swells and hey when you get it clear I do not know 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.030
 it is a pleasure the next step that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.730
 we would have to do to continue with 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.760
 the treatment would be to mix a portion 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.430
 of pure eye oil that has above 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.410
 sunscreen with nobex mask 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.870
 also of eye oil what I have done 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.850
 has been catching an abundant amount of 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.310
 the mask and then I took the 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.190
 oil and I have thus given the dispenser 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.350
 between 25 and 30 times and then I have 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.870
 mixed in my hand and I applied it 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.519
 all over the hair avoiding the root 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.680
 but yes, I 've uploaded it a lot or 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.180
 all the hair has been impregnated 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.800
 proportions are depending on your 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.290
 hair type obviously if you have it more 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.360
 finite use less amount of both 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.100
 mask as oil and the same 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.410
 way if you have very thick hair or 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.330
 very long then you will have to use more 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.650
 quantity of the two products once 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.970
 applied the product what we have to 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.250
 to do is roll up our hair in 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 Albal paper or in a thermal cap in 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.519
 its defect you can also 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.440
 find on the web and it's a lot more 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.540
 comfortable because it comes with elastic 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.910
 fits perfectly and hears the truth is 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.440
 that stays there all overheated and 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.330
 acting and the truth 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.440
 and once 10 minutes have elapsed , 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.630
 what we would have to do is take away 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.450
 something rite and we will finish the hair when 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.330
 come to that step and you're going to 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.040
 noticing you are going to flip is girls are you going to 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.930
 I really had to rinse myself 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.030
 hair like several times because I say 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.310
 it's softness is not normal there should be 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.780
 product I still do not know I did not understand 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.300
 but I found myself rinsed me 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.940
 and it's not that I was incredibly 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.560
 ultra smooth and last step would already be 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.990
 apply to be a thermal protector and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.790
 shielding of the brand you do not see all of the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.370
 same line and this is a treatment that 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.020
 applies from means to ends and is left 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.480
 It is not rinsed so it will protect us 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.980
 heat hair seals the cuticles and 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.570
 replenish the essential lipids of 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.310
 hair to bring shine and 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.900
 hydration so let's say this is 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.790
 the finished product you put on a 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.170
 small amount of what is distributed throughout 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.250
 the hair and then what do you do that 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.250
 poster or with dryer 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.480
 in my case and the 1st test - axis with 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.400
 dryer and the next day is when I 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.200
 pass the iron is worth doing the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.690
 two steps but I wanted to see exactly 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.280
 how her hair was left just by doing it 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.660
 with a hairdryer and then with a good iron 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.580
 Well, when I take it with a dryer 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.740
 I actually do it like that without giving myself 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.690
 a lot of form just what I want is 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.370
 that the hair stops being wet, stop 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.200
 to be wet I do not really care 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.700
 too much that I stay like this no no 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.290
 but I was very surprised at how it 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.420
 I got my hair has nothing to do with 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.860
 when you use a normal shampoo on 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.980
 all you notice is an extra brightness not 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.410
 I noticed my hair as extra clean no 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.570
 I knew tell you from the root to the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.600
 tips all the hair has a shine 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.880
 different it looks like I eat healthier and 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.740
 then separate zero frizz none of 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.560
 worried nor weird hairs out there 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.150
 nothing all this without ironing they see it and 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.390
 another thing I notice is that the hair had 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.150
 much more weight as more body and that 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.950
 it was really loose I do not know is it is 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.290
 rare to get your hair to stay 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.030
 with that movement when only you 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.610
 dry in the air with dryer 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.650
 usually 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.479
 and that effect you have when you already 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.129
 you pass the iron or when you spend in 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.990
 dryers and with desire later to the day 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.810
 next is when I pass the iron and 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.389
 give me a few drops of pure oil 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.340
 to give a little star shine 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.979
 well as to finish the whole 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.710
 treatment is all perfect with 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.900
 all the little hairs in their place nothing of 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.400
 curling like hairdressing or so 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.289
 same so above all I recommend you 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.270
 this treatment to people who 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.669
 you have very dry hair or those that 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.090
 dryer iron abuses to which 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.800
 Have your hair dyed with wicks or if 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.169
 not for people who want to give 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.360
 a shot of deep hydration in 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.669
 some time of the year as it can be 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.439
 to prepare yourself before summer or to 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.729
 after summer you know it's good 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.729
 pamper your hair from time to time 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.919
 the same salt-free shampoo that you have 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.630
 used or any other that you have and 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.790
 then what you can do is alternate the 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.430
 mask that you have used for the 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.960
 treatment together with a conditioner 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.669
 the conditioner that we do not have the 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.350
 same eye oil line for it 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.120
 I say to you and that lasts the longer 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.620
 better and the serum can also be used 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.990
 inside the maintenance treatment 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.389
 because it contains keratin and it is also 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.250
 thermal protector if right now you are 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.620
 they control it is revived in you want to have the 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.910

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.040
