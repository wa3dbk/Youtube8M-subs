bunch because you don't want to just

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.909 
bunch because you don't want to just
waterlog<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:27.079> whole<00:03:27.319> balloon<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.560> I've<00:03:30.680> got

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
waterlog the whole balloon and I've got

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.020

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
little bit of that there as well so

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.140 
little bit of that there as well so
since<00:03:37.099> we're<00:03:37.340> making<00:03:37.609> like<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> little

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
since we're making like a little

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.110 
since we're making like a little
reduction<00:03:39.079> sauce<00:03:39.819> throughout<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.970> cooking

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
reduction sauce throughout the cooking

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.640 
reduction sauce throughout the cooking
process<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:44.019> that's<00:03:45.019> everything<00:03:45.319> that's

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
process so that's everything that's

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.170 
process so that's everything that's
going<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:45.889> go<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.040> here<00:03:46.220> now<00:03:46.760> at<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.060> point

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
going to go in here now at this point

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.270 
going to go in here now at this point
you<00:03:47.510> can<00:03:47.750> add<00:03:47.900> vegetables<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.620> I've<00:03:48.919> got<00:03:49.099> some

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
you can add vegetables and I've got some

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.909 
you can add vegetables and I've got some
asparagus<00:03:50.169> and<00:03:51.169> we<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.410> actually<00:03:51.709> put<00:03:51.889> a

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
asparagus and we can actually put a

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.339 
asparagus and we can actually put a
couple<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.340> these<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.489> here<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.200> what's<00:03:54.200> going

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
couple of these in here and what's going

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.110 
couple of these in here and what's going
to<00:03:54.410> happen<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.010> vegetables<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.849> fish

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
to happen is the vegetables and the fish

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.509 
to happen is the vegetables and the fish
will<00:03:56.359> all<00:03:56.450> be<00:03:56.599> steamed<00:03:56.930> together<00:03:57.519> so

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
will all be steamed together so

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.890 
will all be steamed together so
essentially<00:03:58.970> you've<00:03:59.090> got<00:03:59.239> a<00:03:59.269> complete<00:03:59.690> meal

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
essentially you've got a complete meal

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.869 
essentially you've got a complete meal
by<00:04:00.109> the<00:04:00.169> time<00:04:00.410> all<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.889> done<00:04:01.069> so<00:04:01.579> this<00:04:01.730> is

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
by the time all this is done so this is

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.300
