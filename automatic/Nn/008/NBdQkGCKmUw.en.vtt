 said measure has been taken 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.539
 says this dependence on the government 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:36.649
 since, as is public knowledge, some copper leaders 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:41.409
 breaking the labor legislation agreed to a national paralysis of 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.009
 activities and then failed

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.789
 politics 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:58.209
 whose set 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.360
 created the feeling of an artificial riding climate 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.409
 and from public decency 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.440
 all of it 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.340
 with the purpose of collaborating 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.979
 with the aforementioned integration 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.629
 they shape this radio station 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.090
 in charge of incidents of violence 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.669
 by all known and that led to the unfortunate results 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.239
 that the government deplores 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.200
 the authority and breach of a constitutional duty 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.009
 in order to prevent the repetition of these acts 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.110
 therefore working accordingly adif and aena 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.029

 for violation of the state security law 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.330
 thus 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.699
 the government of the general although they think that ugarte 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.590
 justify the measure 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.220
 to restrict and suspend 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.169
