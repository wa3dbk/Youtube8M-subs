00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 in many science fiction film religion 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 or scary stories is about that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.040
 eternal life and immortality though 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.809
 is something like that possible today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 it will be with the help of medicine every case 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.389
 be possible or is it all 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.590
 complete bullshit 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.210
 in this video we show you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.670
 examples from nature the the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.670
 immortality come horribly close 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.570
 company for example this creature can 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.640
 you just cut in the middle 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.949
 without killing her and the best part about it 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.510
 both ends live further cuts one 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 a flatworm in the middle 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.530
 So you get two new sheet companies 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 but that works without you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.160
 she cuts through some kinds of parts 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.090
 that is, voluntarily 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.190
 procreate 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 that means every worm lives in the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.360
 next 24 man it is so 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.980
 hard to say how old a platform 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 really is because he is after each division 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
 the platform is lives of 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 He does not kill anyone, he lives forever 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 other amazing animals are the ones 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.489
 freshwater polyp the name becomes you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.710
 probably do not say much but the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.960
 small animals look and belong like this 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.760
 so to the stem of the cnidarians jellyfish 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.890
 and that's how these freshwater polyps look like 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 possess the ability damaged 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 replace cells with brand new ones 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
 For that you use a stem cell 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.530
 basically the basic building block for each 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.299
 other body cell you can do such a 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.759
 divide stem cell namely and each 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.409
 develop other needed cell from it 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.060
 With this technique you can as 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.250
 even the world's only animals 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.080
 completely set nerve cells first 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.150
 Within five days one can 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.079
 freshwater polyps practically all of its 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.210
 renew cells 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.130
 always show them with fresh cells 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.189
 the freshwater polyps are not biological 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.329
 aging and are therefore in the reason 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.820
 immortal have these little animals 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.680
 but even more so if we eg one 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.780
 freshwater polyp little piece 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.670
 you can cut two scenarios 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.439
 either the individual will expire 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.630
 Pieces find together again and that 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.250
 freshwater polyp it all over again or it 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.890
 grow out of the pieces new 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.110
 freshwater polyps out what the earth is 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.549
 that's hunger for sick animals too 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.920
 show no signs of 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.810
 old age and do not stop 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.740
 but they grow with time 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.360
 slower and slower 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.190
 in theory, homer might 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.039
 live eternally through the whole fishing 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.079
 but that is practically impossible 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.599
 the record for probably the oldest homer 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.489
 It is around 140 years old 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.680
 This was a new kilo 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.900
 heavy hammer called george the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.730
 heaviest ever caught roma even grew 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.739
 over 20 kilos 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.599
 exact information about his age is available 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.340
 but unfortunately not the oldest living one 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.530
 animal is currently a sponge in the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.680
 Southern Ocean there has the good piece 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.939
 for about 10,000 years and will 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.470
 probably there for a while 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.810
 stay after years of research 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.459
 Researchers have no growth 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.409
 or determine oxygen consumption 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.359
 can and which is slowly growing and ever 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.730
 less oxygen you consume the more 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.470
 you live longer if no outer 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.120
 Influences and damage a sponge 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.159
 he will probably still some 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.569
 stay there for a thousand years 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.280
 that it is already as good as immortal 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.379
 at the front we saw that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.030
 some freshwater polyps on the box 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.489
 but they are not the only ones 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.310
 almost immortal cnidarians the 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.169
 touri tops is also ricola 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.590
 Cats dominate the art 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:12.139
 the relation of reunification 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.120
 She can complete each of her cell 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.459
 For example , it could be converted from one 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.260
 muscle cell a nerve or egg cell 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.209
 make the rejuvenation of the thurid again 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.099
 if it works normally 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.650
 jellyfish develop from one 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.049
 fertilized egg at a location and 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.609
 She sings on the sea floor there 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.739
 she develops further to one 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.690
 polyp and the reiff then over time 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.750
 a full- blown jellyfish to the touri 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.829
 tops can be up though if needed 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.629
 to reconvert an earlier stadium 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.729
 as well as at benjamin button 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.620
 They first return to the stage of the coast 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.340
 back and then becomes a polyp 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.870
 colony 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.180
 these polyps then develop 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.579
 continue to new adult qualms 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.069
 through this increase asexually 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.780
 there are hundreds of almost exact copies of 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.699
 a single source 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.139
 because the touri taxis that so often 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.310
 can repeat how she boggles and 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.109
 so again in an earlier 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.750
 She can return to the stadium, so to speak 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.639
 immortal but probably the hottest 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.069
 Animals are these little mates here 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.409
 the tardigrades are about a millimeter 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.750
 tall and have eight-piece feet 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:14.900
 they are as good as indestructible 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.150
 They survive temperatures of minus 270 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.639
 up to plus 150 degrees celsius and also 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.840
 perverted strong uv or x-rays 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.240
 Newton The Beasts Do not Hold Them 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.530
 the vacuum in the universe for which reason some 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.630
 Researchers believe that they too 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.340
 originally come from there to that 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.900
 they have a few things to endure 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.210
 tricks in stock for example the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.699
 Tongue education during this stadium 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.889
 the tardigrades are as good as dead 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.240
 They feed their feet and want to 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.370
 to a ball together that me 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.380
 then like a ton hence the name 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.600
 They drive every activity in the body 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.010
 then it will not find any metabolism 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.260
 no growth and none 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.330
 Reproduction of the city of Munich state 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.639
 age the mountain church and can not 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.110
 thus come over 100 years old come 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.850
 the animals then in contact again with 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.400
 Water will be up in minutes 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.350
 days again the normal active state 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.550
 taken and it goes on as if 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.160
 nothing would have been 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.840
 through this constant education and education 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.570
 resurrection can be done by aquarium 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.250
 the most abundant circumstances survive 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.540
 easily reach the age of one 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.880
 people or even the one 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.889
 turtle our mountain churches are so 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.630
 true survivors but from 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.410
 unfortunately they are still immortal 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.120
 a bit away 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.010
 So we saw some now 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.530
 animals dominate pretty horny tricks 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.479
 and almost to immortality 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.039
 what do you think it would be good if 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.900
 that man could live indefinitely 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.180
 and why just about all of them live 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.530
 animals from this video in the water has that 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.870
 what to do with immortality 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.070
 write your opinion in the comments 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.599
 if there are other interesting ones 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.039
 natural phenomena want to see then clicks 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.780
 on this video here 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.370
 there we show you why water runners 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.780
 So do not go down three people 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.780
 until the next video and ciao
