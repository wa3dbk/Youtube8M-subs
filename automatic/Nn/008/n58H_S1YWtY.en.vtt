00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.010 
think I'll take some more computer
programming<00:02:17.640> classes<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.180> high<00:02:18.210> school<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
programming classes in high school but I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.960 
programming classes in high school but I
actually<00:02:19.110> find<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.710> really<00:02:20.280> interesting<00:02:20.370> now

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
actually find it really interesting now

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.690 
actually find it really interesting now
that<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.210> tried<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.600> when<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.170> work<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.280> study

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
that I tried it when you work and study

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.850 
that I tried it when you work and study
and<00:02:23.970> excel<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.720> what<00:02:24.960> you're<00:02:25.110> doing<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.620> math

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
and excel at what you're doing in math

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.590 
and excel at what you're doing in math
and<00:02:26.160> science<00:02:26.280> for<00:02:26.790> making<00:02:27.030> sure<00:02:27.210> we<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.450> the
