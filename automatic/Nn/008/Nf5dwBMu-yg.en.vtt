00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
clean it up anything that was really

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.340 
clean it up anything that was really
rusted<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.890> tried<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> repair<00:01:13.369> but<00:01:14.369> overall

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350

here

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.330 

inside<00:01:31.780> there<00:01:32.050> it's<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.650> only<00:01:32.680> being<00:01:33.160> that

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
inside there it's the only being that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.990 
inside there it's the only being that
will<00:01:33.520> work<00:01:33.670> with<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.030> machine<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:36.070> it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
will work with this machine and it's

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.490 
will work with this machine and it's
basically<00:01:37.240> because<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.050> weight<00:01:38.290> that

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
basically because of the weight that

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.110 
basically because of the weight that
this<00:01:38.710> actually<00:01:38.950> this<00:01:39.310> crane<00:01:39.610> can<00:01:39.820> actually

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
pick up and the magnet that allows this

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.960 
pick up and the magnet that allows this
whole<00:01:43.510> mechanism<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.470> work<00:01:44.770> right<00:01:45.610> now<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.760> got

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
whole mechanism to work right now I got

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.090 
whole mechanism to work right now I got
30<00:01:46.240> pounds<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.780> lentil<00:01:47.200> beans<00:01:47.410> inside<00:01:47.800> there

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.510 
to try to play a couple games in here
and<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:28.120> does<00:02:28.270> work<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.600> quarters<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.520> think

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
and it does work on quarters I think

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.480 
and it does work on quarters I think
originally<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.970> was<00:02:31.030> ten<00:02:31.300> cents<00:02:31.600> but<00:02:32.490> sorta

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
originally it was ten cents but sorta

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.900 
originally it was ten cents but sorta
donnelly<00:02:33.760> changed<00:02:34.150> it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:03:01.920 

ok

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.559 

obviously<00:03:02.829> she's<00:03:03.069> not<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.400> bury<00:03:03.609> her<00:03:04.150> good<00:03:04.420> at

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
obviously she's not to bury her good at

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.830 
obviously she's not to bury her good at
it<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.680> either<00:03:05.769> drop<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.280> crane<00:03:06.840> and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
it but you either drop the crane and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.599 
it but you either drop the crane and
with<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.379> buttons<00:03:08.709> she's<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.189> control

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
with the buttons she's going to control

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.020

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
50 tons of lentil beans here so it's

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.099 
50 tons of lentil beans here so it's
still<00:04:02.439> a<00:04:02.469> task<00:04:02.799> for<00:04:03.099> us<00:04:03.159> to<00:04:03.340> reach<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.730> point

not<00:04:39.849> in<00:04:39.970> bad<00:04:40.150> shape<00:04:40.180> but<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.599> light<00:04:40.870> behind<00:04:41.110> it

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
not in bad shape but the light behind it

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.850 
not in bad shape but the light behind it
kind<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.030> makes<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.449> look<00:04:44.020> like<00:04:44.050> it's<00:04:44.199> so

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
kind of makes it look like it's so

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.749 
kind of makes it look like it's so
transparent<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:46.270> machine<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:47.340> quite<00:04:48.340> old<00:04:48.370> and

transparent the machine is quite old and
then<00:04:49.740> for<00:04:50.740> its<00:04:50.919> age<00:04:51.099> it's<00:04:51.130> in<00:04:51.580> great<00:04:51.759> condition

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880
