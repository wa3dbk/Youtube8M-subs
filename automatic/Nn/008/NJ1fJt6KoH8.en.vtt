going<00:00:24.339> to<00:00:24.429> deal<00:00:24.609> with<00:00:24.789> part<00:00:25.300> one<00:00:25.509> of<00:00:25.539> this

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
going to deal with part one of this

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.179 
going to deal with part one of this
issue<00:00:26.019> because<00:00:26.320> this<00:00:26.769> is<00:00:26.859> actually<00:00:27.130> a

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
issue because this is actually a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.700 
issue because this is actually a
two-part<00:00:27.429> series<00:00:27.909> and<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:28.900> second<00:00:29.380> part<00:00:29.499> with

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
two-part series and the second part with

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.300 
two-part series and the second part with
a<00:00:29.800> look<00:00:29.919> at<00:00:30.039> some<00:00:30.279> specific<00:00:30.689> hormonal<00:00:31.689> issues

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
a look at some specific hormonal issues

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.490 
a look at some specific hormonal issues
specifically<00:00:33.310> related<00:00:33.700> to<00:00:33.730> estrogen<00:00:34.420> that<00:00:35.230> we

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
specifically related to estrogen that we

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.310 
specifically related to estrogen that we
are<00:00:35.560> going<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.860> attend<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.520> and<00:00:37.360> in<00:00:37.600> this<00:00:38.110> video

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
are going to attend to and in this video

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.830 
are going to attend to and in this video
I'm<00:00:38.590> going<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.400> basically<00:00:39.640> speak<00:00:39.910> about<00:00:40.120> one

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
I'm going to basically speak about one

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.140 
I'm going to basically speak about one
concept<00:00:41.320> it's<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.560> very<00:00:41.770> simple<00:00:42.370> concept<00:00:42.550> and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
concept it's a very simple concept and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.660 
concept it's a very simple concept and
it's<00:00:43.870> basically<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.410> fact<00:00:44.740> that<00:00:44.800> as<00:00:45.040> you<00:00:45.310> age

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
it's basically the fact that as you age

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's basically the fact that as you age
you<00:00:46.600> lose<00:00:46.870> muscle<00:00:47.230> mass<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.860> therefore<00:00:48.730> your

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
you lose muscle mass and therefore your

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.290 
you lose muscle mass and therefore your
metabolism<00:00:49.870> slows<00:00:50.140> down<00:00:50.580> so<00:00:51.580> as<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:51.970> result

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
metabolism slows down so as a result

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.230 
metabolism slows down so as a result
it's<00:00:52.870> more<00:00:53.620> difficult<00:00:53.920> for<00:00:54.370> your<00:00:54.610> body<00:00:54.820> to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
it's more difficult for your body to

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.510 
it's more difficult for your body to
expend<00:00:55.750> calories<00:00:56.410> or<00:00:56.530> burn<00:00:56.770> calories<00:00:57.070> and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
expend calories or burn calories and

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.110 
expend calories or burn calories and
therefore<00:00:57.940> it's<00:00:58.420> easier<00:00:58.870> for<00:00:59.170> you<00:00:59.560> to<00:00:59.820> hold<00:01:00.820> on

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
therefore it's easier for you to hold on

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.660 
therefore it's easier for you to hold on
to<00:01:01.360> calories<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:01.960> gain<00:01:02.110> weight<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.430> very

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
to calories and gain weight it's a very

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.599 
to calories and gain weight it's a very
simple<00:01:04.150> formula<00:01:04.740> after<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.859> age<00:01:05.950> 10<00:01:06.189> 30

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
simple formula after the age 10 30

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.730 
simple formula after the age 10 30
pretty<00:01:07.509> much<00:01:07.659> everything<00:01:07.929> kind<00:01:08.289> of<00:01:08.320> goes<00:01:08.380> down

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
pretty much everything kind of goes down

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.219 
pretty much everything kind of goes down
the<00:01:08.950> drain<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.850> mean<00:01:10.659> I<00:01:10.719> don't<00:01:10.749> want<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.079> sound

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
the drain I mean I don't want to sound

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.609 
the drain I mean I don't want to sound
pessimistic<00:01:11.530> anything<00:01:12.280> but<00:01:12.399> its<00:01:13.060> physiology

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
pessimistic anything but its physiology

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.099 
pessimistic anything but its physiology
after<00:01:14.619> 30<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:16.030> maximum<00:01:16.630> aerobic<00:01:16.990> capacity

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
after 30 your maximum aerobic capacity

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.200 
after 30 your maximum aerobic capacity
starts<00:01:17.829> to<00:01:17.920> decrease<00:01:18.219> by<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.549> one<00:01:18.850> percent

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
starts to decrease by the one percent

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.969 
starts to decrease by the one percent
per<00:01:19.359> year<00:01:19.569> the<00:01:19.990> same<00:01:20.289> thing<00:01:20.530> happens<00:01:20.920> with

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
per year the same thing happens with

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.529 
per year the same thing happens with
your<00:01:21.189> muscle<00:01:21.490> mass<00:01:21.579> although<00:01:21.939> one<00:01:22.179> percent

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
your muscle mass although one percent

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.260 
your muscle mass although one percent
per<00:01:22.689> year<00:01:22.929> you<00:01:23.590> lose<00:01:23.859> that<00:01:24.149> you<00:01:25.149> know

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
per year you lose that you know

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.690 
per year you lose that you know
throughout<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.960> rest<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.229> your<00:01:26.350> life<00:01:26.499> now<00:01:27.130> the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
throughout the rest of your life now the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.249 
throughout the rest of your life now the
good<00:01:27.819> thing<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.119> that<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.810> build<00:01:29.049> you

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
good thing is that you can build you

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.809 
good thing is that you can build you
can't<00:01:29.499> really<00:01:29.679> prevent<00:01:30.069> it<00:01:30.399> but<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.609> can

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
can't really prevent it but you can

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.660 
can't really prevent it but you can
delay<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.689> decline<00:01:32.619> in<00:01:32.920> your<00:01:33.249> muscle<00:01:33.549> mass

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
delay the decline in your muscle mass

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.429 
delay the decline in your muscle mass
and<00:01:33.939> basically<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.389> way<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.569> do<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.020> by

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
and basically the way to do that is by

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.179 
and basically the way to do that is by
doing<00:01:36.630> strength<00:01:37.630> training<00:01:37.719> that's<00:01:38.259> right<00:01:38.530> so

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
doing strength training that's right so

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.739 
doing strength training that's right so
the<00:01:39.399> earlier<00:01:39.759> you<00:01:39.880> start<00:01:39.999> strength<00:01:40.479> training

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
the earlier you start strength training

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:42.239 
the earlier you start strength training
the<00:01:40.899> bed<00:01:41.079> I<00:01:41.289> mean<00:01:41.439> I<00:01:41.679> mean<00:01:41.799> obviously<00:01:41.950> if

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
the bed I mean I mean obviously if

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:43.559 
the bed I mean I mean obviously if
you're<00:01:42.399> five<00:01:42.639> years<00:01:42.670> old<00:01:42.999> you<00:01:43.090> are<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.420> don't

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
you're five years old you are you don't

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.300 
you're five years old you are you don't
be<00:01:43.689> doing<00:01:43.899> it<00:01:43.990> but<00:01:44.020> as<00:01:44.499> soon<00:01:44.679> as<00:01:44.740> your<00:01:44.979> kind<00:01:45.249> of

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
be doing it but as soon as your kind of

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.309 
be doing it but as soon as your kind of
you<00:01:45.880> know<00:01:45.909> mid<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.389> late<00:01:46.509> puberty<00:01:46.719> that's<00:01:47.170> what

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
you know mid to late puberty that's what

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.480 
you know mid to late puberty that's what
you<00:01:47.409> want<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.649> start<00:01:47.770> incorporating<00:01:48.069> some

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
you want to start incorporating some

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.699 
you want to start incorporating some
weight<00:01:48.670> especially<00:01:48.939> for<00:01:49.509> women<00:01:49.709> because

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
weight especially for women because

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.969 
weight especially for women because
women<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.609> fear<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.299> mean<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.409> Maya<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.889> my

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
women have a fear I mean in Maya and my

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.709 
women have a fear I mean in Maya and my
experience<00:01:54.429> of<00:01:54.520> lifting<00:01:55.270> weights<00:01:55.479> because

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
experience of lifting weights because

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.169 
experience of lifting weights because
they<00:01:56.020> figure<00:01:56.259> 8<00:01:56.530> balti<00:01:56.889> well<00:01:57.819> it's<00:01:57.939> really

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
they figure 8 balti well it's really

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.250 
they figure 8 balti well it's really
important<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:58.630> women<00:01:58.869> do<00:01:59.350> lift<00:02:00.130> weights<00:02:00.429> and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
important that women do lift weights and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.010 
important that women do lift weights and
challenge<00:02:01.680> their<00:02:01.830> muscles<00:02:02.190> because<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:03.020> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
challenge their muscles because a it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
challenge their muscles because a it
helps<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> pronounce<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> process<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
helps to pronounce to a process and the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.870 
helps to pronounce to a process and the
quit<00:02:05.910> the<00:02:06.060> sooner<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:07.350> start<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.950> engage<00:02:08.400> in

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
quit the sooner you start to engage in

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.820 
quit the sooner you start to engage in
some<00:02:09.240> type<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.479> resistance<00:02:10.080> training<00:02:10.410> women

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
some type of resistance training women

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.920 
some type of resistance training women
the<00:02:11.640> better<00:02:11.670> off<00:02:12.090> you're<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.600> from<00:02:12.840> a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the better off you're going to be from a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.420 
the better off you're going to be from a
building<00:02:13.140> health<00:02:13.410> perspective<00:02:13.980> later<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.310> in

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
building health perspective later on in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.520 
building health perspective later on in
life<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:15.300> second<00:02:15.690> component<00:02:15.840> obviously<00:02:16.440> is

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
life the second component obviously is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.980 
life the second component obviously is
your<00:02:16.710> ability<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.130> burn<00:02:17.280> fat<00:02:17.570> not<00:02:18.570> only<00:02:18.810> now

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
your ability to burn fat not only now

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.350 
your ability to burn fat not only now
but<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:19.650> four<00:02:19.920> years<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> road<00:02:20.460> so

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
but you know four years down the road so

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.170 
but you know four years down the road so
it's<00:02:21.750> important<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.760> strength<00:02:23.760> train<00:02:23.820> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it's important to strength train to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.580 
it's important to strength train to
build<00:02:24.390> your<00:02:24.570> muscles<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.410> can

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
build your muscles so that you can

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.400 
build your muscles so that you can
increase<00:02:26.070> your<00:02:26.430> metabolic<00:02:26.880> rate<00:02:27.360> yeah<00:02:27.600> you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
increase your metabolic rate yeah you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.160 
increase your metabolic rate yeah you
know<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.650> watch<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> other<00:02:29.130> video<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:30.170> we

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
know if you watch the other video on we

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.630 
know if you watch the other video on we
kind<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.470> looked<00:02:31.650> at<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.830> details<00:02:32.280> of

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
kind of looked at the details of

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.550 
kind of looked at the details of
calories<00:02:33.180> needed<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.750> calories<00:02:34.110> burned<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
calories needed and calories burned and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710 
calories needed and calories burned and
all<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.800> stuff<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.360> remember<00:02:36.360> when<00:02:36.510> we<00:02:36.600> knew

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
all that stuff you remember when we knew

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.030 
all that stuff you remember when we knew
we<00:02:36.810> did<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.990> calculation<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.680> basal

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
we did the calculation for basal

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.400 
we did the calculation for basal
metabolic<00:02:38.160> rate<00:02:38.610> your<00:02:38.790> BMR<00:02:39.210> that<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.110> heavily

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
metabolic rate your BMR that is heavily

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.830 
metabolic rate your BMR that is heavily
dependent<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:41.190> your<00:02:41.610> lean<00:02:41.910> muscle<00:02:41.940> mass<00:02:42.330> right

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
dependent on your lean muscle mass right

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.110 
dependent on your lean muscle mass right
so<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> more<00:02:43.680> lean<00:02:43.890> mass<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.580> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so the more lean mass you have the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.970 
so the more lean mass you have the
higher<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:45.750> resting<00:02:46.230> metabolic<00:02:46.260> rate<00:02:46.800> is

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
higher your resting metabolic rate is

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.440 
higher your resting metabolic rate is
going<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.220> be<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:47.820> means<00:02:48.090> they're<00:02:48.270> going<00:02:48.390> to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
going to be which means they're going to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.090 
going to be which means they're going to
burn<00:02:48.570> more<00:02:48.750> calories<00:02:49.050> throughout<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> day<00:02:49.710> at

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
burn more calories throughout the day at

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.980 
burn more calories throughout the day at
rest<00:02:50.670> while<00:02:51.000> you're<00:02:51.120> sleeping<00:02:51.600> during

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
rest while you're sleeping during

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.010 
rest while you're sleeping during
activity<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> whole<00:02:52.770> bit<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.870> absolutely<00:02:54.870> age

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
activity the whole bit so absolutely age

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.020 
activity the whole bit so absolutely age
of<00:02:55.140> 30<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.740> get<00:02:55.890> older<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.280> lean<00:02:56.610> muscle

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
of 30 as you get older that lean muscle

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.850 
of 30 as you get older that lean muscle
mass<00:02:57.060> starts<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.570> decline<00:02:57.870> naturally<00:02:58.620> and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
mass starts to decline naturally and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.680 
mass starts to decline naturally and
that's<00:02:59.190> why<00:02:59.370> your<00:02:59.520> metabolism<00:03:00.120> slows<00:03:00.420> down

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that's why your metabolism slows down

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.330 
that's why your metabolism slows down
now<00:03:01.320> here's<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.709> here's<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.920> difficult<00:03:02.310> thing

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
now here's that here's a difficult thing

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.370 
now here's that here's a difficult thing
it's<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.880> continuing<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.660> eat<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.050> same<00:03:04.230> way

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
it's your continuing to eat the same way

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.260 
it's your continuing to eat the same way
you<00:03:04.500> have<00:03:04.770> been<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.580> tendency<00:03:05.820> will<00:03:06.150> be<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
you have been the tendency will be to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.210 
you have been the tendency will be to
shift<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.750> scale<00:03:07.110> towards<00:03:07.590> more<00:03:07.800> calories

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
shift the scale towards more calories

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.520 
shift the scale towards more calories
coming<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.670> versus<00:03:09.090> being<00:03:09.300> expended<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.380> it's

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
coming in versus being expended so it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.140 
coming in versus being expended so it's
important<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.040> adjust<00:03:11.610> your<00:03:11.820> caloric

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
important that you adjust your caloric

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.810 
important that you adjust your caloric
consumption<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:13.560> either<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:14.130> know<00:03:14.190> maintain

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
consumption to either you know maintain

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.400 
consumption to either you know maintain
your<00:03:15.000> current<00:03:15.239> weight<00:03:15.420> or<00:03:15.630> lower<00:03:16.200> your

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
your current weight or lower your

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.920 
your current weight or lower your
caloric<00:03:16.709> consumption<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> lose<00:03:18.480> further

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
caloric consumption so you lose further

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.620 
caloric consumption so you lose further
weights<00:03:19.640> mask<00:03:20.640> where<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> lot<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.120> people<00:03:21.330> have

a tough time that's actually where a lot
of<00:03:23.310> athletes<00:03:23.670> go<00:03:23.880> go<00:03:24.330> wrong<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.769> they're

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
of athletes go go wrong is that they're

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.890 
of athletes go go wrong is that they're
just<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.070> training<00:03:26.310> very<00:03:26.550> very<00:03:26.790> heavily<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.360> a

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
just a training very very heavily and a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.210 
just a training very very heavily and a
lot<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.200> them<00:03:28.290> get<00:03:28.410> away<00:03:28.500> with<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.709> poor<00:03:29.010> diet

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
lot of them get away with a poor diet

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.580 
lot of them get away with a poor diet
and<00:03:29.610> totally<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.030> stop<00:03:30.269> playing<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.930> that's

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and totally a stop playing and that's

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.440 
and totally a stop playing and that's
when<00:03:31.860> they<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> tough<00:03:32.640> time<00:03:32.670> adjusting<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
when they have a tough time adjusting to

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.449 
when they have a tough time adjusting to
that<00:03:33.690> new<00:03:33.900> way<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.500> continued<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.130> eat<00:03:35.310> the

that new way and it continued to eat the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.640 
that new way and it continued to eat the
same<00:03:35.670> way<00:03:35.940> while<00:03:36.690> their<00:03:36.870> activity<00:03:37.260> level<00:03:37.530> has

basic gan Valley you know fifty to one
hundred<00:03:39.989> percent<00:03:40.200> that's<00:03:41.040> why<00:03:41.280> they<00:03:41.400> put<00:03:41.519> a

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
hundred percent that's why they put a

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.070 
hundred percent that's why they put a
lot<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.820> weight<00:03:42.000> for<00:03:42.030> easily<00:03:42.510> after<00:03:42.750> they're

lot of weight for easily after they're

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.920 
lot of weight for easily after they're
done<00:03:43.200> their<00:03:43.440> careers<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.970> we<00:03:45.570> need<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
done their careers so we need to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.509 
done their careers so we need to
resistant<00:03:46.350> strain<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.950> build<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> lean

muscle mass to keep it going for as long
as<00:03:49.140> possible<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.489> can<00:03:50.610> keep<00:03:50.880> from<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.120> tab

ilysm<00:03:51.660> up<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:52.140> also<00:03:52.290> want<00:03:52.410> reduce<00:03:52.890> your

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
ilysm up you also want reduce your

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.949 
ilysm up you also want reduce your
caloric<00:03:53.340> consumption<00:03:53.790> as<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.390> age<00:03:54.570> because

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
caloric consumption as you age because

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.470 
caloric consumption as you age because
the<00:03:55.080> less<00:03:55.230> muscle<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.910> less<00:03:57.120> indeed

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
the less muscle you have the less indeed

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.060 
the less muscle you have the less indeed
for<00:03:57.780> calories<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.380> energy<00:03:58.500> you're<00:03:58.860> going<00:03:59.010> to

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
for calories and energy you're going to

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.280 
for calories and energy you're going to
need<00:03:59.220> right<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.720> more<00:04:00.900> muscle<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.230> have

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
need right so the more muscle you have

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.140 
need right so the more muscle you have
the<00:04:01.650> more<00:04:01.800> calories<00:04:02.130> you<00:04:02.550> need<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.850> feel<00:04:03.000> those

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
the more calories you need to feel those

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.509 
the more calories you need to feel those
muscles<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.660> less<00:04:03.810> muscles<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.530> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
muscles the less muscles you have the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.800 
muscles the less muscles you have the
fewer<00:04:05.730> calories<00:04:06.000> you're<00:04:06.330> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.540> need<00:04:06.660> to

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
fewer calories you're going to need to

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.680 
fewer calories you're going to need to
fuel<00:04:06.959> them<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:07.830> it's<00:04:08.160> kind<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.489> two-sided<00:04:09.090> to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
fuel them so it's kind of a two-sided to

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.390 
fuel them so it's kind of a two-sided to
cited<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.350> know<00:04:10.470> coin<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:11.040> then<00:04:11.130> we<00:04:11.280> have<00:04:11.370> to

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
cited you know coin and then we have to

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.070 
cited you know coin and then we have to
look<00:04:11.550> at<00:04:11.670> both<00:04:11.790> sides<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.270> equation<00:04:12.330> so

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
look at both sides of the equation so

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.780 
look at both sides of the equation so
that's<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.350> main<00:04:13.650> reason<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:14.100> as<00:04:14.460> you<00:04:14.670> get

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
that's the main reason that as you get

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.120 
that's the main reason that as you get
older<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.210> tougher<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.630> lose<00:04:15.840> weight<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.350> so

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
older it's tougher to lose weight and so

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.009 
older it's tougher to lose weight and so
after<00:04:17.250> both<00:04:17.549> 30<00:04:17.880> has<00:04:18.209> things<00:04:18.600> start<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.870> become

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
after both 30 has things start to become

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.020 
after both 30 has things start to become
a<00:04:19.140> little<00:04:19.350> more<00:04:19.410> difficult<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.130> let's<00:04:20.940> not

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
a little more difficult but let's not

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.300 
a little more difficult but let's not
use<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.420> as<00:04:21.510> an<00:04:21.600> excuse<00:04:21.989> right<00:04:22.350> because<00:04:22.890> I

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
use that as an excuse right because I

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.830 
use that as an excuse right because I
know<00:04:23.370> plenty<00:04:23.730> of<00:04:23.940> people<00:04:24.270> are<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.390> their<00:04:24.510> 50s

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
know plenty of people are in their 50s

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.080 
know plenty of people are in their 50s
60s<00:04:25.020> 70s<00:04:25.260> we're<00:04:25.920> still<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.580> know<00:04:26.610> in<00:04:26.730> great

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
60s 70s we're still you know in great

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
it as well so let's not use excuses I

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.300 
it as well so let's not use excuses I
mean<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:34.020> physiologist<00:04:34.620> physiology<00:04:35.100> but<00:04:35.190> we

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
mean the physiologist physiology but we

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.430 
mean the physiologist physiology but we
can<00:04:35.460> work<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.330> know<00:04:36.450> we<00:04:36.570> can<00:04:36.690> work<00:04:36.900> above<00:04:37.260> and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
can work you know we can work above and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.140 
can work you know we can work above and
beyond<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.680> sometimes<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.550> that's<00:04:39.060> what

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
beyond that sometimes and that's what

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.970 
beyond that sometimes and that's what

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
is part 1 of why it's tougher to lose

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.330 
is part 1 of why it's tougher to lose
weight<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.200> belly<00:04:43.380> fat<00:04:43.470> as<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:43.950> older<00:04:44.160> in

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
weight of belly fat as you get older in

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.490 
weight of belly fat as you get older in
the<00:04:44.670> second<00:04:45.150> part<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.360> this<00:04:45.480> video<00:04:45.630> we're

the second part of this video we're

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.860 
the second part of this video we're
going<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> look<00:04:46.830> at<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:48.060> importance<00:04:48.660> rash

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
going to look at the importance rash

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.540 
going to look at the importance rash
could<00:04:49.080> be<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.350> real<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.680> phenomenon<00:04:50.370> of

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
could be the real the phenomenon of
