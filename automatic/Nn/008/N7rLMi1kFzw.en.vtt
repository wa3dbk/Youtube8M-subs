the kind of lines are the ones over
there<00:00:50.930> take<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.960> off<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:54.390> way<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
there take it off and the way this

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.569 
there take it off and the way this
mechanism<00:00:55.020> works<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.860> turn<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.399> can

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
mechanism works as you turn it you can

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
mechanism works as you turn it you can
turn<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.879> as<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> bicycle<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.170> forward

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
turn that as a bicycle we know forward

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.740 
turn that as a bicycle we know forward
which<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.250> turns<00:00:59.460> over<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.879> very<00:01:00.449> worn

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
which just turns over this very worn

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.360 
which just turns over this very worn
sprocket<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:01.649> goes<00:01:01.770> back<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.219> drive

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
sprocket here which goes back and drive

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.759 
sprocket here which goes back and drive
to<00:01:02.579> chain<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> could<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.290> backwards

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to chain or if you could get backwards

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
to chain or if you could get backwards
it<00:01:04.860> engages<00:01:05.159> something<00:01:05.729> engage<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> chain<00:01:06.420> in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it engages something engage the chain in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940 
it engages something engage the chain in
here<00:01:06.810> which<00:01:06.990> goes<00:01:07.200> over<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> crankshaft

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
here which goes over to the crankshaft

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.300 
here which goes over to the crankshaft
and<00:01:08.490> turns<00:01:09.450> engine<00:01:09.689> over<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.830> unique

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and turns engine over so it's unique

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.130 
and turns engine over so it's unique
among<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.760> heads<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.900> not

ones on the bike has a factory head and
a<00:02:24.720> big<00:02:24.989> for<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.380> reason<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.620> don't<00:02:25.680> used<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
a big for the reason I don't used to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.030 
a big for the reason I don't used to
hike<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.370> head<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.610> my<00:02:26.910> good<00:02:27.209> bike<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.569> because

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
hike on head on my good bike is because

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.500 
hike on head on my good bike is because
I've<00:02:29.040> seized<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> twice<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.000> decided<00:02:30.360> that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
I've seized it twice and I decided that

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.330 
I've seized it twice and I decided that
it<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.049> excess<00:02:31.530> power<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.950> not<00:02:32.130> worth

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
it the excess power is not worth

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.280 
it the excess power is not worth
accidentally<00:02:32.910> seizing<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.810> go<00:02:33.989> ahead<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
accidentally seizing it so go ahead and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.020 
accidentally seizing it so go ahead and
pop<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.799> head<00:02:34.950> off<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.790> loops

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
pop the head off there it's just loops

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.410 
pop the head off there it's just loops
up<00:02:36.150> slide<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.540> off<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.090> see<00:02:39.269> this

up slide it off there you can see this

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.970 
up slide it off there you can see this
is<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.600> very<00:02:39.840> high<00:02:39.989> compression<00:02:40.319> head<00:02:40.739> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
is a very high compression head the

so on this side of it you're gonna have

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.990 
so on this side of it you're gonna have
your<00:04:00.340> stator<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.090> your<00:04:01.750> points<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:03.849> a
