00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
USB wall charger at home you can just

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
USB wall charger at home you can just
not<00:00:45.899> use<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.170> cable<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.890> use<00:00:47.010> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
not use this cable at all and use that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
not use this cable at all and use that
but<00:00:47.610> basically<00:00:48.120> while<00:00:48.809> you're<00:00:49.020> charging<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
but basically while you're charging the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.760 
but basically while you're charging the
battery<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.219> there<00:00:50.850> are<00:00:51.000> five<00:00:51.390> LEDs<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
battery up there are five LEDs here that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
battery up there are five LEDs here that
will<00:00:52.920> light<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.430> sequentially<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.600> being

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
will light up sequentially as it's being

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630 
will light up sequentially as it's being
charged<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> gets<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
charged so you know when it gets to the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.459 
charged so you know when it gets to the
last<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.360> stays<00:00:57.600> solid<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.170> battery

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
last one and it stays solid the battery

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
last one and it stays solid the battery
pack<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.920> fully<00:00:59.219> charged<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.780> see

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
pack is fully charged and as you can see

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.229 
pack is fully charged and as you can see
at<00:01:01.170> any<00:01:01.320> time<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.039> press<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.430> button

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
at any time you can press that button

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
at any time you can press that button
there<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.500> power<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.040> have

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
there to see how much power you have

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
there to see how much power you have
remaining<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> battery<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.750> right<00:01:06.900> now

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
remaining in the battery so right now

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.609 
remaining in the battery so right now
I'm<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.729> five<00:01:09.000> LEDs<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.439> there

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
I'm one down of the five LEDs now there

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
I'm one down of the five LEDs now there
are<00:01:10.799> two<00:01:11.010> ports<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.760> actually<00:01:12.240> charging<00:01:12.720> your

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
are two ports for actually charging your

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
are two ports for actually charging your
devices<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.920> high-output<00:01:14.520> two<00:01:15.270> out

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
devices on this a high-output two out

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
devices on this a high-output two out
port<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.080> side<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> lower

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
port on this side and then a lower

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940 
port on this side and then a lower
output<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:18.150> amp<00:01:18.330> port<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.020> side<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.830> if

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
output one amp port on this side so if

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
output one amp port on this side so if
you<00:01:20.040> wanted<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> charge<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.759> iPhone<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you wanted to charge your iPhone and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.260 
you wanted to charge your iPhone and
your<00:01:21.630> tablet<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:22.770> use<00:01:23.040> both<00:01:23.460> ports<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
your tablet you could use both ports the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.899 
your tablet you could use both ports the
iPhone<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.229> small<00:01:25.740> smaller<00:01:26.220> output<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
iPhone on the small smaller output and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.960 
iPhone on the small smaller output and
the<00:01:27.390> iPad<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> larger<00:01:28.770> output<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> show

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the iPad on the larger output so to show

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.609 
the iPad on the larger output so to show
you<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.329> works<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> plug<00:01:31.350> this

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you how it works I'm going to plug this

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
you how it works I'm going to plug this
lightning<00:01:32.400> cable<00:01:32.729> into<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> larger<00:01:33.810> output

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
lightning cable into the larger output

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.550 
lightning cable into the larger output
and<00:01:34.759> then<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and then you can see when you do that it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.990 
and then you can see when you do that it
immediately<00:01:37.799> lights<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.520> letting<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.880> know

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
immediately lights up letting you know

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
immediately lights up letting you know
it's<00:01:39.180> ready<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.159> plug

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it's ready and then I'm going to plug

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.749 
it's ready and then I'm going to plug
the<00:01:42.060> lightning<00:01:42.810> cable<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.640> will

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the lightning cable in here and it will

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
the lightning cable in here and it will
show<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.479> fully<00:01:45.750> charged<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.619> at

it's<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:48.570> fully<00:01:48.810> charged<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.439> 99%

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369

I dropped a percent but as you can see

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.420 
I dropped a percent but as you can see
in<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.490> upper<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:54.720> hand<00:01:54.750> corner<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:56.009> iPads

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
in the upper right hand corner my iPads

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.240 
in the upper right hand corner my iPads
battery<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.180> being<00:01:57.450> charged<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:59.130> you're

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
battery is being charged so when you're
