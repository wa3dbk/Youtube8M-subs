00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.870

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.629
 stand peugeot we will go around 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.480
 the Peugeot stand with manual and not 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.140
 evil of novelty convoy that is endowed 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.580
 principal but may also 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.320
 vehicles that are simply presented to 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.240
 public view to talk about the standard 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.710
 also its pagan architecture pole 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.940
 particular this year manual it's not 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.470
 my ashes last year geo 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.670
 will see exactly our last planet 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.300
 but it's actually in the 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.640
 broad outlines 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.410
 everything is a little bit configure from the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.090
 same way with a lot of space we have 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.070
 a lot of space to present the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.480
 models and then it 's this big screen 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.829
 to project you we see it is 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.210
 enough it's pretty pure and it's a little 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.980
 few in the image of the style of 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.350
 Today's Peugeot then first 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.730
 car to 308,407 has just been 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.859
 rewarded because of the year so that 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.179
 that's really it's an argument of 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.980
 very strong sale for the builder 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.829
 so the 308 carousel here 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.970
 the novelty on 308 is that low it goes 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.620
 there is the sw advertising version 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.670
 the break version with an excellent 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.100
 boot volume but its particularity 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.630
 3-3 progress that is also presented two 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.650
 new engines that respects 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.230

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.420
 with new diesels unblocking 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.820
 new ideas 3 cylinders pure essence 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 tijd 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 all the blocks that consume and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.270
 consume nothing is good it's ok so 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.170
 we continue on for gary it's not a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.850
 surprise is a 2008 a 2008 with 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 its possibilities of customization is 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 also knows it at the half we have it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.660

 here is a new finish that fits 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.610
 in the range so that will speak to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.330
 some who remember the 205 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.460

 205 we found it on the 206 on the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.640
 207 too and well here it is then not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.930
 in a color a usual color 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.729
 for the garros roland since this is the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.190
 glass normally to this anglet mayor 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.850

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.119

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.940

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.369
 of this year yeah what at 108 so there 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.250
 it's an 8-3 in Lille are exposed here 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.720
 that's pretty poorly lit 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.980
 besides will not be very well 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.630
 against colors but in any case 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.420
 this is the new week that 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.740
 replaces 107 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.069
 which is part of the triplette with 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.870
 lego la c1 we will talk about it a lot during 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.220
 this Geneva fair 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.980
 many breakdowns of possibilities of 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.050
 customization on 708 with between 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.220
 colors stickers ambiances 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.380
 internal to nearly five thousand 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.540
 potential 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.489
 a car that makes the pride of 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.569
 his builder heard him in 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.250
 press conference anyway they 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.650
 can not feed the greenest they 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.239
 will not tell us the opposite in 5 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.310
 doors in 3 doors with two 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.670
 engines and 168 horses and 82 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.000
 horses 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.650
 this time it will exist in version 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.280
 not really convertible but discoverable 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.560
 with this large fabric sunroof that 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 can open up practically 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.819
 up to the rear passengers head 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.140
 okay that's saying more than that there is 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.280
 always some animations on the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.120
 meaning either that since everything to 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.519
 the hour we hear a sizzle 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.690
 poor and really have it 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.510
 okay, let's go 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.400
 so this is our tattooist friend 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.900
 who calls himself or who is 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.690
 extremely well known in the middle and who 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
 took care of this concept because that 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.530
 is called 108 tattoo concept 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.970
 okay and who is a little bit there 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.500
 to highlight the capabilities of 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.049
 customization and possibilities 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.890
 especially customization of the 108 that 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.319
 we have here 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.590
 for example if he drew in that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.230
 lyon 2 the original name of peugeot on the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.270
 roof squarely on this soft top 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.130
 it's an illustrative title finally 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.230
 tattoo 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.580
 in France we will not go there we will not go 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.110
 until then we will explain that 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.880
 actually it's just to show 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.910
 a little of what was possible 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.910
 make 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.810
 the possibility of issuing stickers 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.430
 things like that that are already pre 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.320
 predefined pre- printed but that says the 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.130
 door was not completely closed from 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.870
 side of the peta 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.550
 the really ultimate customization 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.870
 ie arrival with his drawing 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.130
 we see most of the rooms 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.570
 Germans they are alive but we cry 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.190
 we can put it on the car 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.700
 a possibility it's not yet a 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.740
 reality 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.000
 thank you manual we try to show you 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.000
 of stands that plays as if you were there
