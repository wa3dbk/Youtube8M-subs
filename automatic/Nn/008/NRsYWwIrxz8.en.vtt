very niche content and integrating the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.800 
very niche content and integrating the
feedback<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:53.190> everybody<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:53.909> basically<00:03:54.599> like

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
feedback of everybody so basically like

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.360 
feedback of everybody so basically like
the<00:03:54.930> same<00:03:55.139> effects<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.620> blogs<00:03:55.919> building

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
the same effects of blogs building

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.149 
the same effects of blogs building
communities<00:03:56.909> rather<00:03:57.780> than<00:03:58.079> sending<00:03:58.620> messages

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
communities rather than sending messages

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.819 
communities rather than sending messages
of<00:03:59.430> building<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.849> community<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.659> creating<00:04:01.440> the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
of building a community and creating the

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.740 
of building a community and creating the
content<00:04:02.010> with<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.549> community<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.659> I<00:04:03.720> think

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
content with the community and I think

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.339 
content with the community and I think
will<00:04:04.409> lie<00:04:04.829> in<00:04:05.359> more<00:04:06.359> communities<00:04:06.930> around<00:04:07.139> the

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
will lie in more communities around the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.460 
will lie in more communities around the
literature<00:04:07.769> in<00:04:07.919> any<00:04:08.280> also<00:04:08.579> maybe<00:04:08.729> people

quality<00:05:12.940> TV<00:05:13.210> HD<00:05:13.990> TVs<00:05:14.350> but<00:05:14.770> content<00:05:15.310> available

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
quality TV HD TVs but content available

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.420 
quality TV HD TVs but content available
on<00:05:15.699> TV<00:05:16.030> is<00:05:16.150> actually<00:05:16.600> low<00:05:16.960> quality<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.680> my

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
on TV is actually low quality and my

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.890 
on TV is actually low quality and my
question<00:05:18.490> is<00:05:18.849> shouldn't<00:05:19.539> we<00:05:19.690> take

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
question is shouldn't we take

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.990 
question is shouldn't we take
opportunities<00:05:20.200> but<00:05:20.860> cameras<00:05:21.340> as<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.639> 1<00:05:21.789> i'm

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
opportunities but cameras as the 1 i'm

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.480 
opportunities but cameras as the 1 i'm
using<00:05:22.450> right<00:05:22.660> now<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.229> film<00:05:23.500> should

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
using right now to the film should

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.900 
using right now to the film should
produce<00:05:24.720> usually<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.870> content<00:05:26.320> in<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.860> HD<00:05:27.280> and

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
produce usually I content in the HD and

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.490 
produce usually I content in the HD and
then<00:05:28.120> maybe<00:05:28.330> sometimes<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.110> want<00:05:29.289> to<00:05:29.380> just

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
then maybe sometimes I want to just

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.350 
then maybe sometimes I want to just
enhance<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.190> little<00:05:30.520> bit<00:05:30.669> by<00:05:30.910> being<00:05:31.150> able

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
enhance that a little bit by being able

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.790 
enhance that a little bit by being able
to<00:05:31.450> chat<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.050> other<00:05:32.169> guys<00:05:32.440> who<00:05:32.680> are
