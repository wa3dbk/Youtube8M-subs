into<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.630> room<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.050> room<00:01:24.320> was<00:01:24.620> filled<00:01:24.890> evenly

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
into the room the room was filled evenly

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.550

with<00:01:25.790> sound<00:01:26.120> while<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.750> all<00:01:26.900> like<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
with sound while we all like that the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.060 
with sound while we all like that the
old<00:01:27.770> monitor<00:01:28.310> could<00:01:28.490> play<00:01:28.700> loud<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.030> clear

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
old monitor could play loud and clear

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.720 
old monitor could play loud and clear
the<00:01:31.070> new<00:01:31.250> monitor<00:01:31.700> had<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.590> smaller<00:01:33.730> we

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
the new monitor had to be smaller we

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.250 
the new monitor had to be smaller we
wanted<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.180> extend<00:01:35.420> their<00:01:35.720> frequency

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
wanted to extend their frequency

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.200 
wanted to extend their frequency
response<00:01:36.620> down<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:37.040> lower<00:01:37.220> frequencies<00:01:37.490> so

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
response down to lower frequencies so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.960 
response down to lower frequencies so
the<00:01:38.300> person<00:01:38.690> can<00:01:38.870> just<00:01:39.680> use<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.670> speaker

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the person can just use the speaker

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.630 
the person can just use the speaker
without<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.930> need<00:01:42.110> of<00:01:42.140> an<00:01:42.380> external

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
without the need of an external

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.360 
without the need of an external
subwoofer<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.140> also<00:01:45.140> we<00:01:45.500> wanted<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:46.040> improve

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
subwoofer and also we wanted to improve

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.640 
subwoofer and also we wanted to improve
the<00:01:47.000> sound<00:01:47.180> radiation<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:47.960> make<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.470> more

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
the sound radiation and make it more

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.520 
the sound radiation and make it more
even<00:01:48.860> throughout<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.580> room<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.840> speaker

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
even throughout the room so the speaker

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.700 
even throughout the room so the speaker
placement<00:01:52.160> can<00:01:53.000> be<00:01:53.150> more<00:01:53.330> flexible<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:54.200> when

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
placement can be more flexible and when

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.700 
placement can be more flexible and when
we<00:01:54.860> heard<00:01:55.070> them<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.520> when<00:01:55.940> we<00:01:56.090> saw<00:01:56.360> them

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
we heard them and when we saw them

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.810 
we heard them and when we saw them
everything<00:01:57.710> came<00:01:58.010> together<00:01:58.220> for<00:01:58.640> us<00:01:58.730> very

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
everything came together for us very

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.630 
everything came together for us very
quickly<00:01:59.210> all<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.870> art<00:02:00.350> all<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.250> science

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.790 
quickly all the art all the science
combined<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.690> look<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.290> speaker<00:02:03.650> is

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
combined the look of the speaker is

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.110 
combined the look of the speaker is
better<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.370> it<00:02:04.610> gives<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.000> better

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
better and it gives it better

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.420 
better and it gives it better
performance<00:02:05.870> it's<00:02:06.290> smaller<00:02:06.740> yet<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.280> has

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
performance it's smaller yet it has

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.700 
performance it's smaller yet it has
better<00:02:07.670> bass<00:02:08.119> extension<00:02:08.750> because<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.259> more

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
better bass extension because of more

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.070 
better bass extension because of more
sophisticated<00:02:10.340> drivers<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> end<00:02:11.810> all

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
sophisticated drivers and in the end all

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.890 
sophisticated drivers and in the end all
of<00:02:12.710> these<00:02:12.890> things<00:02:13.190> combined

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
of these things combined

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.860 
of these things combined
to<00:02:14.230> create<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.590> music<00:02:15.310> experience<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.120> one

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
to create one music experience and one

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.509 
to create one music experience and one
movie<00:02:17.200> experience<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.040> unforgettable

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
movie experience that is unforgettable

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.750 
movie experience that is unforgettable
and<00:02:18.909> is<00:02:19.629> truly<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.799> greatest<00:02:21.250> sound<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.610> can

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
and is truly the greatest sound that can

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.080 
and is truly the greatest sound that can
be<00:02:21.879> had<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.360> monitor<00:02:23.260> 7<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.799> perfect<00:02:24.489> speaker<00:02:24.909> is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
be had in monitor 7 a perfect speaker is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.440 
be had in monitor 7 a perfect speaker is
like<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> refined<00:02:26.110> bottle<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.799> wine<00:02:27.040> right<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
like a refined bottle of wine right so

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.180 
like a refined bottle of wine right so
you<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:28.930> your<00:02:29.049> entry-level<00:02:29.470> wine<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
you can have your entry-level wine and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.030 
you can have your entry-level wine and
then<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.060> more<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.480> refine<00:02:32.049> it<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
then the more you refine it and then you

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.800 
then the more you refine it and then you
actually<00:02:33.190> learn<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:34.209> things<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.659> you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
actually learn the things that you

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.330 
actually learn the things that you
wanted<00:02:35.079> to<00:02:35.200> taste<00:02:35.440> out<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.829> them<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.159> is<00:02:36.220> how

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
wanted to taste out of them this is how

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.460 
wanted to taste out of them this is how
you<00:02:36.519> get<00:02:36.700> more<00:02:37.030> refined<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.019> listen<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.440> a

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
you get more refined so listen to a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.190 
you get more refined so listen to a
monitor<00:02:38.950> 11<00:02:39.370> it's<00:02:39.819> like<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.269> drinking<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.989> very
