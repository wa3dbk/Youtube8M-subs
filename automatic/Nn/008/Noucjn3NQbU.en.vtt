00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
guess I'll just brew some shits and

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.839 
guess I'll just brew some shits and
giggles

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.820 

to<00:05:27.849> say<00:05:28.119> that<00:05:28.360> I<00:05:28.389> mean<00:05:28.689> guzzle<00:05:29.020> is<00:05:29.169> 50<00:05:29.499> meters

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
to say that I mean guzzle is 50 meters

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.059 
to say that I mean guzzle is 50 meters
and<00:05:30.249> you<00:05:30.309> cuz<00:05:30.909> a<00:05:30.939> source<00:05:31.240> is<00:05:31.449> a<00:05:31.770> belly<00:05:32.770> eighty

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.899 
and you cuz a source is a belly eighty
right<00:05:34.830> so<00:05:35.830> I<00:05:35.860> guess<00:05:36.129> this<00:05:36.249> would<00:05:36.459> be<00:05:36.580> pretty

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
right so I guess this would be pretty

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.489 
right so I guess this would be pretty
like<00:05:37.629> a<00:05:37.659> nice<00:05:37.899> matchup

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:38.499

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.859 

well<00:06:09.099> as<00:06:09.249> you<00:06:09.399> see<00:06:09.550> you<00:06:09.610> guys<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:10.419> sizing<00:06:10.779> is

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:10.869 
well as you see you guys the sizing is

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:14.399 
well as you see you guys the sizing is
way<00:06:11.199> off<00:06:11.229> the<00:06:11.949> gmk<00:06:12.550> gazelle<00:06:12.819> is<00:06:13.029> a<00:06:13.110> lot<00:06:14.110> bigger

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
way off the gmk gazelle is a lot bigger

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.459 
way off the gmk gazelle is a lot bigger
and<00:06:14.740> I<00:06:15.339> you<00:06:16.240> clitoris<00:06:16.779> in<00:06:16.869> terms<00:06:17.080> of<00:06:17.229> height

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469 
and I you clitoris in terms of height

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.239 
and I you clitoris in terms of height
but<00:06:18.279> I<00:06:19.029> think<00:06:19.990> that<00:06:20.169> Yuko<00:06:20.409> source<00:06:20.680> is<00:06:20.889> supposed

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:21.249 
but I think that Yuko source is supposed

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:23.369 
but I think that Yuko source is supposed
to<00:06:21.339> be<00:06:21.430> like<00:06:21.639> I<00:06:21.819> level<00:06:22.330> with<00:06:22.360> a<00:06:22.509> Godzilla

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:23.379 
to be like I level with a Godzilla

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.309 
to be like I level with a Godzilla
