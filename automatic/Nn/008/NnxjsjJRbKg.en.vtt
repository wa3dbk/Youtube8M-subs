 popular cartoon is full of

 ssylochek to games of comics and pop culture 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.230
 in general, but we have a cinema channel here because 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.190
 First of all, we are interested in sending 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.469
 film fan skil 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840

 references in the series gravity falls 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.909
 turn off the movie those who are not all 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.090
 looked and is afraid of spoilers 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.220
 but the rest of the goal do you like the franchise 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 sinister dead since I love her 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.720
 the main character of these films are struggling with 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.799
 dark forces and the show or always been for 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 me the standard of masculinity 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.330
 brutality and mad fun by the way 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.100
 if you don't remember don't know this scene 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.270
 I recall she was in the second part 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.250
 evil dead 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.710
 here the ancient evil finally decided to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.720
 horse tesha they moved into the heads of animals 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 as well as things in the hut where the hero 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.360
 took cover and something like that happened 10 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.400
 Series 2 seasons when pacifica invited 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.380
 dipper to his mansion to help 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.360
 deal with some kind of creepy ghost and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 honestly here that virgin looks like 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 much more creepy than the original 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.420
 the scene on which I once laughed my soul 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.240
 another rather terrible reference 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.549
 it was found the series 5 1 season here 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 mable who has eaten sweets weakened 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.320
 in spirit and as a result became obsessed by some 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.510
 evil she gained incredible power 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.370
 and suddenly spoke rather creepy 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.620
 in a voice like an obsessive heroine 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.720
 film exorcist watch she fly here 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.550
 start mocking mere mortals 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.680
 and even the neck itself was not afraid to turn out 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.230
 for proper effect everything is as in the very 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.930
 the film is another chilling blood 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.480
 neck turning out the reference took place in 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.490
 second episode 2 season here is the main 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.740
 episode antagonist is a reference to 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.260
 the movie is something john carpenter themselves 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.940
 see how he pulls his neck and how 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.370
 he is reincarnated into something dual and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.470
 terrible and this episode I consider one of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.660
 most frightening in this series but 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.120
 The following reference is not so terrible 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.680
 she was noticed by me in episode 9 1 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.180
 season called pig 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.470
 time traveler here 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.480
 a new interesting one appears 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.340
 secondary character traveler 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.530
 in time MB Landing Landing which 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.090
 now takes time machine to 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.010
 fix one recent error 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.320
 past but one trip 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.330
 time hero is not limited but also 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.250
 sister takes her and here they are 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.770
 having created several time paradoxes 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.810
 return to the present at this moment in 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.489
 stories and characters appear that 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.489
 by themselves represent a reference 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.410
 characters are named Olaf and Dungan on the plot 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.780
 they are anti- produces temporary fighters 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.850
 special forces and by the way if you do not understand them 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.590
 names is an anagram of the name of the actor 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.540
 Dolph Lundgren and their appearance 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.940
 sends the cult film of the nineties 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.010
 universal soldier and by the way in the series in 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.570
 the blender first appears 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.700
 another innocent reference to another 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.330
 disney cartoons namely lady and 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.190
 tramp 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.160
 Yes, look how much we loved 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
 his pig romance same 15 series first 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.940
 mable seasons are back in the spotlight 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.100
 the main plot revolves around her 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.930
 love with respect to mermaid rusaldo 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.910
 the pedals of this episode are referring to 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.130
 Free your film about the famous movie 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.350
 Killer whales themselves see how these 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.850
 scenes it seems besides we were seeing 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.100
 is a big fan of it 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.269
 film for after this very scene she 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.980
 says a in the sixth series of the 2 seasons that 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.080
 consists of several less 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.670
 stories told by great-grandfather walls 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.890
 there are quite a few references 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.140
 For example, here you can see the eye of Sauron 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.910
 but I will pay special attention to the story 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.530
 plasticine day which is available 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.640
 otsylochka not even some one 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.800
 specific film 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.260
 but cult personalities of the world key 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.330
 ray harrihausen photographer in this series 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.680
 stand wants to show relatives cool 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.400
 old school film with plasticine 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.860
 monsters 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.110
 created by time-lapse animation but 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.300
 as it later turns out we were damn 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.610
 afraid of such an animation and to win 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.800
 her fear all together the hero goes to 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.780
 mansion director Gary claymore and by the way 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.640
 claymore is a kind of caviar of words 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.620
 This director and created all films 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.210
 who so love the walls and he sort of 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.700
 the story should make it clear 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.280
 the monsters are not real but it turns out that 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.180
 and cyclops is his skeleton and although made of 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.640
 soft material 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 but quite lively and have long taken 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.510
 of their creator captured and here are these 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.060
 monsters refer us to several 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.430
 the film which had a hand of ingenious 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.440
 ray harrihausen namely skeletons were 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.980
 the film jason and the argonauts as well as the battle 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.350
 titans 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.320
 and cyclo seventh journey simba to 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.860
 The following reference was found for 12 episodes 1 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.600
 season 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.730
 look at the main sinister this 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.070
 episode is very similar to faceless god 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.100
 Kaunas and occupying hayao myozaki 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.720
 blown away by ghosts he is the same 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.790
 ambiguous and made don't understand what 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.860
 and it becomes disproportionately large from 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.540
 the fact that everyone lives in this also 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.700
 series there is a reference to the cult 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.890
 franchise about strangers here Uncle Stan 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.140
 trying to scare the kids who came to 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.360
 Winn's summer for sweets trying he is 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.800
 make a pig that in the manner of a stranger 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.050
 pulls from her at some point from 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.450
 abdomen otsylochka pretty short but 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.430
 the joke is counted but sending to another 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.440
 one cult film this time 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.150
 Jurassic Park in one of the series 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.160
 the first season the hero discovers 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.410
 huge smolina and burial 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.060
 variety of dinosaurs seeing this 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.830
 dangerous beauty about uncle stan 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.290
 comes up with a regular business plan and 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.300
 decides to turn this place into an attraction 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.850
 called dumped Oyama Jurassic 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.160
 period and by the way one more thing you see 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.470
 this mosquito in the resin is exactly the same 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.050
 flashed in that same movie spielberg but 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.310
 in 19 episodes of season 1 which is in itself 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.230
 very epic 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.630
 and is hardly my favorite for 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.030
 the whole series is heavily veiled 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.520
 subtle start movie reference 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.650
 and crosses granola well here dipper wanting 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.240
 carry over Stanford consciousness read 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.139
 spells that sounds like this 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:24.669
 the way I remember 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:27.009
 memory and know how it translates from 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.289
 Latin literally began nolana 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.360
 overrated Well dipper can not 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.830
 agree finally to the last 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.740
 today i would like to point out 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.749
 sending in 4 episodes of season 1 which 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.819
 first appears gideon here 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:41.949
 is the most obvious reference to 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.990
 the series which in my opinion the creator 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.969
 gravity falls were inspired the most 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.490
 in this episode where you are intrusive 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.889
 caring for mable he gets that 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.810
 intervene decides dipper it is sent 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.879
 to talk with gideon and meet them 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.629
 pass along the ceiling of some name 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.029
 for club 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:00.430
 and this place is like two drops of water 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.389
 look like a black wigwam invented 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.159
 david lynch 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.289
 and I as a person who did not understand everything 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.840
 Essentially twin pics but watched this series 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:10.210
 two and a half times screamed like that 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.550
 the very pig mei was such a reference 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.680
 Generally respect the creation of so much 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.719
 interesting for film fans left here 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.449
