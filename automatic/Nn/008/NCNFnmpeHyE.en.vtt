all their juices and stuff gets sucked

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.090 
all their juices and stuff gets sucked
through<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.510> they<00:05:30.780> basically<00:05:31.110> get<00:05:31.410> basically

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
through and they basically get basically

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.680 
through and they basically get basically
eaten<00:05:32.520> by<00:05:32.729> this<00:05:32.940> mountain<00:05:33.419> that<00:05:33.570> has<00:05:33.660> a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
eaten by this mountain that has a

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.210 
eaten by this mountain that has a
hundred<00:05:34.020> times<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.320> gravity<00:05:34.710> of<00:05:34.740> normal

hundred times the gravity of normal

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.830 
hundred times the gravity of normal
though<00:05:35.850> it<00:05:35.970> does<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.330> does<00:05:36.479> appear<00:05:36.750> that

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
though it does it does appear that

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.659 
though it does it does appear that
obviously<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.650> know<00:05:37.800> fades<00:05:38.130> into<00:05:38.430> that

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
obviously you know fades into that

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.330 
obviously you know fades into that
Torico<00:05:39.150> took<00:05:39.390> a<00:05:39.450> step<00:05:39.690> in<00:05:39.930> as<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.110> 10g<00:05:40.890> so<00:05:41.250> it

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
Torico took a step in as a 10g so it

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.980 
Torico took a step in as a 10g so it
doesn't<00:05:41.550> obviously<00:05:41.700> go<00:05:41.880> against<00:05:42.240> Anita<00:05:42.450> 100g

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
doesn't obviously go against Anita 100g

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.719 
doesn't obviously go against Anita 100g
because<00:05:43.169> I'd<00:05:43.260> be<00:05:43.320> kind<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.500> ridiculous<00:05:43.770> and

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
because I'd be kind of ridiculous and

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.850 
because I'd be kind of ridiculous and
also<00:05:44.940> as<00:05:45.539> on<00:05:45.750> that<00:05:45.870> way<00:05:46.110> to<00:05:46.169> this<00:05:46.380> before<00:05:46.740> they

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
also as on that way to this before they

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.219 
also as on that way to this before they
reach<00:05:47.010> to<00:05:47.160> Santa<00:05:47.430> Rico's<00:05:47.760> they<00:05:48.330> see<00:05:48.390> this<00:05:48.900> mr.

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229

who that could be down below I've my

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.380 
who that could be down below I've my
little<00:06:05.340> suspicions<00:06:05.789> but<00:06:05.910> we'll<00:06:06.060> have<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.210> wait

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
and see about who i think that is until

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.760 
and see about who i think that is until
next<00:06:08.910> week<00:06:09.180> when<00:06:09.450> when<00:06:09.990> hopefully<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:10.620> gets

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
next week when when hopefully that gets

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.469 
next week when when hopefully that gets
revealed<00:06:11.100> I<00:06:11.280> got<00:06:11.700> the<00:06:11.820> feeling<00:06:11.940> that<00:06:12.180> guy

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
revealed I got the feeling that guy

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.810 
revealed I got the feeling that guy
won't<00:06:12.660> show<00:06:12.930> up<00:06:13.080> for<00:06:13.260> a<00:06:13.320> while<00:06:13.530> but<00:06:14.340> i<00:06:14.370> think<00:06:14.700> is

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
won't show up for a while but i think is

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.060 
won't show up for a while but i think is
someone<00:06:15.180> from<00:06:15.240> gourmet<00:06:15.510> corp<00:06:15.950> beside<00:06:16.950> the
