00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
loader I personally think it is how big

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.570 
loader I personally think it is how big
is<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> 994<00:00:22.140> obviously<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.980> them<00:00:23.130> new<00:00:23.789> 993<00:00:24.539> K

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
is the 994 obviously of them new 993 K

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
is the 994 obviously of them new 993 K
start<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> back<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.050> letter

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
start off on the back you have a letter

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.600 
start off on the back you have a letter
here<00:00:28.920> all<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> hand<00:00:29.460> rails<00:00:29.609> are<00:00:29.789> plastic

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
here all the hand rails are plastic

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.740 
here all the hand rails are plastic
ignore<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> hand<00:00:33.420> rails<00:00:33.570> are

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
ignore that all the hand rails are

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.310 
ignore that all the hand rails are
plastic<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> bit<00:00:36.600> harder<00:00:36.989> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
plastic so right here is a bit harder it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
plastic so right here is a bit harder it
looks<00:00:37.500> different<00:00:37.739> -<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.870> two<00:00:40.860> mirrors

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
looks different - you have two mirrors

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
looks different - you have two mirrors
and<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.980> tab<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.960> really<00:00:45.960> big

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and you have the tab which really big

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
and you have the tab which really big
drops<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:49.230> interior<00:00:49.739> cab<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.399> has

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
drops on it the interior cab it has

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
drops on it the interior cab it has
panels<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> steering<00:00:52.320> wheel<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
panels all around the steering wheel I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.119 
panels all around the steering wheel I
mean<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> seat<00:00:54.500> ignore<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.949> can

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
mean the seat ignore that if you can

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.819 
mean the seat ignore that if you can
hear<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.870> cab's<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.469> detailed

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
hear it and the cab's really detailed

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.670 
hear it and the cab's really detailed
basically<00:00:59.690> you<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.020> walk<00:01:01.260> around<00:01:01.530> here

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
basically you have this walk around here

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
wheel loaders you know nothing in there

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.170 
wheel loaders you know nothing in there
like<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.840> between<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.369> some<00:01:56.369> hydraulic

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
like in between it some hydraulic

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.270 
like in between it some hydraulic
cylinders<00:01:57.570> look<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.680> nice<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
cylinders look really nice with the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.440 
cylinders look really nice with the
model<00:02:00.290> some<00:02:01.290> fenders<00:02:01.649> right<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:03.060> have

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450

that's all
I<00:02:09.369> like<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> tread<00:02:10.330> pattern<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:10.960> really

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
I like the tread pattern it's really

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.750 
I like the tread pattern it's really
nice

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.460 

that's<00:02:16.390> what<00:02:16.540> looks<00:02:16.630> like<00:02:16.780> down<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.260> there

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that's what looks like down in there

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.830 
that's what looks like down in there
basically<00:02:19.080> boom<00:02:20.080> our<00:02:20.350> hydraulic<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.630> got<00:02:22.630> looks

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
basically boom our hydraulic I got looks

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.350 
basically boom our hydraulic I got looks
aren't<00:02:23.020> very<00:02:23.290> smooth<00:02:23.710> on<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.100> though<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
aren't very smooth on this though the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.350 
aren't very smooth on this though the
boom<00:02:25.540> hydraulics<00:02:28.650> whatever<00:02:29.650> they<00:02:30.010> do<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.850> don't

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
boom hydraulics whatever they do I don't

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.400 
boom hydraulics whatever they do I don't
use<00:02:31.540> mind<00:02:31.780> very<00:02:31.990> much

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
use mind very much

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.530 
use mind very much
there's<00:02:33.040> how<00:02:33.220> far<00:02:33.460> backing<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.120> going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.420> be<00:02:34.510> a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
there's how far backing it going to be a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.260 
there's how far backing it going to be a
level<00:02:35.550> whenever<00:02:36.550> it's<00:02:36.700> raised<00:02:36.850> up<00:02:37.000> all<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
level whenever it's raised up all the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.780 
level whenever it's raised up all the
way<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.660> holding<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.380> up<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.710> then<00:02:39.010> dumps

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
way and holding it up and then dumps

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.700 
way and holding it up and then dumps
pretty<00:02:40.060> far

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.940 

there's<00:02:44.710> your<00:02:44.980> linkage<00:02:45.370> system<00:02:46.950> little

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
there's your linkage system little

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.130 
there's your linkage system little
detail<00:02:48.310> right<00:02:48.460> there

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
detail right there

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.200 
detail right there
there's<00:02:50.140> your<00:02:50.260> boom<00:02:50.440> arm<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:51.220> curved<00:02:51.610> up<00:02:51.910> and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
there's your boom arm it's curved up and

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.260 
there's your boom arm it's curved up and
then<00:02:52.330> curve<00:02:52.510> down<00:02:53.730> there<00:02:54.730> well<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.090> are

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
then curve down there well you are

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.080 
then curve down there well you are
curved<00:02:55.960> out<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.200> curve<00:02:56.380> down<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:57.520> bucket<00:02:57.910> has

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
curved out the curve down the bucket has

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.910 
curved out the curve down the bucket has
pretty<00:02:58.450> good<00:02:58.600> detail<00:02:58.750> actually<00:03:01.620> look<00:03:02.620> at<00:03:02.770> this

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
pretty good detail actually look at this
