the<00:00:47.550> ground<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.260> were<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.850> sort<00:00:50.850> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the ground now if we were to sort of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
the ground now if we were to sort of
adapt<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.390> sort<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.750> idea<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:53.520> kinect

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
adapt that sort of idea to the kinect

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090 
adapt that sort of idea to the kinect
rub<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> idea<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.379> concept<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> running

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
rub the idea of what concept of running

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.670 
rub the idea of what concept of running
we<00:00:56.340> thought<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:57.000> kind<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
we thought it was a little kind of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
we thought it was a little kind of
difficult<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.510> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
difficult to get a go to make it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.520 
difficult to get a go to make it
user-friendly<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.800> make<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> realistic<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.530> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
user-friendly or make it realistic so we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
user-friendly or make it realistic so we
actually<00:01:04.949> thought<00:01:05.250> oh<00:01:05.489> wait<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.390> we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
actually thought oh wait what do we we

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
actually thought oh wait what do we we
have<00:01:07.229> sonic<00:01:07.560> riders<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.729> gate

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
have sonic riders it's kind of a gate

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
have sonic riders it's kind of a gate
that's<00:01:09.180> based<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.840> writing<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> board

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that's based on a writing on the board

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.450 
that's based on a writing on the board
and<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.549> felt<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:13.260> sort<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> gameplay

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and we felt that that sort of gameplay

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.660 
and we felt that that sort of gameplay
metaphor<00:01:15.030> lent<00:01:15.689> itself<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.040> kinect

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
metaphor lent itself to the kinect

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.929 
metaphor lent itself to the kinect
control<00:01:18.210> experiment<00:01:18.840> experience<00:01:19.700> now<00:01:20.700> let's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
control experiment experience now let's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.190 
control experiment experience now let's
talk<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> content

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
talk a little bit about the content

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.749 
talk a little bit about the content
obviously<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:23.009> include<00:01:23.250> characters

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
obviously this will include characters

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
obviously this will include characters
from<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.180> previous<00:01:24.659> Emma<00:01:24.900> credit<00:01:25.200> series<00:01:25.500> but

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
from the previous Emma credit series but

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
from the previous Emma credit series but
um<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.520> brought<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.820> elements<00:01:27.210> from

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
um have you brought in elements from

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.069 
um have you brought in elements from
other<00:01:27.479> sonic<00:01:27.840> games<00:01:29.180> specifically<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
other sonic games specifically one of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.630 
other sonic games specifically one of
the<00:01:31.200> features<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:31.860> expect<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the features that you would expect to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.390 
the features that you would expect to
see<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> other<00:01:33.270> Sonic<00:01:33.630> games<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.200> rings<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
see the other Sonic games as rings so in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
see the other Sonic games as rings so in
Sonic<00:01:35.700> Riders<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.090> sonic<00:01:37.020> free<00:01:37.170> riders<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
Sonic Riders and sonic free riders in

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.550 
Sonic Riders and sonic free riders in
that<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.130> particular<00:01:38.810> we've<00:01:39.810> implemented

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that it in particular we've implemented

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.139 
that it in particular we've implemented
a<00:01:40.950> feature<00:01:41.250> whereby<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.470> player<00:01:43.470> character

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
a feature whereby the player character

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.630 
a feature whereby the player character
can<00:01:45.149> power<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.540> by<00:01:45.950> collecting<00:01:46.950> gathering

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
can power up by collecting gathering

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
can power up by collecting gathering
ring<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.630> example<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.920> able<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
ring so for example you would be able to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.780 
ring so for example you would be able to
use<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.970> Rings<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.780> translate<00:01:52.439> into

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
use the the Rings to translate into

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
use the the Rings to translate into
acceleration<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:54.450> dash<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.470> that's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
acceleration or dash so that's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
acceleration or dash so that's
definitely<00:01:55.890> something<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> sonic

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
definitely something that's in the sonic

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.780 
definitely something that's in the sonic
franchise<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:58.079> been<00:01:58.259> brought<00:01:59.189> brought

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
franchise that's been brought brought

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.290 
franchise that's been brought brought
into<00:02:00.149> sonic<00:02:00.479> free<00:02:00.630> riders

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
into sonic free riders

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.330 
into sonic free riders
there's<00:02:01.690> more<00:02:01.900> interaction<00:02:02.560> in<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.160> game

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
there's more interaction in the game

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.080 
there's more interaction in the game
besides<00:02:04.290> controlling<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:06.100> actual<00:02:06.430> board<00:02:06.730> or
