00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.320
 him 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.359
 carbon at first 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 God forbid the memory clearly appeared on our 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:28.329
 the market has probably been used by him for years 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.110
 5 back maybe this before and somehow 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.210
 ambiguous I am used 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.510
 fluorocarbon did not use at that time 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.610
 for a while he did not dock me 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.080
 Russian fishing for our fish why 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.239
 one simple reason is that some 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:50.590
 knit leashes from yuar carbon for for 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 catching predatory fish and positioned for 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.579
 catching pike but I will say so here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.430
 0 35 04 flourocarbon is rick wushu 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.989
 a second to 2 predator will do and I will not 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.129
 I hope to experiment now 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.619
 don't believe a word 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.660
 here is a predator to do it many times faster 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.240
 than i have teeth predator meet me 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.740
 uniquely therefore do habits 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.110
 Carbon Carbon is an ordinary monofilament 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.270
 hydrogen 100 by its varnish 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.630
 Entities same as ordinary semolina 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.569
 make habits hope that they will save 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.289
 report can only be very thick 06 07 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.690
 08 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.369
 like ordinary mana don't make out 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.459
 Fluorocarbon habits can only be in 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.390
 one case i do further if i 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:41.819
 I catch predatory fish not pike perch bersh 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.110
 and catch bait requiring animation 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:48.640
 spinning they coil that is 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.250
 I throw like performance in 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.110
 pigtails in this case will be higher because 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.080
 which is usually this hard string 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.539
 leash that we use for jig 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.869
 Here sometimes happens if the enemy is uncomfortable 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:10.989
 enemy wasps are attacking a predator then it becomes 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:14.110
 spacer and in a pack of fish and often we 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.270
 we take out after biting we cut not 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.550
 feel no resistance 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.030
 take out the gear see that the leash is bent 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.480
 other 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.950
 she weights on 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.200
 bait a single scratch it says 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.269
 about what this predator from you and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.489
 protivohod like this one got out of my head 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.530
 the leash got entangled in it there or somehow 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.750
 bent awa for bait not got 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.200
 fluorocarbon is never like this 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.340
 soft 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.840
 respectively, the performance of cuttings 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.540
 that's exactly when 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.629
 perch and liberzh there laid down and takes the bait 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.150
 with the head forward 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.140
 across is much higher than 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:56.769
 using hard trays is 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:03:01.950
 uniquely talk about what he does not 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.129
 we see and it even plays a role when 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.049
 poklevkah 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.139
 but I would not say so straight 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.099
 categorical we catch bait 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:13.150
 which but not like a failure new fish 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.870
 all kinds of silicone bait 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.359
 but which is by no means and we will not let you down quickly 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.819
 and find out what is there for the same 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.620
 the very same metal lure predator well 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.709
 and just can't attack this piece 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.810
 metal piece of plastic and really understand 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.519
 what is in front of the bait what is there 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.540
 the leash is apparently invisible but this 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.819
 neighbor is funny and most important in this 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.519
 in this material the fact that this material is not 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.680
 no longer afraid of hiller change any 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.510
 material fighters other than shell rock 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.849
 but he flurocarbon 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.829
 less prone to somehow do n't know 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.109
 the impact of shell rock and we catch in 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.359
 koryazhnik file good koryazhnik this 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.540
 snags overgrown with shell we catch 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.849
 hillocks at some depths like 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.859
 rule in places where hard bottom i 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.389
 shell colony is on some 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.549
 reservoir in such as my troops 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.069
 reservoir find shell rock find 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.599
 God with shell rock calls this already gender 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.220
 affairs therefore it is clear that constantly 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.989
 bait touches the bottom, respectively, that 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.669
 the part that is next to the bait 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.039
 braided or is there something 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.190
 the same is subject to touch and being 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.020
 all roughness irregularities and if 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.300
 not a metal leash 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.610
 and some leash there does not use 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.910
 knits a regular braid then this is the first one 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.979
 a chance that in this place there at 10 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.510
 15 centimeters 5 centimeters from the bait 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.949
 she just peretra pro kush nick bye 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.960
 not invented wicker which would 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.570
 perfectly kept some shell rock 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.669
 worse some better but flycarbon here 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.310
 can really help with this 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:57.169
 Iâ€™m not talking about the situation 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.710
 besides trays all this is used for 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.960
 flood gears 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.340
 it is clear that some kind of diversion 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.240
 habits have no secret that 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.970
 fluorocarbon is more interesting in this 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.889
 this situation than usual mononith 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.229
 I will explain why in the first place all that is now 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.110
 before me lies all this sinking 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.770
 their a priori carbon fiber separate range 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.190
 the topic and there use flurocarbon 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.289
 as the main fishing line for wobblers 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.870
 minnow 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.490
 usual twitching I catch it on Krenken 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.449
 I would single out this topic in a separate 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.620
 conversation in general because I think that 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.630
 huge horizon principle on 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.430
 Fluocarbon in 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.170
 blair behaves a little differently 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.110
 than on the braids smooth out this brush and 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.630
 sharpness if the person is 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.030
 chaotic twitching here turns out more 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.450
 he is a mild reason out of chaotic but yes 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.210
 etc. 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:56.810
 a completely different horizon reveals 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:59.360
 catching on similar things but one thing 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.410
 but in my hand you are now on the table 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.830
 right cord with diameter 0 35 is understandable 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.650
 worth it I will use some 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.480
 bizarre coil 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.890
 10-gram wobbler fly away from me 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.210
 distance there is 15 20 meters is the maximum 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.670
 at least here it will fall near me now 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.740
 whether the wind rose therefore catching from 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.040
 Fluocarbon as main line 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.450
 stress it implies the application 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.070
 multiplier coils 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:33.130
 where from the thickness of the cord from the thickness of the fishing line 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.300
 distant casting does not actually affect 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:40.490
 therefore, in principle, the era is coming 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.650
 fluorocarbon multiplier coils 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.320
 I predict this type of fishing very 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.730
 great future because for reasons 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.560
 the fact that a completely different catch 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:53.420
 unusual can after 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.300
 spinningist walked there way minnow 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.700
 on a particular site, you can take 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.290
 your carbon fiber catching your own threads 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.970
 wobblers pick up the pipe which I 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.920
 caught that did not work even on his 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.140
 wiring to this wiring can go out 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.130
 completely different game is obtained and 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.130
 wobbler
