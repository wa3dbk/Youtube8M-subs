 carapina 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.320
 a space of 60 square meters in the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.990
 truth has been transformed that size 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.600
 all here the integration of the room is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.270
 with the balcony the architect's design 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 nasa and lau the project manager of 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.010
 reform of this apartment of a young 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.380
 couple or character is all there is 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.570
 integration was done through the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.610
 Floor covering in all its 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.940
 extension also through the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.100
 which provide that linkage and 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.630
 mainly the harmonization of colors 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.390
 and continuity of furniture 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.960
 now nasdaq the next one had this port 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.600
 You've had a life here. 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.310
 the flooring all this now that 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.780
 you can highlight besides the lighting is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.539
 of course, he said that the integration 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.729
 anyway specific points what you 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.120
 put it here that gave this sensation 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.680
 cozy color relation furniture 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.820
 that has to be used by a space 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.330
 big like this 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.430
 well I think everything that is inside 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.010
 a customer needs program 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.810
 so it is necessary here for the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.670
 balcony for more being integrated to people 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.680
 provided a gourmet space that was 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.070
 very interesting for the use of end of 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.830
 couple's week through the bench 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.350
 all coated in a translucent harmonix 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.900
 and demolition wood buffer to 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.420
 own balcony furniture has a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.700
 certain difference in relation to the room 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.910
 because the fabrics are more resistant 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.700
 the sides of the Healthy furniture fiber and 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.880
 I worked a lot on wood and already here 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.400
 in the book and in the tv room I 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.560
 provided through the withdrawal of the claim 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.350
 and the swivel armchairs and sofa 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.510
 retractable all this integration 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.340
 Of course, as I said at the beginning, only 60 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.350
 meters now have solutions 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 very interesting even for 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.620
 compact apartments that often 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.080
 if you think social apartment is very 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.810
 big and watching us though 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.120
 sometimes a smaller compact apartment 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.640
 because they are solutions that you used in this 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.470
 here that can be adapted in 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.290
 smaller real estate 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.660
 then the flexibility of using a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.180
 furnishings sometimes made through 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.640
 carpentry this is already very worthwhile 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.800
 here I placed in the rack one 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.500
 coffee table that she was hidden 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.050
 right with a time course bootie 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.100
 of use you can pull it and use 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.340
 she totally sucks when the couch 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.950
 is retracted neither pulled by wings 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.930
 and so - there now coating of 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.460
 wall here we see three ne 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.100
 both these inserts than the original 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.990
 even the balcony has the color of the wall and the 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.840
 wallpaper and make a composition 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.050
 also interesting is the coating of the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.910
 balcony wall is a one contains a 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.040
 so joker did not mess up at all 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.290
 any evolution of the project 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.640
 the painting I worked on in defense order 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.560
 pulled from the sea and right nuance Monique 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.170
 wallpaper has a brightness of its own 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.590
 was a great situation there 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.010
 on the dining table has an illumination that 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.160
 is further accentuates the brightness of the paper 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.840
 the lighting looks only interesting 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.770
 this work of art here on the couch 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.539
 call her 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.460
 here is a night image and also with 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.699
 application of swarovski crystals 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.740
 the lighting makes the crystal has 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.270
 glow in the streets with the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.430
 importance of a good project of 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.949
 lighting is not clear. 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.259
 more compact to it a little bigger 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.539
 where the lighting between what is done there 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.849
 can cause even by residents or 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.440
 clear to indirect owners 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.389
 provides illumination of 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.360
 well-suited relaxation for a 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.550
 time to watch a movie is I worked 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.639
 the beacons that make a link of 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.539
 connection of the TV room with the 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.669
 input 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.080
 I worked on the top of the 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.120
 gourmet space 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.340
 the pike that was worked on the table 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.919
 When it is off it has a 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.590
 mirror an all-glass mirror that 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.900
 reflects the ambience of the room and the 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.569
 lighting focused on the frames that also 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.569
 It is very interesting to highlight art 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.400

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.199
