to replace the dog run or like here we
had<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> sand<00:01:42.630> box<00:01:43.790> if<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
had a little bit of a sand box if you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.609 
had a little bit of a sand box if you
walk<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> grass<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.869> disturbs<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
walk on the grass that disturbs the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
walk on the grass that disturbs the
roots<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.369> roots<00:01:47.640> cannot<00:01:48.119> get

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
roots if the roots cannot get

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
roots if the roots cannot get
established<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:49.590> sod<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
established your sod is not going to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
established your sod is not going to
take<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.360> not<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:51.960> well

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
take off and it's not going to do well

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.770 
take off and it's not going to do well
so<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.460> rye<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.970> 7<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> 10<00:01:54.540> days

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so for like rye it's 7 to 10 days

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.139 
so for like rye it's 7 to 10 days
for<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> roots<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.040> take<00:01:56.219> off<00:01:56.369> fescue

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
for the roots to really take off fescue

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.780 
for the roots to really take off fescue
can<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.479> 10<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.869> 14<00:01:58.320> days<00:01:58.590> depending<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.250> where

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
can be 10 to 14 days depending on where

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.819 
can be 10 to 14 days depending on where
you're<00:01:59.969> at<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.270> blue<00:02:00.899> grass<00:02:01.200> which<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
you're at and blue grass which is one of

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.819 
you're at and blue grass which is one of
the<00:02:01.979> longest<00:02:02.430> ones<00:02:02.490> takes<00:02:03.210> 28<00:02:03.600> days<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.710> we

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the longest ones takes 28 days so we

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.410 
the longest ones takes 28 days so we
need<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.070> keep<00:02:05.250> children<00:02:05.939> lawn<00:02:06.899> mowers<00:02:07.369> dogs

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
need to keep children lawn mowers dogs

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.910 
need to keep children lawn mowers dogs
any<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.629> animals<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.140> much<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.739> off

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
any other animals as much as you can off

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.050 
any other animals as much as you can off
the<00:02:10.979> grass

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the grass

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.490 
the grass
now<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> final<00:02:12.989> thing<00:02:13.140> we

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
now the final thing we

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.710 
now the final thing we
to<00:02:13.650> talk<00:02:13.890> about<00:02:14.070> again<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.820> fertilizer<00:02:15.240> if

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
to talk about again is the fertilizer if

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.620 
to talk about again is the fertilizer if
you<00:02:16.320> put<00:02:16.590> down<00:02:16.830> fertilizer<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.790> nitrogen<00:02:18.300> on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
you put down fertilizer that nitrogen on

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260 
you put down fertilizer that nitrogen on
young<00:02:19.050> grass<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.280> young<00:02:20.580> seedlings<00:02:21.120> if

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
young grass just like young seedlings if

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.520 
young grass just like young seedlings if
you're<00:02:21.420> doing<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.720> vegetable<00:02:22.110> garden<00:02:22.380> that

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
you're doing a vegetable garden that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.490 
you're doing a vegetable garden that
nitrogen<00:02:23.400> will<00:02:23.700> burn<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.270> grass<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.930> then

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
nitrogen will burn the grass and then

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.220 
nitrogen will burn the grass and then
you're<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:26.610> exactly<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.750> opposite

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
you're going to do exactly the opposite

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.410 
you're going to do exactly the opposite
of<00:02:28.350> what<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.740> want<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.910> wait<00:02:30.150> till

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
you've mowed the lawn three times then

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.030
