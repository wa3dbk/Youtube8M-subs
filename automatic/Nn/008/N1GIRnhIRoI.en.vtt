00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640

much<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:56.050> manipulate<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.620> strings<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.340> do

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
much can manipulate the strings to do

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.890 
much can manipulate the strings to do
whatever<00:02:57.670> he<00:02:57.940> wants<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:58.720> particular

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
whatever he wants and in this particular

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.020 
whatever he wants and in this particular
case<00:02:59.200> he<00:02:59.800> used<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.190> destroy<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.670> meteorite

case he used it to destroy the meteorite
and<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.390> also<00:03:01.600> makes<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.380> seem<00:03:02.530> as<00:03:02.680> though

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
and that also makes it seem as though

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.290 
and that also makes it seem as though
because<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.550> know<00:03:03.610> if<00:03:03.700> he<00:03:03.820> could<00:03:03.940> frickin

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
because you know if he could frickin

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.000 
because you know if he could frickin
make<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.450> meteorite<00:03:04.900> get<00:03:05.080> chopped<00:03:05.380> into<00:03:05.620> bits

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
make a meteorite get chopped into bits

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.190 
make a meteorite get chopped into bits
that<00:03:06.790> frickin<00:03:07.270> shows<00:03:07.510> how<00:03:07.750> strong<00:03:08.080> those

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
that frickin shows how strong those

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.380 
that frickin shows how strong those
strings<00:03:08.500> are<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.920> can<00:03:09.310> kinda<00:03:09.580> explain<00:03:09.820> how<00:03:10.030> he

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
strings are and can kinda explain how he

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.449 
strings are and can kinda explain how he
was<00:03:10.510> able<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.780> glide<00:03:11.170> in<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> sky<00:03:11.740> using<00:03:12.400> the

was able to glide in the sky using the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.680 
was able to glide in the sky using the
strings<00:03:12.730> he<00:03:12.850> can<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.120> create<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.450> strings

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
strings he can just create the strings

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.270 
strings he can just create the strings
out<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.959> nothing<00:03:14.320> out<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.560> thin<00:03:14.740> air<00:03:14.770> they

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
out of nothing out of thin air they

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.830 
out of nothing out of thin air they
could<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.610> pop<00:03:15.790> up<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.180> he<00:03:16.270> could<00:03:16.450> just<00:03:16.630> jump

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
could just pop up and he could just jump

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.810 
could just pop up and he could just jump
on<00:03:17.020> them<00:03:17.170> because<00:03:17.440> they're<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:18.100> solid<00:03:18.730> and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
on them because they're that solid and

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.190 
on them because they're that solid and
that<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.209> know<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.450> they're<00:03:19.600> able<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.989> carry

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
that you know that they're able to carry

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.870 
that you know that they're able to carry
his<00:03:20.350> weight<00:03:20.530> kind<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.190> connects<00:03:21.489> everything

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
his weight kind of connects everything

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.550 
his weight kind of connects everything
makes<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.510> gives<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.840> little<00:03:23.019> more<00:03:23.230> insight

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
makes it gives a little more insight

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.590 
makes it gives a little more insight
basically<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.430> dolfe<00:03:24.670> amigos<00:03:25.120> ability

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
basically and to dolfe amigos ability

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.570 
basically and to dolfe amigos ability
overall<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.739> was<00:03:26.860> definitely<00:03:27.220> my<00:03:27.310> favorite

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
overall that was definitely my favorite

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
overall that was definitely my favorite
part<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.850> chapter<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:28.209> was<00:03:28.330> freakin

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
part of the chapter that was freakin

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.040 
part of the chapter that was freakin
awesome

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
awesome

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.540 
awesome
I<00:03:29.080> really<00:03:29.470> wish<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.739> entire<00:03:29.860> chapter<00:03:30.370> were<00:03:30.459> to

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
I really wish the entire chapter were to

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.040 
I really wish the entire chapter were to
focus<00:03:30.820> on<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.060> because<00:03:31.180> we<00:03:31.420> get<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.840> and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
focus on that because we get that and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.660 
focus on that because we get that and
then<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:32.560> kind<00:03:32.769> of<00:03:32.860> cut<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.190> other<00:03:33.340> parts

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
then we kind of cut it to other parts

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.670 
then we kind of cut it to other parts
the<00:03:34.000> least<00:03:34.300> important<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:34.989> probably

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
the least important and probably

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.100 
the least important and probably
unnecessary<00:03:35.890> part<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.910> chapter<00:03:37.300> was<00:03:37.750> went

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
unnecessary part of the chapter was went

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.840 
unnecessary part of the chapter was went
Frankie<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.680> LaToya<00:03:39.040> running<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.580> they

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
Frankie and LaToya running and they

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.940 
Frankie and LaToya running and they
actually<00:03:40.209> stole<00:03:40.450> something<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.440> was<00:03:41.800> very

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
actually stole something it was very

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.400 
actually stole something it was very
unnecessary<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.760> was<00:03:42.880> probably<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.510> low<00:03:44.140> of

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
unnecessary that was probably the low of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.020 
unnecessary that was probably the low of
the<00:03:44.560> chapter<00:03:44.950> because<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.280> have<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.459> very<00:03:45.700> big

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
the chapter because we have a very big

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.449 
the chapter because we have a very big
high<00:03:46.300> with<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.290> battle<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.860> then<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.370> was

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
high with the battle and then that was

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.250 
high with the battle and then that was
kind<00:03:48.519> of<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:48.790> like<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.030> break<00:03:49.269> away<00:03:49.480> on<00:03:49.840> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
kind of just like a break away on the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.350 
kind of just like a break away on the
other<00:03:50.380> stuff<00:03:50.620> with<00:03:50.830> Sanji<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.550> dance<00:03:52.150> or

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
other stuff with Sanji and dance or

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.600 
other stuff with Sanji and dance or

bad feeling because they're gonna split

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.840 
bad feeling because they're gonna split
up<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.380> usually<00:03:59.739> when<00:03:59.920> people<00:03:59.950> split<00:04:00.670> up

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
up and usually when people split up

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.970 
up and usually when people split up
especially<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> girl<00:04:01.810> like<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.650> she<00:04:02.800> just

especially a girl like that and she just
betrayed<00:04:03.430> them<00:04:03.720> she<00:04:04.720> might<00:04:04.959> not<00:04:05.110> make<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.440> to

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
betrayed them she might not make it to

the rendezvous point that's my
