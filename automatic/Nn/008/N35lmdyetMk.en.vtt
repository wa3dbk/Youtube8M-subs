00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
remote control here this is for your

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.330 
remote control here this is for your
right<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:16.530> turn<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.220> your

your left and right left and right to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690 
your left and right left and right to
actually<00:01:21.540> make<00:01:22.259> him<00:01:22.439> crawl<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.979> S<00:01:23.189> shape<00:01:23.490> or

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
actually make him crawl in S shape or

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
actually make him crawl in S shape or
you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.119> push<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> S<00:01:24.630> button<00:01:25.080> where<00:01:25.259> it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you can just push the S button where it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.179 
you can just push the S button where it
actually<00:01:26.220> drives<00:01:26.640> itself<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.540> an<00:01:27.689> S<00:01:27.900> pattern

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
actually drives itself in an S pattern

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.789 
actually drives itself in an S pattern
more<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> circular<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.390> spectrum<00:01:31.170> using

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
more like a circular a spectrum using

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
more like a circular a spectrum using
this<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.280> cancel<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.909> circular<00:01:33.479> s

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this and you can cancel that circular s

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.920 
this and you can cancel that circular s
pattern<00:01:34.430> moving<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.670> crawling<00:01:35.970> using<00:01:36.570> any<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
pattern moving or crawling using any of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.100 
pattern moving or crawling using any of
these<00:01:37.110> buttons<00:01:37.610> basically<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.909> neat<00:01:39.659> middle

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
these buttons basically it's neat middle

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
these buttons basically it's neat middle
toe<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> length<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.700> actually

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
toe you can see the length is actually

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.190 
toe you can see the length is actually
good<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.689> well

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
good as well

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.510 
good as well
so<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.460> long<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.270> good<00:01:45.869> enough<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
so not very long but good enough and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.910 
so not very long but good enough and
there's<00:01:47.520> little

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.170
