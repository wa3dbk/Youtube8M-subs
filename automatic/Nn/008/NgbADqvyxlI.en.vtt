00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
it's a proprietary blend so you don't

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.620 
it's a proprietary blend so you don't
know<00:03:35.950> how<00:03:36.100> much<00:03:36.280> speed<00:03:36.580> aliens<00:03:37.090> actually<00:03:37.239> in

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
know how much speed aliens actually in

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.530 
know how much speed aliens actually in
there<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.489> can<00:03:39.489> really<00:03:39.640> feel<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.910> tingle

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
there I can really feel the tingle

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.000 
there I can really feel the tingle
tingle<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.200> know<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.500> know<00:03:41.620> my<00:03:41.769> do<00:03:41.830> with

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
tingle you know you know my do with

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.460 
tingle you know you know my do with
baling<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.730> don't<00:03:42.910> know<00:03:42.970> how<00:03:43.180> much<00:03:43.470> then

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
baling so I don't know how much then

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.110 
baling so I don't know how much then
again<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.860> only<00:03:45.010> took<00:03:45.190> two<00:03:45.430> scoops<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.940> didn't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
again I only took two scoops I didn't

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.539 
again I only took two scoops I didn't
take<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.630> full<00:03:46.870> three<00:03:47.290> just<00:03:47.980> because<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.459> don't

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
take the full three just because I don't

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.039 
take the full three just because I don't
like<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.820> have<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.090> much<00:03:49.269> caffeine<00:03:49.750> before<00:03:49.870> I

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
like to have that much caffeine before I

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.930 
like to have that much caffeine before I
work<00:03:50.230> out<00:03:50.440> but<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:51.100> mean<00:03:51.370> maybe<00:03:51.549> if<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.760> took

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
work out but I mean maybe if you took

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.430 
work out but I mean maybe if you took
the<00:03:52.120> full<00:03:52.269> three<00:03:52.570> scoops<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.989> would<00:03:53.170> you

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
the full three scoops you would you

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.000 
the full three scoops you would you
would<00:03:53.530> feel<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:54.299> then<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.600> next<00:03:55.840> blend<00:03:56.620> here

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
would feel that then the next blend here

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.460 
would feel that then the next blend here
is<00:03:57.280> kind<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:57.880> amino<00:03:58.480> acid<00:03:58.930> blunts<00:03:59.320> you're

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
is kind of a amino acid blunts you're

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.960 
is kind of a amino acid blunts you're
getting<00:03:59.799> all<00:04:00.730> three<00:04:00.810> branch<00:04:01.810> in<00:04:01.989> amino<00:04:02.260> acids

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
getting all three branch in amino acids

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.710 
getting all three branch in amino acids
taurine<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.290> glutamine<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.570> point

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
taurine and glutamine I get the point

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.560 
taurine and glutamine I get the point
one<00:04:07.989> point<00:04:08.019> six<00:04:08.680> grams<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:10.239> I<00:04:10.299> don't<00:04:10.480> know

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
one point six grams so I don't know

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.750 
one point six grams so I don't know
really<00:04:10.780> what<00:04:11.110> I<00:04:11.410> mean<00:04:11.709> they're<00:04:12.459> all<00:04:12.490> good

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
really what I mean they're all good

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.030 
really what I mean they're all good

products I like you know

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.440 
products I like you know
like<00:04:14.129> French<00:04:14.340> in<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.579> u.s.<00:04:14.819> it's<00:04:14.969> a<00:04:15.030> lot<00:04:15.180> talk

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
like French in the u.s. it's a lot talk

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.879 
like French in the u.s. it's a lot talk
about<00:04:15.659> them<00:04:15.810> getting<00:04:16.079> in<00:04:16.259> the<00:04:16.320> video<00:04:16.530> what

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
about them getting in the video what

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.890 
about them getting in the video what
again<00:04:17.459> that's<00:04:17.639> something<00:04:17.789> you<00:04:18.000> could<00:04:18.120> get<00:04:18.329> yes

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
again that's something you could get yes

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.039 
again that's something you could get yes
and<00:04:19.079> then<00:04:19.199> we<00:04:19.350> got<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.940> muscle<00:04:20.940> pump<00:04:21.419> matrix

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and then we got the muscle pump matrix

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.930 
and then we got the muscle pump matrix
blend<00:04:22.440> there's<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:23.009> few<00:04:23.190> ingredients<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.789> that

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
blend there's a few ingredients in that

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.360 
blend there's a few ingredients in that
that<00:04:24.120> I'm<00:04:24.210> actually<00:04:24.539> really<00:04:24.750> excited<00:04:24.900> about

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.060 
that I'm actually really excited about
the<00:04:26.370> first<00:04:26.580> one<00:04:26.970> being<00:04:27.449> well<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.770> first<00:04:28.979> one

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
the first one being well the first one

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.400 
the first one being well the first one
I'm<00:04:29.220> excited<00:04:29.550> about<00:04:29.699> is<00:04:29.910> gotta<00:04:30.539> mean<00:04:30.780> sulfate

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
I'm excited about is gotta mean sulfate

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.129 
I'm excited about is gotta mean sulfate
which<00:04:32.070> way<00:04:32.759> in<00:04:32.820> Argentina<00:04:33.360> supplemented

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
which way in Argentina supplemented

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.749 
which way in Argentina supplemented
that's<00:04:34.320> where<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.770> converted<00:04:35.039> into<00:04:35.400> into

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
that's where it is converted into into

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.330 
that's where it is converted into into
the<00:04:35.850> body<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.630> myself<00:04:37.110> mining<00:04:37.590> directly<00:04:38.130> with

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the body so myself mining directly with

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.340 
the body so myself mining directly with
that<00:04:38.550> you've<00:04:39.120> been<00:04:39.300> it's<00:04:39.660> been<00:04:39.840> found<00:04:40.110> that

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
that you've been it's been found that

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.960 
that you've been it's been found that
it's<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.620> little<00:04:40.650> bit<00:04:40.800> more<00:04:40.979> effective<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:41.759> a

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
it's a little bit more effective so a

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.480 
it's a little bit more effective so a
lot<00:04:42.389> of<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.630> pre<00:04:43.169> workouts<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.009> you<00:04:44.370> know<00:04:44.460> I

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
lot of the pre workouts and you know I

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.460 
lot of the pre workouts and you know I
know<00:04:44.820> products<00:04:45.270> like<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.630> have<00:04:46.110> kind<00:04:46.320> of

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
know products like that have kind of

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.879 
know products like that have kind of
shifted<00:04:46.800> over<00:04:46.889> to<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.190> gotta<00:04:47.639> meet<00:04:47.849> Sophie<00:04:48.300> so

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
shifted over to the gotta meet Sophie so

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
you know trying more research needs to

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.540 
you know trying more research needs to
be<00:04:51.300> done<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.539> that<00:04:51.840> but<00:04:52.199> so<00:04:52.800> far<00:04:53.130> it<00:04:53.310> looks

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
be done on that but so far it looks

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.070 
be done on that but so far it looks
pretty<00:04:53.970> good<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.449> am<00:04:54.570> pretty<00:04:54.720> excited<00:04:54.840> about

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
pretty good so I am pretty excited about

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.770 
pretty good so I am pretty excited about
that<00:04:55.400> then<00:04:56.400> we<00:04:56.550> have<00:04:56.639> beet<00:04:56.940> root<00:04:57.210> extract

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
that then we have beet root extract

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.110 
that then we have beet root extract
which<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.410> know<00:04:58.500> it's<00:04:58.650> been<00:04:58.800> pretty<00:04:59.120> pretty

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
which you know it's been pretty pretty

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.270 
which you know it's been pretty pretty
widely<00:05:00.330> used<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.229> type<00:05:01.440> of<00:05:01.470> product<00:05:02.039> and

this<00:05:14.880> specific<00:05:15.750> neuron<00:05:16.729> so<00:05:17.729> next<00:05:18.030> up<00:05:18.240> would<00:05:18.479> be

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
this specific neuron so next up would be

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.159 
this specific neuron so next up would be
the<00:05:18.870> focus<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:20.130> focus<00:05:20.159> blend<00:05:20.789> in<00:05:21.060> with<00:05:21.840> that

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
the focus the focus blend in with that

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.629 
the focus the focus blend in with that
we<00:05:22.500> have<00:05:22.970> of<00:05:23.970> course<00:05:24.030> that's<00:05:24.449> where<00:05:24.690> caffeine

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
we have of course that's where caffeine

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.520 
we have of course that's where caffeine
tyrosine<00:05:26.639> comes<00:05:27.060> in<00:05:27.330> cup<00:05:27.990> all<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.169> products

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
tyrosine comes in cup all the products

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.140 
tyrosine comes in cup all the products
but<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.949> course<00:05:29.220> it's<00:05:29.400> a<00:05:29.460> pre-workout<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.060> it's

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
but of course it's a pre-workout so it's

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.520 
but of course it's a pre-workout so it's
going<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.300> have<00:05:30.389> caffeine<00:05:30.780> because<00:05:31.229> it's<00:05:31.440> a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
going to have caffeine because it's a

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.770 
going to have caffeine because it's a
