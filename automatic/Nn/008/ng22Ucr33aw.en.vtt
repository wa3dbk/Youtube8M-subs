00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.160
 HIV is HIV 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.060
 If you have HIV, if you have an infection 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.570
 Which destroys the immune system with time, and causes AIDS. 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.930
 AIDS means (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.260
 This is the last stage of HIV infection 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.060
 When the immune system became devastating and very weak 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.700
 To combat normal infections 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.270
 When extraneous objects, such as bacteria and viruses 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.400
 Enter into your body, you can cause infection 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.560
 These events activate your body's defense against alien creatures 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.470
 White blood cells in the immune system 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.320
 Is part of the body's defense 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.450
 There are some types of white blood cells, called 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.650
 T lymphocyte helper, or T-helper cells, 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.570
 Involves and strengthens the immune system to respond to infection 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.980
 In two ways : 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.130
 The first and T cells help secrete chemicals 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.987
 Which attract other white blood cells 

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:21.100
 To the site of infection 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.910
 These extra white blood cells 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.760
 Attracts exotic bacteria or virus as well 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.410
 Other infected cells. 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.120
 Method 2, T cells help secrete chemicals 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.300
 Which makes other white blood cells multiply 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.930
 These new white blood cells make markers 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.370
 Called antibodies, which you can identify 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.700
 The same intruder body is around the body 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.250
 Antibodies are linked to bacteria or virus 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:08.100
 They identify them as a target for the immune system to destroy them 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.690
 If you have HIV, it travels around your body 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.000
 And other body fluids to infect and kill some white blood cells 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.300
 The virus enters T cells, which are the primary target 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.400
 When it is inside. The virus makes many copies of itself 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.360
 When the parts are made 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.900
 The damaged T cells leave the cells to infect other cells 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.620
 Helping T cells lose the ability to protect the body 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.900
 Of the continuous infection and die. 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.700
 In this way, HIV spreads and kills 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.600
 More T cells help, weak immune system 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.120
 The result, other types of infection 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.910
 Able to exploit weakness and inability of your body 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.730
 To protect itself 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.600
 This infection is called opportunistic infection. 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.320
 If you have HIV infection, one or more 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.800
 Of opportunistic infections, if you have AIDS. 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.720
 Some of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS are known 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.120
 Is a tissue inflammation that covers the brain and spine 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.040
 Lung, called meningitis, encephalitis, 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.150
 Called encephalitis 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.300
 Respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.110
 Intestinal diseases such as chronic diarrhea 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.700
 Caused by infectious parasites. 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.790
 And cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.200
 Non Hodgkin lymphoma. 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.570
 HIV passes from person to person through infected body fluids. 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.700
 HIV can enter the body during unprotected sex, while sharing 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.200
 Needle injection drugs, during your birth, 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.430
 During breast-feeding from your mother, 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.530
 Or from blood or contaminated blood products. 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.790
 Although there is no cure for HIV 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.800
 Drugs called antiretroviral drugs 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.100
 Can reduce the amount of virus in the body. 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.510
 One type of antiviral drugs, 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.160
 Called entry or fusion inhibitors 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.880
 Disrupts the process of HIV infection 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.500
 By preventing the virus from adhering to the cells 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.580
 Other categories of antiretroviral drugs 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.330
 Including reverse transcriptionase inhibitors, 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.530
 Protease inhibitors, and enzyme inhibitors. 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.450
 These drugs prevent the manufacture, assembly, and spread 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.970
 New viruses 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.760
 Your doctor may prescribe a combination of these drugs 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.960
 The classes, known as antiviral therapy are very active 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.030
 Or a mixture of HART drugs. 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.790
 Antiviral drugs do not 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.700
 Removes the virus from the body completely, but slows its spread enough 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.190
 To enable the immune system to fight infection 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.180
 Regular blood tests will let your doctor 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.870
 Find out how effective antiviral drugs is 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.090
 In controlling HIV 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.350
 If the number of T cells is high enough in the blood 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.400
 Sample, medicine works. 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.350
 Treatment of opportunistic infections 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.790
 Are certain drugs for each type of infection. 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.160
 For example, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.900
 If you have pneumonia or tuberculosis. 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.520
 To avoid getting or spreading HIV infection 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.700
 Learn about HIV and your partner 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.260
 Through continuous examination 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.410
 The most effective way to prevent HIV infection 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.220
 Avoid vaginal and anal sex. 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.500
 When engaging in sexual activity, 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.040
 You will be less likely to acquire HIV 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.230
 If you have sex only with one uninfected partner, 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.090
 Or use condoms for protection. 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.210
 Avoid using illegal drugs by injecting, or sharing drug needles, 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.050
 Because needles may have virus on them. 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.250
 Avoid poisoning by drugs or alcohol, 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.570
 Because you will be more likely to engage 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.670
 In sexual behavior risk
