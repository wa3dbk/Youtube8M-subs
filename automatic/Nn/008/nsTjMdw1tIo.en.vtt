bluetooth<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.490> am<00:00:20.699> assuming<00:00:20.820> there's

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
bluetooth so I am assuming there's

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.960 
bluetooth so I am assuming there's
actually<00:00:21.720> no<00:00:21.869> wires<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.650> guys<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.070> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
actually no wires as you guys can see so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.130 
actually no wires as you guys can see so
these<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.269> obviously<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> be

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
these are obviously going to be

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.279 
these are obviously going to be
bluetooth<00:00:25.650> paired<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.490> device<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.960> let's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
bluetooth paired to your device so let's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.960 
bluetooth paired to your device so let's
open<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.830> things<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.490> find<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:29.939> more

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
open these things up and find out more

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.690 
open these things up and find out more

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
what we have fun writing excel we have

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
what we have fun writing excel we have
some<00:01:05.280> accessories<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.360> there's<00:01:07.200> nothing

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
some accessories and there's nothing

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.310 
some accessories and there's nothing
else<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> box<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.340> we'll<00:01:08.490> set<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> aside

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
else in the box so we'll set that aside

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
else in the box so we'll set that aside
here<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.979> Roman<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.510> let's<00:01:12.720> try<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
here we have the Roman so let's try to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.550 
here we have the Roman so let's try to
pop<00:01:13.260> them<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:14.850> okay<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.200> here

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
pop them out there actually okay so here

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.090 
pop them out there actually okay so here
we<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.890> micro<00:01:17.340> USB<00:01:18.270> cable<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:19.890> guess

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we have a micro USB cable and I guess

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.649 
we have a micro USB cable and I guess
their<00:01:20.280> individual<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.060> that's<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
their individual so that's kind of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
their individual so that's kind of
interesting<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.460> another

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
interesting and we actually have another

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
interesting and we actually have another
one<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.200> guessing<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.549> go<00:01:26.670> this

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
one so I'm guessing here we go this

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.420 
one so I'm guessing here we go this
explains<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.049> plug<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.680> wire<00:01:28.979> into

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
explains it so you plug this wire into

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.069 
explains it so you plug this wire into
both<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:30.720> they're<00:01:30.900> both

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
both of them and that's how they're both

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.039 
both of them and that's how they're both
powered<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.610> how<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:32.880> look<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.990> do

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
powered this is how they look they do

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.160 
powered this is how they look they do
look<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.869> unique<00:01:36.869> looking

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
look really kind of unique looking

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
look really kind of unique looking
they're<00:01:37.890> very<00:01:38.070> different<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> here's<00:01:39.390> like

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
they're very different and here's like

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.660 
they're very different and here's like
an<00:01:39.900> accessory<00:01:40.409> package<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.040> we'll<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.490> what

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
an accessory package so we'll see what

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.240 
an accessory package so we'll see what
we<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.259> here<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
we have in here here we actually have a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.850 
we have in here here we actually have a
dual<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.509> guess<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.170> actually<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> charge

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
dual I guess you actually have to charge

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
dual I guess you actually have to charge
both<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.430> separately<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.390> they

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
both of them separately so here they

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
both of them separately so here they
actually<00:01:48.780> give<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> special<00:01:49.460> charger<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actually give you the special charger to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.910 
actually give you the special charger to
charge<00:01:50.640> both<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.299> them<00:01:51.420> which<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.500> very

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
charge both of them which is very

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.319 
charge both of them which is very
interesting<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.490> haven't<00:01:53.850> seen<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.060> before

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
interesting I haven't seen that before

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.499 
interesting I haven't seen that before
you<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.649> user<00:01:55.979> manual<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.360> have

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you have the user manual and you have

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.590 
you have the user manual and you have
two<00:01:57.869> additional<00:01:58.909> earpieces<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.420> case

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
two additional earpieces just in case

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.270 
two additional earpieces just in case
those<00:02:00.930> don't<00:02:01.229> fit<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.590> ears<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:01.979> well<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
those don't fit your ears as well you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.139 
those don't fit your ears as well you
actually<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.820> these<00:02:03.719> pieces<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.880> this

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
actually have these pieces here so this

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
actually have these pieces here so this
is<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.469> package<00:02:07.860> it's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
is what you get in the package it's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.729 
is what you get in the package it's
actually<00:02:08.879> very<00:02:08.910> nice<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:10.140> noodle<00:02:10.590> wire

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
actually very nice and it's noodle wire

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.510 
actually very nice and it's noodle wire
so<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.129> won't<00:02:11.400> tangle<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.970> easily

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
so it won't tangle it's easily

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.510 
so it won't tangle it's easily
as<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.120> guys<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.510> see<00:02:13.570> it's<00:02:14.230> really<00:02:15.130> really

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
as you guys can see it's really really

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.730 
as you guys can see it's really really
easy<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:16.030> untangle<00:02:16.570> it's<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.590> awesome

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
easy to untangle it's so awesome

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.820 
easy to untangle it's so awesome
compared<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.940> regular<00:02:19.120> wires<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.990> I

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
compared to the regular wires and I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.210 
compared to the regular wires and I
guess<00:02:21.010> we<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.190> plug<00:02:21.610> these<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:23.220> here's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
guess we just plug these in so here's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.000 
guess we just plug these in so here's
the<00:02:24.460> first<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:26.350> fire<00:02:26.590> does<00:02:26.830> seem

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
the first one and this fire does seem

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
the first one and this fire does seem
pretty<00:02:27.220> long<00:02:27.490> so<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.270> don't<00:02:28.510> think<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.750> would

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
pretty long so I don't think you would

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.600 
pretty long so I don't think you would
have<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.170> worry<00:02:29.350> about<00:02:29.470> having<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.920> big<00:02:30.100> head<00:02:30.370> or

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
have to worry about having a big head or

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.240 
have to worry about having a big head or
whatnot<00:02:30.960> so<00:02:31.960> let's<00:02:32.290> actually<00:02:32.470> put<00:02:32.920> these<00:02:33.100> on

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
whatnot so let's actually put these on

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.560 
whatnot so let's actually put these on
the<00:02:33.340> ear<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.580> see<00:02:33.910> how<00:02:33.940> they<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.360> actually

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
the ear and see how they so I actually

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.900 
the ear and see how they so I actually
have<00:02:35.020> them<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.440> my<00:02:35.710> head<00:02:35.920> right<00:02:36.130> now<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.550> I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
have them on my head right now and I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.280 
have them on my head right now and I
don't<00:02:36.940> really<00:02:37.360> need<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.630> show<00:02:37.870> them<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.200> you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
don't really need to show them to you

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.260 
don't really need to show them to you
because<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.980> fit<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.490> like<00:02:39.640> any<00:02:40.000> normal

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
because they fit just like any normal

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.750 
because they fit just like any normal
headphones<00:02:40.840> they<00:02:41.650> actually<00:02:41.920> are<00:02:42.310> exactly

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
headphones they actually are exactly

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.520 
headphones they actually are exactly
like<00:02:42.880> normal<00:02:43.690> headphones<00:02:44.020> except<00:02:44.410> you

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
like normal headphones except you

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.340 
like normal headphones except you
wouldn't<00:02:44.830> have<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.610> third<00:02:46.180> or<00:02:46.450> second<00:02:47.230> wire

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
wouldn't have a third or second wire

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.410 
wouldn't have a third or second wire
going<00:02:47.950> down<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.430> your<00:02:48.580> iPhone<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.150> would<00:02:49.300> be

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
going down to your iPhone and would be

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.090 
going down to your iPhone and would be
Bluetooth<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:50.800> cool<00:02:51.040> because

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
Bluetooth and it's really cool because

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.010 
Bluetooth and it's really cool because
it<00:02:51.370> kind<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.550> feels<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.910> mask<00:02:52.300> because<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
it kind of feels like a mask because the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.780 
it kind of feels like a mask because the
wire<00:02:53.200> actually<00:02:53.650> goes<00:02:53.800> under<00:02:54.190> your<00:02:54.340> chin<00:02:54.580> or

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
wire actually goes under your chin or

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.430 
wire actually goes under your chin or
behind<00:02:55.420> your<00:02:55.630> head<00:02:55.780> whichever<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.320> prefer

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
behind your head whichever you prefer

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.610 
behind your head whichever you prefer
and<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:58.450> feels<00:02:58.510> very<00:02:58.960> nice<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.470> actually

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
and it feels very nice and it actually

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.320 
and it feels very nice and it actually
blocks<00:02:59.950> out<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.430> lot<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.820> sound<00:03:01.060> so

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
blocks out a lot of the sound so

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.410 
blocks out a lot of the sound so
actually<00:03:01.870> as<00:03:02.020> I'm<00:03:02.680> talking<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.150> little

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
actually as I'm talking it's a little

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.120 
actually as I'm talking it's a little
bit<00:03:04.510> hard<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.810> hear<00:03:05.050> myself<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> can't<00:03:05.920> tell

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
bit hard to hear myself so I can't tell

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.220 
bit hard to hear myself so I can't tell
exactly<00:03:06.280> how<00:03:06.610> loud<00:03:06.910> I'm<00:03:07.060> talking<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.960> it<00:03:08.050> does

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
exactly how loud I'm talking so it does

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.690 
exactly how loud I'm talking so it does
block<00:03:08.470> out<00:03:08.650> noise<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.250> they're<00:03:09.370> actually

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
block out noise and they're actually

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.580 
block out noise and they're actually
really<00:03:09.730> comfortable<00:03:10.180> thus<00:03:10.660> far<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.140> can

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
really comfortable thus far I can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.470 
really comfortable thus far I can
picture<00:03:11.920> myself<00:03:12.160> wearing<00:03:12.580> these<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:13.180> lot

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
picture myself wearing these a lot

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.140 
picture myself wearing these a lot
they're<00:03:14.260> very<00:03:14.470> comfortable<00:03:14.800> they<00:03:15.580> feel<00:03:15.880> very

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150

like<00:03:47.860> these<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.280> far<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:48.640> HP<00:03:49.030> voice<00:03:49.240> is<00:03:49.480> very

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
like these so far the HP voice is very

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.920 
like these so far the HP voice is very
very<00:03:50.110> nice<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.800> really<00:03:51.640> like<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.120> design<00:03:52.270> and

the<00:03:53.220> overall<00:03:54.220> feel<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.940> look<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.450> I<00:03:55.930> think

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
the overall feel and look and I think

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.240 
the overall feel and look and I think
it's<00:03:56.230> really<00:03:56.410> cool<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.800> can<00:03:57.100> actually

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
it's really cool that you can actually

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.250 
it's really cool that you can actually
get<00:03:57.520> them<00:03:57.730> in<00:03:57.850> different<00:03:58.000> colors<00:03:58.480> they're

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
get them in different colors they're

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.080 
get them in different colors they're
really<00:03:59.650> really<00:03:59.770> nice<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.280> sporty<00:04:00.700> headphones

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
really really nice and sporty headphones

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.070 
really really nice and sporty headphones
but<00:04:01.720> like<00:04:01.870> i<00:04:01.990> said<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:02.410> base<00:04:02.650> does<00:04:03.160> lack<00:04:03.550> and

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
but like i said the base does lack and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.870 
but like i said the base does lack and
it<00:04:05.080> is<00:04:05.770> a<00:04:05.800> little<00:04:06.010> bit<00:04:06.190> disappointing<00:04:06.730> because

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
it is a little bit disappointing because

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.610 
it is a little bit disappointing because
i<00:04:07.090> really<00:04:07.330> do<00:04:07.450> like<00:04:07.600> bass<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.200> there's<00:04:08.350> not

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
i really do like bass and there's not

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.460 
i really do like bass and there's not
much<00:04:09.160> bass<00:04:09.459> in<00:04:09.730> these<00:04:09.880> headphones<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.989> be<00:04:11.110> one

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
much bass in these headphones to be one

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.250 
much bass in these headphones to be one
hundred<00:04:11.590> percent<00:04:11.830> honest<00:04:12.520> there's<00:04:12.790> really

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
hundred percent honest there's really

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.289 
hundred percent honest there's really
they<00:04:14.260> sound<00:04:14.530> just<00:04:14.680> like<00:04:14.890> standard<00:04:15.700> headphones

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
they sound just like standard headphones

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.440 
they sound just like standard headphones
with<00:04:16.900> with<00:04:17.350> more<00:04:17.620> like<00:04:17.830> clarity<00:04:18.790> i<00:04:18.910> should<00:04:19.239> say

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
with with more like clarity i should say

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.530 
with with more like clarity i should say
and<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.200> bluetooth<00:04:20.560> 4.0<00:04:21.100> works<00:04:21.400> very<00:04:21.700> well<00:04:21.820> so

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
and the bluetooth 4.0 works very well so

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.960 
and the bluetooth 4.0 works very well so
it<00:04:22.660> has<00:04:22.720> HD<00:04:23.260> voice<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.860> think<00:04:24.430> it's<00:04:24.580> missing

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
it has HD voice I think it's missing

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.890 
it has HD voice I think it's missing
like<00:04:25.120> HD

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
like HD

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.350 
like HD
area<00:04:26.139> or<00:04:26.259> HD<00:04:26.949> base<00:04:27.190> just<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.699> make<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.000> sound<00:04:28.240> a

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
area or HD base just to make it sound a

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.659 
area or HD base just to make it sound a
little<00:04:28.479> better<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:29.650> think<00:04:30.070> if<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.280> had<00:04:30.460> those

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
little better I think if it had those

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.300 
little better I think if it had those
features<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.360> would<00:04:31.509> just<00:04:31.690> be<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:32.199> total<00:04:33.100> total

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
features it would just be a total total

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.909 
features it would just be a total total
amazing<00:04:33.910> by<00:04:34.060> but<00:04:34.870> overall<00:04:35.199> they're<00:04:35.500> very<00:04:35.710> nice

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
amazing by but overall they're very nice

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.770 
amazing by but overall they're very nice
there<00:04:36.220> have<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.460> 12<00:04:36.789> month<00:04:36.970> warranty<00:04:37.060> on<00:04:37.600> them

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
there have a 12 month warranty on them

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.540
