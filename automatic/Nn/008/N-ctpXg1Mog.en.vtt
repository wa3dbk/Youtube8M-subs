00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.709 
somebody tries to get in the fight it's
just<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.260> save<00:00:50.469> yourself<00:00:51.389> sometimes<00:00:52.389> I<00:00:52.510> have<00:00:52.690> a

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
just to save yourself sometimes I have a

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.319 
just to save yourself sometimes I have a
habit<00:00:53.019> of<00:00:53.350> stopping<00:00:53.649> rolling<00:00:54.579> on<00:00:54.699> my<00:00:54.819> camera

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
so this is a constant record just kind

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.950 
so this is a constant record just kind
of<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:59.049> good<00:00:59.199> way<00:00:59.319> insurance<00:01:00.039> I<00:01:00.489> guess<00:01:00.960> but

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
of a good way insurance I guess but

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.070 
of a good way insurance I guess but
another<00:01:02.440> great<00:01:02.739> feature<00:01:02.949> with<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.399> GoPro<00:01:03.789> is
