guess<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.410> since<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.710> update<00:00:13.920> buckets

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
guess and since in this update buckets

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.849 
guess and since in this update buckets
are<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> lot<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.109> cool<00:00:16.529> things

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
are out you can do a lot of cool things

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.920 
are out you can do a lot of cool things
now<00:00:17.330> especially<00:00:18.330> Gardens<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.080> stuff<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.590> see

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
now especially Gardens and stuff so see

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.500 
now especially Gardens and stuff so see
so<00:00:22.760> make<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:23.910> elevator<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.539> requires<00:00:26.510> depends

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
so make an elevator it requires depends

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.310 
so make an elevator it requires depends
how<00:00:27.660> much<00:00:28.039> buckets<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.160> water<00:00:30.260> depends<00:00:31.260> how

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
how much buckets of water depends how

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.930 
how much buckets of water depends how
much<00:00:31.439> buckets<00:00:31.980> having<00:00:32.369> signs<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
much buckets having signs and and a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.920 
much buckets having signs and and a
block<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.590> adding<00:00:37.950> lots<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.550> blocks<00:00:38.930> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
block that adding lots of blocks that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.590 
block that adding lots of blocks that
you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:40.500> signs<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.120> which<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> basically

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
ladders so let's start like this I'm

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.450 
ladders so let's start like this I'm
gonna<00:00:52.320> start<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> structure<00:00:53.280> like

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
gonna start to make a structure like

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.689 
gonna start to make a structure like
this<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.199> side<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this you don't have to do this side you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.569 
this you don't have to do this side you
only<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.520> we're<00:00:59.520> gonna

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
only do this side here and we're gonna

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.680 
only do this side here and we're gonna
put<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.850> sign<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.570> bucket<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> water<00:01:01.670> sign<00:01:02.690> bucket

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
put a sign a bucket of water sign bucket

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
put a sign a bucket of water sign bucket
of<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:04.019> sign<00:01:04.470> button<00:01:04.710> water<00:01:05.010> keep<00:01:05.400> going

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
of water sign button water keep going

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.800 
of water sign button water keep going
and<00:01:07.580> that's<00:01:08.580> pretty<00:01:08.880> much<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and that's pretty much what you have to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
and that's pretty much what you have to
do<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> top<00:01:11.100> part<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:11.970> have

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
do and then the top part you just have

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.810 
do and then the top part you just have
to<00:01:12.150> put<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> sign<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
to put a sign here and there so that the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.719 
to put a sign here and there so that the
water<00:01:15.450> doesn't<00:01:15.720> spread<00:01:16.110> around<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:18.259> so

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
water doesn't spread around see you so

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.010 
water doesn't spread around see you so
that<00:01:20.729> word<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.270> taking<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> little<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:21.930> or

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
that word is just taking a little bit or

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.120 
that word is just taking a little bit or
you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.200> make<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.950> high<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
you can make it as high as you want and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.370 
you can make it as high as you want and
you'll<00:01:26.130> never<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.580> stairs<00:01:26.990> surgery<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.200> in

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you'll never do stairs surgery I'm in

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.109 
you'll never do stairs surgery I'm in
each<00:01:28.670> hole<00:01:29.840> there<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.909> nice

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
each hole there so that's pretty nice

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.080 
each hole there so that's pretty nice
and<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.710> other<00:01:34.979> side<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> elevator

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and in this other side of the elevator

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.620 
and in this other side of the elevator
it's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.049> way<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.680> back<00:01:38.189> down<00:01:38.700> super<00:01:39.329> fast

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it's a way to go back down super fast

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.679 
it's a way to go back down super fast
which<00:01:40.320> will<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.740> any<00:01:41.040> height<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.759> fall

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
which will be at any height you fall

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.330 
which will be at any height you fall
down<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.460> there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.729> bucket<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.060> water<00:01:45.210> here

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
down and there's a bucket of water here

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.450 
down and there's a bucket of water here
so<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:48.060> fall<00:01:48.509> damage<00:01:49.100> here's<00:01:50.100> another

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so you don't fall damage here's another

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.760 
so you don't fall damage here's another
type<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.759> elevator<00:01:51.329> that's<00:01:51.659> way<00:01:52.049> bigger<00:01:52.350> so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
type of elevator that's way bigger so

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.499 
type of elevator that's way bigger so
comes<00:01:52.979> big<00:01:53.280> house<00:01:53.490> item<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> East<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
comes big house item in the East is and

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
comes big house item in the East is and
so<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> same<00:01:58.350> thing<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:58.799> it's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so it's kind of the same thing but it's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.120 
so it's kind of the same thing but it's
more<00:01:59.219> Spacey<00:01:59.759> it's<00:02:00.180> fun<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.659> multiplayer

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
more Spacey it's fun for multiplayer

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
more Spacey it's fun for multiplayer
who's<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.460> friend<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.420> same
