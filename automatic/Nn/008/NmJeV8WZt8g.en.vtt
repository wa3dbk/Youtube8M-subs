monitoring<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> harddrive<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.470> i<00:01:13.740> end<00:01:14.220> up

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
monitoring for the harddrive so i end up

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
monitoring for the harddrive so i end up
always<00:01:14.670> forgetting<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.390> setting<00:01:15.689> it's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
always forgetting that one setting it's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510 
always forgetting that one setting it's
usually<00:01:15.990> buried<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.439> men<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.710> did<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
usually buried in some men you did that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
usually buried in some men you did that
found<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.119> nailed<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> also<00:01:19.229> just

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
found it nailed it and then I also just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.830 
found it nailed it and then I also just
decided<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> start<00:01:20.520> looking<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.330> files<00:01:21.689> i

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
decided to start looking at what files i

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
decided to start looking at what files i
was<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.080> storing<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> device

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
was actually storing on the device

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.320 
was actually storing on the device
compared<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> what's<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.610> mine<00:01:23.820> ass<00:01:24.000> that's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
compared to what's on mine ass that's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
compared to what's on mine ass that's
connected<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.780> my<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.650> house<00:01:25.770> anyway<00:01:26.040> the

connected in my in the house anyway the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.620 
connected in my in the house anyway the
network<00:01:26.460> attached<00:01:26.729> storage<00:01:26.850> device<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.570> i

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
network attached storage device that i

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
network attached storage device that i
use<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:28.020> my<00:01:28.140> movies<00:01:28.320> well<00:01:29.009> i<00:01:29.040> decided<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
use for all my movies well i decided to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.219 
use for all my movies well i decided to
get<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> audio<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.960> too<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
get all the audio off of that too and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.420 
get all the audio off of that too and
put<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.950> network<00:01:32.100> attached

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
put that back on the network attached

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.399 
put that back on the network attached
storage<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:33.000> well<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.509> well<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.200> have

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
storage as well so well actually have

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.200

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
went with even less storage then i ended

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.179 
went with even less storage then i ended
up<00:01:39.990> putting<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.770> short<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> things

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
batteries were low it would detect for

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.570 
batteries were low it would detect for
the<00:03:08.080> handshaking<00:03:08.710> of<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.190> two<00:03:09.310> components

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
the handshaking of the two components

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.730 
the handshaking of the two components
but<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.300> wouldn't<00:03:10.540> complete<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.020> until<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> put

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
but it wouldn't complete it until I put

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.140 
but it wouldn't complete it until I put
new<00:03:11.890> batteries<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.610> drove<00:03:12.940> me<00:03:12.970> I

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
new batteries in it and that drove me I

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.850 
new batteries in it and that drove me I

thing and it saves a lot of problems so
good<00:03:24.850> call<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.180> think<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.450> SSD<00:03:25.840> though<00:03:26.020> for

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
good call I think the SSD though for

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.010 
good call I think the SSD though for
just<00:03:26.650> random<00:03:27.250> access<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.970> usually<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.840> boot

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
just random access and usually the boot

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.660 
just random access and usually the boot
up<00:03:29.170> process<00:03:29.200> which<00:03:29.830> once<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.340> running<00:03:30.610> I

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
up process which once it's running I

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.400 
up process which once it's running I
just<00:03:30.820> leave<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.000> running<00:03:31.120> but<00:03:31.300> forever<00:03:31.870> that'd

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
just leave it running but forever that'd

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
just leave it running but forever that'd
be<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.620> next<00:03:32.830> little<00:03:32.920> thing<00:03:33.130> baby<00:03:33.280> i<00:03:33.370> don't
