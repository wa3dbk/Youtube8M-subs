crucify<00:02:43.040> we're<00:02:43.189> talking<00:02:43.459> about<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.849> know

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
crucify we're talking about it you know

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.149 
crucify we're talking about it you know
a<00:02:44.450> lot<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:44.989> times<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.439> find<00:02:45.650> we<00:02:45.829> have<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.950> lot<00:02:46.129> of

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
a lot of times we find we have a lot of

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.339 
a lot of times we find we have a lot of
advantage<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.730> being<00:02:46.879> of<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> race<00:02:47.360> because

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
advantage of being of the race because

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.420 
advantage of being of the race because
the<00:02:48.590> speeds<00:02:48.829> really<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.129> yeah<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.510> know

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
the speeds really I yeah and you know

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.699 
the speeds really I yeah and you know
speeds<00:02:52.430> really<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.849> factor<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.420> beginning<00:02:53.870> but

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
speeds really a factor the beginning but

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.720 
speeds really a factor the beginning but
towards<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.010> end<00:02:55.069> of<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.250> race<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.549> more

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
towards the end of the race it's more

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.119 
towards the end of the race it's more
just<00:02:55.760> endurance<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.840> muscle<00:02:57.739> strength<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
just endurance and muscle strength and

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.440 
just endurance and muscle strength and
that<00:02:58.159> sort<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.489> things<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.790> you'll<00:02:59.420> find

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
that sort of things that you'll find

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.030 
that sort of things that you'll find
that<00:02:59.750> at<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.959> end<00:03:00.109> of<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.290> epic<00:03:00.590> people<00:03:00.859> stick

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
that at the end of the epic people stick

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.770 
that at the end of the epic people stick
together<00:03:01.190> more<00:03:01.549> excited<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.090> give<00:03:02.269> gaps<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.750> I

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
together more excited to give gaps and I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.500 
together more excited to give gaps and I
think<00:03:03.049> having<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.560> stage<00:03:03.859> training<00:03:04.640> where

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
think having that stage training where

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.880 
think having that stage training where
there<00:03:05.720> won't<00:03:05.840> be<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.049> bunch<00:03:06.319> riding<00:03:06.530> is

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
there won't be a bunch riding is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.259 
there won't be a bunch riding is
actually<00:03:07.280> against<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.549> clock<00:03:07.760> on<00:03:07.940> your<00:03:08.000> only

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
actually against the clock on your only

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.140 
actually against the clock on your only
can<00:03:09.200> can<00:03:09.620> be<00:03:09.769> really<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.370> interesting<00:03:10.879> i

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
can can be really really interesting i

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.680 
can can be really really interesting i
think<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:12.099> lot<00:03:13.099> of<00:03:13.129> times<00:03:13.459> let's<00:03:13.879> can<00:03:14.090> we<00:03:14.120> opened

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
think a lot of times let's can we opened

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.619 
think a lot of times let's can we opened
up<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.959> message<00:03:15.859> so<00:03:16.609> possibly<00:03:16.940> an<00:03:17.060> opportunity

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
up a message so possibly an opportunity

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.319 
up a message so possibly an opportunity
guilty<00:03:18.349> yeah<00:03:18.889> i<00:03:18.950> mean<00:03:19.099> definitely<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:20.030> if<00:03:20.150> you

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
guilty yeah i mean definitely and if you

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.970 
guilty yeah i mean definitely and if you
look<00:03:20.480> at<00:03:20.599> stages<00:03:21.139> you<00:03:21.349> know<00:03:21.440> we<00:03:21.590> go<00:03:21.709> into<00:03:21.829> the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
look at stages you know we go into the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.670 
look at stages you know we go into the
race<00:03:22.129> and<00:03:22.159> we<00:03:22.370> look<00:03:22.489> at<00:03:22.579> stages<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.620> parts<00:03:24.620> of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
race and we look at stages and parts of

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.530 
race and we look at stages and parts of
the<00:03:24.799> stages<00:03:25.069> which<00:03:25.370> are<00:03:25.549> key<00:03:25.790> for<00:03:26.060> us<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.450> we

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the stages which are key for us and we

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.339 
the stages which are key for us and we
can<00:03:26.900> hopefully<00:03:27.500> make<00:03:27.980> some<00:03:29.079> obvious<00:03:30.079> in<00:03:30.200> that

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
can hopefully make some obvious in that

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.339 
can hopefully make some obvious in that
stage<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.920> perfect<00:03:31.609> i<00:03:32.269> think<00:03:32.569> a<00:03:32.629> lot<00:03:32.659> of<00:03:32.840> teams

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
stage is perfect i think a lot of teams

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.500 
stage is perfect i think a lot of teams
or<00:03:33.650> preparing<00:03:34.280> specifically<00:03:34.879> for<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.150> stage

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
or preparing specifically for that stage

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.770 
or preparing specifically for that stage
as<00:03:35.780> i<00:03:35.930> did<00:03:36.049> for<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.260> prohibition<00:03:36.440> yes

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
as i did for the prohibition yes

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.210 
as i did for the prohibition yes
although<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:38.989> would<00:03:39.709> have<00:03:39.859> being<00:03:40.040> on<00:03:40.129> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
although this would have being on the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.920 
although this would have being on the
stage<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.790> guys<00:03:40.910> in<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.120> way<00:03:41.329> more<00:03:41.569> fatigued

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
stage the guys in the way more fatigued

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.300 
stage the guys in the way more fatigued
