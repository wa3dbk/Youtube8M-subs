 much to modify that when finished and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.450
 Installation I leave this box 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.140
 marked to perform linen the show 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 linux live ufpe heitor and do finish 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.060
 here no one in the area would finish that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.640
 it will already run the program 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.640
 for us here I'm going to do first 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 thing I'm going to select my pen drive 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.350
 that I had already created a pendrive 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.350
 car drinking and linux with it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 so I'll leave it here selected 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.049
 my pen drive in this case here is the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.159
 second thing is to choose the source from where 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.579
 You're bringing that image of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.009
 to a linen you receive you will do the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.099
 download or you will use in a 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.620
 isuzu most of the cases you go 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.680
 download linux for an iso or me 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.540
 I will not use any iso here I 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.730
 I'll come here, my accountant will wrap 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.580
 any and all here is a system 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.640
 I have left here 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:34.769
 find her here let's try for example 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.049
 a ghetto 13.10 is 64 bits and there it is 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.200
 when you choose the font that it will 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.910
 check the file know 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.160
 probably it will give a message 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.129
 What are you talking about? What's the system? 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.579
 if he does not know that he is not 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.400
 if he will tell you what style he has 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.730
 is not in compatibility list 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.239
 but this message that for me did not 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.230
 no difference because the works 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.340
 same way 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.269
 The other thing I do here is hand. 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.250
 it to kill the pendrive for fat32 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.549
 new says it ensures that the pen drive does not 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.669
 have data remember you can make 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.750
 you want is even if you have data 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:25.410
 your pen drive does not affect yyyy 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.959
 software, and then I click on 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.669
 start here in this zinho radius here 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.980
 The message speaks asking me if I have 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:38.459
 sure you want to format the truth I 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.560
 I'll give it okay here and then it'll make a 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.169
 process here that should lead and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.750
 depending on the size of the iso you 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:49.019
 puts the idea can take up to 10 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.079
 A few minutes then we'll wait. 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.319
 this one is good to finish here linux 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.859
 live usb creator creating my cd my pen 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.500
 Ubuntu's potable drive there and it already 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.680

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.410
 what about linux to and the spirit now is 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.359

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.750
 your computer to boot from the 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.660
 pen drive in the case there and that's it 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.870
 to snap 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.320
