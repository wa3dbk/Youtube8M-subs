vibrate<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.630> volume<00:02:10.110> buttons<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.590> good<00:02:10.890> but

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
vibrate and volume buttons are good but

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.680 
vibrate and volume buttons are good but
the<00:02:11.790> problem<00:02:12.180> comes<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.730> form<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> top

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the problem comes in the form of the top

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.290 
the problem comes in the form of the top
portion<00:02:15.959> of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
portion of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.360

okay<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.020> can<00:02:17.140> see<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.800> phone<00:02:18.010> doesn't

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
okay so as you can see the phone doesn't

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.820 
okay so as you can see the phone doesn't
jiggle<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.240> not<00:02:19.390> loose<00:02:19.690> nothing's<00:02:20.410> going<00:02:20.710> on

jiggle it's not loose nothing's going on

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.220 
jiggle it's not loose nothing's going on
with<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.190> whatsoever<00:02:21.460> but<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.480> seems<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.020> have

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
with it whatsoever but it seems to have

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.450 
with it whatsoever but it seems to have
this<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.310> would<00:02:25.090> say<00:02:25.330> it's<00:02:25.510> approximately<00:02:26.500> four

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
this I would say it's approximately four

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.260 
this I would say it's approximately four
to<00:02:27.490> five<00:02:27.790> millimeters<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:29.910> extra<00:02:30.910> case

to five millimeters of extra case
there's<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:32.050> no<00:02:32.260> other<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.590> say<00:02:32.920> it

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
there's really no other way to say it

happens<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.430> when<00:02:42.700> i<00:02:42.730> tried<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.330> press<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
happens is when i tried to press the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.360 
happens is when i tried to press the
standby<00:02:44.110> wakey<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.590> felt<00:02:44.770> like<00:02:44.890> something<00:02:45.100> was

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
standby wakey it felt like something was

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.160 
standby wakey it felt like something was
in<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.700> way<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.120> when<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.300> looked<00:02:46.540> at<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
in the way and when I looked at it it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.100 
in the way and when I looked at it it
basically<00:02:47.620> created<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.520> well<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:49.240> back<00:02:49.690> well

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
basically created a well a back well

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.170 
basically created a well a back well
they<00:02:50.710> made<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.010> very<00:02:51.190> difficult<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.880> press<00:02:52.150> a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
they made it very difficult to press a

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.340 
they made it very difficult to press a
standard<00:02:52.600> by<00:02:53.040> weight<00:02:54.040> key<00:02:54.450> easily<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:56.140> not

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
standard by weight key easily was not

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.710 
standard by weight key easily was not
sure<00:02:56.620> why<00:02:57.100> they<00:02:57.340> would<00:02:57.490> have<00:02:57.610> done<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.970> why

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
sure why they would have done that why

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.630 
sure why they would have done that why
it<00:02:58.780> can't<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.710> been<00:03:00.040> flushed<00:03:00.430> I

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
it can't have just been flushed I

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.890 
it can't have just been flushed I
believe<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.030> has<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.300> do<00:03:01.420> with<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.630> thickness

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
believe it has to do with the thickness

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.980 
believe it has to do with the thickness
of<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.350> edges<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:03.100> snap<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.490> case<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.720> really

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
of the edges the snap on case but really

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.900 
of the edges the snap on case but really
that<00:03:05.170> was<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.350> only<00:03:05.470> issue<00:03:05.980> they<00:03:06.700> were<00:03:06.820> able

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
that was the only issue they were able

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.180 
that was the only issue they were able

that's<00:03:20.560> not<00:03:20.680> for<00:03:20.860> review<00:03:21.130> but<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.790> is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
that's not for review but this is

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.600 
that's not for review but this is
probably<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.590> permanent<00:03:23.590> addition<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.520> this

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
probably a permanent addition to this

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.280 
probably a permanent addition to this
particular<00:03:24.850> design<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.630> case<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:26.080> just

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
particular design of the case it just

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.920 
particular design of the case it just
has<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.500> deeper<00:03:27.190> well<00:03:27.489> on<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.820> top<00:03:28.060> not<00:03:28.900> a

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
has that deeper well on the top not a

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.630 
has that deeper well on the top not a
huge<00:03:29.230> fan<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.830> i'm<00:03:30.040> wishing<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.550> either

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
huge fan of that i'm wishing to either

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.400 
huge fan of that i'm wishing to either
carve<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.239> out<00:03:31.480> or<00:03:31.660> made<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> recessed

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
carve this out or made a recessed

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.640 
carve this out or made a recessed
section<00:03:32.890> right<00:03:33.100> here<00:03:33.239> for<00:03:34.350> accessibility<00:03:35.350> of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
section right here for accessibility of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.040 
section right here for accessibility of
the<00:03:35.709> standby<00:03:36.100> wakey<00:03:36.810> probably<00:03:37.810> would<00:03:37.959> have

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
the standby wakey probably would have

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.750 
the standby wakey probably would have
made<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.440> back<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.950> little<00:03:39.190> bit<00:03:39.370> shorter<00:03:40.360> or

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
made the back a little bit shorter or

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.090 
made the back a little bit shorter or
not<00:03:42.760> continuous<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.780> didn't<00:03:44.050> look<00:03:44.200> very<00:03:44.440> it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
not continuous so it didn't look very it

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.650 
not continuous so it didn't look very it
won't<00:03:45.280> look<00:03:45.489> very<00:03:45.550> good<00:03:45.850> with<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.120> recessed

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
won't look very good with that recessed

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.930 
won't look very good with that recessed
portion<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.620> what<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.580> should<00:03:48.850> have

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
portion so what really should have

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.160 
portion so what really should have
happened<00:03:49.120> was<00:03:49.480> they<00:03:49.630> should<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:49.900> made<00:03:50.020> this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
happened was they should have made this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.510 
happened was they should have made this
top<00:03:50.380> portion<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.709> little<00:03:50.890> bit<00:03:50.980> thinner<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.430> you

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
top portion a little bit thinner so you

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.240 
top portion a little bit thinner so you
didn't<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:51.880> five<00:03:52.390> millimeters<00:03:53.020> of

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
didn't have that five millimeters of

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.910 
didn't have that five millimeters of
extra<00:03:54.250> case<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.660> get<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.080> way<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.320> pressing

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
extra case to get in the way of pressing

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.800 
extra case to get in the way of pressing
a<00:03:57.010> standby<00:03:57.310> wakey<00:03:57.790> but<00:03:58.390> other<00:03:58.540> than<00:03:58.630> that

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
a standby wakey but other than that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.990 
a standby wakey but other than that
feels<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.830> quality<00:04:00.160> is<00:04:00.220> nice<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.820> leather

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000
