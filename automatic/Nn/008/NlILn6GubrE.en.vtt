00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
was still here when we arrived back and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419 
was still here when we arrived back and
she<00:00:27.930> stayed<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.650> five<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.369> hours

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.100 
she stayed for like five more hours
after<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.529> had<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.980> no<00:00:36.110> privacy

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
after that so I had like no privacy

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.190 
after that so I had like no privacy
because<00:00:37.680> everyone<00:00:38.190> was<00:00:38.510> walking<00:00:39.510> everywhere

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
because everyone was walking everywhere

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.889
