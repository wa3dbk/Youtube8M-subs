00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.980 
beast machine tutorial series today
we're<00:00:09.059> going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.300> taking<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.660> look<00:00:09.780> at<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
we're going to be taking a look at the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.749 
we're going to be taking a look at the
pattern<00:00:10.290> storage<00:00:10.650> block<00:00:11.190> from

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
pattern storage block from

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.060 
pattern storage block from
industrialcraft<00:00:12.389> too<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.769> machine

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
industrialcraft too so this machine

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.799 
industrialcraft too so this machine
works<00:00:14.280> hand-in-hand<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.030> replicator<00:00:15.599> and

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
works hand-in-hand with a replicator and

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.800 
works hand-in-hand with a replicator and
a<00:00:15.870> scanner<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.470> actually<00:00:17.430> store<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
a scanner to actually store the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.689 
a scanner to actually store the
different<00:00:18.810> types<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.260> recipes<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.460> have

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
different types of recipes that you have

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.480 
different types of recipes that you have
for<00:00:21.420> your<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.130> user<00:00:23.250> interface

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
for your you you so the user interface

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370 
for your you you so the user interface
for<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.630> confusing<00:00:24.840> I've

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
for this is a little confusing I've

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.529 
for this is a little confusing I've
noticed<00:00:25.789> here<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> actual

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
noticed here is going to be the actual

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.540 
noticed here is going to be the actual
item<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> look<00:00:29.429> at

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
item so if we actually take a look at

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.999 
item so if we actually take a look at
one<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.660> import<00:00:31.109> one<00:00:31.320> from<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> crystal

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
one if we import one from a crystal

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.319 
one if we import one from a crystal
that's<00:00:32.250> already<00:00:33.320> done<00:00:34.460> like<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.149> click

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that's already done like so we can click

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.889 
that's already done like so we can click
save<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.500> save<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.129> crystal<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.809> if

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
save and save it to this crystal and if

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.209 
save and save it to this crystal and if
we<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.110> ahead<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.410> pop<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.070> can

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
we go ahead and pop that in there we can

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.280 
we go ahead and pop that in there we can
import<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.730> from<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> crystal<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.570> then

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
import it from the crystal and then

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.900 
import it from the crystal and then
there<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.399> iridium

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
there you can see that we have iridium

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.750 
there you can see that we have iridium
or<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> name<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.860> UU<00:00:47.190> matter<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
or is the name the UU matter is going to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.479 
or is the name the UU matter is going to
take<00:00:47.910> 22<00:00:48.329> buckets<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> power<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
take 22 buckets and then the power and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.459 
take 22 buckets and then the power and
EU<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.570> take<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
EU is going to take I think that's a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.279 
EU is going to take I think that's a
million<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.750> that's<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> user

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
million so that's kind of the user

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.600 
million so that's kind of the user
interface<00:00:55.410> forward<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.489> actually

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
interface forward you got to actually

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
interface forward you got to actually
have<00:00:56.910> some<00:00:57.120> stuff<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> kind

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
have some stuff in there for it to kind

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.459 
have some stuff in there for it to kind
of<00:00:58.770> make<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.129> sense<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.809> recipe<00:01:01.320> for

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of make some sense so the recipe for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.990 
of make some sense so the recipe for
this<00:01:01.530> machine<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.980> three<00:01:02.219> reinforced<00:01:02.789> stone

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this machine is three reinforced stone

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
this machine is three reinforced stone
now<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.019> from<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.350> CF<00:01:04.650> sprayer<00:01:04.890> now

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
now you get this from a CF sprayer now

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
now you get this from a CF sprayer now
you<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.420> iron<00:01:06.689> scaffolding

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you have to use some iron scaffolding

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
you have to use some iron scaffolding
and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:08.040> spray<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.460> CF<00:01:08.970> foam<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> CF

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and then spray the CF foam with the CF

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.890 
and then spray the CF foam with the CF
sprayer<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.560> back<00:01:10.830> back<00:01:11.100> onto<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:12.240> iron

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
sprayer and back back onto the iron

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.420 
sprayer and back back onto the iron
scaffolding<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.950> reinforced

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
scaffolding to actually get reinforced

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.330 
scaffolding to actually get reinforced
stone<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.850> there's<00:01:15.479> no<00:01:15.600> recipe<00:01:15.810> anymore<00:01:16.409> it's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
stone now there's no recipe anymore it's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.920 
stone now there's no recipe anymore it's
two<00:01:17.549> crystal<00:01:17.939> memories<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.570> don't<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
two crystal memories which don't have a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
two crystal memories which don't have a
recipe<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.470> well<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> that's<00:01:20.280> because<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
recipe as well and that's because you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.219 
recipe as well and that's because you
have<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.850> make<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> raw<00:01:21.330> memory<00:01:21.720> first<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
have to make the raw memory first and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
have to make the raw memory first and
then<00:01:22.350> cook<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.830> advanced<00:01:23.700> machine<00:01:24.060> casing

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
then cook it an advanced machine casing

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
then cook it an advanced machine casing
advanced<00:01:24.840> circuit<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.680> mining<00:01:26.040> lasers

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
advanced circuit and into mining lasers

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
advanced circuit and into mining lasers
so<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.299> machine<00:01:27.479> does<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.170> require<00:01:28.439> power

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so this machine does not require power

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.140 
so this machine does not require power
much<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.400> other<00:01:29.520> two<00:01:29.700> machines<00:01:30.030> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
much like the other two machines it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 
much like the other two machines it
works<00:01:30.329> very<00:01:30.479> closely<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.189> just

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
works very closely with so here I just

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.569 
works very closely with so here I just
have<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:33.140> solar<00:01:34.140> panel<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.680> MFE<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
have a solar panel and MFE and then a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.060 
have a solar panel and MFE and then a
scanner<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.509> whenever<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.829> put

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
scanner so whenever I would actually put

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.360 
scanner so whenever I would actually put
so<00:01:38.340> let's<00:01:38.520> say<00:01:38.729> some<00:01:39.000> iridium<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.600> here

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
so let's say some iridium in here

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.970 
so let's say some iridium in here
if<00:01:42.370> i<00:01:42.550> spelt<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.030> right<00:01:43.150> there<00:01:44.050> we<00:01:44.170> go<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:44.830> if<00:01:44.890> i

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
if i spelt it right there we go so if i

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.920 
if i spelt it right there we go so if i
threw<00:01:45.220> this<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.700> scanner<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.300> then

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
threw this in the scanner and then

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.210 
threw this in the scanner and then
whenever<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.380> actually<00:01:47.770> give<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.040> some

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
whenever you actually give it some

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.200 
whenever you actually give it some
crystal<00:01:48.640> memory<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:51.040> right<00:01:51.250> here<00:01:51.550> whenever

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
crystal memory like right here whenever

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.760 
crystal memory like right here whenever
it<00:01:52.480> gets<00:01:52.600> finished<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:53.110> takes<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.410> while<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:53.710> i'm

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
it gets finished it takes a while so i'm

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.810 
it gets finished it takes a while so i'm
not<00:01:53.860> going<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.070> wait<00:01:54.250> on<00:01:54.370> it<00:01:54.400> will<00:01:54.640> go<00:01:54.730> over

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
not going to wait on it will go over

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.400 
not going to wait on it will go over
this<00:01:54.970> in<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.240> scanner<00:01:55.540> but<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.200> will<00:01:56.320> actually

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
this in the scanner but it will actually

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.660 
this in the scanner but it will actually
save<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.770> in<00:01:56.950> there<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.130> then<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:57.490> take

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
save it in there and then you can take

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.220 
save it in there and then you can take
that<00:01:57.700> disk<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:58.720> put<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.020> into<00:01:59.140> the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
that disk and then put it into the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.230 
that disk and then put it into the
pattern<00:01:59.470> storage<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.850> will<00:02:01.000> work

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
pattern storage and it will work

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.510 
pattern storage and it will work
perfectly<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.070> going<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.280> be<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:03.490> for

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
perfectly so that is going to be it for

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.250 
perfectly so that is going to be it for
