00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.050 
new one and just log into that one and
replace<00:01:04.460> hopefully<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.700> replace<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:08.060> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
recommend getting one unless you have a

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.500 
recommend getting one unless you have a
proper<00:03:17.430> farming<00:03:17.790> character<00:03:18.349> as<00:03:19.349> their<00:03:20.510> armor

the<00:03:22.200> defense<00:03:22.590> for<00:03:23.010> their<00:03:23.130> range<00:03:23.459> isn't<00:03:23.880> very

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
the defense for their range isn't very

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.390 
the defense for their range isn't very
even<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:25.319> should<00:03:25.560> either<00:03:25.680> have<00:03:25.859> more<00:03:26.190> range

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
even they should either have more range

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.800 
even they should either have more range
or<00:03:26.930> more<00:03:27.930> defense<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.349> my<00:03:28.440> opinion<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:29.810> they

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
or more defense in my opinion but they

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.259 
or more defense in my opinion but they

on you and kill you immediately so I

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.290 
on you and kill you immediately so I
recommend<00:04:50.470> doing<00:04:50.890> these<00:04:51.100> brief<00:04:51.520> runnings<00:04:52.000> and

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
recommend doing these brief runnings and

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.380 
recommend doing these brief runnings and
killing<00:04:52.570> them<00:04:52.600> that<00:04:52.840> way<00:04:54.000> then<00:04:55.000> there's<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
killing them that way then there's the

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.470 
killing them that way then there's the
sprite<00:04:55.780> God<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.680> sprite<00:04:57.040> guard<00:04:57.340> will<00:04:58.090> shoot

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
sprite God the sprite guard will shoot

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.810 
sprite God the sprite guard will shoot
and<00:04:58.900> then<00:04:59.140> you<00:04:59.380> can<00:04:59.560> dodge<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.950> the<00:04:59.980> side<00:05:00.250> it

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
and then you can dodge to the side it

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.490 
and then you can dodge to the side it
makes<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.150> quite<00:05:01.330> an<00:05:01.480> easy<00:05:01.600> modbus<00:05:02.140> you<00:05:02.320> can

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
makes it quite an easy modbus you can

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.110 
makes it quite an easy modbus you can
see<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.890> can<00:05:03.160> do<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.310> lot<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.550> damage<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.030> the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
see it can do a lot of damage and the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.330 
see it can do a lot of damage and the
quieten<00:05:04.690> can<00:05:05.020> be<00:05:05.200> annoying<00:05:05.410> as<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.890> can't<00:05:06.130> use

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
quieten can be annoying as you can't use

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.180 
quieten can be annoying as you can't use
your<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.850> shuriken<00:05:07.810> on<00:05:07.960> them<00:05:08.140> then<00:05:08.979> lets
