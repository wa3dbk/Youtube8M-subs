00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Dear brothers and sisters 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.850
 in today's catechesis I talked about the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.020
 union of the sick 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.750
 it is the sacrament of God's compassion 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 with the suffering of man 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.600
 the parable of the Good Samaritan expresses 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.500
 the mystery that is celebrated in this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.040
 sacrament jesus approaches who suffers 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.119
 and comfort him with the oil of consolation 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.550
 and the wine of hope 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.020
 then he takes it to the inn that 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.020
 represents the church 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.050
 here to which Christ confides Jesus 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.680
 he taught his disciples to have his 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.080
 predilection for the sick and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.040
 needed and entrusted them with the task of 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.730
 serve them is a man by means of 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.730
 this sacrament 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:07.280
 the option of the sick helps us 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.940
 expand the look in front of the disease 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.200
 and know that we are not alone that the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.020
 priest and the Christian community 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.960
 they sustain the sick and those who suffer for 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.070
 that's important to always call the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.979
 priest when there is a sick 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.979
 it does not need to be serious that is 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.960
 dying to call him have such a way 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.690
 may the sacrament strengthen you 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.130

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.810
 of Christ in the disease that takes us 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.990
