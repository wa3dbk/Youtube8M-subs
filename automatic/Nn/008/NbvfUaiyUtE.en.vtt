00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
them is pretty common for an

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
them is pretty common for an
interception<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.070> other<00:00:26.250> which<00:00:26.849> was

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
actually a holding call I don't know if

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.740 
actually a holding call I don't know if
I<00:00:29.279> see<00:00:29.580> Miss<00:00:29.820> frequently<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.390> game<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
I see Miss frequently in the game is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
I see Miss frequently in the game is
actually<00:00:30.900> pretty<00:00:31.590> astonished<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.579> you

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
actually pretty astonished to see it you

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.760 
actually pretty astonished to see it you
basically<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> situation<00:00:33.360> where<00:00:33.840> Lincoln

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
basically have a situation where Lincoln

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.920 
basically have a situation where Lincoln
Bach<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:34.980> melton<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> situation

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
Bach and melton here get in a situation

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.049 
Bach and melton here get in a situation
it's<00:00:37.469> kind<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.739> hard<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> tell<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.520> because

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it's kind of hard to tell here because

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.600 
it's kind of hard to tell here because
the<00:00:39.300> play<00:00:39.540> obviously<00:00:39.750> doesn't<00:00:40.230> record

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
the play obviously doesn't record

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.830 
the play obviously doesn't record
pre-snap<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.390> mountain<00:00:42.719> was

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
pre-snap but you can see mountain was

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.990 
pre-snap but you can see mountain was
kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.170> already<00:00:43.260> moving<00:00:43.649> before<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
kind of already moving before and you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
kind of already moving before and you
can<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.360> Lincoln<00:00:45.780> Bach<00:00:45.960> gets<00:00:46.350> basically

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
can see the Lincoln Bach gets basically

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.330 
can see the Lincoln Bach gets basically
beat<00:00:47.480> right<00:00:48.480> underneath<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.230> look<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.250> what

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
beat right underneath and look at what

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910 
beat right underneath and look at what
he<00:00:50.460> does<00:00:50.640> he<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.690> kind<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.989> puts<00:00:52.230> himself<00:00:52.379> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
he does he just kind of puts himself in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.189 
he does he just kind of puts himself in
a<00:00:52.980> position<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.520> wrap<00:00:53.730> his<00:00:53.969> arms<00:00:54.180> around<00:00:54.570> him

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
a position to wrap his arms around him

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.260 
a position to wrap his arms around him
and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.129> drags<00:00:56.550> him<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.000> another

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and then just drags him down another

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.840 
and then just drags him down another
ground<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.410> immediately<00:00:58.949> drew<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> flag

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
ground and this immediately drew a flag

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.250 
ground and this immediately drew a flag
of<00:00:59.879> course<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.719> thought<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of course and I actually thought the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
of course and I actually thought the
flag<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.219> offside<00:01:02.640> because

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
flag was going to be for offside because

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.460 
flag was going to be for offside because
of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> speed<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> game<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.750> couldn't<00:01:04.170> tell

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
of the speed of the game I couldn't tell

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.070 
of the speed of the game I couldn't tell
that<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.220> game<00:01:05.400> didn't<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.659> Melton

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that the game didn't know that Melton

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.899 
that the game didn't know that Melton
had<00:01:07.229> went<00:01:07.470> off<00:01:07.590> sides<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.729> obviously

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
had went off sides but then obviously

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.730 
had went off sides but then obviously
after<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> play<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.960> back<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.439> see
