00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 today the chef offers a typical menu 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.600
 of the Sicilian culinary tradition e 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.059
 I'm talking about cous in Arabic cuisine 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.160
 cous that we will prepare today together with 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.590
 of vegetables and we will accompany it with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.780
 a very delicate yogurt-based sauce 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.609
 but you want to know a curiosity there 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 have you ever wondered why couscous is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.350
 a food that falls within the kitchen 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.029
 Arabic and in the Sicilian one la 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.039
 answer is very simple 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.710
 in the past our beautiful sicily was 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.599
 conquered by different populations 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 including the Arabs and it is really 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.800
 by the Arabs that the Sicilians knew 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.690
 different eating habits 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 and this is precisely the reason why 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.210
 couscous is a food that embraces 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.250
 both cultures and for those not yet 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
 knew the couscous is a food 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.079
 prepared with milled wheat semolina 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.210
 hard kneaded with water and followed ad 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.579
 a special treatment with steam 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.270
 assumes the characteristic of losa branches 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.680
 let's see together what we need 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 ingredients for 4 people 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 we have 200 g of precooked couscous 220 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.540
 milliliters of water 200 g of pepper 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.570
 red 200 g eggplant a few 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.720
 mint leaf 100 g of peas 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 then again salt preferably salt 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.400
 Himalayan rose a drop of oil 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.670
 extra virgin olive oil for the sauce of 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.700
 accompaniment instead we have 200 g of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.200
 Greek yogurt zero percent fat 2 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.640
 peaches and a few mint leaves 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.829
 let's start with the preparation of ours 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.560
 couscous in a small casserole we have 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.259
 put to boil water 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 now we can salt it and we can too 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.159
 aromatize if there is water with some 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.439
 mint leaves which then clearly 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.790
 we're going to take them off and mind 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.439
 will also recall the sauce of 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.030
 accompaniment 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.730
 now we can pour ours 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:05.360
 cous cous so 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:10.420
 maybe we mix them we see with the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:14.480
 spoon and turn off the heat 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.820
 cover with the lid and leave them on 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.010
 cous cous so that it absorbs all 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.080
 water in the meantime we prepare a 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.330
 evader 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.970
 then we cut into squares the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.970
 eggplant we also cut a 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.370
 diced red pepper and then i 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.920
 we have counted peas in water 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.230
 boiling slightly salty now 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.300
 let's pan-fry our own 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.820
 vegetables except the peas 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.130
 because they are already cooked so we will go to 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.780
 season them later in the 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:53.210
 pan pour some whipped oil 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:56.270
 of oil so and we pour eggplant la 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.430
 pan must already be very hot so 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:04.630
 a nice crust will also form 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.630
 golden we also pour the pepper 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:18.269
 perfect then we adjust salt and 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.730
 we keep a rather lively flame up 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.440
 then browning then 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.019
 when it will be well and browned ours 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.000
 way vegetable cubes lower the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.620
 flame to put the lid on so that 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.610
 even inside you can cook 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.640
 carefully 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.830
 clearly after 10 15 minutes of cooking 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.450
 the volume of our vegetables is 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.130
 decreased especially that of 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.260
 aubergines because they are rich in water 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.630
 now we can also add our own 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.720
 peas that need only to be 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.049
 a little flavored because precisely 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.170
 have already been cooked in water 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.170
 slightly salty 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.459
 let it flavor for a few minutes 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.459
 and then we go to assemble the couscous 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.430
 we broke our mind and time 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.200
 we can also go to flavor the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.790
 vegetables 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.739
 clearly if you don't like the middle 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.590
 you can replace it with parsley 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.060
 or of the basil as they profess as 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.459
 we can also control situations 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.680
 inside our couscous and that 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.960
 you see that it is absorbed perfectly 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.700
 all the water with a spoon we can 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.660
 going to shell rather 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:35.190
 so delicate and this is the result 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.889
 expect a while that the couscous will 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.660
 in short, absorb the sauce 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.970
 we prepare the sauce with vegetables 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.830
 accompaniment that I have already fixed 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.600
 an anti peach 2 lomi peaches if 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.820
 inside a becker 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.870
 now we can also pour yogurt 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.610
 Greek 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.979
 zero percent fat because of me 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.660
 like the contrast between the vegetables the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.849
 point now you know me then not 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.010
 I prefer to make this sauce 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.630
 a bit special a little sweet of 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.550
 accompaniment in our couscous 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.080
 we can also add to some 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.790
 mint leaf as well 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.590
 and now let's try our ad mixer 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:20.400
 dive and now let's go to assemble 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.590
 in fanciful solar colored dish 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.330
 perfumed nothing better than these four 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.880
 adjectives could describe the 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.740
 wonderful Sicilian cuisine and parer 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.320
 this dish embodies the expression 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.680
 best to bring out all these 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.250
 quality 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.250
 enjoy your meal
