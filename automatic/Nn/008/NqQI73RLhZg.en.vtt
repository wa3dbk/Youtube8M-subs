it<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.280> fluid<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.259> what<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> does<00:01:28.619> when<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
it was fluid and what it does when you

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.639 
it was fluid and what it does when you
pump<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.580> back<00:01:29.789> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> cylinder<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:31.170> pushes

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
pump the back of the cylinder it pushes

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.499 
pump the back of the cylinder it pushes
the<00:01:31.830> fluid<00:01:32.039> down<00:01:32.459> through<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.119> pushes<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the fluid down through and it pushes the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
the fluid down through and it pushes the
air<00:01:33.630> back<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.280> until<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:36.000> you're<00:01:36.270> getting

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
air back up and until all you're getting

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.400 
air back up and until all you're getting
is<00:01:36.690> straight<00:01:37.050> fluid<00:01:37.740> no<00:01:38.069> air<00:01:38.340> bubbles<00:01:39.410> but

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
is straight fluid no air bubbles but

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.460 
is straight fluid no air bubbles but
because<00:01:40.800> they<00:01:40.979> only<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.729> hose<00:01:42.470> I'm

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
got a tall bench bled next thing to do

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.809 
got a tall bench bled next thing to do
is<00:03:37.230> take<00:03:37.379> off<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.739> old<00:03:37.769> one<00:03:38.099> and<00:03:38.310> stick<00:03:38.640> this

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
is take off the old one and stick this

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.050 
is take off the old one and stick this
in<00:03:39.060> okay<00:03:39.390> now<00:03:40.159> there<00:03:41.159> you<00:03:41.250> go<00:03:41.340> there's<00:03:41.760> where

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
in okay now there you go there's where

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.149 
in okay now there you go there's where
the<00:03:42.090> master<00:03:42.659> cylinder<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.900> two<00:03:46.890> lines

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
the master cylinder is and the two lines

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.970 
the master cylinder is and the two lines
going<00:03:47.579> into<00:03:47.909> it<00:03:48.060> are<00:03:48.209> ten<00:03:48.510> millimeter<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.560> I'm

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
going into it are ten millimeter and I'm

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.970 
going into it are ten millimeter and I'm
assuming<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.819> socket<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:52.019> bolts<00:03:52.859> it

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
assuming that the socket that bolts it

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.580 
assuming that the socket that bolts it
to<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.250> power<00:03:53.790> booster<00:03:54.329> is<00:03:54.569> probably<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.560> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
to the power booster is probably like a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.619 
to the power booster is probably like a
twelve<00:03:56.129> millimeter<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.909> haven't<00:03:57.329> actually

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
twelve millimeter I haven't actually

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.319 
twelve millimeter I haven't actually
check<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.409> yet<00:03:58.739> my<00:03:59.430> son<00:03:59.730> is<00:03:59.909> reaching<00:04:00.299> down

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
check that yet my son is reaching down

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.809 
check that yet my son is reaching down
in<00:04:00.690> there<00:04:01.730> twelve

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.580 

that'll<00:04:05.480> work<00:04:05.599> for<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.140> I'm<00:04:06.230> gonna<00:04:06.469> have

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
that'll work for that so I'm gonna have

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.589 
that'll work for that so I'm gonna have
to<00:04:06.620> use<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.890> Flex<00:04:07.159> socket<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:08.209> get<00:04:08.360> down

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
to use the Flex socket to get down

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.089 
to use the Flex socket to get down
underneath<00:04:09.019> that<00:04:09.290> wire<00:04:09.560> entire<00:04:09.950> song

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
underneath that wire entire song

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.580 
underneath that wire entire song
okay<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:11.939> the<00:04:12.299> best<00:04:12.510> way<00:04:12.749> to<00:04:12.780> get<00:04:13.079> down<00:04:13.349> in

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
okay so the best way to get down in

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.670 
okay so the best way to get down in
there<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.700> get<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.030> mounting<00:04:15.870> bolts<00:04:16.199> is<00:04:16.440> to

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
there and get this mounting bolts is to

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.729 
there and get this mounting bolts is to
use<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.829> flex<00:04:17.870> deep<00:04:18.870> well<00:04:19.109> socket

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
use a flex deep well socket

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.270 
use a flex deep well socket
I<00:04:19.889> got<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.160> flex<00:04:20.459> joint<00:04:20.850> with<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.690> D<00:04:21.989> 12<00:04:22.350> 13

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
I got a flex joint with a D 12 13

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.999 
I got a flex joint with a D 12 13
millimeter<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.630> what<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.020> takes<00:04:25.259> and<00:04:25.620> that'll

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
millimeter is what it takes and that'll

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.640 
millimeter is what it takes and that'll
do<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.370> side<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.750> will<00:04:27.810> also<00:04:27.990> move<00:04:28.440> down

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
do this side and it will also move down

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.089 
do this side and it will also move down
underneath<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.220> wire<00:04:30.289> okay<00:04:31.289> now<00:04:31.590> we<00:04:31.650> got<00:04:32.009> to

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
underneath the wire okay now we got to

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.360 
underneath the wire okay now we got to
get<00:04:32.250> those<00:04:33.080> lines<00:04:34.080> loose<00:04:34.500> those<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:34.919> 10

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
get those lines loose those a 10

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.129 
get those lines loose those a 10
millimeter<00:04:37.759> yeah<00:04:38.759> there<00:04:39.210> we<00:04:39.419> have<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:39.960> all
