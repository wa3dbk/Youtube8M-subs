00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the demonstration and I'm going to very

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.410 
the demonstration and I'm going to very
lightly<00:00:22.980> apply<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:24.380> very<00:00:25.380> thin<00:00:25.529> layer<00:00:26.130> as<00:00:27.029> thin

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
lightly apply a very thin layer as thin

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.109 
lightly apply a very thin layer as thin
as<00:00:27.599> possible<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.070> kind<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> tapping

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
as possible and I kind of do a tapping

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.100 
as possible and I kind of do a tapping
motion<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.779> tap<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.070> about<00:00:32.340> 90%<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.870> leave

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
motion I tap it in about 90% and I leave

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.490 
motion I tap it in about 90% and I leave
it<00:00:34.260> 10%<00:00:34.530> wet<00:00:35.360> leaving<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> wet<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it 10% wet leaving it wet is one of the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.720 
it 10% wet leaving it wet is one of the
most<00:00:38.270> important<00:00:39.590> aspects<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.620> doing<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
most important aspects of doing a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.549 
most important aspects of doing a
quality<00:00:42.000> demonstration<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.079> instantly

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
quality demonstration with instantly

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
quality demonstration with instantly
ages<00:00:43.890> now<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> add<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> do

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
ages now what I want to add them to do

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
ages now what I want to add them to do
is<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> remain<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.170> still<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.770> he<00:00:46.890> possibly<00:00:47.129> can

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
is to remain as still as he possibly can

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.479 
is to remain as still as he possibly can
it<00:00:48.239> takes<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.600> 20<00:00:49.140> seconds<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> you're

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it takes about 20 seconds and you're

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.569 
it takes about 20 seconds and you're
going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> start<00:00:50.940> seeing<00:00:51.329> dramatic<00:00:51.600> results

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
going to start seeing dramatic results

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
going to start seeing dramatic results
now<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> fan<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.899> eye<00:00:55.020> but

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
now you don't have to fan at the eye but

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.549 
now you don't have to fan at the eye but
fanning<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.039> does<00:00:56.280> speed<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> process<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
fanning it does speed up the process so

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.040 
fanning it does speed up the process so
if<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.789> real<00:01:00.030> closely<00:01:00.270> you'll<00:01:00.660> begin<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
if you look real closely you'll begin to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.310 
if you look real closely you'll begin to
see<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.500> eye<00:01:02.000> really<00:01:03.000> change<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
see this eye really change for the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.870 
see this eye really change for the
better<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> few<00:01:06.000> seconds<00:01:06.450> time<00:01:07.880> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
better in just a few seconds time the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880 
better in just a few seconds time the
more<00:01:09.090> still<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.780> person<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.619> better<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
more still the person is the better the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
more still the person is the better the
results<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.010> patient<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
results and the more patient you are the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
results and the more patient you are the
better<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.930> results<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
better the results are going to get so I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
better the results are going to get so I
already<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> starting<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.750> dramatically

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
already see it starting to dramatically

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
already see it starting to dramatically
change<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.369> already<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> 30<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
change right now we already have a 30 to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.410 
change right now we already have a 30 to
40<00:01:22.020> percent<00:01:22.170> improvement<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> eye<00:01:23.420> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
40 percent improvement on the eye and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.330 
40 percent improvement on the eye and
we're<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.619> lot<00:01:25.950> more

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
we're going to go for a lot more

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
we're going to go for a lot more
improvement<00:01:26.909> than<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.140> see

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
improvement than that so as you can see

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.310 
improvement than that so as you can see
we<00:01:32.040> haven't<00:01:32.430> moved<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.689> camera<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.170> all

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
we haven't moved the camera at all

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.710 
we haven't moved the camera at all
there's<00:01:34.619> nothing<00:01:34.829> trick<00:01:35.369> photography<00:01:35.909> going

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
there's nothing trick photography going

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.520 
there's nothing trick photography going

on
what<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.330> you<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.140> that's

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
what you see is what you get and that's

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:50.510 
what you see is what you get and that's
unbelievable<00:01:41.369> results<00:01:41.940> with<00:01:42.240> oMG

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.870 

typically<00:01:51.590> 10-15<00:01:52.590> years<00:01:52.619> younger<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.579> as

typically 10-15 years younger and as
little<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.270> two<00:01:54.509> minutes<00:01:55.430> now<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:56.610> 20<00:01:57.030> or

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
little as two minutes now in about 20 or

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.580 
little as two minutes now in about 20 or
30<00:01:57.180> seconds<00:01:57.750> we're<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> turn<00:01:58.259> off<00:01:58.439> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
30 seconds we're going to turn off this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.320 
30 seconds we're going to turn off this
video<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.640> we're<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.030> another

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
video and then we're going to do another

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.960 
video and then we're going to do another
video<00:02:00.740> featuring<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> other<00:02:02.189> eye<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.610> Adam

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
video featuring the other eye of Adam

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.910 
video featuring the other eye of Adam
which<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.720> actually<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.470> puffier

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
which is actually a little bit puffier

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.660 
which is actually a little bit puffier
but<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.329> see<00:02:06.600> we're<00:02:07.110> about<00:02:07.320> 75<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.489> 80

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
but as you can see we're about 75 to 80

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.110 
but as you can see we're about 75 to 80
percent<00:02:08.819> improvement<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:10.200> Adam's<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.310> will

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
percent improvement on Adam's I will

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.440 
percent improvement on Adam's I will
give<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.390> about<00:02:12.480> another<00:02:12.870> 10<00:02:13.230> seconds<00:02:14.450> you're

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
give it about another 10 seconds you're

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:25.050 
give it about another 10 seconds you're
gonna<00:02:15.540> see<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> actually<00:02:16.080> get<00:02:16.500> better
