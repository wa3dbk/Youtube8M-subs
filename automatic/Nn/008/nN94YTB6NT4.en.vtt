lovely<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:39.420> idea<00:02:39.660> behind<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
lovely the idea behind that is that the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.990 
lovely the idea behind that is that the
front<00:02:40.920> seat<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.370> middle<00:02:41.489> there<00:02:41.790> will

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.930 
actually slide into the back a tiny bit
just<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.150> adds<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.420> bit<00:02:45.450> more<00:02:46.670> room<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
