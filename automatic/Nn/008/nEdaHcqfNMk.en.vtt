00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.390
 the rack of lamb with damask sauce 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.950
 heat a frying pan with oil if we look at the lamb 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.639
 raffo moscona was stopped then seasoned with aluminum foil 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.429
 We take it to the hot oven establishments 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.080
 explain the constitution cars or phonograms or tie us up with lard 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.060
 to your unique candidate 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.140
 will pass words before adding the meat bottom 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.349
 but neither the contaminated waters the cooking according to cold of the silver 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.689
 they look for new data 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.559
 place payment sugar salt and cook the beans for a minute and a half with a bucket 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.170
 from montecarlo 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 mcqueen 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.510
 It's all over 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.070
 we believe the damask that as you will see they ate colored they got a little 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.540
 darker 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.070
 the beans that are ready 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.440
 I do not know if they look like I think so and that also green because the cooking is 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.130
 very fast 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.420
 I could try one 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
 hello I would like chitÃ³n really well 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 perfect slightly forward and who up 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.150
 the ruler the heat is 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.210
 damask is also 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.570
 let's take out our lamb 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.850
 we would 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.790
 spokesman 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.790
 there is a different way of examining that plate 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.870
 cut world and marked less toxic 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.870
 one by one 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.220
 let's go back to step something that left me very hot 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.900
 little parked 3 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.010
 a piece 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.190
 of lamb 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 that we are going to caracas 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 what I did not say is that it touches aluminum in addition to 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.160
 to allow even cooking in all the meat which also allows us 3 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.890
 do not burn point of the jdj kidd important posts 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.140
 well we have approached their others what we are thornton different to dock 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 shattered 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.050
 which 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.050
 it's very good 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.639
 Lopez armentera as well 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.739
 everyone eats it their taste 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.509
 let's drink 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.049
 yes our plate 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.299
 kolontÃ¡r 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.299
 some sheets 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.410
 in this case I recognize 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.410
 that they make an error on camera 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.259
 simply because we are honest 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.839
 right in the middle of the ocean and ready 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:42.279
 but if I serve a lamb like this 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.059
 It is very probable 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.969
 rozas 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.279
 to the 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.409
 when the meat is served to the table 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.409
 we could have a growing problem 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.119
 It cools the plate very quickly so it is recommended 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.269
 highly recommended 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.969
 put 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.059
 a hot dish to make this dish as a sanitary on the plate 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.619
 good 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.469
 here we have finished term or loins tidy 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.219
 in its place of presentation 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.430
 Another rack of lamb with more flirtatious finished sauce 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:33.749
 it's a pleasure as always we weigh these things forward wall you these 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:38.859
 dishes before you I hope to see you again in the next open program and 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.859
 A) Yes 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.060
 never
