00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that would just glided past right there

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.330 
that would just glided past right there
and<00:00:58.230> turn<00:00:58.410> around<00:00:58.500> that's<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> first<00:00:59.250> one

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
itself is a riddle you can actually dig

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.910 
itself is a riddle you can actually dig
it<00:01:50.160> from<00:01:50.310> any<00:01:50.520> decently<00:01:51.480> high<00:01:51.690> location<00:01:51.900> so<00:01:52.560> if

for some reason it's not snapping just

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
for some reason it's not snapping just
get<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> altitude<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.040> take<00:01:56.310> a

get a little bit of altitude and take a
snapshot<00:01:56.670> again<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.930> take<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.080> from

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
snapshot again you can take it from

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.540 
snapshot again you can take it from
pretty<00:01:58.440> much<00:01:58.530> anywhere<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.070> city<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.520> it
