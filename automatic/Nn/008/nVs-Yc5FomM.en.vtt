the rest of the Pistons
there's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.260> bit<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> transfer<00:01:11.150> from

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
heat other than that everything was was

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
heat other than that everything was was
performing<00:01:16.049> alright<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.710> lubrication<00:01:17.280> was

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
performing alright the lubrication was

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.820 
performing alright the lubrication was
ok<00:01:18.080> all<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> Pistons<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.700> oil<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
ok all the Pistons are have oil all the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.730 
ok all the Pistons are have oil all the
damage<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:23.009> due<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.700> lean<00:01:24.630> measure<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.560> lean

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
damage was due a lean measure the lean

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.539 
damage was due a lean measure the lean
mixture<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.310> caused<00:01:29.579> by<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:31.220> two-piece<00:01:32.220> fuel

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
mixture was caused by a two-piece fuel

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.710 
mixture was caused by a two-piece fuel
line<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.119> boat<00:01:37.159> and

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
line that is going to be on the boat and

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.120 
line that is going to be on the boat and
what<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> ethanol<00:01:40.140> fuel<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.680> doing<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
what the ethanol fuel is doing is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.690 
what the ethanol fuel is doing is
breaking<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> down<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.950> inner<00:01:44.159> lining<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
breaking it down and the inner lining of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.270 
breaking it down and the inner lining of
it<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.970> turning<00:01:45.930> into<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> jelly<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> turns<00:01:47.130> into

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it is turning into a jelly it turns into

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.030 
it is turning into a jelly it turns into
those<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.729> red<00:01:47.909> chunks<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.040> actually

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
those little red chunks and actually

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
those little red chunks and actually
passes<00:01:50.460> through<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> filter<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.329> into<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
passes through the filter and into the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.429 
passes through the filter and into the
injection<00:01:52.530> system<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.909> causes<00:01:54.229> to<00:01:55.229> lean

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
injection system and it causes to lean

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.090 
injection system and it causes to lean
out<00:01:55.619> an<00:01:55.770> injector<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> damage

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
out an injector and this is the damage

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880 
out an injector and this is the damage
that<00:01:59.369> occurred<00:01:59.610> by

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that occurred by

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.500 
that occurred by
so<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.280> injector<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.970> cylinder<00:02:04.270> will

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
so the injector on the cylinder will

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.350 
so the injector on the cylinder will
need<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.750> be<00:02:04.869> replaced<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.740> well<00:02:06.580> as<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.180> block

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
need to be replaced as well as the block

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.800 
need to be replaced as well as the block
the<00:02:10.360> rod<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.800> due<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.730> transfer<00:02:16.209> there<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.630> an

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
the rod and due to transfer there was an

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.670 
the rod and due to transfer there was an
additional<00:02:17.620> rod<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.970> had<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.600> good<00:02:20.080> chunk

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
additional rod that had a good chunk

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:30.510 
additional rod that had a good chunk
that<00:02:28.110> will<00:02:29.110> also<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.770> be<00:02:29.800> replaced

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
that will also have to be replaced

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:41.479 
that will also have to be replaced
oh<00:02:36.209> let<00:02:37.209> me<00:02:37.300> see<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.750> yeah<00:02:38.019> cannot<00:02:38.980> see<00:02:39.280> that

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
oh let me see it yeah cannot see that

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.590 
oh let me see it yeah cannot see that
nope<00:02:42.489> still<00:02:42.820> can't<00:02:43.150> see<00:02:43.769> okay<00:02:44.769> there<00:02:44.950> this

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
nope still can't see okay there this

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.370 
nope still can't see okay there this
shine<00:02:46.600> your<00:02:46.750> light<00:02:46.900> on<00:02:47.050> it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
shine your light on it

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.420 
shine your light on it
oh<00:02:47.850> no<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.330> shines<00:02:49.540> back<00:02:49.920> okay<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.250> that

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
oh no but just shines back okay so that

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.720 
oh no but just shines back okay so that
little<00:02:51.700> pit<00:02:51.880> right<00:02:52.090> there

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
little pit right there

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.100 
little pit right there
that<00:02:54.730> rod<00:02:54.940> will<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.239> well<00:02:55.420> also<00:02:55.660> have<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.989> be

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
that rod will as well also have to be

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.550 
that rod will as well also have to be
replaced<00:02:57.510> when<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.570> raw<00:02:58.810> when<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.170> piston

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
replaced when the raw when the piston

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:09.290 
replaced when the raw when the piston
came<00:02:59.769> off<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:01.420> did

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.250 

how'd<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.330> work

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.510
