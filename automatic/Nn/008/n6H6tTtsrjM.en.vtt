00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
at 3000 profit off of that if it went

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.730 
at 3000 profit off of that if it went
for<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> lowest<00:02:45.690> part<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.140> we're<00:02:46.290> banking<00:02:46.650> on

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
for the lowest part but we're banking on

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.080 
for the lowest part but we're banking on
it<00:02:46.890> going<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> buy<00:02:47.490> now<00:02:47.520> which<00:02:47.910> would<00:02:48.000> be

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it going for the buy now which would be

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.910 
it going for the buy now which would be
a<00:02:48.120> couple<00:02:48.420> thousand<00:02:48.930> more<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.260> maybe<00:02:49.380> five<00:02:49.680> six

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
a couple thousand more so maybe five six

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.950 
a couple thousand more so maybe five six
thousand<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.340> him<00:02:50.520> as<00:02:50.640> well<00:02:50.670> would<00:02:51.420> be<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> nice

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
thousand on him as well would be a nice

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.630

little<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.620> profit<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:53.460> we<00:02:53.520> got<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
little bit of profit there but we got a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.310 
little bit of profit there but we got a
couple<00:02:53.790> more<00:02:54.030> Ronaldinho's<00:02:54.690> hanging<00:02:54.990> out<00:02:55.110> in

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
could just change this formation very

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.090 
could just change this formation very
easily<00:04:35.330> 2352<00:04:36.290> or<00:04:36.530> something<00:04:36.800> along<00:04:36.860> those

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
easily 2352 or something along those

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.670 
easily 2352 or something along those
lines<00:04:37.220> there's<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.120> for<00:04:38.360> 231<00:04:38.840> ronaldinho

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
lines there's that for 231 ronaldinho

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.650 
lines there's that for 231 ronaldinho
now<00:04:39.830> he<00:04:39.890> listed<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.280> for<00:04:40.450> 110,000<00:04:41.450> which<00:04:41.540> i

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
now he listed it for 110,000 which i

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.510 
now he listed it for 110,000 which i
think<00:04:41.720> is<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.930> bit<00:04:42.230> of<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.410> mistake<00:04:42.530> he's

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
think is a bit of a mistake he's

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.160 
think is a bit of a mistake he's
obviously<00:04:43.670> trying<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.150> trade<00:04:44.330> but<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:44.720> actually

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
obviously trying to trade but I actually

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.660 
obviously trying to trade but I actually
think<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.740> he<00:04:45.860> could<00:04:45.980> have<00:04:46.100> got<00:04:46.280> somewhere

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
think that he could have got somewhere

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.480 
think that he could have got somewhere
closer<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.200> 120,000<00:04:48.200> coins<00:04:48.470> without<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.890> doubt
