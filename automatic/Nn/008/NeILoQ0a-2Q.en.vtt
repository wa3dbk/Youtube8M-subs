00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.769
 in remember me we take over in the year 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.139
 In 2084, the role of a young lady was 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.809
 to change the memories of other people 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.400
 or even can completely wipe out exactly 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.590
 that is always wise but also here 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.720
 happened and looking for our 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.420
 own identity we have to almost 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.890
 overpowering group memories of the 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.380
 trade with the thoughts of the people 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.060
 controls the forehead and offers us 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.980
 bring back our memory 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.839
 for the fighting system of the 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.940
 Action Adventures has become a developer 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.440
 download entertainment something completely 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.140
 to come up with something special 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.700
 therefore we got free hits and 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.650
 step with the right timing 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.930
 combos to each other we gradually 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.670
 which effectively enable our 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 but we can have a hit ourselves 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.020
 set and so on our fight style 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.700
 to adjust 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.580
 red stands leads powerfully 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.590
 attacks, we end up with yellow attacks 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.410
 By the way, let's fill ours 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.270
 health indicator on and purple again 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.820
 colored hits shorten the waiting time 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.570
 until you have our special skills again 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.850
 this can be an example 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.860
 These bombs we to our opponents 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.320
 staples and their pressure wave in the ideal case 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.960
 just a few more opponents 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.510
 captured and thrown to the ground 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.729
 with the spammer we shoot like in 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.940
 a first person shooter data impulse 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.240
 and open doors in this way put 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.950
 certain devices are lame or 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.200
 break through the shields of the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.770
 opponents climbing is also one 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.600
 important element of the game of remember me 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.920
 the next tangible advantage will be us 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.990
 always with a mark 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.300
 that gives us the opportunity 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.990
 the skyline of new york paris too 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.479
 admire 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.700
 It combines historical buildings like 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.360
 the triumphal arch or the eiffel tower 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.340
 futuristic skyscraper or the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.140
 gloomy run-down poor neighborhood 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.210
 the city only through the neon light 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.729
 The promotional advertisement will be enlightened 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.890
 another very cool one 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.780
 feature of remember me is 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.580
 the memory of certain persons too 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.040
 to influence our advantage 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.209
 In this scene, we experience the dispute 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.920
 a couple 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.370
 he has washed but goes 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.319
 in the end quite lenient from ours 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.150
 task it is now objects in the 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.040
 to manipulate the environment so that the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.540
 guy not after the bottle but the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.250
 weapon attacks on the table and his 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.200
 woman with him shoots around 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.450
 then out of despair itself 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.799
 kill 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.180
 the guy is on the verge of his 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.160
 appointment as commander of the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.320
 security forces and could be soon 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.910
 a serious threat to us 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.140
 become 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.790
 for that we throw the bottle on the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.510
 ground 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.510
 Unlock the pistol 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.820
 and push the side table to the side 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.650
 because our victim is otherwise the head 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.780
 would strike up and become unconscious 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.310
 if he stumbles over the bottle from there 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.230
 we just have to keep the sequence 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.910
 keep running and see how 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.770
 our devilish plan arises 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.450
 whether the purpose is really any medium 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.220
 sanctify or we did with ours 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.320
 maybe a little too far 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.560
 we are probably only in 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.610
 summer experienced if that so far very much 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.380
 varied and promising 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.380
 remember me appears with us
