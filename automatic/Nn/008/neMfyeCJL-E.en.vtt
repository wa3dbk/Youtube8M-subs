you<00:04:32.830> know<00:04:32.860> look<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.370> come<00:04:33.850> from<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.180> point<00:04:34.389> of

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
you know look I I come from the point of

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.689 
you know look I I come from the point of
view<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:34.720> there<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:35.740> no<00:04:35.919> president<00:04:36.430> they<00:04:36.550> can

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
view that there is no president they can

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.219 
view that there is no president they can
make<00:04:36.789> a<00:04:36.820> difference<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.510> his<00:04:37.690> system<00:04:38.110> is

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
make a difference this is his system is

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.430 
make a difference this is his system is
so<00:04:38.710> much<00:04:38.919> larger<00:04:39.130> than<00:04:39.400> one<00:04:39.699> person<00:04:39.910> or<00:04:40.330> one

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
so much larger than one person or one

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.830 
so much larger than one person or one
administration<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.880> it<00:04:43.240> doesn't<00:04:43.630> matter

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
administration that it doesn't matter

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.840 
administration that it doesn't matter
and<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.199> think<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:44.860> know<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.220> think<00:04:45.699> that

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
and I think that you know I think that

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.790 
and I think that you know I think that
he<00:04:46.000> does<00:04:46.270> a<00:04:46.360> lot<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.570> glad-handing<00:04:47.260> he<00:04:47.410> has<00:04:47.560> to

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
he does a lot of glad-handing he has to

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.590 
he does a lot of glad-handing he has to

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
and it's firmly entrenched I think it

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.260 
and it's firmly entrenched I think it
would<00:05:22.990> be<00:05:23.020> either<00:05:23.800> naive<00:05:24.099> or<00:05:24.400> disingenuous<00:05:25.240> to

not believe that yeah how do you how do

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.460 
not believe that yeah how do you how do
you<00:05:27.550> then<00:05:27.580> go<00:05:27.910> on<00:05:28.120> when<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:28.900> win<00:05:29.110> you<00:05:29.139> have

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
you then go on when you win you have

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.820 
you then go on when you win you have
these<00:05:29.979> thoughts<00:05:30.520> all<00:05:31.030> right<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.240> I<00:05:32.139> just<00:05:32.590> think

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
these thoughts all right I I just think

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.710 
these thoughts all right I I just think
that<00:05:32.889> no<00:05:33.130> one<00:05:33.280> really<00:05:33.310> and<00:05:34.120> I'm<00:05:34.360> saying<00:05:34.630> this

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
that no one really and I'm saying this

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.330 
that no one really and I'm saying this
unit<00:05:34.960> wants<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.410> hear<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.770> complete<00:05:36.130> truth

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
unit wants to hear the complete truth

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.770 
unit wants to hear the complete truth
because<00:05:36.669> a<00:05:36.699> complete<00:05:37.090> truth<00:05:37.300> is<00:05:37.510> there

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
because a complete truth is there

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.719 
because a complete truth is there
probably<00:05:38.050> are<00:05:38.229> aliens<00:05:38.740> their<00:05:39.160> problems<00:05:44.729> yeah

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
probably are aliens their problems yeah

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.580 
probably are aliens their problems yeah
I<00:05:45.760> don't<00:05:46.330> know<00:05:46.449> what<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.810> answers<00:05:47.169> but<00:05:47.560> I

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
I don't know what the answers but I

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.040 
I don't know what the answers but I
disagree<00:05:48.099> that<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:48.940> president<00:05:49.389> can<00:05:49.660> make<00:05:50.020> a

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
disagree that a president can make a

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.640 
disagree that a president can make a
change<00:05:50.380> I<00:05:50.590> think<00:05:51.220> we<00:05:51.639> as<00:05:51.820> individuals<00:05:52.510> have<00:05:53.470> to

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
change I think we as individuals have to

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.969 
change I think we as individuals have to
understand<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.699> idea<00:05:55.300> that<00:05:55.360> some<00:05:56.050> one<00:05:56.410> person

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
understand the idea that some one person

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.310 
understand the idea that some one person
is<00:05:57.070> going<00:05:57.220> to<00:05:57.280> change<00:05:57.760> every<00:05:58.510> little<00:05:58.870> terrible

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
is going to change every little terrible

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.710 
is going to change every little terrible
thing<00:05:59.560> is<00:05:59.740> silliness<00:06:00.639> yeah<00:06:00.970> but<00:06:01.210> he<00:06:01.330> has<00:06:01.449> made

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
thing is silliness yeah but he has made

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.659 
thing is silliness yeah but he has made
a<00:06:01.750> change<00:06:02.020> as<00:06:02.229> far<00:06:02.349> as<00:06:02.470> health<00:06:02.710> care<00:06:02.979> that's

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
a change as far as health care that's

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.460 
a change as far as health care that's
affected<00:06:04.120> my<00:06:04.240> life<00:06:04.449> in<00:06:04.510> a<00:06:04.750> better<00:06:04.900> way<00:06:05.139> in<00:06:05.320> my

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
affected my life in a better way in my

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.469 
affected my life in a better way in my
children's<00:06:05.919> life<00:06:06.070> so<00:06:06.370> I<00:06:06.580> mean<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:07.060> think<00:06:07.090> that

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
children's life so I mean I think that

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.409 
children's life so I mean I think that
people<00:06:08.139> do<00:06:08.409> make<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.830> change<00:06:09.190> it's<00:06:09.940> not<00:06:10.180> as

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
people do make a change it's not as

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.000 
people do make a change it's not as
grandiose<00:06:10.810> as<00:06:11.050> everybody<00:06:11.440> wants<00:06:11.740> it<00:06:11.860> to<00:06:11.979> be

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
grandiose as everybody wants it to be

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.920 
grandiose as everybody wants it to be
because<00:06:12.220> everybody<00:06:12.669> wants<00:06:12.849> everything<00:06:13.510> right

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
because everybody wants everything right
