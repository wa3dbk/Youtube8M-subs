00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 so welcome to 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 a new episode perfect and wonderful 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.770
 said I did not look it over 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.840
 that is exactly what could be 9 could 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.860
 but also ten 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.150
 and I have that again today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.839
 a small inn to be brought to you too 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.210
 equal number two and three 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:24.119
 address and we welcome with one 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.910
 heartiest drum swirls Portugal so 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.250
 present at so applause for present 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.960
 then we come directly to the first 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.790
 fact you all surely know 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 score big especially in the complete 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.239
 players among you are already 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.690
 made acquaintance with this pokémon 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.520
 to have 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.230
 for those who do not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.930
 It should be a pokémon 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.360
 Which is very defensive why you 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 It really gets very hard off 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 but we will talk hard 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.899
 then let's have a look 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.260
 weight of scor to the scorpio like 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.629
 just 42 5 kilograms 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.309
 why this now so special is you can 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.340
 Of course you ask yourself now but 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 his advanced development athlete is 90 cm 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.350
 smaller is still whole 64 8 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.990
 kilogram 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.900
 so it is over 20 kilos heavier than 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.670
 core gros the next act is about 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.250
 the plants start the second one 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 generation endivia confused for the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.060
 but not with the eponymous one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 salad because there is in the real world 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.189
 an endive salad and thus is the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.320
 name of in we the only name 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.720
 a pokémons which also in the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.390
 real world has a meaning and that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.250
 is at 7 120 different pokémon on 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.549
 every case a fact of here a place 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.079
 you have certainly earned 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.850
 one of the new pokémon of the sixth 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.920
 generation 's eyes 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.740
 the further development of kia has one 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.030
 male and a female form these 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.220
 both forms differ in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.590
 skills attacks especially 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.320
 This year it's only up to date 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.600
 including wants 25 attacks per 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.869
 Level up as it learns with the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.579
 25 levels evolve that lies 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.630
 because the attacks are like me 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.149
 just mentioned 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 between the two form thus distinguish 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.209
 is it forced to do so 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.259
 to develop it new 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.599
 can learn attacks 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.520
 Of course temps are excluded 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.319
 and because I still have some send time over 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.000
 I've just used this around 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.650
 a fact about my favorite pokémon 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.590
 arcania rauszuhauen 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.830
 you do not have the time anymore 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.500
 three facts and now nobody wants 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.780
 some facto barkani have that one 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
 Present out, it's over, you knew 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.440
 even that arcania almost ten thousand 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.060
 kilometers per day 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.500
 when pressing you have your august now 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.030
 abolished then go now also okay me 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.310
 I'm just one 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 there is the rule of three facts is ready 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.170
 what was she de facto does not fall here 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.980
 continue to give me 30 seconds to the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.980
 day to finish 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.489
 god in the sky finally it awakens 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.099
 a bit annoyed or something like the motto 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.150
 Go get rid of it 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.709
 I would just say 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.230
 he asked her to fix the last four 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.050
 facts yeah and we'll catch you soon 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.879
 with fuck number four and a big one 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.810
 dear otto paul you know all 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.180
 the pokémon when faxing facto weighs 105 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.940
 kilo is not necessarily easy 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.909
 However, Michael is anime man 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.120
 lift faxes easily 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:26.120
 a ten-year-old girl now 105 kilos 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.360
 i know that japan landes in that 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.440
 men and women almost here 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.049
 are equal 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.510
 At least if I hope so, I hope 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:44.010
 cooking the women is encouraging japan 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.799
 a real power woman with ten years 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:53.760
 can never nice to look at what 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:54.780
 Michael , we say no for ten years 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.269
 I do not know because I know 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.159
 at least when ten-year-old girl 105 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.780
 I can raise kilos without problems, I think 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.890
 I have to go to the team I think 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.980
 I 'm going to mop up soon 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.150
 train better we believe better 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.909
 fact number 15 because now and that in 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.459
 pokédex entry of rehorn year will be there 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.090
 mentions that it is small stone 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.639
 bullets used 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.290
 So you have to imagine reunions 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.090
 the pokémon if it's an attack 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.320
 then it raises the quasi also 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.660
 poor as high as now, apparently 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.970
 shoot them out and if that's the case 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.210
 now it is throwing throw it shoots 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.880
 almost like spiderman from the caves am 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.910
 arm kleinstein out los both one has 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.460
 spider thread but her hobbies looks like 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.610
 small stone and now you represents time ago 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.729
 her sitting so falls on a shoot 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.460
 Kleinstein in the middle of the flight 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.380
 it evolved to georg like that and 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.900
 shoot two out at the same time and 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.570
 if you have to change places now 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.070
 one georg almost swapped and the im 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.960
 flight they are still developing into one 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.040
 geo watts and when they meet you 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.770
 they're also causing explosions 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.539
 old piglet but so what from then would the 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.510
 world on the ass if the e on with a few 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:17.070
 would shoot geo waxes 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:21.340
 Roche meal number 6 and indeed 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.560
 although the pokemon and silt the 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.380
 Water weakness can be found in the water 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.389
 play only in the water to hit something like that 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.530
 it's a bit of a paradox , it's like 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.120
 you could only find it in the fire it is one 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.430
 a bit feebleminded so clearly names 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.930
 is that a flounder but if water 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.710
 weakness has why you can actually find 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.330
 only in the water 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.620
 That could be such a mud 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.380
 I think that we sometimes completely 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.760
 Interesting to the mud area was cool 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.289
 in any case, from mud water weakness 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.650
 only in the water meet 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:54.010
 gg cambridge and there are already 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.979
 to the last stroke in the pokédex 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.620
 Entries from just under Arag greetings to 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.180
 Casey is also mentioned as flying 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.260
 can 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.250
 however , neither has the ability 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.650
 balance 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.630
 The attack can still learn to fly 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.050
 still really has wings 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.729
 it's a bit alright i would 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.410
 can understand if the thing is swimming 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.370
 could never do anything with the ground type 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:20.740
 necessarily smart but flying like 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.849
 to the veh can knack please fly and how 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.610
 said it has neither the ability 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.830
 it can still fly the attack 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.099
 So theoretically could the thing 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.719
 do not fly, you can still the 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.479
 war please tell me here or 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.390
 i would become nintendo germany 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.380
 like to know why knack can fly 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.090
 Anyway it was already again 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.099
 with the pocket- follower on the spot as well 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.110
 again a nice greeting to present 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.580
 lp of course below in the video 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.219
 description linked skog with him 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.200
 I've been in the last three 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:53.080
 leaf green space was definitely there 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.340
 very interesting the following and around 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.780
 present now towards the end easy 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.310
 to reinzuge so far has me the 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.110
 recording sent to the piece and 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.820
 I then have to cut around like that 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.650
 he works quite well and him 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.200
 to choke him one more time 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.659
 I'll end up ice cold again 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.340
 We simply pack the scene 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.900
 I even talked in half 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.030
 make me cut in now 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.830
 because I just press in again 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:19.360
 He wants to press it to the end 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:21.550
 presents abmoderation or be where I am 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.500
 it is supposed to displace it even more 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.030
 Let's always hear how it sounds 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.010
 I would not have cut around then 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.060
 I'm out people in and me 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.130
 I wish you a lot of fun again 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.830
 with classes see you on wednesday 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.930
 for the title fight against case and there me 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.550
 I still use a bit of broadcast time 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.200
 Just give it a fact over 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.099
 my favorite pokémon apani 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.200
 rauszuhauen 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:42.969
 did you know that arcania almost 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.590
 Cover ten thousand kilometers a day 

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:46.840
 can 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:49.330
 What did she actually like here ? 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.080
 what the 30 seconds to me the fact 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.510
 to finish 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.349
 no, what she does not wait is waiting 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.349
 do not hold me back
