00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.730
 hello today we are going to learn everything 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.139
 concerning the ergonomics of the guitar 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.509
 that is, the placement of the instrument and 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.360
 the placement of ourselves before the 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.720
 instrument 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.900
 a good starting point is the lesson 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.119
 of the chair 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.500
 we need a chair that allows us 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.850
 Place your back straight and your feet 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.489
 leaning on the floor 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.879
 the back straight we inhabit future 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.879
 problems 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.820
 these computer or office chairs 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.030
 that allow the regulation of the height 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.629
 by gas are very useful since 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.799
 that allow us to adapt them to the height 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 of each one but if you have one 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.170
 Fixed chair that fits well in height 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 the next point and one of the most 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.280
 important is cabbage 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.659
 the strap is going to hold the guitar 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.450
 during long periods of study of 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.570
 rehearsal and live 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.700
 what is the correct length 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.380
 fix 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.480
 If I adjust the strap in such a way that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 not slip the guitar 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.409
 and it stays hanging and it's making me 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.560
 strength in the neck 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.170
 that is to say that it is perfectly 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.710
 supported of the soul and the rest begins 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.330
 move or want to hang when I 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.760
 I raised 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:54.680
 will be positioned in the same place 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.110
 when I go to rehearse when I go 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.500
 to play live I will have the same 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.050
 position on the guitar that when 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.050
 study at home sitting 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.900
 and all the positions that I go 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.090
 using when I learn them I'm going 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.300
 to be able to perform at the time of rehearsal and 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.990
 at the time of touching however if I 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.390
 study in one position and without a belt or 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.360
 nothing when I get up pongolle 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.690
 according to the long or I put it in very high 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.610
 the positions are going to be somewhere else 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:36.220
 then it is more correct to start from a point 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.220
 where the guitar does not move added 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.090
 the tilt of the guitar 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.959
 not good 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.580
 and have it completely attached to the body or 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:55.640
 very separate the ideal 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.640
 a 45 degree angle 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:06.670
 because that way I can see the notes well 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:10.210
 move from the neck and force it and this arm 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:16.360
 it will be well placed 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:17.520
 that is 45 degrees and a tad raised 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.360
 upwards 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:27.590
 because if I'm going to see the notes better 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:31.780
 and avoid forcing the back move to 45 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.780
 degrees and a little angled upwards 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.549
 the guitars all have all 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.829
 not some older model does not have 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.550
 does not have this recess to support the 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.150
 arm but the vast majority 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.480
 have 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.530
 of a small one do not go down where I can 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.700
 support the arm 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.700
 at the time of playing 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.350
 the left hand remember the way 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.960
 of ball as if you were holding 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:06.670
 a ball and the thumb in the middle of 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.680
 mast 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:16.810
 and now comes the left arm and elbow 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.060
 It is not very good or hit the elbow 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.580
 totally to the body is not going to 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.510
 allow to move the hand and move it 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.820
 so much that we start lifting the shoulder 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.590
 yours is the comfortable logical posture and yes 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.900
 that we can take advantage of a small 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.300
 movement is to say when I go towards 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.680
 the most serious notes I can bring a 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.930
 little elbow to the body and when I 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.220
 I move to higher notes I can 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:51.300
 take a little elbow 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.800
 everything comes down to comfort and good 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.800
 disposition before our moment
