00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.050 
that's clear you know it's all wrong
that<00:01:59.420> cloaking<00:02:00.380> very<00:02:00.679> important<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.489> also<00:02:01.880> I

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
that cloaking very important and also I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.790 
that cloaking very important and also I
like<00:02:02.179> to<00:02:02.239> really<00:02:02.539> boost<00:02:02.750> my<00:02:02.959> radar<00:02:03.440> with<00:02:03.679> all

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
like to really boost my radar with all

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.889 
like to really boost my radar with all
the<00:02:03.979> different<00:02:04.640> options<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.539> can<00:02:05.569> have

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
the different options that you can have

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.199 
the different options that you can have
in<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.410> as<00:02:07.099> a<00:02:07.160> stealth<00:02:07.520> agent<00:02:07.970> I

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
in it and as a stealth agent I

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.470 
in it and as a stealth agent I
definitely<00:02:08.959> equip<00:02:09.500> Adam<00:02:10.280> with<00:02:10.520> most<00:02:10.879> of<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
definitely equip Adam with most of the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.930 
definitely equip Adam with most of the
stealth<00:02:12.010> augmentation<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.430> take

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
stealth augmentation so I take

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.880 
stealth augmentation so I take
you<00:02:14.120> know<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.330> x-ray<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.770> know

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
you know the x-ray so you can you know

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.110 
you know the x-ray so you can you know
see<00:02:16.100> through<00:02:16.310> walls<00:02:16.490> you<00:02:16.790> know<00:02:16.880> where<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
see through walls you know where the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.430 
see through walls you know where the
enemy<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.540> position<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.050> can<00:02:18.170> see<00:02:18.320> what

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
enemy is a position you can see what

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.810 
enemy is a position you can see what
direction<00:02:18.710> we're<00:02:18.980> looking<00:02:19.220> at<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.550> see<00:02:19.670> where

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
direction we're looking at you see where

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.120 
direction we're looking at you see where
the<00:02:19.910> security<00:02:20.210> cameras<00:02:20.750> are<00:02:21.130> other

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
the security cameras are other

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.070 
the security cameras are other
augmentations<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.450> marking<00:02:23.810> track

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
augmentations like the marking track

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.500 
augmentations like the marking track
that<00:02:24.350> really<00:02:25.070> allows<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.700> tag<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
that really allows you to tag the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.510 
that really allows you to tag the
enemies<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.200> see<00:02:27.440> trackers<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.340> are

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
enemies that you see trackers that are

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.240 
enemies that you see trackers that are
going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.180> follow<00:02:29.690> them<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.410> you'll<00:02:30.560> always<00:02:30.830> be

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
going to follow them so you'll always be

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.760 
going to follow them so you'll always be
able<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.520> know<00:02:32.180> where<00:02:32.390> their<00:02:32.630> position<00:02:33.560> and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
able to know where their position and

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.500 
able to know where their position and
where<00:02:33.950> they're<00:02:34.160> patrolling<00:02:34.510> attachments

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
where they're patrolling attachments

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.470 
where they're patrolling attachments
like<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.720> silencer<00:02:36.470> can<00:02:36.830> be<00:02:37.040> really<00:02:37.730> useful<00:02:37.760> but

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
like a silencer can be really useful but

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.780 
like a silencer can be really useful but
we<00:02:38.630> also<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:39.230> weapons<00:02:39.800> like<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.220> trussville

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
we also have weapons like the trussville

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.390 
we also have weapons like the trussville
that<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.480> totally<00:02:41.960> silent<00:02:42.260> I'll<00:02:42.740> usually<00:02:43.040> use

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
that is totally silent I'll usually use

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.190 
that is totally silent I'll usually use
a<00:02:43.430> crossbow<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:44.300> long<00:02:44.510> distance<00:02:44.930> let's<00:02:45.110> say

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
a crossbow for long distance let's say

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.270 
a crossbow for long distance let's say
there's<00:02:45.380> like<00:02:45.530> two<00:02:45.710> guys<00:02:45.890> when<00:02:46.190> this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
there's like two guys when this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.130 
there's like two guys when this
patrolling<00:02:46.790> was<00:02:46.970> close<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.480> me<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.750> use<00:02:48.110> a

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
patrolling was close to me I use a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.290 
patrolling was close to me I use a
crossbow<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.770> take<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.610> guy<00:02:49.760> furthest

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
crossbow to take that the guy furthest

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.360 
crossbow to take that the guy furthest
from<00:02:50.480> me<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> by<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.110> 20<00:02:51.410> goes<00:02:51.620> down<00:02:51.890> I'll

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
from me and by the 20 goes down I'll

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.550 
from me and by the 20 goes down I'll
just<00:02:52.790> attack<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.330> guy<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:53.930> closest<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.350> me

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
just attack the guy that's closest to me

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.500 
just attack the guy that's closest to me
