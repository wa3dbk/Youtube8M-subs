00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.760 

consensus<00:03:08.120> on<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.540> silk<00:03:08.810> scarf<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.440> think<00:03:09.650> it's

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
consensus on the silk scarf I think it's

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.200 
consensus on the silk scarf I think it's
a<00:03:09.800> great<00:03:09.950> hair<00:03:10.130> treatment<00:03:10.520> if<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.700> have<00:03:10.880> fine

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
a great hair treatment if you have fine

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.060 
a great hair treatment if you have fine
hair<00:03:11.240> it's<00:03:11.870> not<00:03:12.020> like<00:03:12.320> an<00:03:12.440> oily<00:03:12.920> hair

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
hair it's not like an oily hair

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.290 
hair it's not like an oily hair
treatment<00:03:13.520> so<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> don't<00:03:13.940> think<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:14.180> as

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
treatment so I don't think it's as

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.690 
treatment so I don't think it's as
intensive<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:14.990> it<00:03:15.200> says<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.710> is<00:03:15.740> weight

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
intensive as it says that it is weight

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.080 
intensive as it says that it is weight
even<00:03:17.210> say<00:03:17.420> intense<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.470> never<00:03:19.220> said<00:03:19.610> intense

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
even say intense it never said intense

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.000 
even say intense it never said intense
so<00:03:20.540> there<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.870> go<00:03:20.990> it<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.110> not<00:03:21.290> intensive<00:03:21.890> so

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
so there you go it is not intensive so

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.140 
so there you go it is not intensive so
if<00:03:22.100> you're<00:03:22.190> looking<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:22.670> like<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.820> once

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
in a while treatment I would do this but

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.990
