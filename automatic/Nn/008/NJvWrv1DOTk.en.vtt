rocking one of these like a month ago
and<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.450> thought<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.719> was<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.170> cool<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.950> wanted

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
and I thought it was so cool so I wanted

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.160 
and I thought it was so cool so I wanted
to<00:00:14.280> teach<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.670> all<00:00:14.820> how<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> make<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.929> first

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to teach you all how to make it so first

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.450 
to teach you all how to make it so first
thing<00:00:16.289> you're<00:00:16.410> gonna<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.830> take<00:00:17.130> some

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
thing you're gonna do is take some

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.349 
thing you're gonna do is take some
string

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
string

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.880 
string
this<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.980> braided<00:00:20.460> nylon<00:00:21.180> cord<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
this one is a braided nylon cord so it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.170 
this one is a braided nylon cord so it
works<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.340> well<00:00:23.460> because<00:00:23.850> when<00:00:24.119> you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
works out really well because when you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.060 
works out really well because when you
cut<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> doesn't<00:00:24.990> fray<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.830> braided

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
cut it it doesn't fray and it's braided

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.250 
cut it it doesn't fray and it's braided
so<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.460> stays<00:00:26.670> together<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> little

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
so it stays together and it's a little

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.870 
so it stays together and it's a little
thicker<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.980> we're<00:00:29.070> gonna<00:00:29.160> take<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.820> we

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
thicker so we're gonna take this and we

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.549 
thicker so we're gonna take this and we
want<00:00:30.090> about<00:00:30.269> 3<00:00:30.840> feet<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.560> gonna<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.859> one

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
want about 3 feet so we're gonna do one

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.870 
want about 3 feet so we're gonna do one
two<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:35.160> you're<00:00:35.280> gonna<00:00:35.370> kind<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> cross

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
two and then you're gonna kind of cross

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.450 
two and then you're gonna kind of cross
those<00:00:36.090> together<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.899> two<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.219> put

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
those together so one two and then put

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280 
those together so one two and then put
the<00:00:38.550> third<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.180> tie<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.750> at<00:00:40.050> one

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the third one like that tie it at one

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.810 
the third one like that tie it at one
end<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.649> you're<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.860> gonna<00:00:40.980> make<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.579> big

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
end so you're just gonna make one big

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.360 
end so you're just gonna make one big
knot<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:42.540> three<00:00:42.870> strings<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> there

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
knot with all three strings so there

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.400 
knot with all three strings so there
should<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> loop<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> end<00:00:48.480> with

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
should be like a loop on the end with

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.139 
should be like a loop on the end with
that<00:00:49.590> loop<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.280> attach<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.969> gonna

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that loop you can attach it I'm gonna

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
that loop you can attach it I'm gonna
attach<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.690> hook<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.680> attach

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
attach it to this hook so you can attach

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
attach it to this hook so you can attach
it<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.610> anything<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.570> we're<00:00:54.690> gonna

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it to like anything and then we're gonna

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.229 
it to like anything and then we're gonna
make<00:00:55.050> sure<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> ends<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.250> free<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
make sure all the ends are free so you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.939 
make sure all the ends are free so you
have<00:00:57.510> three<00:00:57.809> strands<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.440> gonna<00:00:58.530> cut<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
have three strands we're gonna cut that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.459 
have three strands we're gonna cut that
really<00:00:59.219> quickly<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.140> then<00:01:01.140> we're<00:01:01.379> gonna

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
really quickly and then we're gonna

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.410 
really quickly and then we're gonna
start<00:01:01.710> braiding<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> don't<00:01:03.239> really

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
start braiding now if you don't really

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
start braiding now if you don't really
know<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> braid<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.439> actually<00:01:04.710> made<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
know how to braid I actually made a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.179 
know how to braid I actually made a
tutorial<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:06.210> beginner<00:01:06.390> braiders<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
tutorial for beginner braiders and it is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
tutorial for beginner braiders and it is
right<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.570> sure<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.780> check<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and we're gonna take our three pieces

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520 
and we're gonna take our three pieces
and<00:01:15.420> we're<00:01:15.540> gonna<00:01:15.630> make<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.200> tight

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and we're gonna make a really tight

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
and we're gonna make a really tight
braid<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.430> gonna<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.180> two

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
braid and you're gonna do about two

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
braid and you're gonna do about two
inches<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.320> braiding<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.070> itself<00:01:20.369> you're

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
inches of braiding just by itself you're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.109 
inches of braiding just by itself you're
just<00:01:21.299> gonna<00:01:21.420> continue<00:01:21.840> braiding<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> now<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
just gonna continue braiding so now that

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.490 
just gonna continue braiding so now that
we<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> little<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> braiding<00:01:25.259> done

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
we have a little bit of braiding done

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
we have a little bit of braiding done
it's<00:01:26.009> time<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> start<00:01:26.580> adding<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.210> hexans

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's time to start adding in the hexans

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.420 
it's time to start adding in the hexans
when<00:01:28.049> you're<00:01:28.170> putting<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> hex<00:01:28.920> nuts<00:01:29.220> it's

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
when you're putting on the hex nuts it's

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090 
when you're putting on the hex nuts it's
actually<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:30.119> hard<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.409> takes<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
actually really hard so it takes a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.710 
actually really hard so it takes a
couple<00:01:32.280> tries<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> stick

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
couple tries so you just have to stick

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.410 
couple tries so you just have to stick
with<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.670> just<00:01:35.670> take<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> few

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
with it and really just take a few

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
with it and really just take a few
combing<00:01:36.990> breaths<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.590> try<00:01:37.829> again<00:01:37.979> because

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
combing breaths and try again because

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.249 
combing breaths and try again because

strings but I'm really tight and pull

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.870 
strings but I'm really tight and pull
this<00:02:04.619> string<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:04.950> I'm<00:02:05.399> gonna<00:02:05.579> take<00:02:05.759> another

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
this string out I'm gonna take another

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.210 
this string out I'm gonna take another
hex<00:02:06.270> net

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
hex net

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.600 
hex net
put<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:08.910> through<00:02:09.440> whoop<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.710> then<00:02:11.340> you're

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
put it through whoop and then you're

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.510 
put it through whoop and then you're
gonna<00:02:11.730> take<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.060> same<00:02:13.220> you're<00:02:14.220> gonna<00:02:14.310> do

another<00:02:14.640> braid<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:16.080> then<00:02:16.170> you're<00:02:16.320> gonna

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
another braid and then you're gonna

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.530 
another braid and then you're gonna
continue<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.460> like<00:02:17.640> ten<00:02:18.060> or<00:02:18.180> eleven

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
continue this for like ten or eleven

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
continue this for like ten or eleven
turns<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.110> always<00:02:19.320> grab<00:02:19.740> two<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.460> then

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
turns so you always grab two and then

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:46.030 
turns so you always grab two and then
with<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.850> third<00:02:21.120> one<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.900> put<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> bead<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.590> it

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.830 

so<00:02:47.040> we<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.370> put<00:02:47.550> our<00:02:47.640> last<00:02:47.970> hex<00:02:48.300> nut<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.660> there

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
so we just put our last hex nut on there

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.180 
so we just put our last hex nut on there
and<00:02:49.020> then<00:02:49.170> we're<00:02:49.290> gonna<00:02:49.380> continue<00:02:49.620> braiding

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and then we're gonna continue braiding

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.790 
and then we're gonna continue braiding
so<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.390> make<00:02:51.630> sure<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:51.960> tight<00:02:52.230> so

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
so just make sure it's really tight so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.250 
so just make sure it's really tight so
that<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.910> hex<00:02:54.090> nuts<00:02:54.300> don't<00:02:54.480> fall<00:02:54.600> out<00:02:54.630> and

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that the hex nuts don't fall out and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.470 
that the hex nuts don't fall out and
you're<00:02:55.380> just<00:02:55.410> gonna<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:56.400> more<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.970> two<00:02:57.240> more

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
you're just gonna do more like two more

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.940 
you're just gonna do more like two more
inches<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.930> tight<00:02:58.110> braiding<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.740> did<00:02:58.860> in

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
inches of tight braiding like you did in

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.940 
inches of tight braiding like you did in
the<00:02:59.040> beginning<00:03:00.080> now<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.740> braid

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the beginning now that we have the braid

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.850 
the beginning now that we have the braid
finished<00:03:02.460> we<00:03:03.090> are<00:03:03.240> just<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.810> grab<00:03:04.530> all
