I'm<00:00:06.120> head<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.479> neck<00:00:06.569> cancers<00:00:07.109> are<00:00:07.649> treated<00:00:08.309> in

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
I'm head and neck cancers are treated in

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.270 
I'm head and neck cancers are treated in
a<00:00:09.330> couple<00:00:09.660> different<00:00:09.990> ways<00:00:10.139> number<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:11.129> do

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
a couple different ways number one we do

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.279 
a couple different ways number one we do
surgery<00:00:11.610> I'm<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> head<00:00:12.299> and<00:00:12.389> neck<00:00:12.450> surgeon<00:00:12.539> so

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
surgery I'm a head and neck surgeon so

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.859 
surgery I'm a head and neck surgeon so
that's<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.920> treat<00:00:16.430> patients<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.330> lot<00:00:18.779> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that's how I treat patients but a lot of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.060 
that's how I treat patients but a lot of
the<00:00:18.960> patients<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.770> are<00:00:19.919> also

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the patients that we see are also

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.979 
the patients that we see are also
treated<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:20.849> other<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.630> such<00:00:21.960> as

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:21.989 
treated with other things such as

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.819 
treated with other things such as
radiation<00:00:22.649> therapy<00:00:23.520> chemotherapy<00:00:24.419> and<00:00:25.349> some

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
radiation therapy chemotherapy and some

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.069 
radiation therapy chemotherapy and some
of<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.070> new<00:00:26.480> biologically<00:00:27.480> targeted

of the new biologically targeted

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.859 
of the new biologically targeted
therapies<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.430> we<00:00:29.610> use<00:00:29.790> these<00:00:30.090> each<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.630> these

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
therapies and we use these each of these

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.749 
therapies and we use these each of these
treatments<00:00:31.619> either<00:00:31.890> alone<00:00:32.219> or<00:00:32.520> in

treatments either alone or in
combination<00:00:33.620> our<00:00:34.620> findings<00:00:35.129> show<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:36.140> while

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
combination our findings show that while

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
combination our findings show that while
we<00:00:37.320> used<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.940> try<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.970> identify<00:00:39.380> a<00:00:40.790> treatment

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
we used to try to identify a treatment

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.400 
we used to try to identify a treatment
that<00:00:41.970> would<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.150> good<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.810> majority<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that would be good for the majority of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.140 
that would be good for the majority of
head<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.650> neck<00:00:43.770> cancer<00:00:44.000> patients<00:00:45.000> or

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
patients with any cancer what we found

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.390 
patients with any cancer what we found
with<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.600> study<00:00:48.990> by<00:00:49.260> looking<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.130> the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
with this study by looking at all the

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.460 
with this study by looking at all the
different<00:00:50.610> genes<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.870> whether<00:00:52.200> they're

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
different genes and whether they're

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.040 
different genes and whether they're
mutated<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.250> cancer<00:00:53.790> we've<00:00:54.540> been<00:00:54.720> able<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
mutated in cancer we've been able to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.420 
mutated in cancer we've been able to
find<00:00:55.650> that<00:00:55.920> each<00:00:56.780> patients<00:00:57.780> tumor<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.530> unique

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
find that each patients tumor is unique

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.340 
find that each patients tumor is unique
and<00:00:59.760> has<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.000> different<00:01:00.510> combination<00:01:00.720> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and has a different combination of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.729 
and has a different combination of
mutations<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.880> makes<00:01:03.690> sense<00:01:04.049> why<00:01:04.320> some

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
mutations and this makes sense why some

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.069 
mutations and this makes sense why some
patients<00:01:04.920> haven't<00:01:05.790> responded<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.479> two

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
patients haven't responded to two

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.080 
patients haven't responded to two
treatments<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.710> work<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.189> other<00:01:08.340> patients

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
treatments that work for other patients

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.739 
treatments that work for other patients
and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.929> really<00:01:10.139> supports<00:01:10.469> this<00:01:11.009> notion<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:11.749 
and it really supports this notion of

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:16.129 
and it really supports this notion of
personalized<00:01:12.749> cancer<00:01:13.049> therapy<00:01:13.700> where<00:01:15.139> rather

mutations<00:02:26.080> do<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.770> our<00:02:26.980> conventional

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
mutations do with our conventional

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.140 
mutations do with our conventional
treatments<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.570> surgery<00:02:29.130> radiation

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150

see whether patients with these

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.080 
see whether patients with these

don't<00:02:40.360> have<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.840> mutations<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.220> if<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.520> find

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
don't have the mutations and if we find

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.820 
don't have the mutations and if we find
that<00:02:42.940> they<00:02:43.090> do<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.780> helps<00:02:44.140> us<00:02:44.320> to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
that they do then that helps us to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.280 
that they do then that helps us to
identify<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> group<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.970> patients<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.720> need

identify a group of patients that need
additional<00:02:47.650> or<00:02:48.130> different<00:02:48.180> treatments<00:02:49.180> and

additional or different treatments and

additional or different treatments and
