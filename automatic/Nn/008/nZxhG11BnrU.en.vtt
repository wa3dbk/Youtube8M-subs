00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.100
 hello friends networks with a touch of 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.650
 love we are back 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.170
 We mix a rich recipe for problems 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.180
 alien to us we can not record 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.019
 but good today we bring musicians 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.050
 global ingredients are appearing 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:24.599
 we only start with the dough 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 we are going to need first is to incorporate 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.679
 the butter remember that they have to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.679
 be butter salt 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.320
 and with our hands we are going to go to 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.320
 marshall 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.300
 as you can see, it's a little bit like teddy bears 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.300
 we are going to add the egg yolks 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.080
 like integrate it with our hands 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.210
 we are going to add the beer we use 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.390
 all the houses if we're not going to be 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.390
 speaking that the beyond 60 handles well 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.690
 a little bit in beer I'll go back to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.400
 add sting to this as I tell them it's going to 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.950
 depend on how you feel the structure 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.320
 of the mass 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.420
 try not to spend too much of the liquid 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.420
 so that they fit 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.020
 with this from the masses if you're 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.700
 If I know how to bake, but the tones continue 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.050
 how am I doing it and if you will see that 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.960
 the two outputs as is 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:06.430
 and then let's put the mass of plane 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.430
 we give you two teeth closes 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.900
 I do not want to make balls 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.450
 but if it is not already back fast 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.450
 list 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.910
 of apple let's let rest 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.530
 about an hour about you 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.530
 let's put a shot 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.860
 but when you do not have a mold I'm going to 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.580
 give a useful option 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.360
 we have the oven tray we are going to 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.069
 assign or lining with aluminum that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.340
 this all we all have in our 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.340
 houses 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.640
 they connect us to waxed paper so that 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.620
 do not stick the dough then the dough 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.620
 let's live two parts 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.600
 the doubles let's pass the same 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.600
 same box 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.560
 and we are going to extend it 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.650
 remains because it is again the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:46.180
 size of which our mold in the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.180
 grill of the two 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.390
 since we have the square is good no 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.850
 it's so perfect but there we're going to pass it 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.210
 with it from another person on the grill 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.560
 of the wada communal tray stove 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.560
 and then you extend 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.750
 let's go adding the ingredients 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.750
 first the ham for the whole mass 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.150
 then the pineapple 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.000
 finally the ethics 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.139
 can also add I cook and move to 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.229
 a musician 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:49.180
 and this one is oaxaca can add also 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.180
 Manchego cheese is going to be world 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.910
 and we have the same session with and 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.390
 from another person we are going to put the other 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.890
 cap 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.890
 let's go to them 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.060
 and very manageable bases throw a lot like this 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.350
 Do not talk about problems, let's try 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.350
 to teach all the edges 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.030
 placing the dough inwards towards 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.699
 in always let's put a little 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.189
 of milk this is to give them a 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.039
 brilliant finish at the end of the 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:37.490
 baking the colon let's put an egg 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.490
 whole 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.390
 and we like to pass if you have a skewer 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.120
 it's much better I do not really have and 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.970
 that's why he does not say with a spatula but 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.970
 what if they have 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.970
 best 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.260
 excuse me for my voice I'm a little 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.849
 afÃ³nico but I would not stop 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.580
 work it and avoid this video 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.709
 what do I know they're going to like and then they 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.490
 leaves approximately one 

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:14.889
 hour 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.629
 always external after half an hour 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.050
 they are always checking because it depends on 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.379
 every oven 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.639
 the winter has as it is only 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:27.020
 numbers so I put it between 3 and 4 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.610
 lately not now but I always know what 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.610
 we spend half an hour 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.910
 let's serve 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.800
 with a dressing that is the same as 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.710
 used for banderillas and that in 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.370
 that video and there it is is to right and with 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.370
 habanero 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.630
 good is ready to eat remember 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.340
 that soon the video the channel this 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.360
 forgiveness is also going to become a 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.360
 craft channel
