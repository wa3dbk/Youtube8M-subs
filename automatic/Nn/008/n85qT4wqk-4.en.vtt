00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.370
 welcome guys and I don't have the blog time 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.170
 I'm back a fantastic new video thing 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.299
 let's really make a video today 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.730
 very interesting for owners of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 an iphone any device with ios 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.510
 7 but first of all I wanted kids 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.760
 show you my latest creation with 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.170
 photoshop and how you see this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.189
 here in the background I really hope that you 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 like it a lot 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.960
 it really took a long time 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.570
 we do about four and a half hours 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.010
 good or bad is beaten down well 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.930
 I'm really very happy together 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 to the other that it was precisely this here that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.230
 the had already seen in the previous 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.550
 video I had told you in point if you 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.289
 like these types of graphic types 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 written so you ask me 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.950
 I do the tutorial when I receive a 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.329
 substantial number of requests because 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.510
 while we are asked by a few, I cannot 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.739
 do it however the tutorial or for this for 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.520
 this one you choose does not change 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.840
 remembered the boys to always be 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.160
 beautiful I like what I say you saw the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.260
 video because at the end I put some at the end 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 maybe many are already doing away and yes 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.619
 they forget, in fact, many have 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.090
 asked nardÃ² of the beginning of the video mi 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.290
 like because I forget that if 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.299
 I would like to put it anyway , it's fine 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 so secondary it does not matter I go on 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.509
 with this video 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.119
 so what should we do as you have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.979
 read from the title improve speed 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.110
 to the fluidity the battery and the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.970
 ayas i7 temperature with three 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 very simple steps 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.270
 we immediately see boys where we have to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.909
 let's go on over to settings 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
 in hand I am using reflector with the air 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.900
 play mirroring if you have not seen the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.700
 video to download the comic effect on 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.590
 link here somewhere or here 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.259
 below in description let's go on 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 settings and we immediately look for general information 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.360
 let's go on general and click on 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.149
 accessibility once you go up 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.470
 accessibility we see guys 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.899
 we will have to go lower with a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 fast scrolling super reduce speed 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.250
 as you can see we click is written 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.780
 deactivated we will have to activate that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.750
 what allows you to do this is the thing 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.420
 the first thing you base on let's say lets 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 remove the 3d effect that occurs when 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.630
 let's move the iphone 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 in the background with the icons then 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.539
 the 3d effect got away before yes 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.970
 they moved second now it's gone 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.099
 because it really consumes a lot 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.200
 battery I can assure you is the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.800
 phone heats up considerably but 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.090
 this is the minor change now 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.310
 we want to see the bigger ones that 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.590
 will make the iphone or any 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.100
 much faster and more device 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.470
 fluid then we go on mail contacts 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.269
 and calendars this operation which 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.510
 let's go to do the notifications 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.739
 push and then download new data 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.709
 we will publish and deactivate these 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.720
 push them off because not because 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.319
 we don't want push notifications but why 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.239
 on ios 7 beta the third are 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.430
 really annoying because 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.680
 they work badly on beta 2 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.120
 overheating and ramini was 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.010
 minimized compared to bollard 1 instead 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.170
 it has just returned to blame for a 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.910
 because of these push notifications not 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.440
 you will lose nothing quiet and notifications 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.450
 the same will arrive but you will avoid 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.250
 that this thing remains in the background 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.650
 all the time looking for new data every 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.959
 15 minutes to have a pretty thing 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.790
 annoying then back to settings 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.120
 now let's go to privacy 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.100
 let's go to the location and below all 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.070
 the applications you see some services 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.660
 system once found here we will have to 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.730
 remove enough services from 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.350
 localization that are useless that 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.700
 they just waste bacterial 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.230
 you really see a marked improvement 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.350
 so we remove those that are useless 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.480
 type cleri calibration compass diagnosis 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.769
 use jadida position 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.510
 we don't need this fusion gene 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.810
 popular near hi-fi research 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.280
 we keep mobile phone traffic 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.810
 better keep this doctors too 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.130
 frequent position that I didn't have to 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.739
 change absolutely nothing then 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.540
 just remove the first five and see 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.430
 a clear improvement if you do 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.870
 obvious that he was not yet 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.459
 improving perfectly also remove 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.209
 the height of time nothing happens 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.489
 so dramatic and guys that's it 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.660
 let's see when we got four 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.519
 minutes and six video guys are 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.620
 becoming shorter and shorter guys 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.569
 I know why the problem is too fast 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.040
 but that's how you like it 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.959
 immediate is not that I have to stay so much 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.569
 loll so I always try to do 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.670
 quite immediate things and nothing 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.409
 what guys talk about it in 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.040
 next video I wanted to make a video 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:21.040
 let's see if you like this 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.950
 This novelty of a pair of headphones 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.260
 of fantastic bluetooth headphones that 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.510
 I think they are the best headphones for 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.640
 the sport I really will call it that 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.380
 the best video headphones for sports 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.360
 for something of the sort glass chosen for 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.710
 English heard in Italian only 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.270
 really very valid I told you 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.710
 already some video makes that I would have done it 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.420
 this video, however, in the end I never have 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.850
 mounted because it annoyed me it takes a while 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.770
 of time is a total time but now the 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.360
 I have time and I can do it then 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.700
 let's see if next week maybe 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.190
 it was week here that I can do 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.810
 this video of things indeed 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.360
 above that I told you before bluetooth 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.190
 which are fantastic guys have nothing 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.590
