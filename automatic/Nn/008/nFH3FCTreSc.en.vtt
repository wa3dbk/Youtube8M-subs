the information just doesn't get
transmitted<00:02:27.360> i<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.690> it's<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.930> logistical

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230

there's<00:02:30.360> anything<00:02:30.570> necessarily<00:02:31.320> deliberate

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
there's anything necessarily deliberate

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.880 
there's anything necessarily deliberate
about<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.640> or<00:02:33.290> underhanded<00:02:34.290> about<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.860> just

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
about it or underhanded about it it just

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.340 
about it or underhanded about it it just
happened<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.030> bottom<00:02:36.210> line<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:37.140> think

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
happened so the bottom line is I think

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.090

the eyes I'm looking at them through so

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.120 
the eyes I'm looking at them through so
in<00:02:54.510> percentage<00:02:54.959> terms<00:02:54.990> very<00:02:55.440> quickly<00:02:55.770> because

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
in percentage terms very quickly because

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.920 
in percentage terms very quickly because
we<00:02:56.220> always<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.850> Ted<00:02:57.120> where<00:02:57.360> are<00:02:57.510> we<00:02:57.690> on

gold and silver in terms of

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.970 
gold and silver in terms of
deterioration<00:02:59.900> okay<00:03:00.900> based<00:03:01.170> upon<00:03:01.590> my

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
deterioration okay based upon my

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.640 
deterioration okay based upon my
subjective<00:03:02.660> analysis<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.870> what<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> think

subjective analysis of what I think

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.500 
subjective analysis of what I think
really<00:03:04.950> took<00:03:05.280> place<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.760> Tuesday<00:03:06.330> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
really took place on Tuesday and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.990 
really took place on Tuesday and
certainly<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.080> Wednesday<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.860> detect<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.790> big

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
certainly on Wednesday I detect a big

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.580 
certainly on Wednesday I detect a big
improvement<00:03:09.390> even<00:03:09.840> though<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.260> didn't<00:03:10.530> show

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
improvement even though it didn't show

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.699 
improvement even though it didn't show
it<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.459> week<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.270> report<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.590> think

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
it in this week to report so I think

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.790 
it in this week to report so I think
that<00:03:14.100> we<00:03:14.610> have<00:03:14.970> we're<00:03:15.330> better<00:03:15.630> by<00:03:15.930> about<00:03:16.140> four

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
that we have we're better by about four

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.860
