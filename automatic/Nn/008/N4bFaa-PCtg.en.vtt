00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
two sinks which I don't know if we

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.039 
two sinks which I don't know if we
hardly<00:03:10.040> ever<00:03:10.130> use<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:10.970> sink<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.870> I

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
hardly ever use to that sink that I

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.780 
hardly ever use to that sink that I
guess<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.620> nice<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.160> convenient<00:03:13.670> if
