00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.430
 why a smart watch needs to do with 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.070
 abs 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.949
 samsung's answer seems to be everything 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.720
 that a smartphone makes equipped with a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.760
 modem of which is one of the few 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.529
 clocks capable of connecting to networks 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.110
 3g of cellular 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 unlike other stores 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.489
 smart it receives notifications 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.379
 even without a smartphone pairing 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.840
 the speakers are also good. 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.450
 enough to make voice calls 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.930
 The only difficulty is getting used to talking 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.430
 with his own wrist he spoke franklin and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.430
 How are things still inflated? 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.949
 so it's ok, it's more theatrical we do 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.220
 voice calls is just the beginning of this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.040
 watch also has wifi gps and 4gb of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.229
 memory for storing images and music 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.510
 samsung has not forgotten either of the bar other 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.510
 nor of the ultra violet ray sensor 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.740
 to manage so many resources the company 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.159
 Korea has opted to use the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.960
 operating system such as android is the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.290
 advantage of the team in its huge 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:36.350
 flexibility it is possible to change the face 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.350
 Watch the colors and even the same source there 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.869
 still a reasonable selection of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.649
 applications that can be installed on your 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.649
 from mobile 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.250
 but as in other watches 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.380
 its main function is to display 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.579
 notifications of programs installed on the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.579
 telephone 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.979
 at this point the ps is well showing the whole 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.159
 content even of my existence 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.810
 although the system is highly 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.819
 customizable and functional large number 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.739
 resources that it offers to be 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.849
 processor for the dual core processor 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.410
 of s 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.840
 which presents delays with certain 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.880
 often though not performance 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.040
 was a problem the fact is that putting 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.680
 a smartphone interface on a screen 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.769
 2 inches is not a good idea to use 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.250
 the keyboard for example is an exercise 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.709
 frustrating 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.750
 Another problem is the fact that the guide is 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.780
 can only be stopped with 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.680
 line galaxy running android 4.3 or 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 higher 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.329
 in the end, ps does it well 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.200
 that the smartphone could still do 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.700
 best 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.709
 but for those who need the whole 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.500
 versatility of a mobile phone in a 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.250
 smaller and can afford the price of 1,500 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.650
 real 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.650
 these martin both unbeatable at the moment
