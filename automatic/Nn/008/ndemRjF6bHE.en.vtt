just faster than most other machines

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.350 
just faster than most other machines
it's<00:02:51.510> faster<00:02:52.230> heavier<00:02:52.709> built<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.060> even

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
it's faster heavier built you can even

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.440 
it's faster heavier built you can even
time<00:02:54.680> by<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.739> by<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> sound<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.239> can
