00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.360 
kind of medium and I'll leave them there
for<00:02:34.819> 24<00:02:35.540> hours<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.230> then<00:02:36.290> I'll<00:02:36.590> check<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.160> them

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
for 24 hours and then I'll check on them

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.780 
for 24 hours and then I'll check on them
then<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:37.970> might<00:02:38.150> have<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.329> rotate<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> few<00:02:39.549> of<00:02:40.549> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
then I might have to rotate a few of the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.940 
then I might have to rotate a few of the
apricots<00:02:41.299> around<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.049> they<00:02:42.349> get<00:02:42.530> evenly

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
apricots around so that they get evenly

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.300 
apricots around so that they get evenly
dried<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.670> then<00:02:44.450> flip<00:02:44.810> them<00:02:44.930> over<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.950> then

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
dried and then flip them over and then

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.640 
dried and then flip them over and then
let<00:02:46.489> them<00:02:46.610> go<00:02:46.640> for<00:02:47.150> probably<00:02:47.540> another<00:02:48.140> 12

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
let them go for probably another 12

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.420 
let them go for probably another 12
hours

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
hours

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.420 
hours
so<00:02:49.910> apricots<00:02:50.420> are<00:02:50.630> juicy<00:02:51.170> they<00:02:51.349> take<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.889> longer

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
so apricots are juicy they take a longer

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.940 
so apricots are juicy they take a longer
than<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.639> lot<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.030> fruits<00:02:53.329> but<00:02:53.780> that's<00:02:54.709> how<00:02:54.920> you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
than a lot of fruits but that's how you

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.530 
than a lot of fruits but that's how you
do<00:02:55.250> hide<00:02:55.459> rate<00:02:55.730> apricots

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
do hide rate apricots

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.020 
do hide rate apricots
I'll<00:02:56.660> show<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.049> part<00:02:57.410> two<00:02:57.560> later<00:02:57.819> that's<00:02:58.819> all

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I'll show you part two later that's all

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.720 
I'll show you part two later that's all
