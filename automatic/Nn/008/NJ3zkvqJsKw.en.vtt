00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
it seemed very flat this afternoon what

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.830 
it seemed very flat this afternoon what
did<00:00:17.290> you<00:00:17.380> make<00:00:17.590> of<00:00:17.620> it<00:00:18.090> well<00:00:19.090> there's<00:00:19.510> no<00:00:19.630> doubt

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
did you make of it well there's no doubt

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.390 
did you make of it well there's no doubt
aboard<00:00:20.170> at<00:00:20.350> all<00:00:20.560> Bertie<00:00:20.950> that<00:00:21.070> was<00:00:21.190> difficult

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
aboard at all Bertie that was difficult

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.150 
aboard at all Bertie that was difficult
for<00:00:21.670> us<00:00:22.140> especially<00:00:23.140> in<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.439> first<00:00:23.680> half<00:00:23.980> and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
for us especially in the first half and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.580 
for us especially in the first half and
I<00:00:24.369> think<00:00:24.730> that<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.750> disappointment<00:00:26.410> thing

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
I think that the disappointment thing

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.070 
I think that the disappointment thing
for<00:00:27.279> me<00:00:27.400> is<00:00:27.520> that<00:00:27.550> amount<00:00:28.150> of<00:00:28.300> mistakes<00:00:28.450> we

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
for me is that amount of mistakes we

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.740 
for me is that amount of mistakes we
made<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.460> when<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.640> come<00:00:30.820> here<00:00:31.119> when<00:00:31.660> you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
made and when you come here when you

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.270 
made and when you come here when you
come<00:00:31.930> here<00:00:32.110> or<00:00:32.379> anywhere<00:00:32.739> at<00:00:32.830> our<00:00:32.949> level<00:00:33.220> in

come here or anywhere at our level in
the<00:00:33.370> Premier<00:00:33.699> League<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.840> you<00:00:35.290> can't<00:00:35.530> make

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the Premier League then you can't make

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.040 
the Premier League then you can't make

snapped<00:02:16.280> into<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> tackle<00:02:16.970> or<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:18.290> rhythm<00:02:18.560> we

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
snapped into a tackle or the rhythm we

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.040 
snapped into a tackle or the rhythm we
found<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.100> very<00:02:19.130> very<00:02:19.370> difficult<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.900> get

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
found it very very difficult to to get

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.360 
found it very very difficult to to get
anywhere<00:02:21.380> near<00:02:21.440> them<00:02:21.800> particularly<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
anywhere near them particularly in the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.280 
anywhere near them particularly in the
first<00:02:22.520> half<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.540> when<00:02:23.720> you're<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> really

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
first half and when you're a really

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.309 
first half and when you're a really
really<00:02:24.319> good<00:02:24.770> side<00:02:25.010> like<00:02:25.760> they<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.060> then<00:02:27.020> you

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
really good side like they are then you

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.650 
really good side like they are then you
know<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.950> rely<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.400> your<00:02:28.730> organization<00:02:29.569> and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
know you rely on your organization and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.970 
know you rely on your organization and
but<00:02:29.810> you're<00:02:30.020> right<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.440> was<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> difficult

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
but you're right it was a difficult

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.830 
but you're right it was a difficult
afternoon<00:02:31.700> from<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> moment<00:02:32.450> we<00:02:32.540> went<00:02:32.660> out

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
afternoon from the moment we went out

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.470 
afternoon from the moment we went out
there<00:02:33.050> we<00:02:33.110> didn't<00:02:33.890> get<00:02:33.950> amongst<00:02:34.250> them<00:02:34.480> we

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
there we didn't get amongst them we

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.150 
there we didn't get amongst them we
didn't<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:36.350> didn't<00:02:36.560> get<00:02:36.620> after<00:02:36.890> them<00:02:37.010> well

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.699 
didn't we didn't get after them well
enough<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.580> can<00:02:37.760> accept<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:39.410> was<00:02:39.560> very

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
enough I can accept that but it was very

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.199 
enough I can accept that but it was very
very<00:02:39.950> difficult<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:40.550> when<00:02:40.850> we<00:02:40.940> got<00:02:41.060> it

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
very difficult because when we got it

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.330 
very difficult because when we got it
back<00:02:41.330> we<00:02:42.170> kept<00:02:42.440> giving<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.769> straight<00:02:42.980> back<00:02:43.160> to

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
back we kept giving it straight back to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.540 
back we kept giving it straight back to
them<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.610> made<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.850> very<00:02:43.910> very<00:02:44.239> difficult<00:02:44.420> I
