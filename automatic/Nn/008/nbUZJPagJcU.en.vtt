weekend visitor of York and my parents

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.620

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
so friendly and welcoming and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.310 
so friendly and welcoming and
knowledgeable<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.820> they<00:00:29.180> served<00:00:29.480> us<00:00:29.779> lobster

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
knowledgeable and they served us lobster

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.889 
knowledgeable and they served us lobster
rolls<00:00:31.029> most<00:00:32.029> people<00:00:32.300> think<00:00:32.450> they're<00:00:32.599> coming

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
rolls most people think they're coming

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.760 
rolls most people think they're coming
to<00:00:33.020> a<00:00:33.050> resort<00:00:33.530> as<00:00:33.829> opposed<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.280> a<00:00:34.399> hospital<00:00:35.770> so

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
to a resort as opposed to a hospital so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.470 
to a resort as opposed to a hospital so
I<00:00:36.829> think<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.490> gives<00:00:37.700> perception<00:00:38.330> that

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
I think that gives perception that

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.030 
I think that gives perception that
they're<00:00:38.660> already<00:00:38.930> being<00:00:39.200> taken<00:00:39.470> care<00:00:39.830> of

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
they're already being taken care of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.220 
they're already being taken care of
most<00:00:41.000> people<00:00:41.300> often<00:00:41.570> tell<00:00:41.720> us<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:42.020> it's

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
most people often tell us that it's

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.440 
most people often tell us that it's
quiet<00:00:42.650> and<00:00:43.040> there's<00:00:43.220> no<00:00:43.340> one<00:00:43.460> here<00:00:43.850> when<00:00:44.420> we

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
quiet and there's no one here when we

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.870 
quiet and there's no one here when we
could<00:00:44.870> be<00:00:45.190> really<00:00:46.190> very<00:00:46.430> busy

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
could be really very busy

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.090 
could be really very busy
so<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.780> think<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.170> gives<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.590> patients<00:00:49.010> are

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
so I think it gives the patients are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.490 
so I think it gives the patients are
doing<00:00:49.220> it<00:00:49.400> perception<00:00:50.150> of<00:00:50.300> relaxation<00:00:50.960> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
doing it perception of relaxation and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.390 
doing it perception of relaxation and
being<00:00:51.860> taken<00:00:52.070> care<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.820> promotes<00:00:53.660> feeling

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
being taken care of and promotes feeling

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.010 
being taken care of and promotes feeling
community<00:00:55.400> based<00:00:55.640> Hospital<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:56.480> the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
community based Hospital that the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.319 
community based Hospital that the
patient<00:00:57.350> variety<00:00:57.800> is<00:00:57.860> really<00:00:58.310> diverse<00:00:58.880> you

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
patient variety is really diverse you

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.660 
patient variety is really diverse you
see<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> lot<00:00:59.810> of<00:00:59.900> different<00:01:00.170> things<00:01:00.490> every<00:01:01.490> time

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
see a lot of different things every time

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.280 
see a lot of different things every time
you<00:01:01.760> come<00:01:01.970> in<00:01:02.150> is<00:01:02.270> something<00:01:02.570> different<00:01:02.810> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
you come in is something different the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.049 
you come in is something different the
patients<00:01:03.680> are<00:01:03.800> different<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.400> diagnosis<00:01:04.939> is

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
patients are different the diagnosis is

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.710 
patients are different the diagnosis is
different<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.860> we<00:01:06.950> do<00:01:07.159> see<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.549> lot<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.119> variety
