00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.799
 kings héctor suárez good afternoon what 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.599
 such oscar very good afternoon is transmitted 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.300
 from hidden port to introduce yourself 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.700
 a note where we can observe a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.560
 organism that lives in the sea and that is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.050
 very important for the health of the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.270
 corals it's about the fish surgeons 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.630
 and some nice features of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.210
 Let's go there 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.279
 between the reefs and rocks of the coast 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.679
 Oaxacan there are countless 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.829
 species that at first glance behave 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.840
 as harmless organisms some of 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.449
 these species are the so-called fish 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.879
 surgeons are goldfish that 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.730
 they hide two and two knives near their 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.850
 caudal fin can cause a severe 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.769
 cut against whoever captures them 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.100
 connoisseurs consider them fish 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.229
 dangerous however two accidents do not 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
 are frequent in this species in the 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.739
 video we see what the fish are 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.049
 surgeon a very large bank fish 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.080
 surgeon these fish feed on what 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.030
 which is the flora that grows near the 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.790
 stones there are not many fish that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.409
 we see that they are scratching on the stones 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.060
 In fact, the 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.790
 researchers of the national park 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.950
 Huatulco explain that these fish are 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.110
 indicators of the health status of 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.329
 reef the surgeon 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.609
 let's say it's a kind of reef 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.240
 which has two slopes can be 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.920
 indicator of the health of an ecosystem 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.859
 the responsibility to keep the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.319
 healthy ecosystems is everyone's first 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.079
 step is not to throw garbage or pour water 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.450
 polluted to the sea the drainages the 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.340
 hotel zones that the one of the other one leaves 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.349
 at sea among fish species 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 surgeon there are a few that are 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.299
 Poisonous fortunately none of them 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.189
 lives in the Mexican coasts but all 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.270
 they have their experiences ready or 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.820
 natural scalpels to defend themselves 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.490
 oscar these animals enter into symbiosis 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.149
 with the coral and prevent the growth 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.159
 to see its seaweed side can kill 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.160
 that coral which in turn is very important 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.269
 for all the marine ecology that 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.950
 the information we want is here in 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.810
 the Oaxacan coast of hidden support 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.549
 between thank you very good respect 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.290
 afternoons you have thrown the team of 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.290
 correspondents thanks
