 hi I'm on fire and you watch my 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:05.449
 video blog 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.580
 I showed you two in the previous issue 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.830
 products from Pavlovo Posad shawls 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.550
 Now I want to continue and show you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.380
 This red skirt in this skirt I 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.810
 combined a scarf with matching color 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.499
 cloth fabric I chose to suit hydrochloric 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.259
 soft 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.359
 well draped and style too 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.999
 fairly simple with soft pleats 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.430
 belt in front of the skirt inset of 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.920
 the handkerchief and handkerchief here is sewn to the main 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.140
 The fabrics on the shawls are laid deep 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.650
 folds smoothly into folds from 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.510
 Suiting cloth shawl fabric in this skirt 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.700
 glued around the perimeter of glue on 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.710
 fabric base as lining 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 i used a soft mesh fabric 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.720
 I did the lining as well as the skirt with 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.580
 soft folds at the master class belt 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.300
 the highway of this skirt can be seen in 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:02.730
 archive of my print blog today 8 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.309
 September and 1 regular reader 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.979
 my blog is Marie's birthday 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.859
 I wish you a happy holiday 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.520
 you sewing inspiration a lot of ideas and 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.829
 the most important time for their realization 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.969
 By the way, Mari made her holiday 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.979
 similar skirt 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.109
 Now I want to talk about what 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.759
 wearing this skirt was originally my skirt 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.179
 was conceived and sewn for one 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.369
 holiday event unfortunately 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.439
 up some kind of fuel shirt in 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.619
 I didnâ€™t find the stores so we 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.749
 I decided to sew myself in the end 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.479
 I turned in the company to this skirt 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.609
 Here is such a brilliant top it tramples 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.530
 from jersey with a very interesting texture 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.420
 such a little golden is beautiful 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.539
 complements the skirt creates a solemn 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.539
 mood 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.140
 my skirt is not at all casual but I 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.649
 still plan to wear it a couple of times this 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.330
 in the autumn 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.019
 adding for example this brown 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.019
 a jacket 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.490
 Now I want to talk about how and what 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.670
 I am often asked to sew from scarves 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.150
 advice on how to make sewing 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.400
 handkerchiefs 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.520
 I can immediately say that some 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.030
 universal advice does not exist all 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.680
 depends on a particular shawl 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.660
 that is, you must look at 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.150
 the one you have 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.480
 either you are going to buy everything 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.340
 shawls are very different with different patterns 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.350
 different colors and it is definitely worth it 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.420
 consider when you sew from scarves 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.880
 but for example the red scarf this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.360
 shawl very bright very so active 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.660
 the color of the central part of the scarf is enough 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 free here small pictures 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.480
 small ornament of flowers by 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.580
 perimeter shawl more active 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.350
 contrasting ornament of flowers such 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.570
 handkerchief 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.900
 difficult to use and stitch 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.480
 I only think that the product will be 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.000
 challenging i would recommend this kind 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.590
 shawls use as 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.110
 add any product like 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.700
 for example my skirt also some parts 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.890
 I think this shawl will be good 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.190
 look like decorations for example 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.510
 jacket here blue shawl more soothing 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.420
 there are tones in it 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.239
 frequent small ornament there is a large 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.739
 ornament is horizontal can say 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.170
 that working with such a handkerchief is much 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.080
 easier and from such a handkerchief can quite 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.610
 get a skirt or jacket as a whole think 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.610
 that you can sew the whole product out of it 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.650
 Now I want to show you a handkerchief 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:05.550
 which captured my mind and heart and in 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.650
 whose next release I will sew 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.950
 something very interesting is this shawl in 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.090
 very calm colors, perhaps this is the most 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.990
 light shawl that i ever 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.570
 came across with very interesting places 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.380
 catchy somewhere not from drawing and because 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.810
 this scarf I will sew practically 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.190
 coat and what you get 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.190
