something<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.299> first<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
something you have to do first so it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
something you have to do first so it
does<00:01:16.680> require<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.520> bit<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.850> planning

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
but um it's really a wonderful way to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.170 
but um it's really a wonderful way to
get<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.509> effect<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.280> still<00:01:23.280> keep<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
course you could always go in later with

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450

if<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.399> keep<00:01:59.579> saturating<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.270> paper<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
if you keep saturating the paper and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
if you keep saturating the paper and
working<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.320> friggin<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:02.250> it's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
working it and friggin with it then it's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.870 
working it and friggin with it then it's
going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:04.009> you're<00:02:05.009> gonna<00:02:05.159> end<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.850> think

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
going to you're gonna end up I think

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
going to you're gonna end up I think
getting<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> water<00:02:06.570> too<00:02:06.810> saturated<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
getting the water too saturated in the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.609 
getting the water too saturated in the
paper<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> go

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
paper and it's going to it's going to go

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.140 
paper and it's going to it's going to go
underneath<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.400> think<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:11.849> you'll

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
underneath and I think it will you'll

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.030 
underneath and I think it will you'll
lose<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> lot<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.720> effect<00:02:13.080> so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
lose a lot of that effect so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160 
lose a lot of that effect so
look<00:02:14.129> at<00:02:14.219> that<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.670> pretty<00:02:14.909> cool<00:02:15.170> um

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
look at that and that pretty cool um

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.990 
look at that and that pretty cool um
I've<00:02:16.590> decided<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:17.069> want<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.340> add<00:02:17.400> some<00:02:17.579> color<00:02:17.730> in
