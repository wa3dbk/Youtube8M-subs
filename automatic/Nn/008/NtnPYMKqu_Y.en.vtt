00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
 Hello everyone, welcome to 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.300
 German KOKO company 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.700
 Cuticle repair therapy application 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000
 Dry skin requires special care 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.300
 Tailor-made DMS series 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.400
 Particularly suitable 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
 Use of this type of skin 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
 Today with the help of a model 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.600
 Let's demonstrate how to apply the DMS series. 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.500
 First we clean the face 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.400
 Neck and chest 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.700
 For easy dry skin 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.800
 We choose DMS Cleansing Milk for skin cleansing 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.700
 Because it contains ingredients from the DMS skin cell membrane 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.500
 So this make-up remover is not only 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.400
 Cleans and nourishes the skin 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.100
 Therefore, it is recommended to use dry skin. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.300
 Brush the makeup remover on the skin with a brush 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
 Can remove both water and 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.600
 Oil-soluble impurities 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.900
 Using a brush 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.800
 Evenly brushing the face 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.300
 Then with a wet towel 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 Effective cleaning of the face 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.900
 Next is the exfoliating care 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600
 Exfoliation promotes skin renewal 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.300
 Protect your eyes with a cotton pad 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300
 Exfoliating Cream contains ingredients for the repair of the DMS stratum corneum 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.100
 Particularly suitable for dry skin 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.200
 It can remove old dead horny 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 Does not contain surfactant 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.700
 Also contains no emulsifier, contains jojoba beads 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.800
 Brush the exfoliating cream on the face with a brush 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.400
 Then with a sharpener 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.100
 Strengthen the role of removing old dead skin cells 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 After 3 minutes 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.300
 Press and clean with a wet towel 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.700
 Then go to the next step 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.100
 Makeup balances skin 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.800
 Can also achieve the role of strengthening cleaning 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.600
 We choose a balanced lotion 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.000
 Contains provitamin B5 to strengthen skin 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.900
 Absorbing active ingredients 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900
 So the lotion is the ideal pre-care 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.500
 Especially beneficial for the special milk to be used next 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.300
 Contains cucumber extract for refreshing and revitalizing skin 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.900
 After using the lotion 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.000
 This bottle of special milk 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.300
 Contains the following three methods of use 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.500
 First, you can use the essence first. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.600
 Can also be mixed with the base milk 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.300
 Can strengthen the role of the new stratum corneum 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.700
 We use active ingredients 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.400
 Nanoparticle Vitamin A Essence 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.600

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.100
 Then rub on the face 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.800
 Vitamin A strengthens skin's aging 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.400
 Vitamin C can promote collagen synthesis 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.100
 Together with vitamin E 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.000
 Can remove free radicals 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.900
 Vitamin A promotes skin cell renewal 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.000
 Now rub the mixed essence 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.800
 Mixing neutral stratum corneum with base oil and avocado oil in a ratio of 1:1 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.000
 Brush on the face 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.300
 Avocado oil contains triglyceride 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.200
 Rich in phytosterols and vitamins A, D and E 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.100
 A base lotion containing avocado oil on the face 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.300

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.900
 Finally on the face 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.300
 Rub the moisturizing stratum corneum to repair the base milk 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.600
 Because it contains advanced ingredients that promote skin renewal 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.600

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.900
