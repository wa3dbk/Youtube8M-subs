00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:02.850
 Jeep Compass Car Test 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.870
 from Mr. strange Fränzi 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.780
 The manufacturer has strangely strange Hermann pull the new Jeep Compass to 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.149
 Provided her with her test impressions 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:15.279
 Compass is the youngest SUV of Chrysler 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.499
 owned brand Jeep 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.919
 with permanent four-wheel drive 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:26.160
 a diesel engine supplied by VW and its future price of 28 00 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.100
 He should grow 490 euros, the market share of the manufacturer in Germany 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.289
 and use the rising Colfer art for this vehicle class 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.010
 Observers expect 16 percent growth for ECS Guth by 2015 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.380
 Seeg Menth 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.450
 the compass comes with surprisingly little comes from therefore 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.479
 the smooth surfaces of the sideline look great they dream goals 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.690
 the puck with the classic 7 vertical air intakes in the fully 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.120
 Untrimmed grille will be round 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.950
 comparatively small headlamps 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.360
 edged 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.870
 the bumper pushes out with angular corners underneath 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.610
 at the stern, dominated by a roof scurrilously crowned large disc 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.000
 underneath that is the turnpike sweep 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.560
 Symbols shaped in the plastic 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.899
 inside, however, this is just framing the well-readable instruments 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.470
 when the driving light is switched off 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.910
 who drives with lighting during the day 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.990
 which is a rule in many places 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.619
 can display the onboard computer and navigation system in the center console 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.340
 little more than guess 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.500
 automatically these instruments then fall into the darkened night mode 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.880
 The Internet is more determined by edges and corners than by switches 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.890
 radii 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.430
 the seats are as well as the steering wheel covered with leather 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.780
 offer a heater but means little side 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.280
 although the steering wheel is only horizontally adjustable 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.149
 quickly find a good seating position 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.400
 which allows a look at the clear Paros series 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.800
 in the rear, the space is hardly less generous than forms shelves 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.969
 is there in due time 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:18.659
 in the trunk fit at loading to the window line 334 liters 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.449
 folding the rear seat backrest up to 1000 277 liters 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.699
 the extension does not handle the left one-handed 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.069
 because the platoon leader on Föhr the unlocking SMI I'm nothing 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.089
 mounted between the seat and backrest 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.170
 this must be done with the left hand 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.359
 directed moves the lines forward 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.069
 It can rest in different places for better seating comfort again 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.639
 be locked 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.810
 the load compartment floor is level 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.260
 only the high loading edge is an easy stowage of luggage in the way 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.859
 You have to be modest in the payload including the driver and 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.050
 his companions are allowed only 400 kilograms on board 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.760
 before the permissible total weight of 2000 and 10 kilograms exceeded 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.589
 becomes 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:12.329
 the engine of the Compass is the well-known 2-liter diesel of the VNW Kunz 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.249
 Serious with pump-nozzle-engineering injection 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.359
 Mitsubishi is setting in Auckland 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.689
 There the noise is better than ignoring Ki Ka 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.120
 The four-cylinder drones so far her strong 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.430
 and especially at full throttle at about 2000 rpm per minute 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.610
 as a single sheet in Lauta 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.849
 disturbing vibrations 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.849
 Nevertheless, the machine ensures brisk progress 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.089
 a hundred 3 kilowatts 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.859
 Kundert 40 hp 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.779
 deliver them 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:46.760
 That's enough for an acceleration in eleven seconds from zero to one hundred 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:52.169
 Kilometers per hour and a specific speed of 189 kilometers per 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.159
 hour 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.080
 for good passage Sorben maximum 310 Eutin tenants torque 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.750
 they are already 2750 slash 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.340
 in Ahlen 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.879
 what schaltfaules allowed driving 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.909
 that's good because the six-speed gearbox is not a pattern in 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.509
 Things precision 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:15.949
 With emphasis, the short lever wants to be guided to the desired position 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.760
 and gives hardly any feedback 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.779
 if the gear is really locked 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:26.210
 8 Commerce The compass needs 2 liters of diesel on average 400 kilometers 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.259
 which is not surprising considering the weight 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:34.439
 the tank volume of 51 liters is a bit short for that 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.629
 Steering and braking do not convey a particularly sensitive impression 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.090
 the soft suspension that increases the comfort on the long haul significantly 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.410
 Fürth Inking attracts more and more Caro Seeger then has her inclinations constantly 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.069
 outpatient the course will be corrected 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:56.009
 The same applies to the straight-line at high speed, the compass looks nervous 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.300
 like the NADA on the tornado 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.390
 the limits call for pressure 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.450
 if you want to delay a lot 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.339
 which affects the dosing 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.950
 it almost seems like fine irony mishaps 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.890
 in the war in the compass prospectus promises that the sporty 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.340
 Driving characteristics also everyday tours to an exciting experience 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.219
 do 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.499
 but when it gets serious the food gets barely controllable understeer 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:23.480
 good-natured 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.759
 if it goes too fast around the corners 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.970
 and uses 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.880
 if it gets worse 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.190
 the standard EStG 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.169
 to stay on course 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.520
 the equipment is neat 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.749
 In addition to the usual comedy acts, there is a and the Roses theme 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.370
 the air conditioning and even a dismissed students tel 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.669
 which sits in the trunk in its cargo holder 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.559
 the list of aids-truck it is very manageable 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.900
 different packages provide more luxury 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.120
 most expensive Santander 2000 then 20 euros 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.270
 is the Technology Pacult taste navigation system 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.220
 integrated CD changer and an upgrade of the audio system by two 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.450
 Speaker in the tailgate 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.790
 who can be sued out at the picnic six sounding out the action 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.059
 which does not make every man happy 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:15.969
 Data and readings 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.509

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:57.340
 good space 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.399
 but low payload 

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:01.879
 the driving behavior is usually the most
