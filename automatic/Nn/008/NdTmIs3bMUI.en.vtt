00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.210
 and 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.210
 ah 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.019
 bmw takes a new step forward in the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.050
 Trail segment launching the new 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.939
 and expected s 1000 xr this adventure sport 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.010
 enter to compete with the are fashionable 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.320
 trail asphalt ducati multistrada or 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.559
 ktm super adventure references in this 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.559
 segment 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.320
 well we are already about to ride in 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.760
 the new bmw s1000 xr we already have the boot 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.280
 assigned and we will go with our group 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.019
 the route that awaits us is 200 and peak 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.059
 kilometers on very twisty roads 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.100
 whereupon these 160 horses that are going to 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.220
 give much much of himself for the story 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.220
 then 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.190
 to get these 160 horses the s 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.350
 1000 x of erre equips the engine of four 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.290
 cylinders from rice 3 in the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.300
 r delivers a torque of 112 or 2 meters 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.040
 and it does it in the margin of revolution 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.800
 ideal to enjoy on a road of 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.530
 curves equipment plus series two modes 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.760
 Driving and traction control 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.830
 can be equipped in option the modes of 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.980
 driving pro dynamic control of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.750
 traction abs pro that allows us to act 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.220
 in full curve that is to say with the motorcycle 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.140
 inclined 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.640
 in addition our test unit is 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.070
 equipped the assistant's option 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.290
 change pro a really addictive extra and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
 exciting allows us to change without 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.500
 need to press the clutch is a 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.500
 authentic past 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.620
 all right 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.960
 good at the moment the spectacular test 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.210
 is how to drive an s 1000 rr 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 but a slightly higher position 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.540
 if we have noticed a difference 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.259
 important in the subject suspensions the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.349
 longer travel 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.640
 that sometimes the more very strong the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.310
 truth is that about the suspension is very 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.010
 demanding are not they do not forgive as much as 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.870
 in the normal gs but we are liking and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.870
 we are really liking the truth 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.860
 we finish here our first take of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.750
 contact with the new bmw s1000 xr in 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.320
 this warm day we have been able to put 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.850
 to test this 160 horsepower machine 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.500
 BMW was short of a sports bike 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.360
 of road in the maxi segment 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.610
 trail and for that he has equipped the engine 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.710
 of the s1000rr in this beautiful machine 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.530
 It is a machine that we can take with 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.360
 an impressive low to 23 thousand 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.000
 turns in a very long march we can 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.620
 go for example to 40 50 in sixth that is 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.380
 something impressive and recover with 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.060
 ease but if we want to get the 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.340
 maximum performance to its 160 horses 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.200
 we will need something more head we have 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.780
 have very good hands because it is a 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.610
 very demanding machine another of the changes 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.680
 evident in this mount is the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.360
 suspensions we abandon the t system in 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.460
 the ebro and for the ever to equip a 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.810
 fantastic 150 front fork 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.360
 millimeters and a good shock absorber 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.190
 rear of 140 mm both 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.860
 equipped and regulated by the system 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.890
 dynamic that braking is another of the 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.660
 strong points of this s 1000 xr equip 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.670
 two huge discs with radial clamps 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.800
 of four pistons that stop us in 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.510
 millimeters the driving position is 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.390
 another of his strengths 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.819
 transformed a naked s 1000 rr into a 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.790
 very comfortable trail that without losing a single 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.950
 apex of its sportsmanship 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.409
 the handlebar that in a very 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.590
 comfortable and the height at the ground oscillates 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.209
 from 790 millimeters to 850 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.090
 which is the highest part being the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.590
 being standard 840 millimeters so 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.810
 that will surely interest many 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.900
 of you is the comparison of this one 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.939
 with the model gs our advice after 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.920
 of the first contact is that if what you 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.019
 will are pure performance and you are 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.970
 looking to compete with the multis trad us 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.470
 with the new super adventure and so on 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.960
 of 160 horses 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.509
 this is an ideal machine instead if 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.979
 what you are looking for a great rutera maybe what 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.440
 we will have to think twice between the 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.789
 gs or this one soon we will do a test 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.789
 most complete of this model
