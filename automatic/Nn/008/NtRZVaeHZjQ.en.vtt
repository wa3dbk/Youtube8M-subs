think a lot of people forget is that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.299 
think a lot of people forget is that
when<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.870> take<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> video<00:00:58.620> capture<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.000> ps4

when you take a video capture of a ps4
you're<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> lose<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:02.879> bit<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you're going to lose a little bit of

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.280 
you're going to lose a little bit of
quality<00:01:03.690> from<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:05.180> not<00:01:06.180> only<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.750> after

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
quality from it not only that but after

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.399

its rendered you lose some quality

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.170 
its rendered you lose some quality
because<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> compress<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.640> video

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
because you have to compress that video

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.530 
because you have to compress that video
you<00:01:12.780> can't<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.140> raw<00:01:13.350> 1080p<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:15.150> once<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you can't do raw 1080p and then once you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.899 
you can't do raw 1080p and then once you
upload<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.049> compressed<00:01:16.860> video<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.310> YouTube

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
YouTube converts it to its own format

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.080
