00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.000

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.890
 watched the previous tutorial I got 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 realized that I had explained to you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 absolutely all positions that's 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.019
 just missing you the end of the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 tablature to have a couple is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.509
 whole and anyway there is no 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 chorus apart in this piece 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.240

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.969
 way it's not difficult enough 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.690

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.690
