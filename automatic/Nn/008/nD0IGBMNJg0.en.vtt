Ladies and gentleman, we have stand up comedy

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Please welcome Pablo Molinari.
- Hello everyone, how's it going?

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.000
I was talking to a friend today, we've been arguing,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.249
at some point I got angry and he said: "you get mad easily, shorty, don't you?"

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:21.770
as if I'm 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.630
getting mad because I'm short, 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.880
like dogs. People sometimes think that short people are like dogs.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.610
Like, big dogs have a dumb face and are happy all the time, 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.890
they're like 'eeeeehhh... eeeeehhh...', 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.480
but small dogs

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.050
they have such a resentment

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.120
because of the shitty size

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.100
they got in life

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.570
and you see that tiny dogs barks to everything that moves, just in case

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.960
he doesn't know what it is, but if it moves, he barks

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.300
he even barks to the big dog, and the big one looks at him and says,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.460
this is gonna end like shit

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.750
you'll be hurt, I'll be choked, this will not end well

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.850
but no, we short humans get pissed off easily because

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.360
some things happens only to us.
Like not growing with the perspective

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.930
short guys doesn't grow with the perspective: 
he's thirty blocks away, or next to you,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230
he's equally tall.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.980
He comes and they say: 'Oh, look, a vanishing point'

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.110
you don't get any attention...
I go to buy some

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.510
clothes, I buy boxers, they look in me me as if they were shorts.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.100
If I buy shorts, they look like capris. 
If I buy capris, they look like

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.550
pants, and if I buy pants there's a tube coming out of each leg

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.910
that if I don't roll them up, when I walk they move like

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.730
those air dancers, they move like...

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.040
Look at this hem, Beto.
- It has eight rounds.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.970
I have a dungaree down there

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.130
It's like having an extra denim. Which is good, 
because if it gets dirty, I roll from up, unroll from down and that's it.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.490
And yes, I get mad easily, and I get angry about 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.250
things that I shouldn't

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.380
Let's say, you go to the pharmacy

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.479
with that hieroglyphic alike thing

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.140
that you need a Rosetta Stone to decipher what the hell

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.940
is what you have to buy. You've been looking at
it for a week,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.010
you don't have a clue,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.950
but you give it to the pharmacist, the
pharmacist grabs it and says: "oh, yes,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.109
Nepradonozol 500, I'll be right back"

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.909
What happened? Something happened there, guys.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.429
It's been rigged between the doctor and

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:26.829
the pharmacist, because

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.449
they understand that
language and you don't

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.389
they are bypassing you

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.719
You're going to die.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.169
Why do doctors do that? If you read out loud the recipe

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.219
where it says what you have to buy, 
the thing you have to buy is

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.599
Podolosimsimvandegtumsanasjkldha skjdhlaksdhjask dhlaksjd hlaksjdhlaskd

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.379
U-U-U-U-U-U because there are some motherfuckers which writes

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.979
I, U, N and M, all with their legs up

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.889
you have to count how many they are, you infer words that don't exist in Spanish,

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.439
nunumu munimi muni... ¡minimum! No, not minimum, not minimum, muni mi... zangmdaniiiiiiiiiiiii

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.550
and then there's a part where there is no ripple at all,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.469
like ñññiiiiiiii... so you don't know if that's some dead bloke's electrocardiogram,

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.869
if the guy thinks he's writing but his hand does not respond, if it's a form

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.989
that I should complete... ñigblablabladadadad...

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.449
FORTE.

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:27.199
Thank you very much. Good night.
