00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.450
 good evening welcome to beaublanc good kind 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.580
 the other good evening 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.740
 antoine for evening everyone this is it 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 the play offs started we had 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.739
 a little arab against paris with a 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.880
 match of a big intensity 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:27.599
 tonight the match start closed two of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.189
 areas had thought of me during the match 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.270
 at one point I had tears 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.739
 I had tears because there is 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.759
 so long that I had not seen 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.940
 such a level of play 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.510
 the exceptional start of the match 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.670
 players it looked like the same player 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.559
 it was really when I said one day 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.870
 I explained to you 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.960
 basket it was the fingers of the hand this 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.550
 evening we saw that a phenomenal address 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.629
 not paint a false note 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.659
 villeurbanne beats the street to the street a 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.760
 obvious pleasure to play 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:02.819
 god knows if sometimes I repeat it we have 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.920
 a little hard but it's really there 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.540
 it's fabulous 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 but beware it is that the first 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.130
 match there is only 1 0 we are not there 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.659
 25 years ago where it was sometimes going 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.909
 back beyond check if you know it 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.799
 Servance beautiful support match limoges 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.899
 leads 1 0 but maybe still 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.340
 sent a message on this first 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.110
 go down to a message at 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 villeurbanne already and a message to all 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.700
 the teams because what they have 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.500
 produced tonight I repeat it this is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.289
 exceptional have as well 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.909
 defensively than offensively the ball 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.579
 systems are passionate about 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.850
 find players on the ground when you 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.430
 see the ratings 114 and at 51 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.289
 it means villeurbanne has let go 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.820
 good he vincent stone had had 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.310
 intelligence in my opinion to do 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.560
 to blow we already know that we do not see there 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.990
 yes he could do that to the mayor 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.219
 we saw he was sitting a little resigned 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.289
 even completely second half time 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.579
 here it is said that price there is forgotten and 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.340
 now we put everything in the match 2 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.479
 but this max on sale by the 11 0 start 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.040
 ideal ideal he could not stand out the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.450
 head of the water the week after 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.310
 after his debut match the picture at the bottom 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.899
 I always have a little bit of doubt 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.180
 with with limoges 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.830
 but he just now I went to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.630
 radio france I told them that for a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.370
 time I had arrived at the confident room 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.290
 because of what I had seen on the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.520
 latest benefits of limoges I 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.550
 felt the rising power rise in 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.650
 power there we have players of 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.260
 talent and who smell the scent of 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.150
 play-offs what there is no concern 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.760
 vincent stone he was sitting greg 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.900
 beugnot was seated also we have either all 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 the coaches we are going from champion of France 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.750
 this is a good thing 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.610
 we will not say it too much because 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.330
 that once again there is zero but that's 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.620
 we lived an evening 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.050
 outstanding you said it people 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.400
 talented at heart reynolds boungou 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.950
 colo moerman the duty players 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.620
 frejus zerbo again it's a 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.840
 Christian think the player role 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.310
 typical but that's perfect as soon as they 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.320
 return the defense hardens it is done 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.600
 never spent Frejus by his wine his 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.790
 number then made some mistakes but 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.440
 such power in addition he makes 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.500
 more and more interesting moves 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.260
 offensively speaking so well yes that 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.300
 happiness good j k we did not see too much 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.600
 but it's still a subway hand to 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.070
 metronome the beginning of the match of jo if that 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.170
 it's a very good thing for them 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.910
 play-offs that I take back confidence from the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.700
 dune path one of the two sides of the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.470
 field is good hacker then to heart 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.390
 for me makes the perfect match 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.280
 this is the official class at the scea 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.910
 rice without these hand changes in 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.459
 air his defense on and jackson 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.110
 he was he was monstrous the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.970
 defensive rotations have done very well 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.500
 worked what's great it's 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.840
 we win this match I remind you 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.820
 more than a few points of some 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.830
 points by shooting two free throws 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.410
 in the match that is to say that 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.790
 villeurbanne the pace the imposed rhythm 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.959
 we were going too fast he could not do 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.340
 in vain to be in town that they could 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.230
 not make any mistakes and I believe that the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.910
 25th there were only five faults for the asvel 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.489
 it's going too fast on a 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.120
 feeling tried they were tried to 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.640
 poster and joe jackson in low post for 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.169
 the play his contract the rotations are 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.960
 came the ball circulated really low 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.690
 that happiness 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.040
 we saw a good game tonight then 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.560
 now we are in the match of 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.030
 salient is what is the most 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.410
 dangerous there for jean marc dupraz this 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.910
 that players say we have when 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.740
 even a huge margin in this team 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.930
 no we must not we must not at all 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.300
 thought that we have to start again as if 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.300
 it was the first match 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.730
 on the other hand, I'm pretty sure 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.960
 seen what I see since three four 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.340
 matches it's players anyway 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.300
 that they trust them and who 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.830
 know where they want to go 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.920
 exalting at the end of this season 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.740
 waited they always said times 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.960
 I had doubts when I said there is a 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.940
 moment when we had the lows of the 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.890
 vague but each time we bounced back and 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.410
 and then there is the smell of blood there is 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.050
 the smell of blood years ago 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.390
 we did not see that in limoges an audience 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.490
 Then there was the hair you 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.260
 media it was totally and I tell you 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.050
 the blades are mounted on a few 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.060
 actions I am an emotional I am a 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.940
 passionate about basketball is what I saw 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.210
 tonight my and coaching and coaching 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.760
 the rotations everybody played that that 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.710
 also that it involved everyone 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.210
 very quickly jean marc and that's not it 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.990
 innocent maybe that people do not get 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.910
 do not account 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.440
 he did his rotations there was a 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.110
 moment there was more than one player from 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.270
 five major nobel on the field too 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.090
 a little message that I want to make 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.500
 spend as much I respect the player and 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.290
 I find it extraordinary 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.590
 antoine diot i'm not quite 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.540
 agree on his mvp title 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.020
 why because he was very good 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.240
 second half of the season or even in 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.540
 two and did not advance the last third 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.580
 is for me the mbp it was to play 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.340
 between jackson and 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.439
 beautiful for me nobel he was good all 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.349
 the season 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:07.509
 so here I was nice enough 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:10.120
 i am still a mvp title of 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.650
 final but still we talk and why 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.770
 not why not we understood you 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.180
 we feasted tonight I think we 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.590
 will stop and then we will leave 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.789
 the images that will arrive soon for 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.360
 those who did not have the chance to be 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.250
 there tonight 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.569
 and then the very good news is that 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.430
 anyway whatever happens we will 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.659
