00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
86 87 and this one here look at this

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.139 
86 87 and this one here look at this
looks<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> bit<00:00:28.919> dated<00:00:29.279> now<00:00:29.640> doesn't<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:29.999> but

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149 
looks a bit dated now doesn't it but

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.729 
looks a bit dated now doesn't it but
this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.419> a<00:00:30.449> deregistered<00:00:31.970> 1987<00:00:32.970> CBR<00:00:33.809> 600<00:00:34.320> FH

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
this is a deregistered 1987 CBR 600 FH

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
this is a deregistered 1987 CBR 600 FH
the<00:00:35.010> very<00:00:35.190> very<00:00:35.399> first<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.059> there's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the very very first one and there's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.060 
the very very first one and there's
still<00:00:36.329> quite<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.539> few<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:36.930> kicking<00:00:37.800> about

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
still quite a few of these kicking about

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
still quite a few of these kicking about
one<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.300> fact<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.629> particular

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
one like this in fact this particular

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.209 
one like this in fact this particular
one<00:00:40.289> is<00:00:40.859> up<00:00:41.039> for<00:00:41.190> sale<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:42.320> 1999<00:00:43.320> pounds<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.920> 2

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
one is up for sale at 1999 pounds so 2

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.700 
one is up for sale at 1999 pounds so 2
grand<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:45.629> might<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:46.050> 2<00:00:46.199> grands<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> lot<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
grand you might think 2 grands a lot of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
grand you might think 2 grands a lot of
money<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> deregistered<00:00:47.699> bike<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.600> not

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
money for a deregistered bike it's not

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.689 
money for a deregistered bike it's not
exactly<00:00:49.079> cheap<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.679> there<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.550> advantage

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
exactly cheap but there is one advantage

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.489 
exactly cheap but there is one advantage
with<00:00:51.179> buying<00:00:51.390> something<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.750> old<00:00:52.079> because

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:52.499 
with buying something that old because

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.130 
with buying something that old because
it's<00:00:52.679> very<00:00:53.070> nearly<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:53.640> 15<00:00:54.510> years<00:00:54.749> old<00:00:54.960> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it's very nearly now 15 years old this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's very nearly now 15 years old this
and<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.679> bank<00:00:56.210> becomes<00:00:57.210> 15<00:00:57.749> years<00:00:57.989> old<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and when a bank becomes 15 years old it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
and when a bank becomes 15 years old it
becomes<00:00:58.739> eligible<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.429> classic<00:00:59.760> insurance

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
becomes eligible for classic insurance

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.139 
becomes eligible for classic insurance
so<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.379> probably<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:02.339> expensive<00:01:02.640> now

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
so this is probably more expensive now

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.759 
so this is probably more expensive now
than<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.839> when<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.500> couple<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
than it was when it was a couple of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.620 
than it was when it was a couple of
years<00:01:04.920> ago<00:01:05.160> if<00:01:05.520> you<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.480> mean

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
years ago if you kind of see what I mean

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.750 
years ago if you kind of see what I mean
but<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> does<00:01:07.530> look<00:01:07.620> a<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.770> dated<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
but it does look a bit dated now it's a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.430 
but it does look a bit dated now it's a
bit<00:01:08.910> sort<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> old-fashioned<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:10.020> old<00:01:10.170> jelly

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
bit sort of old-fashioned the old jelly

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.930 
bit sort of old-fashioned the old jelly
mould<00:01:10.710> type<00:01:10.980> thing<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.340> used<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> call<00:01:11.760> these

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
mould type thing we used to call these

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.610 
mould type thing we used to call these
didn't<00:01:12.240> me<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:13.290> doesn't<00:01:13.530> look

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
didn't me and it doesn't look

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.560 
didn't me and it doesn't look
particularly<00:01:14.010> attractive<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.850> perhaps<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
particularly attractive so perhaps you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
particularly attractive so perhaps you
want<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> spend<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.260> little<00:01:16.440> bit<00:01:16.620> more<00:01:17.010> money

no storage space what bit there is you
have<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.930> have<00:03:22.349> tools<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.979> take<00:03:23.129> it<00:03:23.280> about

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
have to have tools to take it about

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.000 
have to have tools to take it about
a<00:03:24.989> long<00:03:25.860> gap<00:03:26.849> between<00:03:27.269> fifth<00:03:27.659> and<00:03:27.870> six<00:03:28.110> when

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
a long gap between fifth and six when

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.800 
a long gap between fifth and six when
you're<00:03:29.159> changing<00:03:29.340> gear<00:03:32.360> well<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.450> two<00:03:33.569> things

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
you're changing gear well the two things

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.030 
you're changing gear well the two things
I<00:03:33.870> don't<00:03:33.989> like<00:03:34.079> about<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.799> not<00:03:34.890> much

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
I don't like about it but it's not much

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.830 
I don't like about it but it's not much
to<00:03:35.189> choose<00:03:35.430> from<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.970> think<00:03:36.269> one<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.689> main

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
to choose from I think one of the main

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.740 
to choose from I think one of the main
things<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.670> like<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.209> turning<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.599> bit

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
things is that I like it's turning a bit

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.229 
things is that I like it's turning a bit
quicker<00:03:39.959> into<00:03:40.200> corners<00:03:40.590> maybe<00:03:41.040> if<00:03:41.129> I<00:03:41.250> took<00:03:42.180> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
quicker into corners maybe if I took a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.140 
quicker into corners maybe if I took a
16<00:03:42.599> inch<00:03:42.750> front<00:03:42.930> wheel<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.319> maybe<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
16 inch front wheel on it maybe the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.580 
16 inch front wheel on it maybe the
possibly<00:03:45.150> drop<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.659> Fox<00:03:45.870> then<00:03:46.019> yoges<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.439> few

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
possibly drop the Fox then yoges a few

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.410
