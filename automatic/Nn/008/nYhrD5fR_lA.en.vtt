00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 this was the truth the only one and it is believed so long 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.350
 On July 21, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin moved a few meters away from 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 module 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.100
 confirming this incredible construction 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.470
 this 14-minute movie was never broadcast by NASA 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.740
 yesterday the reds was one of the few Americans who had access to Iran 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.210
 Borja scarce meters and the blonde 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.340
 and it was not coincidence upn everything were meticulously programmed 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.030
 these mysterious ruins as others similarly filmed by the others to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.760
 poles 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.430
 they had been photographed before by the different waves 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.450

 released on September 8, 1967 Thursday 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.490
 landed in the sea of â€‹â€‹tranquility very close to this construction sending 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 19 thousand photographs 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.420
 ruined buildings 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.339
 buildings on the surface of the moon 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:11.359
 besides seemingly ambiguous buildings 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.969
 but who had raised them 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.969
 for us humans obviously not 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.459
 there was only one answer 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.870
 for this was works of a non-human civilization 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.239
 the military 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.620
 they had satisfied the first part of their time and they buy now it does not look bad

 according to and confidant the astronauts proceeded 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.240
 to the programmed 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.539
 they collected samples from the walls they took measurements 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.539
 and they retired 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.520
 the unusual construction very similar to a hangar 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.889
 average 60 meters in length with a maximum height of nine walls 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.449
 meters 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.169
 had 12 holes or windows there is a kind of front door

 five meters deep by cristian tula 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.850
 according to the analyzes practiced on earth the material with which there was 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.040
 been built 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.229
 it was similar to the lunar surface 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.819
 jin 60% of the atoms would have oxygen with a zero points 0 1% of the weight 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.819
 constituted by hydrogen 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.800
 the walls and allamand very eroded 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.419
 this circumstance since the moon practically does not exist atmosphere made 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.189
 think to the military that the building 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.940
 if in question I could believe 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.940
 several thousand years 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.930
 the secret is part of alex proyas provides this hangar equina tural mind 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.960
 the 14 minutes of film 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.910
 they were never spread by the nasa
