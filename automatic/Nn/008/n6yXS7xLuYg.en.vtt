00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.139 

building<00:00:01.860> your<00:00:01.890> base<00:00:02.190> in<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.610> floating<00:00:02.909> island

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
building your base in a floating island

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.950 
building your base in a floating island
can<00:00:03.659> be<00:00:03.689> fun<00:00:04.110> but<00:00:04.890> how<00:00:05.069> do<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.279> get<00:00:05.460> up<00:00:05.490> there

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
can be fun but how do you get up there

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.350 
can be fun but how do you get up there
the<00:00:06.960> answer<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.350> wireless<00:00:08.069> redstone<00:00:11.240> now<00:00:12.240> this

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
the answer is wireless redstone now this

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.600 
the answer is wireless redstone now this
is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.599> vanilla<00:00:12.929> version<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.590> Minecraft<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
is a vanilla version of Minecraft the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.630 
is a vanilla version of Minecraft the
only<00:00:14.880> mod<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.870> here<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.440> too<00:00:17.430> many

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
only mod I have on here is too many

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.980 
only mod I have on here is too many
items<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.619> see<00:00:19.910> there<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.180> no

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
items and as you can see there is no

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.200 
items and as you can see there is no
paths<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.740> redstone<00:00:23.430> they<00:00:23.609> get<00:00:23.760> up<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.090> my

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
paths for redstone they get up to my

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
paths for redstone they get up to my
floating<00:00:24.539> island<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.980> completely

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
floating island it is it's completely

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.750 
floating island it is it's completely
free<00:00:27.529> but<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.890> step<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.429> pressure

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
free but if I step on this pressure

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:39.740 
free but if I step on this pressure
plate<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:32.930> waterfall<00:00:33.930> comes<00:00:34.200> down

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.000 

and<00:00:40.750> now<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:40.960> can<00:00:41.290> swim<00:00:41.650> up<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.830> my<00:00:42.220> island

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.130 

pleasure<00:00:47.010> wait<00:00:47.840> that's<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.990> waterfall<00:00:51.140> but

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
pleasure wait that's the waterfall but

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.010 
pleasure wait that's the waterfall but
how<00:00:52.290> does<00:00:52.350> wireless<00:00:52.950> redstone<00:00:53.160> work

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.660 

this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> receiver<00:01:02.720> consists<00:01:03.720> of<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.930> clock

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
this is the receiver consists of a clock

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.330 
this is the receiver consists of a clock
pistol<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.150> glass<00:01:08.479> glass<00:01:09.479> pane<00:01:10.040> pushes<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
pistol the glass glass pane pushes the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.020 
pistol the glass glass pane pushes the
boat<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.580> activated

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
boat up and down but when it's activated

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.830 
boat up and down but when it's activated
by<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> transmitter<00:01:16.340> would<00:01:17.340> fall<00:01:17.670> down<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.360> on

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
by a transmitter would fall down and on

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
by a transmitter would fall down and on
this<00:01:18.960> pressure<00:01:19.229> plate<00:01:19.970> which<00:01:20.970> will<00:01:21.710> allow<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
this pressure plate which will allow the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.930 
this pressure plate which will allow the
pistol<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.960> attract<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.860> release<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.430> wire

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.040 

this<00:01:32.940> is<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> transmitter<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.469 

dispenser<00:01:40.050> filled<00:01:40.800> with<00:01:40.979> arrows<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
dispenser filled with arrows with a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
dispenser filled with arrows with a
glass<00:01:42.750> pane<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:44.330> front<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.580> glass

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
glass pane in front of it on a glass

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.660 
glass pane in front of it on a glass
paint<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:49.320> arrow<00:01:49.800> is<00:01:49.950> shot<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> glass

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
paint when an arrow is shot at the glass

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:04.860 
paint when an arrow is shot at the glass
pane<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:53.070> activates<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> receiver<00:01:55.700> oops

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.840 

as<00:02:05.870> you<00:02:06.140> can<00:02:06.290> see<00:02:06.560> who<00:02:07.190> falls<00:02:07.580> down<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.270> hits

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
as you can see who falls down and hits

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.930 
as you can see who falls down and hits
pressure<00:02:10.850> plate<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.140> orientation<00:02:18.140> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
pressure plate now the orientation of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.930 
pressure plate now the orientation of
the<00:02:22.330> receiver<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.810> transmitter<00:02:24.459> are<00:02:25.459> very

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the receiver and transmitter are very

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.740 
the receiver and transmitter are very
important<00:02:26.600> in<00:02:26.840> relation<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.650> each<00:02:27.680> other

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
important in relation to each other

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.199 
important in relation to each other
because<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.900> way<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.080> turn<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.590> off<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.850> just

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
because the way I turn it off is just

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.930 
because the way I turn it off is just
another<00:02:32.540> dispenser<00:02:33.320> in<00:02:33.530> last<00:02:33.830> plane<00:02:34.160> as<00:02:34.670> you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
another dispenser in last plane as you

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.620 
another dispenser in last plane as you
feel<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.330> glass<00:02:35.510> pane<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.630> different

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
feel of a glass pane is in a different

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:50.170 
feel of a glass pane is in a different
state

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.759 

so<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.209> hope<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.540> guys<00:02:51.569> can<00:02:52.019> use<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.439> in<00:02:52.620> honor

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
so I hope you guys can use this in honor

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.969 
so I hope you guys can use this in honor
of<00:02:52.980> floating<00:02:53.459> islands
