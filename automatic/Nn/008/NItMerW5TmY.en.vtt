any<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:46.020> accounts<00:01:46.500> logged<00:01:46.890> into<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
any other accounts logged into it and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.060 
any other accounts logged into it and
then<00:01:48.090> let's<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.450> back<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.380> go<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:49.950> into

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
then let's go back and we go here into

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.130 
then let's go back and we go here into
signature<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.820> signature<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.450> course<00:01:51.780> if

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
signature now signature of course if

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.510 
signature now signature of course if
you're<00:01:52.320> not<00:01:52.380> aware<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.009> signature<00:01:53.399> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you're not aware of what signature is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
you're not aware of what signature is
it's<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.140> signature

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it's going to be the little signature

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's going to be the little signature
that<00:01:56.040> ends<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.759> every<00:01:57.180> email<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.719> send

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
that ends on every email that you send

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.100 
that ends on every email that you send
at<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> very<00:01:58.619> end<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.040> something<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.960> not

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
at the very end so something I was not

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.109 
at the very end so something I was not
really<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> fan<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:02.880> allow

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
really a fan of is that they don't allow

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.300 
really a fan of is that they don't allow
multiple<00:02:03.659> signatures<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.380> multiple<00:02:04.829> emails

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
multiple signatures for multiple emails

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.510 
multiple signatures for multiple emails
so<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.329> did<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:06.780> other<00:02:07.350> personal<00:02:07.950> gmail<00:02:08.310> on

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
so I did have my other personal gmail on

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.540 
so I did have my other personal gmail on
this<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.899> didn't<00:02:10.289> allow<00:02:10.530> me<00:02:10.709> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
this and it didn't allow me to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.060 
this and it didn't allow me to
add<00:02:11.640> different<00:02:12.420> signatures<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:13.380> that's<00:02:13.770> what

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
add different signatures so that's what

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.160 
add different signatures so that's what
something<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.640> wasn't<00:02:14.820> really<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.120> fan<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.450> so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
something I wasn't really a fan of so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.050 
something I wasn't really a fan of so
maybe<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.560> future<00:02:16.740> they'll<00:02:17.070> add<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.520> but

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
maybe in the future they'll add it but

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.210 
maybe in the future they'll add it but
anyways<00:02:18.300> go<00:02:18.600> down<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.020> list<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.800> list

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
anyways go down here to list and list

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.820 
anyways go down here to list and list
you<00:02:20.700> are<00:02:20.820> able<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.690> different<00:02:22.380> lists<00:02:22.710> of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
you are able to have different lists of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.980 
you are able to have different lists of
course<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.580> default<00:02:24.000> ones<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:24.420> are<00:02:24.450> two<00:02:24.840> by

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
course the default ones here are two by

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.410 
course the default ones here are two by
to<00:02:25.380> read<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.040> watch<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.300> actually

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
to read and to watch so you can actually

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.970 
to read and to watch so you can actually
create<00:02:27.780> other<00:02:28.140> lists<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.710> can<00:02:28.830> actually

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
create other lists and you can actually

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.280 
create other lists and you can actually
arrange<00:02:29.220> these<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.970> can<00:02:30.120> even<00:02:30.360> tap<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.140> hold

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
arrange these if I can even tap and hold

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.040 
arrange these if I can even tap and hold
on<00:02:31.620> one<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.160> these<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.430> drag<00:02:32.580> there<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.880> goes

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
on one of these and drag there it goes

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.350 
on one of these and drag there it goes
so<00:02:34.050> let's<00:02:34.650> go<00:02:34.890> back<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.310> go<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> snooze

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
so let's go back and go down to snooze

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.690 
so let's go back and go down to snooze
is<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.720> smooth<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.140> pretty<00:02:37.410> cool<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.280> what's

then you can also have the unstar moved

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.400 
then you can also have the unstar moved
items<00:03:09.210> so<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.720> down<00:03:09.900> there<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.200> kind<00:03:10.380> of

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
20 so I think that is really useful

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.159 
20 so I think that is really useful
especially<00:06:37.890> if<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:38.460> just<00:06:38.669> want<00:06:38.910> to

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
especially if you just want to

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.670 
especially if you just want to
rid<00:06:39.409> of<00:06:39.529> everything<00:06:39.830> and<00:06:41.020> not<00:06:42.020> have<00:06:42.319> anything

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
rid of everything and not have anything

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.860 
rid of everything and not have anything
showing<00:06:43.009> up<00:06:43.219> on<00:06:43.370> your<00:06:43.400> notifications<00:06:44.090> but

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
showing up on your notifications but

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.559 
showing up on your notifications but
overall<00:06:45.499> I<00:06:45.650> think<00:06:45.830> mailbox<00:06:46.370> is<00:06:46.550> a<00:06:47.060> really

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569 
overall I think mailbox is a really

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.360 
overall I think mailbox is a really
great<00:06:47.719> application<00:06:48.439> it's<00:06:48.620> worth<00:06:48.860> giving<00:06:49.189> a

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
great application it's worth giving a

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.140 
great application it's worth giving a
shot<00:06:49.400> and<00:06:49.900> it<00:06:50.900> has<00:06:51.169> a<00:06:51.439> lot<00:06:51.680> of<00:06:51.710> potential<00:06:52.249> so<00:06:52.699> in

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
shot and it has a lot of potential so in

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.700 
shot and it has a lot of potential so in
the<00:06:53.330> future<00:06:53.479> I<00:06:53.659> think<00:06:53.749> it's<00:06:54.050> going<00:06:54.169> to<00:06:54.229> pick<00:06:54.499> up
