I'm<00:00:03.889> going<00:00:04.069> to<00:00:04.130> jam<00:00:04.399> on<00:00:04.580> this<00:00:04.700> d-minor<00:00:05.240> track<00:00:05.870> a

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899 
I'm going to jam on this d-minor track a

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.880 
I'm going to jam on this d-minor track a
little<00:00:06.260> bit<00:00:06.729> and<00:00:07.729> the<00:00:08.420> Dorian<00:00:08.900> mode<00:00:08.929> playing

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:09.890 
little bit and the Dorian mode playing

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.370 
little bit and the Dorian mode playing
melodic<00:00:10.340> ideas<00:00:10.840> we're<00:00:11.840> going<00:00:11.990> to<00:00:12.050> concentrate

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
melodic ideas we're going to concentrate

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.339 
melodic ideas we're going to concentrate
on<00:00:12.620> melody<00:00:13.190> and<00:00:13.640> the<00:00:13.820> Dorian<00:00:14.269> mode<00:00:14.450> keeping<00:00:15.200> it

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
on melody and the Dorian mode keeping it

00:00:15.349 --> 00:01:45.390 
on melody and the Dorian mode keeping it
nice<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:15.559> easy

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.230 

in<00:01:46.400> that<00:01:47.530> improvisation<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.820> was<00:01:49.820> using<00:01:50.000> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
in that improvisation I was using the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.470 
in that improvisation I was using the
Dorian<00:01:50.750> mode<00:01:51.040> which<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.250> derived<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:53.210> this

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
Dorian mode which is derived in this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.810 
Dorian mode which is derived in this
case<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.080> D<00:01:54.260> Dorian<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.920> derived<00:01:55.280> from<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.610> C

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
case the D Dorian is derived from the C

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.270 
case the D Dorian is derived from the C
major<00:01:56.060> scale<00:01:58.780> C<00:01:59.780> major<00:01:59.990> scale<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.860> Dorian

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
major scale C major scale the Dorian

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.800 
major scale C major scale the Dorian
mode<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.580> simply<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.120> C<00:02:02.300> major<00:02:02.510> scale

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
mode is simply the C major scale

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.860 
mode is simply the C major scale
starting<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.740> ending<00:02:04.160> on<00:02:04.400> D<00:02:10.570> that's<00:02:11.570> very

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
starting and ending on D that's very

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.370 
starting and ending on D that's very
well<00:02:12.140> with<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> D<00:02:12.740> minor<00:02:13.010> 7th<00:02:13.490> chord<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:14.380> was

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
well with the D minor 7th chord I was

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.590 
well with the D minor 7th chord I was
going<00:02:15.830> for<00:02:16.130> playing<00:02:16.550> melodically

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
going for playing melodically

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.860 
going for playing melodically
and<00:02:17.900> not<00:02:18.350> fast<00:02:18.920> which<00:02:19.610> i<00:02:19.820> think<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.450> very

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
and not fast which i think is very

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.930 
and not fast which i think is very
important<00:02:21.440> for<00:02:21.590> guitarists<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.520> think

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
important for guitarists to think

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.520 
important for guitarists to think
melodically<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:24.620> make<00:02:25.400> musical<00:02:26.180> ideas<00:02:26.660> what<00:02:27.500> I

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
melodically to make musical ideas what I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.380 
melodically to make musical ideas what I
like<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.130> is<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.550> what<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.970> call<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
like to do is do what I call the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.290 
like to do is do what I call the
question<00:02:29.840> answer<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.250> play<00:02:31.490> an<00:02:31.670> idea

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
question answer is to play an idea

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.690 
question answer is to play an idea
take<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> second<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.650> listen<00:02:34.070> what<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.310> played

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
take a second to listen what I played

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.590 
take a second to listen what I played
and<00:02:35.030> then<00:02:35.270> answer<00:02:35.870> what<00:02:36.200> I've<00:02:36.350> played

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.240 

question<00:02:41.600> think<00:02:42.230> about<00:02:42.320> what<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.740> played<00:02:43.040> and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
question think about what you played and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.210 
question think about what you played and
answer<00:02:43.550> it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.280 

so<00:02:49.220> therefore<00:02:49.490> you're<00:02:49.819> creating<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.630> musical

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
so therefore you're creating a musical

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.460 
so therefore you're creating a musical
statement<00:02:51.620> over<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.760> bars<00:02:53.330> rather<00:02:53.840> than<00:02:54.170> just

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
statement over a bars rather than just

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.809 
statement over a bars rather than just
playing<00:02:54.940> Ithorian<00:02:55.940> scale<00:02:57.280> what<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.310> like<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.700> do

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
playing Ithorian scale what I like to do

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:08.010 
playing Ithorian scale what I like to do
also<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.360> take<00:02:59.569> scale<00:02:59.840> patterns<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:07.100> thirds

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
also is take scale patterns in thirds

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.440 
also is take scale patterns in thirds
alter<00:03:09.020> them<00:03:09.230> rhythmically<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.400> you<00:03:11.060> come<00:03:11.300> up

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
alter them rhythmically and you come up

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:25.630 
alter them rhythmically and you come up
with<00:03:11.480> musical<00:03:12.020> ideas<00:03:23.980> another<00:03:24.980> way<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.250> start

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
with musical ideas another way to start

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.590 
with musical ideas another way to start
making<00:03:25.940> musical<00:03:26.569> ideas<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:28.010> use<00:03:28.330> two<00:03:29.330> notes

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
making musical ideas is to use two notes

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.380 
making musical ideas is to use two notes
or<00:03:30.049> three<00:03:30.560> notes<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.130> make<00:03:32.120> different

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
or three notes and make different

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:48.309 
or three notes and make different
rhythmic<00:03:33.319> variations<00:03:34.100> out<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.670> them<00:03:47.319> there's

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
rhythmic variations out of them there's

00:03:48.319 --> 00:04:05.500 
rhythmic variations out of them there's
another<00:03:48.620> example<00:04:03.730> in<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.850> next<00:04:05.120> segment

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
another example in the next segment

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.660 
another example in the next segment
we're<00:04:06.079> gonna<00:04:06.140> talk<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.769> little<00:04:07.070> more<00:04:07.160> about<00:04:07.489> the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
we're gonna talk a little more about the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.140 
we're gonna talk a little more about the
Dorian<00:04:08.150> mode<00:04:09.250> about<00:04:10.250> playing<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.730> all<00:04:10.850> over

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
Dorian mode about playing it all over

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.080 
Dorian mode about playing it all over
the<00:04:11.269> fingerboard<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.609> get<00:04:13.609> a<00:04:13.640> little<00:04:13.910> more

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
the fingerboard and get a little more

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.260 
the fingerboard and get a little more
into<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.260> involved<00:04:16.130> in<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.780> fun<00:04:17.780> mode
