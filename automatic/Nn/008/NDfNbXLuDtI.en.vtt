hey everyone here's the review for the

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.419 
hey everyone here's the review for the
bicycle<00:00:04.310> go<00:00:05.310> stick<00:00:06.049> let<00:00:07.049> me<00:00:07.170> start<00:00:07.470> out<00:00:07.589> by<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
bicycle go stick let me start out by the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.690 
bicycle go stick let me start out by the
image<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> look<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:10.019> um<00:00:10.490> to<00:00:11.490> me<00:00:11.670> I

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
image and the look of it um to me I

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
image and the look of it um to me I
think<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.480> bicycle<00:00:12.870> deck<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
think the bicycle deck is one of the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.790 
think the bicycle deck is one of the
coolest<00:00:13.769> X<00:00:14.130> illusionist<00:00:14.940> has<00:00:15.260> offered<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
coolest X illusionist has offered to the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.120 
coolest X illusionist has offered to the
magic<00:00:17.130> community<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:18.840> size<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:19.920> they

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
magic community the size I like how they

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.040 
magic community the size I like how they
did<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.490> airflow<00:00:21.330> finish<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
did that airflow finish with like a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.880 
did that airflow finish with like a
spade<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> side<00:00:23.789> if<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.480> that

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
spade on the side if you can see that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.990 
spade on the side if you can see that
it's<00:00:25.890> Spade<00:00:27.289> there<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:29.460> did<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it's Spade there and they did all the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
it's Spade there and they did all the
markings<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.650> really

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
markings right there I think they really

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.400 
markings right there I think they really
made<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.279> look<00:00:32.520> trademark<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:34.260> did

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
made that look trademark and they did

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.030 
made that look trademark and they did
the<00:00:34.559> same<00:00:34.739> thing<00:00:34.800> again<00:00:35.309> over<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:37.040> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the same thing again over there and the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010 
the same thing again over there and the
back<00:00:38.340> let's<00:00:39.059> talk<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> back<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.989> back

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
back let's talk about the back the back

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.709 
back let's talk about the back the back
is<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.469> cool<00:00:40.800> Ian<00:00:41.120> it's<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.360> kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
is really cool Ian it's just kind of a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
is really cool Ian it's just kind of a
faded<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.320> black<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:45.739> white<00:00:46.739> color<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.730> if

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
faded out black and white color but if

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
faded out black and white color but if
you<00:00:48.000> look<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:49.010> another<00:00:50.010> deck<00:00:50.340> say<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.890> bicycle

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
you look at another deck say the bicycle

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.439 
you look at another deck say the bicycle
pro<00:00:53.280> deck<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.870> bicycle<00:00:55.260> protec<00:00:55.910> now<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
pro deck the bicycle protec now it is

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.959 
pro deck the bicycle protec now it is
designed<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.640> less<00:00:59.640> color<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> unless

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
designed with less color in it unless

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.230 
designed with less color in it unless
unlike<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.480> regular<00:01:04.080> decks<00:01:06.950> okay<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.240> these

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
unlike the regular decks okay and these

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.130 
unlike the regular decks okay and these
actually<00:01:10.189> fan<00:01:11.479> just<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.110> have

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
actually fan just like this they have

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.940 
actually fan just like this they have
spaces<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:15.439> they<00:01:16.439> didn't<00:01:16.740> put<00:01:16.830> as

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
spaces in there and they didn't put as

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.999 
spaces in there and they didn't put as
near<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.220> much<00:01:17.400> color<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.229> like<00:01:19.229> ink<00:01:19.619> into

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
near as much color like like ink into

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.410 
near as much color like like ink into
the<00:01:20.369> cards<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.630> they've<00:01:21.810> been<00:01:22.110> better<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
the cards so they've been better and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
the cards so they've been better and
whatever<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.900> use<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:27.590> ghosts<00:01:28.590> stick<00:01:28.890> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
whatever you use the ghosts stick it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.850 
whatever you use the ghosts stick it's
the<00:01:29.909> same<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.259> didn't<00:01:31.590> use<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the same thing because they didn't use a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.249 
the same thing because they didn't use a
ton<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> color<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:34.140> nice

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
ton of color and that is really nice

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.200 
ton of color and that is really nice
about<00:01:34.320> these<00:01:34.710> decks<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> pull

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
about these decks now say if you pull

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.429 
about these decks now say if you pull
out<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.950> bicycle<00:01:37.950> black<00:01:38.159> tie<00:01:38.400> her<00:01:38.640> deck<00:01:39.439> right

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
out a bicycle black tie her deck right

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.340 
out a bicycle black tie her deck right
here<00:01:41.780> these<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:44.390> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.720> harder

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
here these are kind of actually harder

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.569 
here these are kind of actually harder
to<00:01:46.470> fan<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:48.020> think<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:50.040> me<00:01:50.159> they're<00:01:50.340> harder<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
to fan I think to me they're harder to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.310 
to fan I think to me they're harder to
fan<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.750> much<00:01:51.840> color<00:01:52.200> in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
fan because they have so much color in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.649 
fan because they have so much color in
them<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:53.159> put<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> ton<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> ink<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.420> them

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
them and they put a ton of ink on them

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.700 
them and they put a ton of ink on them
and<00:01:54.899> stuff<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.180> think<00:01:57.180> these<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.450> UV<00:01:58.110> 500

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and stuff and I think these are UV 500

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.580 
and stuff and I think these are UV 500
airflow<00:01:59.460> finish<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.899> actually<00:02:01.079> kind<00:02:01.530> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
airflow finish and it actually kind of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.139 
airflow finish and it actually kind of
makes<00:02:01.799> some<00:02:01.979> hard<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.460> fan<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:03.149> think<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.110> mean

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
makes some hard a fan I think I mean

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.820 
makes some hard a fan I think I mean
they're<00:02:06.149> easier<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> fan<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:10.610> sea

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
they're easier to fan if you use the sea

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.950 
they're easier to fan if you use the sea
I<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.460> get<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> better<00:02:14.160> use<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.460> fan<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:16.660> says

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
I can get a better use this fan it says

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.270 
I can get a better use this fan it says
different<00:02:17.700> feel<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.650> think<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.100> white

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
different feel and so I think the white

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.450 
different feel and so I think the white
tiger<00:02:21.520> deck<00:02:22.020> has<00:02:23.070> more<00:02:24.070> color<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
tiger deck has more color in it and the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.690 
tiger deck has more color in it and the
ones<00:02:27.670> without<00:02:27.820> color<00:02:28.650> without<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.190> much<00:02:30.370> color

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
ones without color without so much color

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.580 
ones without color without so much color
have<00:02:31.270> easier<00:02:32.140> fans<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.580> use<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.590> that's

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
have easier fans to use and that's

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.580 
have easier fans to use and that's
basically<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.190> use<00:02:36.490> now<00:02:37.150> these<00:02:37.360> stay<00:02:37.840> like

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
basically the use now these stay like

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.660 
basically the use now these stay like
perfect<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.850> like<00:02:40.270> months<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.440> months<00:02:41.770> like

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
perfect for like months and months like

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.010 
perfect for like months and months like

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
I've had this deck up for a while and it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.560 
I've had this deck up for a while and it
still<00:02:47.440> looks<00:02:47.470> brand<00:02:47.920> new<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.730> mean<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.450> whole

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
still looks brand new I mean the whole

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.480 
still looks brand new I mean the whole
package<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> deck<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.130> all<00:02:51.310> looks

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
package and the deck it just all looks

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.130 
package and the deck it just all looks
really<00:02:51.730> good<00:02:51.880> now<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.600> one<00:02:52.870> thing<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:53.080> don't

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
really good now the one thing I don't

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.199 
really good now the one thing I don't
like<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:54.010> after<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.580> started<00:02:54.820> using<00:02:55.030> it

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
like is that after you started using it

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.420 
like is that after you started using it
a<00:02:55.300> lot<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.840> sides<00:02:56.200> start<00:02:56.650> getting<00:02:56.920> darker

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
a lot the sides start getting darker

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.820 
a lot the sides start getting darker
unlike<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.360> bloch<00:02:58.780> high-tech<00:02:59.290> because<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.709> is

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
unlike the bloch high-tech because it is

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.410 
unlike the bloch high-tech because it is
black<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.670> think<00:03:00.790> that's<00:03:01.120> one<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
black so I think that's one of the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.930 
black so I think that's one of the
advantages<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:02.260> owning<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:03.340> watch<00:03:03.550> on<00:03:03.820> your

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
advantages of owning a watch on your

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.420 
advantages of owning a watch on your
deck<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.850> review<00:03:07.540> for<00:03:07.840> the
