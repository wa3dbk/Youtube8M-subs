00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.150 

visit<00:00:02.000> the<00:00:02.120> situation<00:00:02.870> that<00:00:03.650> has<00:00:03.949> the

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
visit the situation that has the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.340 
visit the situation that has the
potential<00:00:04.549> for<00:00:04.819> a<00:00:05.830> nuclear<00:00:06.830> catastrophe<00:00:06.979> and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
potential for a nuclear catastrophe and

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.930 
potential for a nuclear catastrophe and
it's<00:00:09.350> basically<00:00:09.740> a<00:00:10.070> race<00:00:10.400> against<00:00:10.910> time

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
it's basically a race against time

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.860 
it's basically a race against time
because<00:00:11.210> what<00:00:12.110> has<00:00:12.230> happened<00:00:12.710> is<00:00:12.920> that<00:00:13.870> plant

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
because what has happened is that plant

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.200 
because what has happened is that plant
operators<00:00:15.560> have<00:00:15.890> not<00:00:16.160> been<00:00:16.460> able<00:00:16.609> to<00:00:16.970> cool

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
operators have not been able to cool

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.169 
operators have not been able to cool
down<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:18.199> core<00:00:18.560> of<00:00:18.800> I<00:00:19.189> understand<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.089> at

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.019 
down the core of I understand of at
least<00:00:20.359> two<00:00:20.689> reactors<00:00:21.320> which<00:00:22.130> detain<00:00:22.579> enormous

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
least two reactors which detain enormous

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.210 
least two reactors which detain enormous
amounts<00:00:23.419> of<00:00:23.419> radioactivity<00:00:24.199> because<00:00:24.949> of

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
amounts of radioactivity because of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.710 
amounts of radioactivity because of
build<00:00:25.880> backup<00:00:26.449> diesel<00:00:26.689> generators<00:00:28.720> where

build backup diesel generators where

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.540 
build backup diesel generators where
we're<00:00:30.079> probably<00:00:31.419> damaged<00:00:32.500> by<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.559> tsunami<00:00:34.070> or

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
we're probably damaged by the tsunami or

we're probably damaged by the tsunami or
the<00:00:34.760> earthquake<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.050> there<00:00:36.710> is<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.949> major

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
the earthquake so there is a major

tremendous amount of heat that built up

them cooled then what well I mean uh

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.750 
them cooled then what well I mean uh
there's<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.269> window<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.719> time<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.760> probably

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
there's the window of time that probably

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.920 
there's the window of time that probably
somewhere<00:01:05.420> in<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:06.079> matter<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.470> 24<00:01:07.400> hours<00:01:07.930> where

somewhere in a matter of 24 hours where

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.980 
somewhere in a matter of 24 hours where
if<00:01:09.350> they're<00:01:09.619> not<00:01:09.799> able<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.750> pull<00:01:11.750> these

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.899 
reactors that they're not able to
particularly<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.810> fly<00:01:15.020> fresh<00:01:15.890> cool<00:01:16.340> water<00:01:16.369> to

particularly the fly fresh cool water to

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.560 
particularly the fly fresh cool water to
remove<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.390> payee<00:01:17.829> then<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.909> water<00:01:20.149> will

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
remove the payee then the water will

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.770 
remove the payee then the water will
start<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.079> boil<00:01:21.320> off<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.000> eventually<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
start to boil off and eventually the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.280 
start to boil off and eventually the
reactor<00:01:24.729> core<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.060> fuel<00:01:26.390> elements<00:01:26.630> will<00:01:27.140> be<00:01:27.170> a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
reactor core the fuel elements will be a

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.469 
reactor core the fuel elements will be a
boat<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.360> when<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.600> happened<00:01:30.579> then<00:01:31.579> the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
boat and when that happened then the

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.139 
boat and when that happened then the
temperatures<00:01:33.020> start<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.439> build<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:34.430> in

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
temperatures start to build and then in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.800 
temperatures start to build and then in
a<00:01:35.299> matter<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.659> several<00:01:36.290> hours<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.270> start

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
a matter of several hours you can start

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.530 
a matter of several hours you can start
to<00:01:39.049> have<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.860> reactor<00:01:40.610> experience<00:01:41.270> of

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
to have the reactor experience of

to have the reactor experience of
meltdown<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.439> other<00:01:42.890> things<00:01:43.280> could<00:01:43.579> happen

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170

something<00:02:41.270> like<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.480> happened<00:02:42.230> well<00:02:42.950> I

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
something like that happened well I

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.090 
something like that happened well I
think<00:02:43.160> unlike<00:02:43.760> Chernobyl<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:45.590> Japanese
