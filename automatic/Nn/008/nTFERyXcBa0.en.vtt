00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.740 
like straight-up milk in it so yeah
being<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.560> actually<00:02:30.010> pretty<00:02:30.280> hard<00:02:30.750> especially

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
being is actually pretty hard especially

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.880 
being is actually pretty hard especially
when<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.470> have<00:02:32.710> any<00:02:33.190> minutes<00:02:33.670> water<00:02:33.910> because

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
when you have any minutes water because

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.370 
when you have any minutes water because
you<00:02:35.890> want<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.460> binge<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:37.060> ice<00:02:37.570> cream<00:02:38.200> and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
you want to binge on ice cream and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.430 
you want to binge on ice cream and
things<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:39.100> then<00:02:39.340> you're<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:40.440> basically

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
things but then you're like basically

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.650 
things but then you're like basically

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
for my taste buds because that I just I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.050 
for my taste buds because that I just I
missed<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.530> much<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.220> I've<00:03:50.490> seen<00:03:50.880> how

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
missed it so much and I I've seen how

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.510 
missed it so much and I I've seen how
they<00:03:51.240> slaughter<00:03:51.540> those<00:03:51.780> animals<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:53.130> if<00:03:53.400> I

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
they slaughter those animals so if I

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.120 
they slaughter those animals so if I
just<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.510> bit<00:03:54.660> what's<00:03:54.900> up<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.230> ok<00:03:55.320> like

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
just a little bit what's up you ok like

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.600 
just a little bit what's up you ok like
I<00:03:56.430> just<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.090> miss<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.870> but<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.680> feel<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.250> bad

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
I just I miss it but I feel so bad

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.400 
I just I miss it but I feel so bad
because<00:03:59.640> I've<00:04:00.270> seen<00:04:00.540> some<00:04:00.810> really<00:04:01.080> graphic

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
because I've seen some really graphic

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.130 
because I've seen some really graphic
videos<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.370> pictures<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:03.570> slaughterhouses

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
videos and pictures the slaughterhouses

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.380 
videos and pictures the slaughterhouses
and<00:04:04.440> it's<00:04:04.740> also<00:04:04.950> we<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.700> pepperoni<00:04:06.120> or

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
and it's also we can have pepperoni or

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.080 
and it's also we can have pepperoni or
pizza<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.100> having<00:04:08.520> pepperoni

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
pizza and I think that having pepperoni

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.930 
pizza and I think that having pepperoni
on<00:04:09.300> your<00:04:09.420> pizza<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:09.810> actually<00:04:10.410> kind<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.940> greedy

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
on your pizza is actually kind of greedy

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.260 
on your pizza is actually kind of greedy
because<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:14.040> already<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.610> cheese<00:04:15.030> on

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
because you already have the cheese on

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.729 
because you already have the cheese on
there<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.750> cheese<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.170> times<00:04:16.410> that

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
there and the cheese of times that

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.070 
there and the cheese of times that
that's<00:04:17.549> already<00:04:17.820> an<00:04:18.030> animal<00:04:18.390> product<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
that's already an animal product and

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.620 
that's already an animal product and
that<00:04:19.109> has<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> lot<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.430> protein<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.510> you

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
that has a lot of protein in it and you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.720 
that has a lot of protein in it and you
don't<00:04:21.840> need<00:04:22.019> two<00:04:22.320> proteins<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.070> one<00:04:23.250> thing<00:04:23.490> but

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
don't need two proteins in one thing but

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.790 
don't need two proteins in one thing but
I<00:04:24.000> think<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.720> okay<00:04:25.020> it's<00:04:25.290> just<00:04:25.320> harder<00:04:25.770> for

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
I think it's okay it's just harder for

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.280 
I think it's okay it's just harder for
your<00:04:25.980> body<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.430> digest<00:04:26.970> having<00:04:27.960> more<00:04:28.140> than<00:04:28.169> one

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
your body to digest having more than one

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.640 
your body to digest having more than one
type<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.590> protein<00:04:29.040> at<00:04:29.190> once<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.620> yeah<00:04:31.620> I

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
type of protein at once in it so yeah I

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.710 
type of protein at once in it so yeah I
just<00:04:31.830> think<00:04:32.160> you<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.520> have<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.730> cheese<00:04:33.030> pizza

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
just think you just have a cheese pizza

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.900 
just think you just have a cheese pizza
with<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.140> bunch<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.530> vegetables<00:04:34.740> on<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.250> you

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
with a bunch of vegetables on it you

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.820 
with a bunch of vegetables on it you
don't<00:04:36.090> have<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.480> have<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.840> dang<00:04:37.080> pepperoni<00:04:37.650> I

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
don't have to have that dang pepperoni I

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.460 
don't have to have that dang pepperoni I
mean<00:04:38.070> if<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.790> are<00:04:38.940> crazy<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.390> pepperoni<00:04:39.750> go
