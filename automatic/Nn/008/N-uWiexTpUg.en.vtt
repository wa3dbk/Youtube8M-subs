00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.760
 two 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.070
 Today I welcome you to this new 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.870
 chapter of your channel I all talk in this 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.970
 chapter I bring you two tweets for the 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.160
 new fifth- touch ipod camera 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.460
 generation that are very useful and we 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.259
 they bring things that on iPhone 5 are 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.750
 but that in this device are not 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.099
 are 2 tweet obviously decided that 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.860
 we have to install our device 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.170
 and they are totally free from the arrival 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.570
 of big box that means that no 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 they will have to install no arrival on 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.680
 first tweet that we are going to install it 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.109
 flame steel capsule in a blood that 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.359
 it means that our device is going 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.579
 to be able to take pictures while we are 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.800
 recording that is a very good option that 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.140
 bring the iphone 5 but in this ipod 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.510
 touch they did not add as you can see in 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.339
 this moment I will record this model 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.440
 what we have and how can they see me 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.600
 activates this option where a 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.789
 camera then if I pressed it post 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.980
 You take pictures while I'm recording as 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.500
 you can see there the chronometer of 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.450
 when we are recording and how can 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.700
 see is a pretty useful tweet for the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.980
 people that we have ipod touch since this 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.540
 iphone 5 option is very very good and 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.550
 and they added it to us 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.960
 the second tweet that we are going to anchor is 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.940
 call l lb and pt 5 this tweet what we 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.220
 allows is to be able to activate as you can see 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.130
 the option of low lights in our 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.140
 device since the iphone 5 brings this 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.090
 option for photos to come out a lot 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.010
 sharper at night but this iphone does not 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.110
 has it then with this option 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.300
 our photos will come out much sharper 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.760
 at night this option can not be 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.040
 show very well but if you want 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.170
 install this tweet here in the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.990
 description of this tweet come out images 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.790
 so that we have a reference that 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.680
 it also works the truth I have 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.509
 tested and it works pretty well 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.030
 photos come out much sharper as 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.000
 you can see here there goes a little more the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.710
 explanation here would be if this tweet and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 here would be with this tweet the truth as 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.550
 you can see it's not a big change but it's 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.410
 a change that the truth can be 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.160
 quite useful at the same time that we want 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.140
 take a picture at night as you can see 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.970
 those are the two tweets that I present to you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.070
 today I hope they serve you and hopefully 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.290
 like these tweets are very very good and 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.170
 they add quite useful to our 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.420
 device since on the iphone 5 it 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.620
 they added but not us and nothing 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.690
