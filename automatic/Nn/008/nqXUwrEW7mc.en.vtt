00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
test our wires we'll go ahead and turn
on<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> left<00:00:25.619> turn<00:00:25.769> signal<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.670> look

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
on the left turn signal first and look

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.060 
on the left turn signal first and look
for<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.449> circuit<00:00:27.689> okay<00:00:28.260> now<00:00:28.590> our<00:00:28.619> left<00:00:28.949> turn

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
for that circuit okay now our left turn

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.569 
for that circuit okay now our left turn
signal<00:00:29.269> looks<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.840> green<00:00:31.470> wire<00:00:31.740> so

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
signal looks like it's a green wire so

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.920 
signal looks like it's a green wire so
now<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> yellow<00:00:32.880> wire<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.630> left

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
now the yellow wire is going to be left

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.299 
now the yellow wire is going to be left
turn<00:00:34.110> our<00:00:34.260> module<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.829> we'll<00:00:34.950> connect<00:00:35.190> those

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
turn our module so we'll connect those

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850

two<00:00:35.579> together<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.079> green<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
two together so this will be green to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
two together so this will be green to
yellow<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> make<00:00:39.149> our<00:00:39.180> connections<00:00:39.750> we'll

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
yellow now to make our connections we'll

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.240 
yellow now to make our connections we'll
be<00:00:39.989> using<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.290> quick<00:00:40.469> splice<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.980> comes<00:00:41.129> with
