00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 two 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 the earth a blue oasis in the cosmos is 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.750
 the only habitable planet in the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.480
 immensity of the universe or are there there 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.540
 outside other places where life 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.430
 It is also possible in recent years 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.669
 this search became a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.050
 prolific field of research 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.790
 scientists from potsdam investigate 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 celestial bodies that were already 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.320
 discovered intend to determine if 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.280
 life is possible in those worlds 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.770
 Distant why it is so difficult 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.950
 locate extrasolar planets that are 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.320
 habitable as the earth the problem 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 to discover extrasolar planets is 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 that the light of the respective star 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.690
 completely hides the light of the planet 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.430
 if you look at the sky you will only see 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.180
 stars but not the possible planets 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180
 surrounding 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.240
 the little rocky planets like the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.250
 Earth can only be discovered 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.380
 From space 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.380
 when they pass in front of their sun 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.860
 why the nasa american agency 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.200
 launched the kepler probe 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.110
 kepler is equipped with a telescope 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.720
 of one and a half meters your mission detect 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.710
 habitable planets while passing through their 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.290
 star 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.780
 when a planet orbits ahead of 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.090
 your sun blocks part of the light to 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.790
 discover the planet the satellite must 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.420
 to be able to capture the intimate oscillations of 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.420
 starlight 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.549
 our planet for example neutralizes 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.479
 barely one ten-thousandth of the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 solar luminosity 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 another problem is that these transits 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.780
 planetariums are rare by 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.719
 that the kepler probe took a field 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.860
 cosmic more extensive the constellation of 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.789
 swan 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.040
 there monitoring permanently 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.440
 150,000 stars for it must have been 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.970
 oriented very precisely the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.459
 goal was that each star 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.360
 always keep the same position 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.360
 about the detector 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.570
 it was the only way for Blair to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.890
 capture the minute variations of light 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.500
 the planets orbit tests 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.530
 scientists on earth investigate 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.700
 if these distant worlds can also 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.459
 house life 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.390
 for it the planets must move 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.520
 by the so-called habitable zone there is 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.480
 where water exists in a liquid state 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.480
 like on earth 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.780
 liquid water is a premise for the 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.700
 appearance of life as it emerged 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.770
 on earth if on another planet the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.840
 temperature ranges between 0 and 100 degrees 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.830
 we can consider the possibility that 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.110
 there is water in a liquid state 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.990
 but kepler will no longer be able to discover a 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.150
 second planet earth in August the 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.490
 planetary tracking had to be interrupted 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.010
 by the failure of two of its four 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.110
 orientation gears to work 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.450
 accurately the probe needs a 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.910
 minimum of three shortly before the mission 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.490
 original three and a half years had been 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.180
 extended three more years than missed covered 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.490
 in that period 135 exoplanets the most 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.100
 small has a diameter somewhat smaller than 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.320
 the one on our moon the most discovery 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.410
 spectacular is that of a solar system 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.630
 very similar to ours the bodies 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.000
 celestial similar to the earth orbit 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.770
 within its habitable zone are the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.380
 exoplanets with the largest 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.270
 possibilities to house this life 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.020
 type could be many more who 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.090
 course so far 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.430
 once based on data from kepler 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.070
 we calculate that there are about 50 billion 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.640
 of planets in the Milky Way and those 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.620
 about 500 million could be habitable 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.350
 how similar to the earth are those 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.720
 planets or if they really harbor life is 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.320
 something that should clarify missions 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.320
 future
