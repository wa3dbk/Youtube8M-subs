00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.600
 Hello, Welcome to the YouTube channel Digital Digging. 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.000
 In this video we look at PzKpfw IV Ausf.C, both in real life and in War Thunder 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.080
 A series of PzKpfw IV tanks, which formed the backbone of the German tank forces during the 2nd St. war, has its roots in the 1930s. 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.960
 Germany at that time was still bound by the Versailles Treaty, which prohibited the development or construction of tanks 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.160
 Therefore, PzKpfw IV had to be developed under the code name "Begleitwagen" ("Accompanying Vehicle") to avoid undue suspicion. 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.700
 This designation, however, carried some truth in it, as the early versions of Panzer IV were not meant to fight tanks 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.580
 but to support infantry. They were therefore not heavily armored and armed 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.440
 75 mm cannon with a short main, capable of firing three-life grenades. 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.660
 PzKpfw IV also had anti-armor ammunition 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.100
 which were effective against lightly armored targets, but when such Panzer IVs came across very well 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.700
 armored French and British tanks Char B1 bis and Matilda Mk.II, showed the inadequacy of their armor and armor. 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.740
 Even more, the shortcomings of the early versions of PzKpfw IV showed up during Operation Barbarossa 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.800
 where the Germans encountered Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks, which Panzers IV significantly outperformed in firepower and armor. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.300
 Although the career of the early versions of PzKpfw IV ended, the chassis became the basis for a large number of vehicles 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.940
 that remained on duty until the end of the war. 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.700
 This, of course, included later versions of the Panzer IV with better armor and new, more effective armament 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.480
 Furthermore, the Jagdpanzer IV tank destroyers and the Sturmgeschütz IV and Sturmpanzer IV "Brummbär" assault cannons. 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.040
 In War Thunder we have many versions of PzKpfw IV, but this video will focus on Ausf.C. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.880
 It is a 1st-level tank with BR 1.3 and a maximum speed of 35 km / h, which will reach a level surface in seven seconds. 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.420
 The speed of the tower is 16.5 degrees per second and the primary armament is the 7.5 cm KwK 37 L / 24 cannon with a 3.9 second overcharging speed. 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:12.200
 The ammunition supply is 80 rounds. Basic ammunition can break 43 mm armor at 100 m, 35 mm at 500 m and 30 mm at a distance of one kilometer. 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:22.680
 Hull and tower armor is 15 mm thick, 12 mm on top and 30 mm on the forehead. 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.960
 Ausf.C's armor doesn't look very strong, and basic ammunition doesn't mean too much of a threat to the enemy 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.580
 however, an explicable cumulative ammunition has an 80 mm penetration independent of distance 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.440
 and if you can aim well, you can also threaten higher-level tanks, including Soviet T-34 tanks of lower levels. 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.300
 A good game style for this tank is shooting from a distance - find a cover, shoot a few shots (use fast charging here) 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.420
 and then move quickly before the enemy can send you an unwelcome response. 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.860
 Well, that's all for today. If you liked the video, leave it "like", because as I was familiar, one other angel gets his wings for each lajk. 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.120
 That is all. See you next video and see you.
