00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
example now I can change the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.070 
example now I can change the
applications<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.090> well<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> moment<00:01:03.870> as

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
applications as well so at the moment as

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.910 
applications as well so at the moment as

enabled<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:09.960> change<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
enabled in there but you can change it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.620 
enabled in there but you can change it
as<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.340> said<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.909> example<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> want

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
as I'm said so for example if you want

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
as I'm said so for example if you want
it<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.990> enabled<00:01:13.799> when<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.430> using

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939

calculator camera chat on and Chrome

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.130 
calculator camera chat on and Chrome
then<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.930> take<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
then all you have to do is to take that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
then all you have to do is to take that
but<00:01:22.350> apart<00:01:22.560> from<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> does

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
but apart from that that's what it does

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.950 
but apart from that that's what it does
alright<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> next<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.570> we're<00:01:24.810> going

honest<00:02:41.090> now<00:02:41.780> as<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.739> can<00:02:42.830> see<00:02:42.890> over<00:02:43.280> there<00:02:43.430> it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
honest now as you can see over there it

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.940 
honest now as you can see over there it
opens<00:02:43.910> up<00:02:44.239> in<00:02:44.420> full-screen<00:02:45.020> mode<00:02:45.110> whereas<00:02:45.739> on

opens up in full-screen mode whereas on

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.699 
opens up in full-screen mode whereas on
the<00:02:46.370> other<00:02:46.640> one<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.690> can<00:02:48.080> still<00:02:48.290> see<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
the other one you can still see the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.040 
the other one you can still see the
status<00:02:49.340> bar<00:02:49.550> but<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.269> can<00:02:50.390> actually<00:02:50.540> change

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
status bar but you can actually change

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.320 
status bar but you can actually change
this<00:02:51.530> if<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:52.100> don't<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:52.940> full<00:02:53.180> screen

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
this if you don't like it in full screen

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.410 
this if you don't like it in full screen
mode<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.690> if<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.140> just<00:02:54.290> go<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:55.030> settings<00:02:56.030> and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
mode so if you just go to settings and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.830 
mode so if you just go to settings and
then<00:02:56.510> screen<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.680> text<00:02:58.160> then<00:02:58.850> all<00:02:59.600> you<00:02:59.720> have

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
then screen and text then all you have

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.050 
then screen and text then all you have
to<00:02:59.930> do<00:03:00.050> is<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.530> untick<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.519> really

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
to do is to untick that but I really

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.060 
to do is to untick that but I really
like<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.660> set<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.440> default<00:03:03.680> like

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
like that it's set to a default like

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.640 
like that it's set to a default like
this<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:05.600> really<00:03:05.630> takes<00:03:06.110> advantage

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
this because it really takes advantage

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.900 
this because it really takes advantage
of<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.040> 5-inch<00:03:07.519> display<00:03:08.120> on<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.459> galaxy<00:03:10.459> s4

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
of the 5-inch display on the galaxy s4

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.340 
of the 5-inch display on the galaxy s4
now<00:03:11.090> as<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.600> can<00:03:11.690> see<00:03:11.810> there's<00:03:12.019> also<00:03:12.230> a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
now as you can see there's also a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.040 
now as you can see there's also a
background<00:03:12.739> NASA<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.700> find<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.480> really<00:03:14.930> cool

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
background NASA I find it really cool

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.259 
background NASA I find it really cool
not<00:03:15.620> really<00:03:15.799> cool<00:03:15.950> but<00:03:16.250> it's<00:03:17.030> something

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
not really cool but it's something

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.330 
not really cool but it's something
different<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.230> guess<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.590> our<00:03:18.890> eyes<00:03:19.070> although

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
different I guess to our eyes although

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.509 
different I guess to our eyes although
