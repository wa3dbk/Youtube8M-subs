00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.120
 using from sd card takes us to the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.250
 internal card of the terminal but good 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.590
 our rom is on the card 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.590
 external we will choose the second option 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.100

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.460

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.820
 good 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.540
 I want to tell you that this question 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:15.050
 room has been updated and improved 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.950
 importing galaxy themes and ports 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.290
 this 5 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.230
 this room question does not have the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.350
 aroma installer so the whole process 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.200
 it's done from here from the recovery 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.030
 I'm going to pass the video to not do it so 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.709
 long 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.709
 and we continue in a while 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.740
 very well here the process of the 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.800
 installation has finished has finished 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:48.460
 completely down here shows us 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:53.280
 that has already finished and well what now 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.280
 you have to do is restart the terminal 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.690
 let's choose the first option rebot 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.590
 system now 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.780
 for the system to start the process goes 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.360
 take a few minutes because it's your 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.360
 first time and well let's give it 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.160

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.280
 world of the excursion course before 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.430
 empty any rum or any taste 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.090
 in room it is necessary to make a backup of 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.710
 our folder or partition fs 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:34.320
