00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.820
 well clear matte black carbon killer 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.170
 look the sharpest can be 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.640
 Bergschneider caught again 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.099
 I've heard that puts a lot of 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.950
 tailor development work at the sls 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.750
 was understandable since the beginning of year with 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.059
 the car a lot on the nordschleife 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.970
 sachsenring hockenheim hoffheimer very much 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.140
 a lot of ceramic brakes are being developed 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.470
 and it was a lot of fun 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.140
 how fast is the sls amg 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.019
 So at the moment our testers are moving 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.629
 the 47 which i think a bit 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.729
 Potential in it is I think it is too 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.000
 an awesome time considering 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.799
 that black series 400 would be more than 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.930
 10 more than ten seconds slower 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.600
 then you know what's in the car first 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.729
 Amg has the claim 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.500
 to build the right super sports car 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.000
 also against the corresponding ferrari and 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.159
 lamborghini can compete 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.740
 what is in it what this is 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.630
 claim I believe everything 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.049
 in there we have the right one first 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.020
 weight distribution of 47 percent 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.689
 the rear axle 53 that is the sls amg 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.670
 has a great traction and be 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.039
 biggest advantage is simply braking in 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.820
 the corner rows that means the car has 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.219
 not this madness 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.450
 weight shift and is very stable 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.219
 on the rear axle we have 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.530
 dry sump lubrication that does not mean 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.630
 only that the engine more flier up 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.399
 household but quite simply the engine 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.240
 that means much lower in the car 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.240
 in turn, focus 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.250
 eleven curves is actually like that 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.229
 clearly arranged from sid 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.700
 but laguna seca is above all 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.280
 things curve number six man needs 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.960
 Brake on blindly because it is pretty 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.490
 uphill and it is a very fast 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.020
 turn in fourth gear 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.500
 after that comes the famous one 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.480
 corkscrew curve when blind again the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.700
 brake it goes uphill and then steep 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.810
 the track turns off to the left 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.370
 downhill and it is really fun and fun 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.370
 Thanks a lot for a maul tea
