this round of console wars it's a huge

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.020 
this round of console wars it's a huge
deal<00:00:56.969> obviously<00:00:57.719> Sony's<00:00:58.260> lack<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.770> DRM<00:00:59.219> really

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
deal obviously Sony's lack of DRM really

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
deal obviously Sony's lack of DRM really
put<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> pressure<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.930> Microsoft<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> change

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
put the pressure on Microsoft to change

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.709 
put the pressure on Microsoft to change
their<00:01:02.309> policies<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.329> think<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> lot<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
their policies and I think a lot of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
their policies and I think a lot of
gamers<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.379> today<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:05.010> spoken<00:01:05.519> if

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
at some point we're going to have to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.789 
at some point we're going to have to
move<00:01:10.950> forward<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.760> terms<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.330> non<00:01:12.720> disc<00:01:13.439> based

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
directly from the internet and then
playing<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.090> finding<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.960> either

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
playing them and finding a way to either

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.069

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
with friends and family so maybe 24

hours as an authentication checkpoint

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
hours as an authentication checkpoint
isn't<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> best<00:01:40.619> way<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> may<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
isn't the best way to do it may be the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
isn't the best way to do it may be the
better<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.110> every<00:01:43.560> 90<00:01:43.890> days

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
better way to do it is every 90 days

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.389 
better way to do it is every 90 days
like<00:01:44.340> Steam<00:01:44.670> does<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.540> single-player<00:01:45.930> games

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
like Steam does for single-player games

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.859

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
guys think about that and how we can

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.420 
guys think about that and how we can
move<00:01:51.030> forward<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> future<00:01:52.070> when<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.220> get

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
