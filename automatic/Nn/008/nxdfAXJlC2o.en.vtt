00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
inversion has the third in the base so

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.190 
inversion has the third in the base so
this<00:02:48.409> was<00:02:48.829> a<00:02:49.239> root<00:02:50.239> position<00:02:50.480> as<00:02:50.810> we<00:02:50.959> call<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
on top of a B flat chord now right here

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.099

we<00:03:49.190> have<00:03:49.340> an<00:03:49.459> A<00:03:49.549> flat<00:03:49.730> note<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.599> if<00:03:50.750> we<00:03:50.900> play

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
we have an A flat note so if we play

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.270 
we have an A flat note so if we play
this<00:03:51.139> construction

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.370 

we'll<00:03:54.910> actually<00:03:55.090> have<00:03:55.270> another<00:03:55.600> inversion<00:03:56.110> of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380
