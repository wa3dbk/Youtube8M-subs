next year he's gonna be trying to pull
the<00:01:25.850> move<00:01:26.000> off<00:01:26.179> tell<00:01:26.960> me<00:01:27.049> cause<00:01:27.170> deals<00:01:27.470> what's

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
the move off tell me cause deals what's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.740 
the move off tell me cause deals what's
so<00:01:28.009> important<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.969> remember<00:01:29.060> about<00:01:29.390> doing

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
so important to remember about doing

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.990 
so important to remember about doing
this<00:01:29.810> move<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:30.560> make<00:01:30.920> sure<00:01:31.159> you<00:01:31.280> stretch<00:01:31.700> as

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
this move but make sure you stretch as

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.660 
this move but make sure you stretch as
much<00:01:32.030> as<00:01:32.329> possible<00:01:32.590> easier<00:01:33.590> each<00:01:33.770> why<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.429> that

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
much as possible easier each why is that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.660 
much as possible easier each why is that
so<00:01:35.390> they<00:01:35.539> move<00:01:36.110> is<00:01:36.289> more<00:01:36.439> explosive<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.429> can

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
so they move is more explosive you can

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.880 
so they move is more explosive you can
get<00:01:37.789> I<00:01:38.000> got<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.289> guy<00:01:39.409> won't<00:01:39.619> stand<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.860> chance
