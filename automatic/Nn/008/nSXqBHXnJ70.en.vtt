split<00:02:24.709> these<00:02:24.980> two<00:02:25.040> apart

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
split these two apart

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.399 
split these two apart
so<00:02:27.079> by<00:02:27.530> winding<00:02:27.799> this<00:02:28.189> I<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:29.420> actually<00:02:29.989> puts

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
so by winding this I it actually puts

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.649 
so by winding this I it actually puts
pressure<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.099> bottom<00:02:31.280> here<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.510> ball

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
pressure on the bottom here and a ball

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.110 
pressure on the bottom here and a ball
joint<00:02:32.900> should<00:02:33.109> ven<00:02:33.290> split<00:02:33.730> okay<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:35.030> see

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
joint should ven split okay you can see

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.509 
joint should ven split okay you can see
that<00:02:35.269> ball<00:02:35.420> joint<00:02:35.719> is<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> bit<00:02:36.019> now<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:36.439> out<00:02:36.859> 17mm

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
that ball joint is a bit now so out 17mm

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.550 
that ball joint is a bit now so out 17mm
ball<00:02:37.579> comes<00:02:37.969> out<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.209> bottom<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:38.810> what<00:02:39.349> we<00:02:39.439> do

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
ball comes out the bottom and what we do

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.610 
ball comes out the bottom and what we do
is<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.769> prize<00:02:40.129> those<00:02:40.489> two<00:02:40.670> apart<00:02:40.969> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
is you prize those two apart and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.550 
is you prize those two apart and
eventually<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.680> pops<00:02:42.950> out<00:02:43.159> and<00:02:43.879> then<00:02:44.560> we

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
eventually it pops out and then we

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.979 
eventually it pops out and then we
cannot<00:02:45.859> drive<00:02:46.219> shaft<00:02:46.489> through<00:02:46.989> that's

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
cannot drive shaft through that's

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.830 
cannot drive shaft through that's
unbolted<00:02:48.560> from<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.739> top<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:50.239> from<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.599> point

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
unbolted from a top so from this point

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.420 
unbolted from a top so from this point
onwards<00:02:51.849> we<00:02:52.849> pull<00:02:53.120> back<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.540> part<00:02:54.139> owner<00:02:54.430> when

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
onwards we pull back a part owner when

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.899 
onwards we pull back a part owner when
it<00:02:55.549> will<00:02:55.669> come

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
it will come

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.990 
it will come
there<00:02:56.569> we<00:02:56.689> go<00:02:56.889> so<00:02:57.889> we're<00:02:58.010> just<00:02:58.040> gonna<00:02:58.609> take

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
there we go so we're just gonna take

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.879 
there we go so we're just gonna take
away<00:03:05.290> okay<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.969> you<00:03:07.969> can<00:03:08.090> see<00:03:08.269> now

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
away okay so you can see now

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.789 
away okay so you can see now
well<00:03:09.889> we<00:03:10.010> pop<00:03:10.219> that<00:03:10.400> ball<00:03:10.549> joint<00:03:10.849> out<00:03:10.939> away<00:03:11.799> why

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
well we pop that ball joint out away why

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.550 
well we pop that ball joint out away why
it's<00:03:12.980> removed<00:03:13.340> -<00:03:13.579> sorry<00:03:14.120> why<00:03:14.329> it's<00:03:14.810> wise<00:03:15.260> to

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
splines so what we're going to do now is

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.509 
splines so what we're going to do now is
they<00:03:41.989> look<00:03:42.169> like<00:03:42.290> eight<00:03:42.530> mill<00:03:42.739> or<00:03:43.040> ten<00:03:43.340> mill

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
they look like eight mill or ten mill

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.189 
they look like eight mill or ten mill
knots<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:44.629> what<00:03:44.720> you're<00:03:44.810> going<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:44.959> pull<00:03:45.109> the

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
knots and what you're going to pull the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.149 
knots and what you're going to pull the
whole<00:03:45.349> thing<00:03:45.379> off<00:03:45.939> it<00:03:46.939> is<00:03:47.329> wise<00:03:47.569> to<00:03:48.159> have

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
whole thing off it is wise to have

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.039 
whole thing off it is wise to have
something<00:03:49.579> underneath<00:03:51.790> because<00:03:52.790> it's<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.870> work

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
something underneath because it's a work

shaft gearbox when you pull that what we
always<00:03:56.419> going<00:03:56.629> to<00:03:56.720> pull<00:03:56.870> out<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:58.489> to

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
always going to pull out and have to

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.909 
always going to pull out and have to
give<00:03:58.819> my<00:03:58.970> out<00:03:59.090> breath<00:03:59.419> I'm<00:04:00.169> a<00:04:00.229> Crabby<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:00.709> fit

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
give my out breath I'm a Crabby on fit

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.360 
give my out breath I'm a Crabby on fit
okay<00:04:01.519> as<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.729> can<00:04:01.759> see<00:04:02.829> it's<00:04:03.829> like<00:04:03.979> some<00:04:04.129> oils

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
okay as you can see it's like some oils

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.719 
okay as you can see it's like some oils
dropping<00:04:04.699> out<00:04:04.849> they<00:04:05.180> were<00:04:06.069> three<00:04:07.069> times<00:04:07.340> ten

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:07.729 
dropping out they were three times ten

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.539 
dropping out they were three times ten
mill<00:04:08.199> we<00:04:09.199> can<00:04:09.319> get<00:04:09.439> in<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.709> little<00:04:09.859> bit<00:04:10.040> we<00:04:10.489> can

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
mill we can get in a little bit we can

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:22.990 
mill we can get in a little bit we can
see<00:04:12.790> drive<00:04:13.790> shaft<00:04:18.669> drive<00:04:19.669> shaft<00:04:19.940> removed<00:04:22.000> okay

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
see drive shaft drive shaft removed okay

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.320 
see drive shaft drive shaft removed okay
so<00:04:23.570> now<00:04:24.229> we're<00:04:24.409> back<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.740> shed<00:04:25.039> I<00:04:25.330> suppose

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
so now we're back in the shed I suppose

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.019 
so now we're back in the shed I suppose
the<00:04:26.479> first<00:04:26.599> question<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.229> going<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.440> be<00:04:28.029> what

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:29.029 
the first question is going to be what

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.570 
the first question is going to be what
is<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.180> wash<00:04:29.389> hat<00:04:29.630> gearbox<00:04:30.050> or<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.130> watch<00:04:31.310> shaft

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
is a wash hat gearbox or to watch shaft

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.830 
is a wash hat gearbox or to watch shaft
drive<00:04:32.000> shaft

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
drive shaft

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.730 
drive shaft
and<00:04:33.410> while<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.919> taking<00:04:34.220> off<00:04:35.380> I've<00:04:36.380> taken<00:04:36.560> it

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
and while the taking off I've taken it

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.050 
and while the taking off I've taken it
off<00:04:36.830> because<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.190> other<00:04:37.310> ones<00:04:37.520> being<00:04:37.760> bent

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
off because the other ones being bent

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.830 
off because the other ones being bent
and<00:04:38.560> it's<00:04:39.560> leaking<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.450> leads<00:04:41.660> on<00:04:41.810> to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
and it's leaking and that leads on to

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.860 
and it's leaking and that leads on to
the<00:04:42.080> Y<00:04:43.030> web<00:04:44.030> shaft<00:04:44.330> gearbox<00:04:45.520> basically<00:04:46.520> means

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
the Y web shaft gearbox basically means

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.450 
the Y web shaft gearbox basically means
but<00:04:47.870> by<00:04:48.020> shaft<00:04:48.290> is<00:04:48.530> where<00:04:48.770> we<00:04:49.040> have<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:51.220> week<00:04:52.220> 1

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
but by shaft is where we have the week 1

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.060 
but by shaft is where we have the week 1
connection<00:04:52.970> into<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.300> gearbox<00:04:53.540> itself<00:04:54.139> with

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
connection into the gearbox itself with

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.180 
connection into the gearbox itself with
the<00:04:55.250> bearings<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.620> then<00:04:57.620> we<00:04:57.770> have<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.040> age<00:04:58.160> of

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
the bearings and then we have the age of

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.150 
the bearings and then we have the age of
sleeves<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:58.850> this<00:04:58.970> is<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.270> 3<00:04:59.930> x<00:05:00.200> 10<00:05:00.470> mil<00:05:00.710> bolts

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
sleeves so this is the 3 x 10 mil bolts

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.690 
sleeves so this is the 3 x 10 mil bolts
and<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:02.780> actually<00:05:03.320> contains<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.190> oil<00:05:04.250> so<00:05:04.639> if

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
and this actually contains the oil so if

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.909 
and this actually contains the oil so if
you<00:05:04.760> move<00:05:04.940> tool<00:05:05.120> right<00:05:05.360> now<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:06.500> can<00:05:06.620> see<00:05:06.770> the

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
you move tool right now you can see the

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.790 
you move tool right now you can see the
see<00:05:07.100> lead<00:05:07.340> boot<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:08.270> actually<00:05:09.139> retaining<00:05:09.650> the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
see lead boot is actually retaining the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.990 
see lead boot is actually retaining the
oil<00:05:09.950> on<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.130> shaft<00:05:11.410> so<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.590> spins<00:05:13.000> inside

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
oil on the shaft so this spins inside

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.340 
oil on the shaft so this spins inside
here<00:05:14.570> what<00:05:15.320> tends<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.680> happen<00:05:16.630> with<00:05:17.630> 899

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
here what tends to happen with 899

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.420 
here what tends to happen with 899
senchan<00:05:18.800> throws<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:20.479> kink<00:05:20.960> janko's<00:05:21.350> even<00:05:21.710> and

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
senchan throws a kink janko's even and

the Fiat pandas is this develops a weap
and<00:05:26.990> over<00:05:27.229> time<00:05:27.500> you<00:05:28.040> give<00:05:28.250> up<00:05:28.430> soil

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
and over time you give up soil

and over time you give up soil
disappears<00:05:29.210> down<00:05:29.389> the<00:05:29.570> floor<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:30.080> what<00:05:30.889> you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
disappears down the floor and what you

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.000 
disappears down the floor and what you
end<00:05:31.160> up<00:05:31.250> with<00:05:31.310> dodgy<00:05:31.880> gear<00:05:32.210> change<00:05:32.510> is

end up with dodgy gear change is

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.490 
end up with dodgy gear change is
normally<00:05:34.010> someone<00:05:34.400> from<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.729> gearbox<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.540> then

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
normally someone from a gearbox and then

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.390 
normally someone from a gearbox and then
potentially<00:05:37.250> a<00:05:37.610> rather<00:05:37.760> expensive<00:05:38.030> rebuild

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
potentially a rather expensive rebuild

potentially a rather expensive rebuild
that<00:05:40.400> start<00:05:40.729> to<00:05:40.880> happen
