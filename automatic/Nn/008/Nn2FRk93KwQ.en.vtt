00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
we are making art as annex a X pleura

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.370 
we are making art as annex a X pleura
known<00:03:21.440> when<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.739> are<00:03:23.040> when<00:03:23.910> monk<00:03:24.569> paints<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
known when we are when monk paints a

picture and you can see primal
existential<00:03:34.290> anguish<00:03:34.980> absolutely<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.060> you

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
existential anguish absolutely and you

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.430 
existential anguish absolutely and you
can<00:03:36.930> see<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.950> different<00:03:38.670> color<00:03:38.970> palette<00:03:39.600> then

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
can see a different color palette then

can see a different color palette then
is<00:03:40.799> in<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.609> photo<00:03:42.060> real<00:03:42.359> world<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.620> there

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
is in the photo real world it is there

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.210 
is in the photo real world it is there
are<00:03:44.670> these<00:03:44.760> lines<00:03:45.389> of<00:03:45.900> energy<00:03:46.349> that<00:03:46.650> are<00:03:46.859> the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
are these lines of energy that are the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.210 
are these lines of energy that are the
whole<00:03:47.489> image<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.450> rendered<00:03:49.049> in<00:03:49.230> these<00:03:49.650> bold

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
whole image is rendered in these bold

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.830 
whole image is rendered in these bold
lines<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:51.030> energy<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.120> an<00:03:54.299> exploration

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
lines of energy so it is an exploration

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.830 
lines of energy so it is an exploration
of<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:56.900> being<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.260> truth<00:03:58.680> beyond<00:03:59.489> the<00:04:00.120> limits<00:04:00.660> of

our<00:04:01.079> cultural<00:04:01.739> conditioning<00:04:02.540> art<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.870> really

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
our cultural conditioning art is really

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.690 
our cultural conditioning art is really
about<00:04:05.239> going<00:04:06.680> over<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.859> hill<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.370> what<00:04:08.549> is

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
about going over the hill of what is

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.479 
about going over the hill of what is
known<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:10.010> attempting<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.250> touch<00:04:11.909> it<00:04:11.939> hmm

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
known and attempting to touch it hmm

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.920 
known and attempting to touch it hmm
it's<00:04:14.489> like<00:04:14.760> going

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it's like going

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.990 
it's like going
into<00:04:16.199> a<00:04:16.259> dream<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.190> come<00:04:17.430> back<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.880> you

remember the dream enough to bring back

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.360 
remember the dream enough to bring back
some<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.289> wisdom<00:04:22.889> of<00:04:22.979> them<00:04:23.160> of<00:04:23.280> the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
some of the wisdom of them of the

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
perception to bring it back to share

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.070 
perception to bring it back to share
with<00:04:26.160> others<00:04:26.430> hell<00:04:26.699> over<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.810> what

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
which is true I guess they are in a

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.980 
which is true I guess they are in a
symbiotic<00:04:33.870> relationship<00:04:35.210> one<00:04:36.210> pulls<00:04:36.660> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
symbiotic relationship one pulls the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.770 
symbiotic relationship one pulls the
other<00:04:37.169> forward<00:04:37.759> this<00:04:38.759> is<00:04:38.970> what<00:04:39.150> increases<00:04:39.449> our

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
other forward this is what increases our

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.529 
other forward this is what increases our
possibility<00:04:40.560> yeah<00:04:40.800> increases<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.970> holds<00:04:42.389> the

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
possibility yeah increases it holds the

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.020 
possibility yeah increases it holds the
