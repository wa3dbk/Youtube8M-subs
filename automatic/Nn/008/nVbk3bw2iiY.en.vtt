00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
I'm the Argent bad thing but the P acnes
bacteria<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:30.030> particular<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.049> causes

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
bacteria in particular is what causes

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.469 
bacteria in particular is what causes
some<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> these<00:01:31.860> bothersome<00:01:32.490> blemishes<00:01:33.060> now

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
some of these bothersome blemishes now

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.440 
some of these bothersome blemishes now
when<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.689> comes<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.790> now<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.030> comes<00:01:36.210> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
when it comes to now when it comes to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.590 
when it comes to now when it comes to
the<00:01:36.570> Sun<00:01:36.840> UV<00:01:37.680> rays<00:01:37.920> actually<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.820> kill<00:01:39.210> P<00:01:39.420> acnes

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the Sun UV rays actually do kill P acnes

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.830 
the Sun UV rays actually do kill P acnes
bacteria<00:01:40.579> because<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> UV<00:01:42.000> rays<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.329> toxic

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
bacteria because the UV rays are toxic

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.109 
bacteria because the UV rays are toxic
it<00:01:42.990> does<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.619> help<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.130> penetrate<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it does kind of help to penetrate and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149 
it does kind of help to penetrate and
actually<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.290> kill<00:01:46.590> off<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
actually kind of kill off some of the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually kind of kill off some of the
bacteria<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.180> problem<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.229> many

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
bacteria the problem is we have many

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.760 
bacteria the problem is we have many
layers<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.979> skin<00:01:50.430> over<00:01:50.460> our<00:01:50.850> acne<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
layers of skin over our acne and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.080 
layers of skin over our acne and
sometimes<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.670> know<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.820> little

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
sometimes it can get you know a little

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.609 
sometimes it can get you know a little
bit<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> acne<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.930> surface<00:01:55.409> some

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
bit of the acne on the surface some

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.139 
bit of the acne on the surface some
people<00:01:55.920> notice<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.340> acne<00:01:56.640> gets<00:01:56.820> better<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
people notice that acne gets better in

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.310 
people notice that acne gets better in
the<00:01:57.240> summer<00:01:57.479> maybe<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.020> they've<00:01:58.170> been<00:01:58.259> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
the summer maybe because they've been in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.469 
the summer maybe because they've been in
the<00:01:58.469> Sun<00:01:58.649> where<00:01:58.829> often<00:01:59.189> but<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> have

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the Sun where often but if you have

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.660 
the Sun where often but if you have
deep-rooted<00:02:00.960> acne<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.590> cystic<00:02:02.219> acne<00:02:02.340> that's

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
deep-rooted acne or cystic acne that's

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.179 
deep-rooted acne or cystic acne that's
multiple<00:02:03.060> layers<00:02:03.270> under<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> skin<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
multiple layers under the skin this the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.980 
multiple layers under the skin this the
UV<00:02:05.490> rays<00:02:05.700> are<00:02:05.850> probably<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.840> be

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
UV rays are probably not going to be

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.020 
UV rays are probably not going to be
enough<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.799> kill<00:02:08.039> off<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> P<00:02:08.610> acnes<00:02:08.759> bacteria

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
enough to kill off the P acnes bacteria

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.119 
enough to kill off the P acnes bacteria
it's<00:02:09.989> also<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.379> little<00:02:10.590> bit<00:02:10.679> dangerous<00:02:10.830> when

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
it's also a little bit dangerous when

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.380 
it's also a little bit dangerous when
you<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.370> about<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.030> could<00:02:12.270> get

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you think about it because you could get

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.510 
you think about it because you could get
skin<00:02:12.750> cancer<00:02:12.780> now

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
skin cancer now

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.010 
skin cancer now
the<00:02:13.760> reason<00:02:14.090> some<00:02:14.270> people<00:02:14.300> say<00:02:14.630> morning

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
the reason some people say morning

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.540 
the reason some people say morning
sunlight<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:15.860> good<00:02:16.010> idea<00:02:16.100> is

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
sunlight is a really good idea is

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.490 
sunlight is a really good idea is
because<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.300> morning<00:02:17.660> rays<00:02:17.870> are<00:02:18.110> usually<00:02:18.470> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
because the morning rays are usually a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.680 
because the morning rays are usually a
little<00:02:18.680> bit<00:02:18.890> less<00:02:19.130> harmful<00:02:19.610> than<00:02:20.000> rays<00:02:20.300> maybe

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
little bit less harmful than rays maybe

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.080 
little bit less harmful than rays maybe
between<00:02:20.900> 10<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.350> 4<00:02:21.680> p.m.<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.880> morning

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
between 10 and 4 p.m. so the morning

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.310 
between 10 and 4 p.m. so the morning
rays<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.480> hit<00:02:23.630> your<00:02:23.720> back<00:02:23.930> or<00:02:24.140> something

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
rays that hit your back or something

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.650 
rays that hit your back or something
could<00:02:24.710> help<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.100> acne<00:02:25.580> do<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.150> condone<00:02:26.600> it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
could help with acne do I condone it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.570 
could help with acne do I condone it
well<00:02:27.050> Sun<00:02:27.440> does<00:02:27.680> naturally<00:02:28.160> help<00:02:28.370> create

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
well Sun does naturally help create

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.700 
well Sun does naturally help create
vitamin<00:02:28.970> D<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:29.450> small<00:02:29.750> amounts<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.380> very

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
vitamin D so in small amounts it is very

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.460 
vitamin D so in small amounts it is very
very<00:02:30.860> good<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:33.170> would<00:02:33.350> be

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
kill the P acnes bacteria and are more

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.760 
kill the P acnes bacteria and are more
effective<00:02:56.480> when<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.780> comes<00:02:56.960> to<00:02:57.110> penetrating
