00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:01.790
 Hello 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.109
 I show you today again a small carton box except a square one 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.109
 Piece of motif paper can shape 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.389
 which is completely different from ear to ear, for example, from matching color 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.550
 Design paper is a retail investor 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.789
 Polak the box with something and 15 after knew once there would be one 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.560
 small 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.659
 another gift 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.789
 if you have the bankrupt organza or ribbon or a paper handle 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.450
 mounts 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.830
 you come you 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.060
 a small head home 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.250
 or 8 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.420
 if you climb a second quadrant that is three millimeters less than 11 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.200
 you can also tap again 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.330
 shape 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.430
 with the lid to the then a matching box 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.490
 you need a square piece 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.360
 Motif paper 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.810
 in size can vary 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.810
 because definitely with this guide 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.540
 made square paper into a box 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.640
 first is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.970
 maybe we have to go up 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.670
 Rod Stewart will 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.670
 we had one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 these escape cover now occurred 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.320
 because you are all four sides 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 e twice case 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.610
 once the top it will be nothing 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.580
 connect 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.580
 another time fit 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.310
 so that at 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 shown finish line I demand here in parallel 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.230
 so also a variety 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.749
 Schneiders book 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:47.269
 its folded lines 1 2 each equal to the centerline 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.209
 Ann-Kathrin continues 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.339
 Kills brings together supplies 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.339
 others can 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.249
 though tends 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.489
 on the opposite side exactly the same 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.159
 you can do it already case 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.579
 at the side 2 the cuts are the last two sides 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.469
 with the tip to the Mediterranean Sea 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.299
 once again meets red arrow 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.029
 and she shows this up to the incision 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.049
 where i am the nick here 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.479
 Pollard willow free 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.400
 the two outer elements are now still in the 2 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.869
 and now you can drive your little carton away 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:11.629
 and cramping communicated own taste five more missed 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.870
