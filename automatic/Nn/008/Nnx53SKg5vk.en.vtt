00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
reason for that is because this screen

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.410 
reason for that is because this screen
protector<00:01:11.740> was<00:01:12.100> not<00:01:12.310> actually<00:01:12.490> made<00:01:12.850> for<00:01:13.210> my

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
protector was not actually made for my

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.600 
protector was not actually made for my
camera<00:01:13.720> here<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.290> I'm<00:01:14.920> going<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.130> be<00:01:15.220> doing<00:01:15.460> a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
camera here so I'm going to be doing a

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.070 
camera here so I'm going to be doing a
little<00:01:15.730> cutting<00:01:16.060> here<00:01:16.240> just<00:01:16.480> to<00:01:16.570> size<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.960> up

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
little cutting here just to size it up

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.950 
little cutting here just to size it up
so<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.560> will<00:01:17.710> fit<00:01:18.120> properly<00:01:19.120> on<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:19.750> one

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
so that will fit properly on this one

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.030 
so that will fit properly on this one
okay

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
okay

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.120 
okay
but<00:01:21.430> again<00:01:21.670> if<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.970> if<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:22.720> have<00:01:22.900> one<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.860> is

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
but again if you if you have one that is

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.250 
but again if you if you have one that is
made<00:01:24.610> for<00:01:25.000> your<00:01:25.180> device<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.690> could<00:01:25.780> be<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:25.930> phone

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
made for your device it could be a phone

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.140 
made for your device it could be a phone
it<00:01:26.530> could<00:01:26.650> be<00:01:27.570> camera<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.840> could<00:01:29.020> be<00:01:29.850> any<00:01:30.850> other

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
it could be camera it could be any other

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.720 
it could be camera it could be any other
device<00:01:31.540> that<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:32.650> if<00:01:32.950> it's<00:01:33.100> exact<00:01:33.460> fit

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
device that you have if it's exact fit

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.660 
device that you have if it's exact fit
then<00:01:34.330> basically<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:35.350> skip<00:01:35.890> this<00:01:36.100> cutting

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
then basically you skip this cutting

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.520

because you want to have a clean cut
along<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.159> edge<00:02:03.280> if<00:02:04.120> it's<00:02:04.420> tall<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.229> weapon

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
along the edge if it's tall the weapon

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.339 
along the edge if it's tall the weapon
is<00:02:05.770> at<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.159> edge<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.729> not<00:02:06.909> going<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.180> lay<00:02:07.960> flat

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
is at the edge is not going to lay flat

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.260 
is at the edge is not going to lay flat
on<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:09.520> screen

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.610 

so<00:02:14.270> what<00:02:14.420> I'll<00:02:14.510> need<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.780> do<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.050> first<00:02:15.320> measure

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
so what I'll need to do is first measure

00:02:15.620 --> 00:03:51.990 
so what I'll need to do is first measure
the<00:02:16.600> size<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.810> need

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.260 

then<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.110> next<00:03:53.350> thing<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.950> little<00:03:54.880> bit<00:03:55.150> of

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
then the next thing is a little bit of

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:05.290 
then the next thing is a little bit of
the<00:03:56.520> LCD<00:03:57.520> cleaner

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.730 

what<00:04:06.110> clean<00:04:06.440> B<00:04:06.680> surface<00:04:07.390> for<00:04:08.390> sure<00:04:08.570> is<00:04:08.660> no<00:04:08.870> dust

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
what clean B surface for sure is no dust

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.760 
what clean B surface for sure is no dust
or<00:04:10.010> fingerprints<00:04:10.580> on<00:04:10.700> my<00:04:11.440> wanna<00:04:12.440> get<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> little

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
or fingerprints on my wanna get a little
