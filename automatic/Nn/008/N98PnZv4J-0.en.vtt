00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
in here with a certain idea of how

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.009 
in here with a certain idea of how
things<00:00:55.030> were<00:00:55.120> going<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.330> go<00:00:55.479> and<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:55.839> don't

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
things were going to go and I don't

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.899 
things were going to go and I don't
think<00:00:56.199> any<00:00:56.470> of<00:00:56.589> those<00:00:56.769> three<00:00:57.010> players<00:00:57.250> felt

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
think any of those three players felt

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.910 
think any of those three players felt
that<00:00:58.239> things<00:00:58.600> went<00:00:58.809> their<00:00:59.019> way<00:00:59.229> so<00:00:59.290> actually

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
that things went their way so actually

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.310 
that things went their way so actually
in<00:00:59.979> the<00:01:00.070> finals<00:01:00.489> I<00:01:01.210> felt<00:01:01.629> like<00:01:01.720> louder<00:01:01.960> played

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
in the finals I felt like louder played

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.350 
in the finals I felt like louder played
a<00:01:02.350> little<00:01:02.830> bit<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.850> lack<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.150> better<00:01:04.210> word

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
a little bit the lack of a better word

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.050 
a little bit the lack of a better word
flaccid<00:01:04.989> I<00:01:05.110> mean<00:01:05.260> he's<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.379> great<00:01:05.470> player<00:01:06.060> he's

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
flaccid I mean he's a great player he's

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.910 
flaccid I mean he's a great player he's
usually<00:01:07.570> really<00:01:07.930> good<00:01:08.049> with<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.409> her<00:01:08.740> ass

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
usually really good with like her ass

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
and then getting at you with a bigger

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.710 
and then getting at you with a bigger
army<00:01:12.970> while<00:01:13.210> you're<00:01:13.299> trying<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.540> deal<00:01:13.690> with

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
next one it's always the big question

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.550 
next one it's always the big question
and<00:02:45.459> I've<00:02:45.550> been<00:02:46.240> wrong<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.870> many<00:02:46.930> times<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and I've been wrong so many times on the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.270 
and I've been wrong so many times on the
subject<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.040> past<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.760> want<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.150> say

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
subject in the past but I want to say

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.470 
subject in the past but I want to say
that<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.400> better<00:02:51.640> bet<00:02:51.880> would<00:02:52.060> be<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.360> this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
that the better bet would be that this

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.300 
that the better bet would be that this
is<00:02:52.630> not<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.020> last<00:02:53.170> starcraft<00:02:53.709> broodwar<00:02:53.890> us

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
is not the last starcraft broodwar us

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.580 
is not the last starcraft broodwar us
invitational<00:02:55.000> i<00:02:55.030> think<00:02:55.330> starcraft<00:02:55.930> 2<00:02:56.140> will<00:02:56.500> be

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
invitational i think starcraft 2 will be

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.620 
invitational i think starcraft 2 will be
in<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.770> bed<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:56.950> stage<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.580> think<00:02:58.090> they'll<00:02:58.239> find

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
in the bed of stage I think they'll find

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.000 
in the bed of stage I think they'll find
some<00:02:58.900> problems<00:02:59.200> with<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.560> then<00:02:59.770> I<00:02:59.830> think

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
some problems with it and then I think

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.830 
some problems with it and then I think
they're<00:03:00.130> blizzard<00:03:00.850> being<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.450> guys<00:03:01.600> they

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
they're blizzard being the the guys they

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.870 
they're blizzard being the the guys they
are<00:03:01.870> going<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.260> want<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.440> perfect<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.700> that

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
are going to want to perfect it and that

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.460 
are going to want to perfect it and that
being<00:03:04.060> said<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.390> think<00:03:04.570> we'll<00:03:04.900> see<00:03:05.050> one<00:03:05.260> more

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
being said I think we'll see one more

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.010 
being said I think we'll see one more
wcg<00:03:06.070> with<00:03:06.280> starcraft<00:03:06.750> anything<00:03:07.750> else<00:03:07.870> you'd
