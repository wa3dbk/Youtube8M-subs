00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.770 
moving and I thought that was kind of
cool<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> go<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:32.910> f5<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
cool as you know if you go in an f5 you

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.600 
cool as you know if you go in an f5 you
can<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.079> your<00:00:34.320> hands<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.860> move<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.460> when

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.490 
can see that your hands do move so when
you<00:00:35.700> actually<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> first<00:00:37.200> person

lava<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:33.390> rough<00:01:33.659> idea<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.140> I

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
lava you know very rough idea but I

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
lava you know very rough idea but I
thought<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.799> kind<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.189> cool<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
thought that would be kind of cool so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.969 
thought that would be kind of cool so
that's<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.770> mod

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that's that and then one thing this mod

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's that and then one thing this mod
does<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.460> when<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.759> eat<00:01:39.020> items<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.380> should<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
does is when you eat items or should I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.140 
does is when you eat items or should I
say<00:01:40.979> when<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.369> hungry<00:01:41.549> let<00:01:41.790> me<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.000> into

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
say when you're hungry let me go into

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.929 
say when you're hungry let me go into
survival<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:43.280> when<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.340> eat<00:01:44.520> items<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
survival here when you eat items it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.130 
survival here when you eat items it
doesn't<00:01:45.210> actually<00:01:45.329> bring<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> food<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> your

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
doesn't actually bring the food to your

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.440 
doesn't actually bring the food to your
face<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.880> good<00:01:48.149> or

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
face so I don't know if that's a good or

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.760 
face so I don't know if that's a good or
bad<00:01:48.600> feature<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.439> know<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
bad feature don't really know what to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
bad feature don't really know what to
say<00:01:49.920> about<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> particle

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
say about that you just get the particle

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.389 
say about that you just get the particle
effects<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.619> doesn't<00:01:52.890> actually<00:01:52.950> bring

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
effects but it doesn't actually bring

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
effects but it doesn't actually bring
the<00:01:53.729> food<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> your<00:01:54.509> mouth<00:01:54.720> because<00:01:55.380> obviously

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the food to your mouth because obviously

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.080 
the food to your mouth because obviously
it<00:01:55.890> doesn't<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> go<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.820> five

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it doesn't do that when you go at five

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.639 
it doesn't do that when you go at five
so<00:01:57.540> i<00:01:57.780> guess<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> could<00:01:58.140> call<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> little

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so i guess you could call that a little

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.920 
so i guess you could call that a little
bit<00:01:58.860> more<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.189> realistic<00:01:59.520> feature<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.630> i

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
bit more of a realistic feature but i

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.539 
bit more of a realistic feature but i
guess<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.560> could<00:02:01.680> kind<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> argue<00:02:02.369> that

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
guess you could kind of argue that

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.010 
guess you could kind of argue that
because<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.090> bring<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.570> food

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
because you do bring you know food

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
because you do bring you know food
your<00:02:04.170> mouth<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.590> real<00:02:04.829> life<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.789> anyways

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
your mouth in real life but anyways

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.340 
your mouth in real life but anyways
let's<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.570> ahead<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> running<00:02:07.109> through<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
let's go ahead and running through the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
let's go ahead and running through the
damage<00:02:07.710> items<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.340> guys<00:02:08.489> saw<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
damage items here you guys saw the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.509 
damage items here you guys saw the
pickaxe<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.450> uh<00:02:09.709> not<00:02:10.709> much<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> say<00:02:11.160> about<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
pickaxe so uh not much to say about that

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.860 
pickaxe so uh not much to say about that
but<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.849> pretty<00:02:11.970> cool<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.269> your<00:02:12.390> mind<00:02:12.629> could

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
but it's pretty cool in your mind could

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.210 
but it's pretty cool in your mind could
you<00:02:12.900> get<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.230> kind<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.500> cool<00:02:13.680> effect<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.069> went

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
you get that kind of cool effect I went

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.160 
you get that kind of cool effect I went
across<00:02:14.370> your<00:02:14.580> face<00:02:14.760> rather<00:02:15.420> than<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:16.050> you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
across your face rather than what you

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.290 
across your face rather than what you
get<00:02:16.379> without<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.920> mod<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.370> then<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.090> have

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
get without this mod and then we have

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.110 
get without this mod and then we have
our<00:02:18.510> spade<00:02:19.349> or<00:02:19.379> shovel<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.910> pretty<00:02:21.030> much

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
our spade or shovel and that pretty much

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.900 
our spade or shovel and that pretty much
does<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.750> exact<00:02:22.049> same<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.040> pickaxe

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
does the exact same thing as the pickaxe

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.119 
does the exact same thing as the pickaxe
and<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.690> our<00:02:24.959> acts<00:02:25.290> right<00:02:25.680> here<00:02:25.980> and

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
and then we have our acts right here and

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.860 
and then we have our acts right here and
i<00:02:26.160> thought<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.090> kind<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.480> looked<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.720> little

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
i thought this kind of looked a little

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.850 
i thought this kind of looked a little
bit<00:02:28.049> cool<00:02:28.200> when<00:02:28.319> you're<00:02:28.379> chopping<00:02:28.560> down<00:02:28.799> trees

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
bit cool when you're chopping down trees

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.270 
bit cool when you're chopping down trees
let's<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.430> ahead<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.610> try<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:31.950> yeah

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
let's go ahead and try that so what yeah

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.970 
let's go ahead and try that so what yeah
and<00:02:32.549> then<00:02:32.910> we<00:02:33.030> have<00:02:33.180> our<00:02:33.390> regular<00:02:33.810> sword<00:02:34.680> where

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
and then we have our regular sword where

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.190 
and then we have our regular sword where
you<00:02:35.370> guys<00:02:35.549> know<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.060> looks<00:02:36.360> very<00:02:36.480> cool<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.049> your

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
down with the map I thought that was

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.350 
down with the map I thought that was
kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.470> cool<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:50.489> we<00:02:50.610> go<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:50.880> five<00:02:51.120> year

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
kind of cool and if we go at five year

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.850 
kind of cool and if we go at five year
you<00:02:51.450> guys<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.750> see<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.019> we<00:02:52.110> still<00:02:52.349> have<00:02:52.620> the

you guys can see that we still have the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.170
