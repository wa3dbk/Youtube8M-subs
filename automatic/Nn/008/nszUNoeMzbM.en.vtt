difference<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.880> if<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:14.299> like<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
difference that if you really like the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.880 
difference that if you really like the
ones<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.959> video<00:02:15.049> when<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.500> call<00:02:15.620> five

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
ones in the video when you call five

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.580 
ones in the video when you call five
four<00:02:16.130> oh<00:02:16.160> three<00:02:16.400> seven<00:02:16.670> two<00:02:16.700> drum<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:18.260> cymbals

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
four oh three seven two drum the cymbals

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.860 
four oh three seven two drum the cymbals
again<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.099> really<00:02:19.310> nice<00:02:19.549> complex<00:02:20.060> texture<00:02:20.630> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
again a really nice complex texture and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.259 
again a really nice complex texture and
that's<00:02:21.019> what<00:02:21.139> I<00:02:21.200> look<00:02:21.350> for<00:02:21.560> in<00:02:21.680> cymbals

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
that's what I look for in cymbals

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.580 
that's what I look for in cymbals
they're<00:02:23.269> either<00:02:23.450> supposed<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.900> do<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.019> job<00:02:24.109> to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
they're either supposed to do a job to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.530 
they're either supposed to do a job to
be<00:02:24.620> bright<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.370> dark<00:02:25.760> they're<00:02:26.090> supposed<00:02:26.450> to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
be bright to be dark they're supposed to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.420 
be bright to be dark they're supposed to
sustain<00:02:27.079> for<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.350> long<00:02:27.530> time<00:02:27.829> or<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.160> short<00:02:28.190> time

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
sustain for a long time or a short time

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.580 
sustain for a long time or a short time
but<00:02:29.209> what<00:02:29.329> makes<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.630> cymbal<00:02:29.959> better<00:02:30.200> or<00:02:30.410> worse

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
but what makes a cymbal better or worse

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.220 
but what makes a cymbal better or worse
in<00:02:30.950> my<00:02:31.100> opinion<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.670> whether<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:32.989> that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
in my opinion is whether you have that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.500 
in my opinion is whether you have that
complexity<00:02:33.859> or<00:02:34.220> if<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.760> want<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:34.970> very<00:02:35.090> clean

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
complexity or if you want a very clean

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.479 
complexity or if you want a very clean
cymbal<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.230> can<00:02:36.769> look<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.400> you

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
cymbal you can look for that but you

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.710 
cymbal you can look for that but you
typically<00:02:37.760> find<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:38.389> something<00:02:38.600> that

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
typically find that it's something that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.720 
typically find that it's something that
costs<00:02:39.049> about<00:02:39.139> 150<00:02:39.799> bucks<00:02:39.980> if<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.670> want

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
costs about 150 bucks if you want

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030 
costs about 150 bucks if you want
something<00:02:41.120> complex<00:02:41.650> something<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.829> does<00:02:43.010> a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
something complex something that does a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.360 
something complex something that does a
lot<00:02:43.340> more<00:02:43.400> than<00:02:43.819> one<00:02:44.440> sample<00:02:45.440> e<00:02:45.739> Roland

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
lot more than one sample e Roland

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.860 
lot more than one sample e Roland
electric<00:02:46.760> KITT<00:02:46.910> sounding<00:02:47.299> thing<00:02:47.510> over<00:02:47.780> and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
electric KITT sounding thing over and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.840 
electric KITT sounding thing over and
over<00:02:47.959> you've<00:02:48.889> got<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.280> something<00:02:49.519> hand

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
over you've got to get something hand

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.150 
over you've got to get something hand
hammered<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:51.139> that<00:02:51.440> takes<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.739> lot<00:02:51.829> of<00:02:51.889> time<00:02:52.130> a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
hammered and that takes a lot of time a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.710 
hammered and that takes a lot of time a
lot<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.489> labor<00:02:52.730> that's<00:02:53.000> why<00:02:53.120> they<00:02:53.239> cost<00:02:53.480> so

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
lot of labor that's why they cost so

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.410 
lot of labor that's why they cost so
much<00:02:53.840> more<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:55.519> really<00:02:55.670> can't<00:02:56.030> get<00:02:56.180> more

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
much more you really can't get more

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.840 
much more you really can't get more
complex<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.230> interesting<00:02:57.319> sounding<00:02:58.220> than
