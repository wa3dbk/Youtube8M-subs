 the climate of Coriano and then of Sciacca now 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.770
 then we put the water back and put it back 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.390

 let's put back on the century without salt for 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.040
 an hour when they are cooking 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.150
 adds refit we would be doing for 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.510
 another 5 6 minutes and then we give ourselves flame 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.510
 moderate 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.680
 here we have lit the fire and the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.950
 flame and moderate, I recommend now 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.390

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.190
 it was entirely noticed that the bully is 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.110
 comes out and let's go so I have 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.880
 at least for us we taste an e 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.740
 however consider themselves and they are softer 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.440
 less soft so we always taste 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.390
 when they are cooked we add the salt 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.330
 let him go 35 minutes and then 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.180
 we close it so we can keep them 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.660
 once cooled and freeze them in the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:17.930
 case now that they want to lower the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:19.610
 flame and cover and let go 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.840

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.530
 and I give you 34 minutes 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.810
 maximum we can use these for 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.510
 make them to the salad to preserve them 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.989
 containers with their cooking water 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.980
