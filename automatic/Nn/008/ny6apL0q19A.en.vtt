running is an extremely important part
of<00:00:14.370> your<00:00:14.460> training<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.139> thought<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.260> watch<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
of your training I thought this watch to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.349 
of your training I thought this watch to
be<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> really<00:00:17.550> good<00:00:17.730> motivator<00:00:18.619> for<00:00:19.619> that

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
be a really good motivator for that

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.550 
be a really good motivator for that
which<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.480> why<00:00:21.600> I'm<00:00:21.720> doing<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.020> little<00:00:22.140> review

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
which is why I'm doing a little review

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.960 
which is why I'm doing a little review
there's<00:00:22.890> play<00:00:23.039> time<00:00:23.310> other<00:00:23.460> reviews<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.880> these

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
there's play time other reviews on these

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
there's play time other reviews on these
watches<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> don't<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> spend<00:00:25.859> too

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
watches so I don't want to spend too

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.349 
watches so I don't want to spend too
long<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.400> them<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.760> always<00:00:26.910> go<00:00:27.090> look<00:00:27.269> at

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
long on them you can always go look at

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
long on them you can always go look at
those<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.560> want<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> give<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:29.070> take<00:00:29.279> on

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
those I just want to give you my take on

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.970 
those I just want to give you my take on
it<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.849> find<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:30.929> watches<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:31.529> helpful

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it I find these watches very helpful

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
it I find these watches very helpful
because<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> track<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.059> pace<00:00:33.420> your

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
because you can track your pace your

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.560 
because you can track your pace your
distance<00:00:34.190> your<00:00:35.190> elevation<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.360> kind

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
distance your elevation so you can kind

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.970 
distance your elevation so you can kind
of<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.840> whether<00:00:37.079> you're<00:00:37.290> improving<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.829> not

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
of see whether you're improving or not

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.340 
of see whether you're improving or not
and<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.579> need<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> push<00:00:39.000> yourself<00:00:39.350> it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and when you need to push yourself it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.450 
and when you need to push yourself it
also<00:00:40.500> works<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> heart<00:00:41.309> rate<00:00:41.340> monitor

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
also works with a heart rate monitor

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
also works with a heart rate monitor
which<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> buy<00:00:42.360> separately<00:00:42.690> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
which you have to buy separately so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.590 
which you have to buy separately so
it'll<00:00:43.170> sink<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.530> heart<00:00:43.739> rate<00:00:43.860> monitor<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
it'll sink to heart rate monitor and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.180 
it'll sink to heart rate monitor and
until<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.809> heart<00:00:46.020> rates<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.620> avatar<00:00:47.039> rate

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
until your heart rates your avatar rate

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
until your heart rates your avatar rate
over<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> course<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> runs<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
over the course it runs and as you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
over the course it runs and as you
progress<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.879> training<00:00:51.210> you'll<00:00:52.110> have

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
progress with your training you'll have

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.540 
progress with your training you'll have
to<00:00:52.379> push<00:00:52.559> harder<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.890> keep<00:00:53.039> your<00:00:53.219> heart<00:00:53.399> rate

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
to push harder to keep your heart rate

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.770 
to push harder to keep your heart rate
up<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
up so it's just not a way to kind of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.110 
up so it's just not a way to kind of
track<00:00:55.320> data<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.949> whether<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.489> you're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
track data to see whether you're you're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
track data to see whether you're you're
improving<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.690> you're<00:00:58.020> training<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.010> in

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
improving or not you're training so in

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.860 
improving or not you're training so in
that<00:00:59.609> sense<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.059> found<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> watched<00:01:00.690> your

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that sense I found this watched your

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
that sense I found this watched your
really<00:01:01.140> helpful<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.010> connects<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.520> couple

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
really helpful it connects a couple

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
really helpful it connects a couple
different<00:01:03.120> ways<00:01:03.180> it'll<00:01:03.539> connect<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> GPS

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
different ways it'll connect to GPS

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.980 
different ways it'll connect to GPS
obviously<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:06.060> it'll<00:01:06.240> also<00:01:06.330> connect<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> your

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
obviously but it'll also connect to your

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
obviously but it'll also connect to your
Nike<00:01:07.350> Plus<00:01:07.500> shoes<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> little

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
Nike Plus shoes so if you have a little

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.160 
Nike Plus shoes so if you have a little
pod<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.299> shoes<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.750> connect<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pod in your shoes that will connect to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.590 
pod in your shoes that will connect to
that<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.470> well<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> that's<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.479> some

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that as well so that's like for some

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
that as well so that's like for some
reason<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:12.869> can't<00:01:12.900> find<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> satellite<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
reason they can't find the satellite you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
reason they can't find the satellite you
can<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> quick<00:01:15.479> run<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> it'll<00:01:16.710> start

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
can just do a quick run and it'll start

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.280 
can just do a quick run and it'll start
automatically<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.729> shoe<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.869> if

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
automatically with the shoe and then if

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
automatically with the shoe and then if
it<00:01:19.470> finds<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> satellite<00:01:20.280> okay<00:01:20.610> it'll

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it finds the satellite okay it'll

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.859 
it finds the satellite okay it'll
connect<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.600> don't<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
connect to that so you don't have to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.469 
connect to that so you don't have to
always<00:01:21.960> wait<00:01:22.170> around<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> satellite

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
always wait around for the satellite

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.940 
always wait around for the satellite
with<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> set<00:01:24.869> I've<00:01:24.990> used<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.409> over<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
with that set I've used this for over a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.300 
with that set I've used this for over a
year<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.580> I've<00:01:27.240> probably<00:01:27.600> logged<00:01:28.100> 400<00:01:29.100> plus

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
year and I've probably logged 400 plus

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.690 
year and I've probably logged 400 plus
miles<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.590> don't<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.520> maybe

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
miles and I don't have I think maybe

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.310 
miles and I don't have I think maybe
once<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.180> twice<00:01:33.240> they've<00:01:33.659> had<00:01:33.780> difficulties

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
once or twice they've had difficulties

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.499 
once or twice they've had difficulties
finding<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.799> satellite<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:36.270> other<00:01:36.390> than

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
finding the satellite but other than

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.780 
finding the satellite but other than
that<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.930> finds<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.500> satellite<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.100> within<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that it finds a satellite and within a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.520 
that it finds a satellite and within a
couple<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.119> minutes<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> most

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
couple of minutes at the most

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.990 
couple of minutes at the most
so<00:01:40.979> I'll<00:01:41.070> put<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> watch<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.909> getting

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so I'll put the watch on as I'm getting

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
so I'll put the watch on as I'm getting
ready<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.659> by<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> time<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> step<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
ready and by the time I step out the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.649 
ready and by the time I step out the
door<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.610> what's<00:01:44.820> beeping<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> say<00:01:45.450> hey

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
door you know what's beeping to say hey

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
door you know what's beeping to say hey
it's<00:01:45.810> ready<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.439> were<00:01:46.680> linked<00:01:46.920> up

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
it's ready you know we were linked up

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's ready you know we were linked up
we're<00:01:47.220> ready<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.720> no

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
we're ready to go so I have really no

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.760 
we're ready to go so I have really no
problems<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.259> their<00:01:49.409> fighting<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
problems with their fighting the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460 
problems with their fighting the
satellite<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:51.210> tracking<00:01:51.570> me<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.110> run<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
satellite or or tracking me as I run it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.219 
satellite or or tracking me as I run it
doesn't<00:01:52.770> block<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.180> run<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.899> once<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
doesn't block out as I run and once I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.660 
doesn't block out as I run and once I
upload<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> data<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> whole<00:01:56.490> map

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
upload the data I can see the whole map

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
upload the data I can see the whole map
of<00:01:56.729> where<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> ran<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.500> sense<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
of where it ran so in that sense the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.469 
of where it ran so in that sense the
satellite<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> connectivity<00:02:00.060> has<00:02:00.329> been

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
satellite and the connectivity has been

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
satellite and the connectivity has been
no<00:02:00.689> problem<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> reason<00:02:03.390> I'm

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
no problem at all but the reason I'm

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
no problem at all but the reason I'm
doing<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.689> review<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.229> actual<00:02:04.619> quality

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
doing this review is the actual quality

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.920 
doing this review is the actual quality
of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> watch<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.270> said<00:02:06.450> I've<00:02:06.570> used<00:02:06.780> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.770 
of the watch like I said I've used it
for<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.259> slightly<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> year<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
for just slightly over a year and the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
for just slightly over a year and the
screen<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.110> actually<00:02:10.709> kind<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.370> went<00:02:11.730> dead<00:02:11.910> on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940

screen like I said this is I've used to

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.550 
screen like I said this is I've used to
log<00:02:21.909> over<00:02:22.120> 400<00:02:22.599> miles<00:02:22.749> on<00:02:22.989> this<00:02:23.079> watch<00:02:23.319> but

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
log over 400 miles on this watch but

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.500 
log over 400 miles on this watch but
it's<00:02:23.680> been<00:02:23.859> just<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.639> over<00:02:24.879> a<00:02:24.909> year<00:02:25.269> and

it's been just a little over a year and
I<00:02:26.469> don't<00:02:26.560> have<00:02:26.829> use<00:02:27.040> my<00:02:27.189> products<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:28.120> can

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
I don't have use my products you can

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.429 
I don't have use my products you can
look<00:02:28.389> at<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.599> thing<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:28.989> see<00:02:29.139> that<00:02:29.290> it's

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
look at this thing and see that it's

look at this thing and see that it's
really<00:02:29.709> almost<00:02:29.889> like<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.430> perfect<00:02:30.639> condition

really almost like in perfect condition
I<00:02:31.450> use<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.139> only<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.469> my<00:02:32.799> runs<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.280> don't<00:02:33.489> wear

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670

haven't dropped it I haven't hit it

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.750 
haven't dropped it I haven't hit it
against<00:02:40.659> anything<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.290> haven't<00:02:42.129> got<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.489> like

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
against anything I haven't got it like

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.429 
against anything I haven't got it like
submerged<00:02:43.569> in<00:02:43.689> water<00:02:43.719> even<00:02:44.200> though<00:02:44.290> it's

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
submerged in water even though it's

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.569 
submerged in water even though it's
water<00:02:44.590> resistant<00:02:45.129> that<00:02:45.189> shouldn't<00:02:45.489> be<00:02:45.549> a

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
water resistant that shouldn't be a

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:45.990 
water resistant that shouldn't be a
problem

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
problem

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.640 
problem
I<00:02:46.180> don't<00:02:46.629> think<00:02:46.659> I've<00:02:46.870> even<00:02:47.109> taken<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.500> out

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
I don't think I've even taken this out

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
I don't think I've even taken this out
in<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.829> rainstorm<00:02:48.010> obviously<00:02:48.939> I've<00:02:49.030> swept<00:02:49.299> when

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
in a rainstorm obviously I've swept when

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.599 
in a rainstorm obviously I've swept when
I<00:02:49.510> run<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.049> being<00:02:50.739> that's<00:02:50.889> water<00:02:51.099> resistant

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
I run but being that's water resistant

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.309 
I run but being that's water resistant
that<00:02:51.730> shouldn't<00:02:52.030> make<00:02:52.120> any<00:02:52.150> difference<00:02:52.389> so

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
that shouldn't make any difference so

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.589 
that shouldn't make any difference so
I'm<00:02:53.379> not<00:02:53.500> exactly<00:02:53.799> sure<00:02:53.980> how<00:02:54.579> or<00:02:54.879> why<00:02:55.120> this

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
I'm not exactly sure how or why this

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.500 
I'm not exactly sure how or why this
screen<00:02:55.900> went<00:02:56.109> dead<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.260> me<00:02:56.379> but<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.430> did<00:02:57.669> with

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
screen went dead on me but it did with

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.360 
screen went dead on me but it did with
that<00:02:58.750> said<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.260> actually<00:02:59.650> still<00:02:59.919> does<00:03:00.099> work

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
that said it actually still does work

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.199 
that said it actually still does work
which<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.269> which<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.379> a<00:03:02.409> you<00:03:03.219> know<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.579> good

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
which is which is a you know a good

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.030 
which is which is a you know a good
thing<00:03:04.419> I<00:03:04.540> guess<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:05.049> since<00:03:05.620> I've<00:03:05.709> used<00:03:05.829> it<00:03:06.010> for

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
thing I guess and since I've used it for

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.589 
thing I guess and since I've used it for
over<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> year<00:03:06.459> I'll<00:03:06.760> know<00:03:06.969> where<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.239> am<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.540> the

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
over a year I'll know where I am in the

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.500 
over a year I'll know where I am in the
menus<00:03:07.959> just<00:03:08.230> by<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:08.949> buttons<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.239> can

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
menus just by the buttons so I can

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.319 
menus just by the buttons so I can
actually<00:03:10.919> go<00:03:11.919> down<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.400> start<00:03:12.699> a<00:03:12.760> run<00:03:12.939> even

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
actually go down to start a run even

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.849 
actually go down to start a run even
though<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.510> can't<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.049> on<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.199> display<00:03:14.439> and

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
though I can't see it on the display and

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.939 
though I can't see it on the display and
it'll<00:03:15.400> beep<00:03:15.609> when<00:03:15.909> it's<00:03:16.030> ready<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:17.169> in<00:03:17.620> that

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
it'll beep when it's ready so in that

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.399 
it'll beep when it's ready so in that
sense<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.370> still<00:03:18.639> use<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:18.879> for<00:03:19.449> the<00:03:19.989> last<00:03:20.139> month

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
sense I still use it for the last month

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.809 
sense I still use it for the last month
or<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.650> still<00:03:20.949> used<00:03:21.189> it<00:03:21.340> with<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.549> screen

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
or so I still used it with the screen

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.360 
or so I still used it with the screen
dead<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.359> I<00:03:22.810> won't<00:03:23.290> know<00:03:23.470> though<00:03:23.769> whether<00:03:24.129> I'm

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370

up or push a little farther which is a
big<00:03:44.229> disappointment<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.919> think<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.220> watch

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
big disappointment I think the watch

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.740 
big disappointment I think the watch
retailed<00:03:45.879> I<00:03:46.000> think<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.239> bought<00:03:46.419> it<00:03:46.509> for<00:03:46.629> like

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
retailed I think I bought it for like

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.210 
retailed I think I bought it for like
150<00:03:47.379> bucks<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:49.209> know<00:03:49.329> for<00:03:49.590> $150<00:03:50.590> for<00:03:51.099> this

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
150 bucks so you know for $150 for this

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.520 
150 bucks so you know for $150 for this
thing<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.759> kind<00:03:52.449> of<00:03:52.509> crap<00:03:52.720> out<00:03:52.900> on<00:03:53.079> me<00:03:53.199> in<00:03:53.349> less

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
thing to kind of crap out on me in less

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.679 
thing to kind of crap out on me in less
than<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.829> year<00:03:53.859> or<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.849> little<00:03:54.939> over<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.329> year<00:03:55.659> I

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
than a year or a little over a year I

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.110 
than a year or a little over a year I
should<00:03:55.900> say<00:03:56.639> it's<00:03:57.639> kind<00:03:57.879> of<00:03:57.939> disappointing

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120

should say it's kind of disappointing
and<00:03:58.810> definitely<00:03:59.290> not<00:03:59.439> worth<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.859> to<00:04:00.099> purchase

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.610 
and definitely not worth it to purchase
one<00:04:01.389> thing<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.629> if<00:04:01.750> they're<00:04:01.900> gonna<00:04:02.019> die<00:04:02.259> on<00:04:02.439> you

it<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.130> think<00:04:30.370> it's<00:04:30.490> an<00:04:30.610> excellent<00:04:30.940> tool<00:04:31.240> but

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
it I think it's an excellent tool but

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.340 
it I think it's an excellent tool but
the<00:04:32.590> actual<00:04:32.980> quality<00:04:33.699> of<00:04:34.000> this<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.360> lacking

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
the actual quality of this is lacking

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.950 
the actual quality of this is lacking
and<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:36.520> definitely<00:04:36.880> not<00:04:36.970> worth<00:04:37.150> 250<00:04:37.750> bucks

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and it's definitely not worth 250 bucks

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.450 
and it's definitely not worth 250 bucks
if<00:04:38.229> you're<00:04:38.620> gonna<00:04:38.710> have<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:38.979> show<00:04:39.160> that<00:04:39.190> out
