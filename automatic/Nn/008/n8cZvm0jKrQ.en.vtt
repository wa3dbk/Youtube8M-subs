cup of eggnog and those are just beaten
together<00:02:49.150> until<00:02:49.480> they're<00:02:49.690> smooth<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.200> that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
together until they're smooth and that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.350 
together until they're smooth and that
makes<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.680> icing<00:02:50.980> for<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.220> top<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.180> just

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
makes the icing for the top so I just

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.270 
makes the icing for the top so I just
thought<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.660> would<00:02:52.840> give<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> really<00:02:53.739> nice

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
thought this would give a really nice

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.370 
thought this would give a really nice
big<00:02:54.610> surface<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.299> icing<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.110> it's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
big surface for the icing and it's

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.220 
big surface for the icing and it's
pretty<00:02:56.620> too<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.730> I'll<00:02:57.970> roll<00:02:58.569> these<00:02:58.750> out<00:02:58.989> and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
pretty too so I'll roll these out and

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410
