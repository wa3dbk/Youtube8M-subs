00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and there's a how-to video on how to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.920 
and there's a how-to video on how to
make<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.510> drawn<00:00:18.960> animation<00:00:20.570> okay<00:00:21.570> that's

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
make a drawn animation okay that's

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.170 
make a drawn animation okay that's
better<00:00:22.140> yeah

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
better yeah

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.300 
better yeah
anyway<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.900> more<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.500> how<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.830> made

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
anyway it's it's more about how I made

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.910 
anyway it's it's more about how I made
my<00:00:26.580> animation<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.750> guess<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.619> use<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
my animation but I guess you can use the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.950 
my animation but I guess you can use the
same<00:00:29.130> techniques<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> haven't<00:00:30.570> seen

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
same techniques and if you haven't seen

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.860 
same techniques and if you haven't seen
it<00:00:31.019> I'll<00:00:31.619> put<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.279> annotation<00:00:32.520> somewhere<00:00:33.510> it's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it I'll put an annotation somewhere it's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.160 
it I'll put an annotation somewhere it's
an<00:00:33.930> ice<00:00:34.079> cream<00:00:34.110> monster<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:36.559> right<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:38.070> me<00:00:38.399> I

an ice cream monster and right with me I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.610 
an ice cream monster and right with me I
have<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.840> ice<00:00:43.050> cream<00:00:43.079> monster

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
have it I have the ice cream monster

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.180 
have it I have the ice cream monster
animation<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.760> envelope<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
animation in this envelope all the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
animation in this envelope all the
drawings<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.399> took<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> thick

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
drawings it took it's like they a thick

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.950 
drawings it took it's like they a thick
stack<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.129> only<00:00:50.280> 13<00:00:50.879> seconds<00:00:51.390> long<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.870> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
stack it's only 13 seconds long can you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.720 
stack it's only 13 seconds long can you
believe<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.940> okay<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> guess<00:00:55.670> I'll<00:00:56.670> show

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
believe it okay but I guess I'll show

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.380 
believe it okay but I guess I'll show

this micron pigma oh one it's a very

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.249 
this micron pigma oh one it's a very
fine<00:01:56.250> point<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.880> another<00:01:57.149> one<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.079> bit

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
fine point I have another one it's a bit

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
fine point I have another one it's a bit
thicker<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.759> finer<00:02:00.000> point

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
thicker but I like the finer point

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.870 
thicker but I like the finer point
better

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
better

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.919 
better
I<00:02:02.470> didn't<00:02:03.470> use<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.650> rule<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.909> that<00:02:07.939> those<00:02:08.569> these

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
I didn't use a rule and that those these

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.030 
I didn't use a rule and that those these
are<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.110> things<00:02:09.380> I<00:02:09.560> did<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.880> technique<00:02:11.390> I

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
are the things I did and the technique I

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.330 
are the things I did and the technique I
did<00:02:13.040> full<00:02:13.340> animation<00:02:13.880> meaning<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.530> true

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
did full animation meaning that I true

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.470 
did full animation meaning that I true
every<00:02:17.030> frame<00:02:18.160> but<00:02:19.160> there's<00:02:19.489> two<00:02:19.819> ways<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.090> do

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
every frame but there's two ways to do

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.949 
every frame but there's two ways to do
formation<00:02:21.290> full<00:02:21.890> animation<00:02:22.780> straight<00:02:23.780> ahead

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
formation full animation straight ahead

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.449 
formation full animation straight ahead
and<00:02:24.440> post<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.190> pose<00:02:26.980> Disney<00:02:27.980> did<00:02:28.250> full

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
and post a pose Disney did full

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.410 
and post a pose Disney did full
animation<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:31.239> except<00:02:32.239> they<00:02:32.390> make

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
animation and and except they make

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180 
animation and and except they make
everything<00:02:32.930> all<00:02:33.260> happy<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.739> bouncing<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
everything all happy and bouncing you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.890 
everything all happy and bouncing you
know<00:02:34.310> but<00:02:34.970> uh<00:02:36.790> straight-ahead<00:02:37.790> animation<00:02:38.209> is

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
know but uh straight-ahead animation is

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.470 
know but uh straight-ahead animation is
when<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.319> just<00:02:39.560> draw<00:02:39.830> one<00:02:40.250> one<00:02:40.670> sheet<00:02:41.150> at<00:02:41.420> a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
when you just draw one one sheet at a

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.320 
when you just draw one one sheet at a
time<00:02:44.560> pose-to-pose<00:02:45.560> animation<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.970> was<00:02:47.120> when

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
time pose-to-pose animation it was when

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.809 
time pose-to-pose animation it was when
you<00:02:47.480> draw<00:02:47.690> all<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.140> keyframes<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:49.040> fill<00:02:49.670> in

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
you draw all the keyframes and fill in

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.520 
you draw all the keyframes and fill in
the<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.540> betweens<00:02:50.959> later<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:54.410> is

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the in but in betweens later and this is

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.380 
the in but in betweens later and this is
what<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.830> cute<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.459> our<00:02:55.610> keyframes<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
what the cute what our keyframes the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.080 
what the cute what our keyframes the
keyframes<00:02:56.870> are<00:02:57.110> basically<00:02:57.760> extreme<00:02:58.760> or

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
keyframes are basically extreme or

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.289 
keyframes are basically extreme or
important<00:02:59.900> poses<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:01.370> know<00:03:01.489> it'll<00:03:01.760> be<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.970> big

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
important poses you know it'll be a big

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.740 
important poses you know it'll be a big
gap<00:03:02.569> like<00:03:03.200> from<00:03:03.440> point<00:03:03.709> A<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:03.920> point<00:03:04.190> B<00:03:04.630> let<00:03:05.630> me

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
gap like from point A to point B let me

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.110 
gap like from point A to point B let me
show<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:05.959> an<00:03:06.140> exactly<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.700> see<00:03:07.940> me

show you an exactly like you you see me

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.509 
show you an exactly like you you see me
in<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.329> mirror<00:03:08.570> okay<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.320> I'm<00:03:10.190> just

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
in the mirror okay it's like I'm just

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.930 
in the mirror okay it's like I'm just
standing<00:03:10.820> okay<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.780> I'm<00:03:11.900> waving<00:03:12.140> hi<00:03:12.820> it'll<00:03:13.820> be

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
standing okay and I'm waving hi it'll be

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.530 
standing okay and I'm waving hi it'll be
like<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.500> I'll<00:03:15.650> race<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.220> then<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.239> next

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
like this and I'll race it then the next

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.800 
like this and I'll race it then the next
frame<00:03:17.780> will<00:03:17.959> be<00:03:17.989> like<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:19.180> then<00:03:20.180> next<00:03:20.450> frame

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
frame will be like this then next frame

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.140 
frame will be like this then next frame
this<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.440> next<00:03:21.739> spring<00:03:21.799> this<00:03:22.340> those<00:03:22.850> those

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
this and next spring this those those

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.539 
this and next spring this those those
would<00:03:23.450> be<00:03:23.600> four<00:03:23.900> keyframes<00:03:24.530> alright<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.430> then

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
would be four keyframes alright and then

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.270 
would be four keyframes alright and then
later<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.880> I'd<00:03:26.150> fill<00:03:26.420> in<00:03:26.570> all<00:03:26.720> them<00:03:26.959> between<00:03:27.410> so

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
later on I'd fill in all them between so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.789 
later on I'd fill in all them between so
from<00:03:28.489> point<00:03:28.730> A<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:28.940> point<00:03:29.120> B<00:03:29.480> they<00:03:30.140> may<00:03:30.320> fit<00:03:30.590> in

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
from point A to point B they may fit in

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.449 
from point A to point B they may fit in
like<00:03:31.010> five<00:03:31.400> more<00:03:31.700> frames<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:34.250> would

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
like five more frames and and it would

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.819 
like five more frames and and it would
be<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> smooth<00:03:35.060> animation<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.930> my<00:03:36.079> arm<00:03:36.320> raising

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
be a smooth animation of my arm raising

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:44.860 
be a smooth animation of my arm raising
up<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.609> know<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.720> I'll<00:03:41.930> get<00:03:42.200> these<00:03:42.380> out<00:03:43.870> right

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
up you know so I'll get these out right

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
it's actually very hard to stuff

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.170 
it's actually very hard to stuff
position<00:03:56.030> hope<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.900> could<00:03:56.960> get<00:03:57.320> them<00:03:57.410> back<00:03:57.620> in

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
I mess up I'd either have to use wideout

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.340 
I mess up I'd either have to use wideout
redraw<00:04:58.910> it<00:05:00.970> but<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.180> didn't<00:05:02.480> I<00:05:02.570> didn't<00:05:02.930> have<00:05:03.110> any

like one frame now I haven't had to read

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.170 
like one frame now I haven't had to read
through<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.840> even<00:05:14.990> then<00:05:15.410> they're<00:05:16.220> like<00:05:16.430> was
