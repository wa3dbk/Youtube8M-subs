00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.660
 Carlo together we are back on the times you stood in the forum 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:14.429
 this way our theme Digital Pianos and although from 3 quite typical new models 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.340
 next to her is Joachim Wolf 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.859
 Joachim Wolf has been one of ours for years 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.419
 most popular acre b so advised rb i must declare electronics keyboards and the 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.919
 Animals Pianos presenters and demonstrators is all of its our kind 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.269
 yes right so far not good more and more pensioners and ships 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.210
 how are you today I'm fine okay okay 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.280
 we'll tell Ariva a little bit what to tell Arius 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.560
 percent 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.360
 Series of Digital Pianos 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.860
 what does Arius mean? 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.770
 The term or Loose derives from Latin and constancy 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.670
 translate freely 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.899
 Air or airway which speaks for this series because it is very light and airy 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.660
 for the ideal beginner instrument is 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.510
 that makes sense okay well right here in front of us the job is often online so that 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.890
 the St 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.250
 how should I say 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.100
 Topper lend how to translate them as German AP from maturity light 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 Year evaluated 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 okay exactly 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.740
 that was the record 8 1 right here in front of us 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.719
 in Rosenholz all the wrath and Marius tell us 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 So everything is Noel 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.740
 just to allow every man to play the piano so that he is the subject 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.910
 Lehmann wants to play the piano, but I can do the big grand piano right away 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.090
 So you need an instrument that already has all the features 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.580
 but what we can do is very cheap 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.250
 Cheap price I see the price tag in the hotel that is just under 1400 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.010
 Euro 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.990
 what do you get for that because you get the right package at the very end 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.320
 important features of flu viruses namely name triple dynamic 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.100
 Klaus Templin on the instrument 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.030
 Wernberg the model even the dampers of the surrounding area so this sound if 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.190
 the damper is moved on the wing with tears we got the super keyboard the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.550
 is called Hemer at Yamaha with the right piano playing feeling 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.669
 also with Denis Mentschow can experience so this is this game and percent 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.119
 Stop feeling like a real real piano of the main culprits 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:21.079
 Hachmeister are in the bass range but with much heavier weighting though 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:21.740
 distance 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.659
 These give the wing massaged in real time 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.059
 understand today 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.719
 the army is the top model 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.819
 to direct left around the corner there are two more so now the UNDP 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.190
 8 1 8 1 on the other hand if we have that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.190
 Paddy Pier 1 6 1 and 1 4 1-win over it 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.430
 the HSV us so the 1 6 1 rings around us the 1 4 1 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.719
 what else can you say about that? 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.879
 Now you can look so Werners Orban said that it is worth from the 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.479
 Row around for example already usb-connecting pair this dynamics 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:01.459
 Shock show with deer 14 days colors fitness even cheaper 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.089
 Purses equal more than thirty characteristics have it in the country theologian 61 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.729
 which at least comes along with ten sounds, there are also in two 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:14.089
 By the way, colors in light tilts in which empirical around rose wood 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.089
 See one of the stainless steel oh so the Alexa scenes like Geely 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.919
 in the entry-level model the 1 4 1 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.510
 and Rosewood we see here on the right side at the 1 6 1 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.759
 the euro is said to be flat enough from 900 euros 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.519
 there is a cherry model that is 1 4 is about 850 euros 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.459
 is there anything else interesting about these 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.569
 Joking to be Digital Pianos, Jacobsen just made me easy 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.160
 fascinated because you do not just play piano Marko and percent 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.580
 that wants to make it very classic so that children and adolescents think 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.150
 then percent I always think so what else can they do that can 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.180
 Producers can absorb even in several tracks 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.159
 which can be software download outside German download shop and for example 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.369
 Years of DAXÂ® play 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:06.149
 For example, you can select a user from the Marburg instances 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:10.229
 oriented to pop with Met your Mother and so on to Michel Jackson too 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.849
 So everything is possible 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.179
 what gives the creativity and that is fun and giving 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.949
 In the usual way of the Marcona, the real good price is Joachim 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.839
 Many thanks first for your time thank you very much whether it was soon
