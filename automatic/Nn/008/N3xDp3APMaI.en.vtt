to create the pirates double I took a
stipple<00:00:52.340> sponge<00:00:52.370> which<00:00:53.150> is<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.330> very<00:00:53.570> coarse

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
stipple sponge which is a very coarse

sponge with lots of little holes in it

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.580 
sponge with lots of little holes in it
and<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.510> need<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.780> make<00:00:56.930> sure<00:00:56.990> that<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.380> pain

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
and you need to make sure that the pain

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.320 
and you need to make sure that the pain
isn't<00:00:57.980> too<00:00:58.130> wet<00:00:58.400> when<00:00:58.610> using<00:00:58.850> one<00:00:59.060> of<00:00:59.180> these

isn't too wet when using one of these

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.090

because<00:00:59.540> otherwise<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.260> stubble<00:01:00.500> will<00:01:00.800> drip

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
because otherwise the stubble will drip

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.760 
because otherwise the stubble will drip
down<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.490> face<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.720> you<00:01:02.780> load<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.170> up<00:01:03.290> nice<00:01:03.560> and

down the face so you load it up nice and
dry<00:01:03.950> and<00:01:03.980> then<00:01:04.370> just<00:01:04.610> gently<00:01:04.879> press<00:01:05.150> it<00:01:05.210> on<00:01:05.449> the

for<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.480> bandana<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:14.050> took<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.260> bright<00:01:14.560> red

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
for the bandana I took a bright red

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.160 
for the bandana I took a bright red
paint<00:01:15.010> on<00:01:15.160> a<00:01:15.220> flat<00:01:15.550> brush<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.060> just<00:01:16.660> painted<00:01:17.020> a

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
paint on a flat brush and just painted a

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.650 
paint on a flat brush and just painted a
line<00:01:17.410> straight<00:01:17.890> across<00:01:17.920> my<00:01:18.340> forehead<00:01:18.400> I<00:01:18.940> did

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
line straight across my forehead I did

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.330 
line straight across my forehead I did
make<00:01:19.810> sure<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.290> line<00:01:20.470> was<00:01:20.710> at<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> slight

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
make sure that the line was at a slight

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.490 
make sure that the line was at a slight
angle<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:22.210> goes<00:01:22.390> up<00:01:22.630> at<00:01:22.780> one<00:01:22.930> side<00:01:23.230> and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
angle so it goes up at one side and

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.830 
angle so it goes up at one side and
lower<00:01:23.890> at<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.160> other<00:01:24.400> and<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.330> lower<00:01:25.510> side

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
lower at the other and on the lower side

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.710 
lower at the other and on the lower side
I<00:01:26.140> painted<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.710> not<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:28.060> by<00:01:28.180> drawing<00:01:28.540> a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
I painted and not just by drawing a

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.450 
I painted and not just by drawing a
circle<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.500> then<00:01:29.650> straight<00:01:29.980> off<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.280> this

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
circle and then straight off of this

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
circle and then straight off of this
added<00:01:30.880> two<00:01:31.090> tails

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.450 

I<00:01:38.540> then<00:01:39.320> took<00:01:39.500> some<00:01:39.560> more<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.100> red<00:01:40.250> paint

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
I then took some more of the red paint

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.040 
I then took some more of the red paint
on<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.670> sponge<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.330> just<00:01:41.540> filled<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.960> the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
on a sponge and I just filled in the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.230 
on a sponge and I just filled in the
whole<00:01:42.230> area<00:01:42.500> above<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.070> line<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:44.000> want<00:01:44.120> to

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
whole area above the line you want to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.280 

to<00:02:00.550> add<00:02:00.700> some<00:02:00.880> dimension<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.540> took<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.750> dark<00:02:02.050> red

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
to add some dimension I took a dark red

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.900 
to add some dimension I took a dark red
color<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:02.980> blended<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.490> into<00:02:03.820> the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
color and just blended this into the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.510 
color and just blended this into the
outside<00:02:04.240> corners<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:04.960> bandana<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:06.370> want

outside corners of the bandana you want
to<00:02:06.580> blend<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:06.940> into<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.330> red<00:02:07.480> as<00:02:07.600> much<00:02:07.750> as<00:02:07.900> you

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
to blend it into the red as much as you

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.450 
to blend it into the red as much as you
can<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.410> then<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.650> also<00:02:08.830> took<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.190> little<00:02:09.310> bit

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
can and then I also took a little bit

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:17.910 
can and then I also took a little bit
over<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.790> knot<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.150> well

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.890 

you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.199 

I<00:02:20.959> wanted<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.040> make<00:02:22.189> sure<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.549> bandana<00:02:22.970> looked

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
I wanted to make sure the bandana looked

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.720 
I wanted to make sure the bandana looked
like<00:02:23.420> fabric<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.409> to<00:02:24.470> add<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.769> bit<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.069> texture<00:02:25.640> I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
like fabric so to add a bit of texture I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.089 
like fabric so to add a bit of texture I
took<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:26.150> stencil<00:02:26.569> with<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> swirly<00:02:27.500> pattern<00:02:27.680> and

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
took a stencil with a swirly pattern and

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.640 
took a stencil with a swirly pattern and
just<00:02:28.299> stenciled<00:02:29.299> a<00:02:29.420> darker<00:02:29.870> red<00:02:30.019> over<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
just stenciled a darker red over the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.589 
just stenciled a darker red over the
whole<00:02:30.860> area<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:34.519> do<00:02:34.730> need<00:02:34.939> to<00:02:35.030> make<00:02:35.090> sure<00:02:35.239> that

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
whole area you do need to make sure that

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.869 
whole area you do need to make sure that
the<00:02:35.720> red<00:02:35.870> underneath<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.799> pretty<00:02:37.430> much<00:02:37.609> dry

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
the red underneath it is pretty much dry

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.550 
the red underneath it is pretty much dry
otherwise<00:02:38.269> when<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.540> lift<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.930> stencil<00:02:39.200> off

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
otherwise when you lift the stencil off

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.960 
otherwise when you lift the stencil off
it<00:02:39.799> will<00:02:39.980> peel<00:02:40.220> off<00:02:40.340> some<00:02:40.549> of<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> brighter

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
it will peel off some of the brighter

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
it will peel off some of the brighter
red<00:02:41.299> as<00:02:41.420> well

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.890 

the<00:02:51.400> next<00:02:51.670> job<00:02:51.850> was<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.060> create<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.540> Pirates

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the next job was to create the Pirates

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.750 
the next job was to create the Pirates
facial<00:02:53.290> hair<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.830> wanted<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.490> look<00:02:54.580> as

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
facial hair and I wanted this to look as

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.450 
facial hair and I wanted this to look as
realistic<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.420> possible<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.860> what<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.130> did<00:02:57.220> was

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
realistic as possible so what I did was

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.670 
realistic as possible so what I did was
take<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.700> very<00:02:57.940> little<00:02:58.180> brush<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.750> some<00:02:59.170> brown

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.670 
take a very little brush and some brown
paint<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:01.060> painted<00:03:01.570> wispy<00:03:02.080> lines<00:03:02.260> all

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
paint and I just painted wispy lines all

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.230 
paint and I just painted wispy lines all
over<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:03.010> areas<00:03:03.340> where<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.580> wanted<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
over the areas where I wanted the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.750 
over the areas where I wanted the
moustache<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.930> be<00:03:05.110> now<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.130> key<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.370> getting

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
moustache to be now the key to getting

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.940 
moustache to be now the key to getting
it<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.150> look<00:03:07.300> as<00:03:07.450> well<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.020> can<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.830> do

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
it to look as well as you can is to do

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.460 
it to look as well as you can is to do
it<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:09.190> layers<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.510> did<00:03:10.690> one<00:03:10.930> layer<00:03:11.140> then<00:03:11.440> I

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
it in layers so I did one layer then I

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.410 
it in layers so I did one layer then I
went<00:03:11.680> back<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.130> with<00:03:12.340> another<00:03:12.790> layer<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.240> hair

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
went back in with another layer of hair

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.940 
went back in with another layer of hair
I<00:03:13.450> think<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.870> did<00:03:13.990> about<00:03:14.170> three<00:03:14.470> layers<00:03:14.650> with

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
I think I did about three layers with

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.040 
I think I did about three layers with
the<00:03:15.040> brown<00:03:15.250> in<00:03:15.520> total

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.170 

I<00:03:19.110> use<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> same<00:03:20.310> technique<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.760> paint<00:03:21.060> his

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
I use the same technique to paint his

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.730 
I use the same technique to paint his
beard<00:03:21.450> as<00:03:21.600> well<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.440> need<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.590> little

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
beard as well so you need a little

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.760 
beard as well so you need a little
triangle<00:03:23.220> underneath<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.060> lips<00:03:24.270> and<00:03:24.600> then<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
triangle underneath the lips and then a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.620 
triangle underneath the lips and then a
small<00:03:26.190> wispy<00:03:26.580> line<00:03:26.760> right<00:03:27.150> along<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.630> jaw

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
small wispy line right along the jaw

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.690 
small wispy line right along the jaw
because<00:03:30.500> my<00:03:30.620> eyebrows<00:03:30.980> are<00:03:31.160> really<00:03:31.250> thin<00:03:31.520> I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
because my eyebrows are really thin I

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.100 
because my eyebrows are really thin I
also<00:03:31.880> needed<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.510> fill<00:03:32.690> them<00:03:32.840> out<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:32.960> little

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
also needed to fill them out a little

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.930 
also needed to fill them out a little
bit<00:03:33.230> more<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:33.590> make<00:03:33.710> them<00:03:33.890> more<00:03:34.010> manly<00:03:34.460> so<00:03:34.910> I

a<00:03:51.220> bit<00:03:51.430> more<00:03:51.640> tone<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.209> also<00:03:52.450> try<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.659> match

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
a bit more tone and also try and match

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.110 
a bit more tone and also try and match
it<00:03:52.870> into<00:03:53.230> my<00:03:53.349> natural<00:03:53.560> hair<00:03:53.920> color<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> went

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
it into my natural hair color so I went

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.539 
it into my natural hair color so I went
over<00:03:55.239> everything<00:03:55.650> with<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> black<00:03:57.069> paint<00:03:57.370> as

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
over everything with a black paint as

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.339 
over everything with a black paint as
well<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:57.909> very<00:03:58.209> lightly<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:59.080> almost

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
well but very lightly so it almost

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:07.470 
well but very lightly so it almost
doesn't<00:03:59.650> show

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.249 

I<00:05:17.909> painted<00:05:18.909> a<00:05:19.000> very<00:05:19.120> thin<00:05:19.479> black<00:05:19.720> line<00:05:19.930> in<00:05:20.169> a

tiny brush wrote on the underside of the
bandana<00:05:22.449> and<00:05:22.750> I<00:05:23.080> also<00:05:23.259> outlined<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.069> knot<00:05:24.280> and

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
bandana and I also outlined the knot and

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:33.200 
bandana and I also outlined the knot and
added<00:05:24.669> a<00:05:24.729> bit<00:05:24.849> more<00:05:24.909> detail<00:05:25.479> there

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.420 

you

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.460 

while<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> paint's<00:05:36.570> still<00:05:36.600> wet<00:05:36.960> I<00:05:37.050> took<00:05:37.260> the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
while the paint's still wet I took the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.350 
while the paint's still wet I took the
same<00:05:37.680> dry<00:05:37.860> brushes<00:05:38.250> before<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:38.790> just<00:05:38.970> blended

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
same dry brushes before and just blended

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.730 
same dry brushes before and just blended
some<00:05:39.510> of<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.660> lines<00:05:39.870> out<00:05:40.140> to<00:05:40.170> make<00:05:40.470> it<00:05:40.620> look

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
some of the lines out to make it look

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.020 
some of the lines out to make it look
like<00:05:40.860> shadows

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.090 

using<00:05:46.030> black<00:05:46.150> I<00:05:46.420> also<00:05:46.660> added<00:05:47.050> some<00:05:47.260> fold<00:05:47.800> lines

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
using black I also added some fold lines

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.950 
using black I also added some fold lines
in<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.640> bandana<00:05:49.090> as<00:05:49.270> well<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.600> make<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.780> look

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
in the bandana as well to make it look

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.080 
in the bandana as well to make it look
more<00:05:50.080> realistic<00:05:50.470> now<00:05:51.220> once<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.640> painted<00:05:51.970> these

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
more realistic now once I painted these

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.130 
more realistic now once I painted these
are<00:05:52.240> I<00:05:52.270> thought<00:05:52.510> they<00:05:52.630> looks<00:05:52.810> a<00:05:52.870> little<00:05:52.930> bit

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
are I thought they looks a little bit

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.770 
are I thought they looks a little bit
too<00:05:53.290> dark<00:05:53.530> so<00:05:53.860> I<00:05:53.890> took<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.400> red<00:05:54.610> sponge<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.330> I

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
too dark so I took the red sponge and I

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.750 
too dark so I took the red sponge and I
just<00:05:56.140> dabbed<00:05:56.440> over<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.890> top<00:05:57.040> of<00:05:57.190> them<00:05:57.370> to<00:05:57.400> mute

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
just dabbed over the top of them to mute

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.820 
just dabbed over the top of them to mute
them<00:05:57.880> down<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.090> bit

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.250 

you

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.380 

next<00:06:08.980> I<00:06:09.040> painted<00:06:09.280> a<00:06:09.400> tiny<00:06:09.610> little<00:06:09.790> face<00:06:10.030> on<00:06:10.270> the

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
next I painted a tiny little face on the

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.180 
next I painted a tiny little face on the
skull<00:06:10.660> now<00:06:10.690> that<00:06:11.050> the<00:06:11.140> white<00:06:11.290> paints<00:06:11.650> dry<00:06:11.800> and

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
skull now that the white paints dry and

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.740 
skull now that the white paints dry and
I<00:06:12.550> also<00:06:12.730> went<00:06:13.060> in<00:06:13.150> and<00:06:13.300> added<00:06:13.510> a<00:06:13.600> bit<00:06:13.690> of

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
I also went in and added a bit of

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.630 
I also went in and added a bit of
shading<00:06:14.200> around<00:06:14.320> him<00:06:14.650> to<00:06:14.830> make<00:06:14.980> him<00:06:15.130> stand<00:06:15.430> out

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
shading around him to make him stand out

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:23.310 
shading around him to make him stand out
a<00:06:15.670> bit<00:06:15.910> more

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:32.239 

you

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:32.249 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:34.249 

I<00:06:32.309> really<00:06:33.059> wanted<00:06:33.269> the<00:06:33.389> black<00:06:33.599> that<00:06:33.869> outlined

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
I really wanted the black that outlined

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.229 
I really wanted the black that outlined
the<00:06:34.379> bandana<00:06:34.769> to<00:06:35.039> look<00:06:35.189> more<00:06:35.459> like<00:06:35.879> a<00:06:35.909> shadow

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:36.239 
the bandana to look more like a shadow

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:38.929 
the bandana to look more like a shadow
so<00:06:36.689> I<00:06:36.899> took<00:06:37.199> a<00:06:37.349> brush<00:06:37.649> with<00:06:37.949> just<00:06:38.249> water<00:06:38.489> on<00:06:38.669> it

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 
so I took a brush with just water on it

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:48.300 
so I took a brush with just water on it
and<00:06:39.029> gently<00:06:39.689> smudged<00:06:40.229> it<00:06:40.439> in<00:06:40.589> a<00:06:40.679> bit

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.870 

you

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.000 

and<00:06:51.970> then<00:06:52.600> the<00:06:52.720> very<00:06:52.960> last<00:06:53.050> thing<00:06:53.440> I<00:06:53.530> did<00:06:53.590> as<00:06:53.980> a

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
and then the very last thing I did as a

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.220 
and then the very last thing I did as a
final<00:06:54.460> touch<00:06:54.640> was<00:06:55.210> to<00:06:55.510> add<00:06:55.690> a<00:06:55.720> little<00:06:56.020> bit<00:06:56.200> of

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
final touch was to add a little bit of

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.960 
final touch was to add a little bit of
black<00:06:56.470> eyeliner<00:06:56.710> right<00:06:57.190> along<00:06:57.610> the<00:06:57.700> waterline

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
black eyeliner right along the waterline

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.390 
black eyeliner right along the waterline
and<00:07:00.970> then<00:07:01.090> we<00:07:01.210> have<00:07:01.420> our<00:07:01.690> Jack<00:07:02.050> Sparrow

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
and then we have our Jack Sparrow
