00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.009
 Y 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.250
 Y 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.870
 well we are in it we are in the position 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.700
 central control company 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.040
 Municipal Transport of Madrid from 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.170
 here we manage in real time all 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.479
 the buses that we have in 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.490
 this time more than 2,000 buses per 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.440
 the city of madrid and we have 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.119
 monitored at all times in their 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.060
 location we can talk to them 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.040
 we communicate and so on we face the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.710
 project sees on-board video surveillance 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.080
 in the bus that as I was saying is a cctv 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.970
 mobile that allows us at all times 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.340
 see what is happening in the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.560
 buses both in real time and in 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.740
 deferred this is very important because 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.410
 every day we transport more than one 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.410
 million and a half passengers with which 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.450
 to equip this infrastructure to the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.009
 buses of a system 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.740
 video surveillance and security 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.750
 based on obtaining images then 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.119
 the system is tremendously important 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.979
 has two fundamental parts one is the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.170
 alarm reception center where 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.700
 receives all the images and another is the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.350
 equipment framed in each of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.440
 buses at the equipment level 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.760
 embarked which is perhaps the most innovative 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.340
 the most important thing of the system 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.040
 in each vehicle between four or five 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.730
 cameras covering all the angles of 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.530
 vehicle interior , and we 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.209
 a central processing unit that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.849
 manages the recording of all these 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.470
 images that is permanently 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.739
 recording everything that happens all that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.120
 visualize those cameras on the bus 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.590
 one of the most characteristic 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.629
 important of the system is that the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.659
 streaming video that is sent from the 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.489
 The bus is adjusted according to the 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.310
 communication system capacity 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.409
 that we have in this moment also 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.530
 it's because the system is based 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.150
 in a pure ip technology thanks to the 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.930
 network that we have framed in the bus 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.329
 a lan network that directly cameras 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.470
 they connect are ip they connect 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.810
 directly to this network of 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.250
 communications already in ip with which is 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.580
 everything we say in the digital world 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.170
 the camera is also able to send two 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.460
 Streaming video simultaneously 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.040
 It is even able to send more us 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.940
 we are using the streamings one for 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.950
 the case of real-time broadcasting with what 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.770
 which is a much more efficient codec in 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.840
 meaning occupies little space and in the 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.209
 If there is an emergency , a 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.580
 streaming much more quality than 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.980
 later when the bus arrives at 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.560
 the garage download already had wifi and a 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.050
 of the project keys one of those from 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.640
 The main challenges of the project is 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.270
 that the entire video surveillance system 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.640
 embarked is embarked on a bus 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.770
 all the technology that from the emt 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.750
 we mark the buses meets 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.180
 certain determined regulations 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.080
 anti-vibration standards also 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.910
 Extended temperature ranges in 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.200
 operation in this case we talk about 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.500
 ranges that go from minus 20 degrees 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.709
 up to 60 degrees even in certain 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.320
 equipment and it was important that also 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.660
 the cameras as a key point of the system 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.690
 of video surveillance will support this type 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.340
 of 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.970
 normative but they are also cameras 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.930
 rugerized with a protection index 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.490
 67 in this case that the company 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.060
 manufacturer of the axis cameras in this 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.650
 case he wanted to participate in the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.320
 project with us and design even 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.960
 a camera with very good characteristics 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.150
 specific to this terrain of 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.230
 transport of onboard equipment and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.390
 the truth that the experience has been a 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.670
 success the project went well it came out in 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.920
 term and we are very happy with the 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.630
 system has been one of the most 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.730
 the emblematic and strategic 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.100
 municipal transport company from 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.850
 its origin in 2009 because it has 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.560
 also received a lot of visits from 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.600
 interest of other cities and others 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.880
 transportation companies because it has been 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.340
 one of the pioneer projects at the 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.190
 of a video surveillance system 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.880
 framed in buses on this scale 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.880
 of which we are talking about
