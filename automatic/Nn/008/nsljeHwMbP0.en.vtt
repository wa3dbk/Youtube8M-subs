having big problems with armadillos

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.870 
having big problems with armadillos
armadillos<00:00:21.439> are<00:00:21.560> mostly<00:00:21.859> nocturnal<00:00:22.070> and<00:00:22.699> they

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
armadillos are mostly nocturnal and they

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.029 
armadillos are mostly nocturnal and they
come<00:00:23.119> in<00:00:23.329> and<00:00:23.539> they<00:00:24.140> root<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:24.710> they're

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039

digging<00:00:25.340> up<00:00:25.550> grubs<00:00:26.149> and<00:00:26.329> worms<00:00:26.419> and<00:00:26.989> you<00:00:27.259> can

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
digging up grubs and worms and you can

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.810 
digging up grubs and worms and you can
see<00:00:27.619> it's<00:00:27.770> on<00:00:27.890> slightly<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:28.579> they're<00:00:28.669> also

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.069 
starting to dig up bushes in this area
to<00:00:31.730> combat<00:00:32.090> this<00:00:32.329> we're<00:00:32.570> gonna<00:00:32.629> put<00:00:32.750> out<00:00:33.050> some

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
to combat this we're gonna put out some

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.250 
to combat this we're gonna put out some
traps<00:00:33.879> we<00:00:34.879> have<00:00:35.000> two<00:00:35.180> different<00:00:35.329> sizes<00:00:35.720> here

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
traps we have two different sizes here

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.430 
traps we have two different sizes here
really<00:00:37.220> the<00:00:37.339> big<00:00:37.670> ones<00:00:37.909> are<00:00:38.089> best<00:00:38.329> but<00:00:39.050> we're

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
really the big ones are best but we're

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.430 
really the big ones are best but we're
gonna<00:00:39.530> use<00:00:39.800> what<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:40.129> have<00:00:40.339> and<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.839> get<00:00:42.290> the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
gonna use what we have and to get the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.990 
gonna use what we have and to get the
armadillos<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:42.980> go<00:00:43.129> into<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:43.400> trap<00:00:43.730> we're

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
armadillos to go into this trap we're

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.930 
armadillos to go into this trap we're
going<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.180> use<00:00:44.420> funnels<00:00:45.670> normally<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.790> would

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
going to use funnels normally we would

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.090 
going to use funnels normally we would
use<00:00:46.970> two<00:00:47.360> by<00:00:47.540> four<00:00:47.809> boards<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:48.620> what<00:00:48.829> we<00:00:48.949> have

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
use two by four boards but what we have

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.950 
use two by four boards but what we have
available<00:00:49.339> today<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:50.059> fire<00:00:50.479> wood<00:00:50.780> and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
available today is fire wood and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.719 
available today is fire wood and
cinderblocks<00:00:51.439> so<00:00:52.220> that's<00:00:52.369> what<00:00:52.549> we're<00:00:52.640> going

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
cinderblocks so that's what we're going

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:54.100 
cinderblocks so that's what we're going
to<00:00:52.790> use<00:00:52.879> we're<00:00:53.330> going<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.479> put<00:00:53.689> out<00:00:53.780> several

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
to use we're going to put out several

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.030 
to use we're going to put out several
traps<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.400> I'll<00:00:55.519> show<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:55.699> how<00:00:55.909> we<00:00:56.000> do<00:00:56.119> that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
traps and I'll show you how we do that

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.079 
traps and I'll show you how we do that
we're<00:00:58.040> at<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.159> spot<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.610> garden<00:00:58.909> that<00:00:58.970> has

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
we're at a spot in the garden that has

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.030 
we're at a spot in the garden that has
fresh<00:00:59.479> sign<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.589> other<00:01:00.619> good<00:01:00.890> thing

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
fresh sign and the other good thing

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.619 
fresh sign and the other good thing
about<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:01.400> spot<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:01.879> we<00:01:02.059> already<00:01:02.420> have<00:01:02.600> a

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
about this spot is we already have a

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.590 
about this spot is we already have a
wall<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.229> we're<00:01:03.350> going<00:01:03.439> to<00:01:03.530> use<00:01:03.710> this<00:01:03.979> wall<00:01:04.250> as

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
wall so we're going to use this wall as

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.510 
wall so we're going to use this wall as
one<00:01:05.600> side<00:01:05.869> of<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.080> funnel<00:01:06.439> to<00:01:06.860> save<00:01:07.070> time<00:01:07.340> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
one side of the funnel to save time and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.039 
one side of the funnel to save time and
materials<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:08.299> we'll<00:01:08.420> go<00:01:08.509> ahead<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.720> get<00:01:08.930> this

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
materials so we'll go ahead and get this

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:42.459 
materials so we'll go ahead and get this
set<00:01:09.290> up

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.440 

so<00:01:43.469> we<00:01:43.590> had<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> funnel<00:01:44.159> set<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.880> idea<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
so we had the funnel set up the idea is

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
so we had the funnel set up the idea is
that<00:01:45.719> when<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> armadillos<00:01:46.590> walk<00:01:46.799> into<00:01:47.069> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that when the armadillos walk into this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.279 
that when the armadillos walk into this
area<00:01:47.549> they'll<00:01:48.179> bump<00:01:48.360> into<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.810> wall<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
area they'll bump into this wall and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.690 
area they'll bump into this wall and
this<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.649> lead<00:01:49.770> them<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:49.950> into<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.459> trap

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
this will lead them right into the trap

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.550 
this will lead them right into the trap
the<00:01:51.299> last<00:01:51.509> thing<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:51.989> do<00:01:52.140> before

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the last thing we have to do before

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
the last thing we have to do before
tonight<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.640> set<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.119> trap<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.750> we'll<00:01:55.020> come

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
tonight is set this trap and we'll come

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.449 
tonight is set this trap and we'll come
back<00:01:55.349> in<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> morning<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:56.069> see<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.429> have

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
back in the morning and see if we have

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:03.289 
back in the morning and see if we have
any<00:01:56.700> luck<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.069> you<00:02:02.220> can<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.970> did<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
any luck so as you can see we did have a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.089 
any luck so as you can see we did have a
successful<00:02:03.689> trapping<00:02:04.289> actually<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.009> of

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
successful trapping actually in one of

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.740 
successful trapping actually in one of
our<00:02:05.189> smaller<00:02:05.489> traps<00:02:05.880> we're<00:02:06.239> gonna<00:02:06.329> take<00:02:06.569> this

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
our smaller traps we're gonna take this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.089 
our smaller traps we're gonna take this
armadillo<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> safe<00:02:07.709> place<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.069> be

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
armadillo to a safe place to be

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.430 
armadillo to a safe place to be
euthanized<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.819> we're<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> come<00:02:09.299> back

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
euthanized then we're going to come back

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.020 
euthanized then we're going to come back
reset<00:02:10.440> our<00:02:10.560> traps<00:02:10.829> and<00:02:11.190> possibly<00:02:11.549> readjust

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
reset our traps and possibly readjust

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.030 
reset our traps and possibly readjust
them<00:02:12.209> based<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.079> fresh<00:02:13.319> sign<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.829> see

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
them based on the fresh sign that we see

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.510 
them based on the fresh sign that we see
thank<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:15.180> watching
