 Hello everyone, I will be today 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:11.540

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.410

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.349
 by standard 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.589
 recipe that I found on the Internet by 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:23.960
 I was prompted to a children's recipe in March 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:26.419
 my girlfriend who's here and i think that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.899

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:39.969

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.399
 cream cream and better to be after 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.800
 refrigerators chilled to us now 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.890
 you need to beat you first at first 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.890
 speeds 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:18.420
 beaten brought to thickening now to us 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:39.040
 you need to keep fruit 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 basis of the game all mix we mix fruit 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.850

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.280

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.070

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.100
 cups left after the holiday 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:05.010

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:13.080

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:13.080

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.840

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.480

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.140

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.069

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.620

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.890

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.349
