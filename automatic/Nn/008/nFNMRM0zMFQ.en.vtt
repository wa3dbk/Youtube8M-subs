00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
get right up to the scalp so that you

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.390 
get right up to the scalp so that you
can<00:01:36.910> get<00:01:37.060> see<00:01:37.240> how<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.600> lifts<00:01:38.260> that's<00:01:39.190> going

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
can get see how that lifts that's going

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.200 
can get see how that lifts that's going
to<00:01:39.460> give<00:01:39.610> her<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.760> ton<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.180> volume<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:42.210> the

to give her a ton of volume and the
other<00:01:43.450> thing<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:43.930> want<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.170> remember<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.950> go

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
other thing we want to remember is to go

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.920 
other thing we want to remember is to go
back<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.670> forth<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:46.060> we<00:01:46.150> wrap<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.600> one<00:01:46.780> this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
back and forth so we wrap this one this

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.020 
back and forth so we wrap this one this
direction<00:01:47.470> we're<00:01:48.340> going<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.550> wrap<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:49.000> other

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
direction we're going to wrap the other

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.270 
direction we're going to wrap the other
one<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:51.160> other<00:01:51.190> direction<00:01:51.760> and<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:54.130> will

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
one the other direction and that will

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.980 
one the other direction and that will
give<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.460> some<00:01:54.580> variation<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.750> way<00:01:55.870> the

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
give it some variation in the way the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.410 
give it some variation in the way the
colors<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.920> way<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.250> curls<00:01:57.580> fall<00:01:57.970> so<00:01:58.390> that

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
colors of the way the curls fall so that

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.240 
colors of the way the curls fall so that

you<00:02:18.090> want<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.480> grab<00:02:18.870> pieces<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
you want to just grab pieces and

you want to just grab pieces and
especially<00:02:20.370> when<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.940> fine<00:02:21.120> hair<00:02:21.150> you
