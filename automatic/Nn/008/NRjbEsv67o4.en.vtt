this<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.050> inches<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:58.190> that's<00:00:59.190> what

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this out for more inches so that's what

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.930 
this out for more inches so that's what
I'm<00:00:59.430> gonna<00:00:59.550> do

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I'm gonna do

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.139 
I'm gonna do
hopefully<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> won't<00:01:00.660> take<00:01:00.899> too<00:01:00.930> long<00:01:02.149> I'll

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
hopefully it won't take too long I'll

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.579 
hopefully it won't take too long I'll
use<00:01:03.390> one-inch<00:01:03.750> square<00:01:03.989> tubing<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.470> we'll

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
use one-inch square tubing and we'll

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.990 
use one-inch square tubing and we'll
stretch<00:01:04.800> it<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.399> gonna<00:01:05.520> make<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> jig

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
stretch it on out I was gonna make a jig

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
stretch it on out I was gonna make a jig
so<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.450> make<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.600> exactly<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
so I can make it exactly like it is and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
so I can make it exactly like it is and
then<00:01:08.789> after<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.479> might<00:01:09.660> start<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.050> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
then after that we might start on the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.350 
then after that we might start on the
rocket<00:01:10.590> again<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.039> need<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:11.910> nose<00:01:12.090> cone

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
rocket again I need to get the nose cone

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.560 
rocket again I need to get the nose cone
on<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:14.660> want<00:01:15.660> to<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:17.210> make<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> jack

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
on I want to get it on and make a jack

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.330 
on I want to get it on and make a jack
for<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> back<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.520> hold<00:01:20.910> it<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
for the back so I can hold it up and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.719 
for the back so I can hold it up and
maybe<00:01:23.340> dangerous<00:01:24.330> Hix<00:01:24.780> again<00:01:25.580> active<00:01:26.580> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
maybe dangerous Hix again active this

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.050 
maybe dangerous Hix again active this

ok<00:01:30.200> we're<00:01:31.200> back<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> swing<00:01:32.570> ok<00:01:33.570> well<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
ok we're back on a swing ok well the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
ok we're back on a swing ok well the
first<00:01:34.470> thing<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:34.950> did<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.340> make<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.090> small

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
first thing I did was make a small

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.770 
first thing I did was make a small
drawing<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.009> got<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.330> got<00:01:39.360> some

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
drawing of what we got here and got some

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.890 
drawing of what we got here and got some
dimensions<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.159> got<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.549> dimension<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
dimensions so I got this dimension and

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.149 
dimensions so I got this dimension and
the<00:01:43.200> outside<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.990> dimension<00:01:46.350> from<00:01:46.799> here

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the outside and this dimension from here

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.510 
the outside and this dimension from here
to<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> almost<00:01:49.590> forgot<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.400> this

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
to here and almost forgot this one this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.660 
to here and almost forgot this one this
is<00:01:50.580> coming<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.890> if<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.430> there's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
is coming up and if you can see there's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.749 
is coming up and if you can see there's
a<00:01:53.759> space<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.299> under<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.189> so<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.400> I<00:01:56.430> did<00:01:56.549> was

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
a space up under here so what I did was

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.520 
a space up under here so what I did was
put<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> spacer<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.659> under<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.020> measure<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
put a spacer up under there measure so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
put a spacer up under there measure so
this<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:58.799> an<00:01:58.920> inch<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.729> we'll<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.150> angle

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
this is an inch so we'll get this angle

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.710 
this is an inch so we'll get this angle
back<00:02:00.720> let<00:02:01.530> me<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.860> off<00:02:01.950> cut<00:02:02.549> apart<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.180> went

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
back let me get it off cut apart I went

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.450 
back let me get it off cut apart I went
ahead<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.900> put<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.079> threaded<00:02:04.500> rod<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.100> here

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
ahead and put that threaded rod on here

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.679 
ahead and put that threaded rod on here
and<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> hold<00:02:05.880> these<00:02:06.060> pieces<00:02:06.390> together

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and now to hold these pieces together

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.109 
and now to hold these pieces together
where<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.770> were<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.549> course<00:02:08.759> I'll<00:02:08.910> check

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
where they were but of course I'll check

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.440 
where they were but of course I'll check
it<00:02:09.239> for<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> welder<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.280> now<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> whole

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it for a welder back in so now the whole

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.729 
it for a welder back in so now the whole
trick<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.840> weld<00:02:13.079> it<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
trick is to weld it you know the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.949 
trick is to weld it you know the
grinding<00:02:14.040> apart<00:02:15.049> so<00:02:16.049> we'll<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> grinder

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.479 

okay<00:02:20.609> I've<00:02:21.609> got<00:02:21.849> them<00:02:21.969> ground<00:02:22.269> down<00:02:23.249> I'll<00:02:24.249> show

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
okay I've got them ground down I'll show

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.800 
okay I've got them ground down I'll show
like<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:24.909> I<00:02:24.969> can<00:02:25.090> see<00:02:25.120> I'm<00:02:25.269> doing<00:02:25.359> ground

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
like you so I can see I'm doing ground

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.280 
like you so I can see I'm doing ground
them<00:02:25.930> down<00:02:26.139> I've<00:02:26.950> ground<00:02:27.249> these<00:02:27.459> down<00:02:28.230> now<00:02:29.230> I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
them down I've ground these down now I

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.559 
them down I've ground these down now I
figured<00:02:30.099> I<00:02:30.219> needed<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.730> seven<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.359> quarter

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
figured I needed a seven and a quarter

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.770 
figured I needed a seven and a quarter
inch<00:02:31.870> piece<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:33.340> make<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.609> longer<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.150> I've<00:02:34.540> cut

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
inch piece to make it longer so I've cut

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.629 
inch piece to make it longer so I've cut
some<00:02:34.810> 1<00:02:35.109> inch<00:02:35.260> square<00:02:35.379> seven<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.129> quarter<00:02:36.310> I

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
some 1 inch square seven and a quarter I

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:42.780 
some 1 inch square seven and a quarter I
coped<00:02:37.359> them<00:02:37.569> on<00:02:38.139> the<00:02:38.709> end<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.790> city<00:02:41.730> hey<00:02:42.730> you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
coped them on the end the city hey you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.940 
coped them on the end the city hey you
know<00:02:42.909> made<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> little<00:02:43.329> bit<00:02:43.480> round<00:02:43.750> there<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.859> I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
know made a little bit round there and I

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.319 
know made a little bit round there and I
even<00:02:45.069> pinched<00:02:45.579> this<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> little<00:02:45.969> bit<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
even pinched this a little bit in the

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.949 
even pinched this a little bit in the
vise<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:47.409> this<00:02:48.069> side<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.579> then<00:02:49.060> I've<00:02:49.239> taken

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
vise on this side and then I've taken

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.069 
vise on this side and then I've taken
them<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.379> clamped<00:02:50.769> them<00:02:50.859> to<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.129> angle<00:02:51.549> iron

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
them and clamped them to this angle iron

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.390 
them and clamped them to this angle iron
to<00:02:53.079> hold<00:02:53.290> them<00:02:53.409> parallel<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.189> straight<00:02:55.090> so

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
to hold them parallel and straight so

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.179 
to hold them parallel and straight so
the<00:02:57.400> next<00:02:57.639> thing<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:57.879> was<00:02:58.030> doing<00:02:59.189> with

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
the next thing I was doing with

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.030 
the next thing I was doing with
measuring<00:03:01.109> let<00:03:02.109> see<00:03:02.260> how<00:03:02.379> straight<00:03:02.709> we<00:03:02.889> are

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
measuring let see how straight we are

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.000 
measuring let see how straight we are
right<00:03:03.250> here<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.959> getting<00:03:05.290> six<00:03:05.500> seven<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:05.949> a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
right here like getting six seven and a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.470 
right here like getting six seven and a
half<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.719> looked<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.019> little<00:03:09.329> it's<00:03:10.329> a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
half this it looked a little it's a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.289 
half this it looked a little it's a
little<00:03:10.719> off<00:03:10.870> see<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:12.459> I'm<00:03:12.730> going<00:03:12.939> to<00:03:12.969> have<00:03:13.120> to

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
little off see so I'm going to have to

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.199 
little off see so I'm going to have to
trim<00:03:13.980> trim<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.340> bit<00:03:15.430> on<00:03:15.519> this<00:03:15.699> end<00:03:15.939> here

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
trim trim a little bit on this end here

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.300 
trim trim a little bit on this end here
to<00:03:16.359> get<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:16.659> parallel<00:03:17.109> with<00:03:17.230> my<00:03:17.379> with<00:03:18.159> my

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
to get this parallel with my with my

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.959 
to get this parallel with my with my
table<00:03:18.549> there<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:21.250> that's<00:03:21.430> when<00:03:21.609> we're<00:03:21.730> up<00:03:21.849> to

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:21.969 
table there so that's when we're up to

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.770 
table there so that's when we're up to
you<00:03:22.030> right<00:03:22.150> now<00:03:22.389> okay<00:03:23.729> before<00:03:24.729> I<00:03:24.759> finish<00:03:25.120> we're

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
you right now okay before I finish we're

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.030 
you right now okay before I finish we're
finished<00:03:26.139> well<00:03:26.290> let's<00:03:26.500> see<00:03:26.620> right<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:26.799> just<00:03:26.889> got

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
finished well let's see right I just got

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.520 
finished well let's see right I just got
attacked<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.579> couple<00:03:27.699> places<00:03:28.030> here<00:03:28.419> I'm<00:03:29.259> gonna

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
attacked a couple places here I'm gonna

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.420 
attacked a couple places here I'm gonna
plumb<00:03:29.919> or<00:03:30.310> square<00:03:31.829> then<00:03:32.829> we'll<00:03:33.009> square<00:03:33.280> these

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
plumb or square then we'll square these

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.559 
plumb or square then we'll square these
tubes<00:03:33.759> up<00:03:34.000> with<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.329> with<00:03:34.989> that<00:03:35.139> axle<00:03:36.569> that

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
tubes up with that with that axle that

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.240 
tubes up with that with that axle that
looks<00:03:37.720> pretty<00:03:37.930> good<00:03:38.079> then<00:03:38.650> I'll<00:03:38.799> go<00:03:38.949> ahead<00:03:39.040> and

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
looks pretty good then I'll go ahead and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.490 
looks pretty good then I'll go ahead and
weld<00:03:39.669> this<00:03:39.939> one<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.419> then<00:03:40.989> we'll<00:03:41.109> do<00:03:41.229> the<00:03:41.319> same

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
weld this one and then we'll do the same

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.719 
weld this one and then we'll do the same
here<00:03:41.799> I'll<00:03:42.310> show<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.549> how<00:03:42.699> this<00:03:42.849> ends<00:03:43.060> off<00:03:43.239> to

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.679 

see<00:03:48.729> how<00:03:48.909> that's<00:03:49.090> off<00:03:49.299> can<00:03:49.689> y'all<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:49.989> that

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
see how that's off can y'all see that

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.509 
see how that's off can y'all see that
so<00:03:52.689> this<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:53.049> this<00:03:53.199> one's<00:03:53.439> good<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.310> we'll<00:03:54.430> go

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
so this is this one's good so we'll go

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.249 
so this is this one's good so we'll go
ahead<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.699> weld<00:03:54.909> it<00:03:55.090> why<00:03:55.269> it's<00:03:55.419> good<00:03:55.629> and<00:03:56.109> then

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
ahead and weld it why it's good and then

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.210 
ahead and weld it why it's good and then
we'll<00:03:56.379> work<00:03:56.500> on<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.769> other<00:03:56.799> one<00:03:59.009> okay<00:04:00.009> there's

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
we'll work on the other one okay there's

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.559 
we'll work on the other one okay there's
probably<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.519> better<00:04:00.609> way<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:00.879> do<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.150> and

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
probably a better way to do this and

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.509 
probably a better way to do this and
after<00:04:01.689> I<00:04:01.870> do<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.079> few<00:04:02.349> of<00:04:02.500> them<00:04:02.650> I'll<00:04:03.219> probably

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
after I do a few of them I'll probably

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.709 
after I do a few of them I'll probably
come<00:04:03.790> up<00:04:03.819> with<00:04:03.939> a<00:04:04.120> better<00:04:04.409> faster<00:04:05.409> way<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:05.799> I

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
come up with a better faster way but I

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:13.099 
come up with a better faster way but I
finally<00:04:07.719> got<00:04:07.840> worse<00:04:08.259> um<00:04:08.799> we're<00:04:09.549> straight<00:04:09.819> here

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.439 

and<00:04:14.109> we're<00:04:14.319> pretty<00:04:14.500> straight<00:04:14.799> there<00:04:15.449> that's

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
and we're pretty straight there that's

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.059 
and we're pretty straight there that's
it<00:04:16.599> real<00:04:16.810> good<00:04:16.959> right<00:04:17.139> there<00:04:17.430> and

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:22.069 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.879 

and<00:04:23.069> I'm<00:04:23.220> measuring<00:04:23.460> right<00:04:23.900> up<00:04:24.900> here<00:04:25.169> it's

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
and I'm measuring right up here it's

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.110 
and I'm measuring right up here it's
like<00:04:26.569> 7<00:04:27.569> 1/2<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:27.990> very<00:04:28.199> top<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.650> rod

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
like 7 1/2 to the very top of the rod

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.029 
like 7 1/2 to the very top of the rod
and<00:04:30.120> this<00:04:30.389> is<00:04:30.599> like<00:04:30.810> 7<00:04:31.139> 1/2<00:04:31.319> right<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.860> too

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
and this is like 7 1/2 right to it too

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:40.390 
and this is like 7 1/2 right to it too
so<00:04:35.479> we're<00:04:36.479> ready<00:04:36.599> to<00:04:36.690> weld<00:04:36.870> those<00:04:37.020> up

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.439 

okay<00:04:41.400> I've<00:04:41.490> went<00:04:41.639> ahead<00:04:41.729> and<00:04:41.940> welded<00:04:42.240> all<00:04:42.389> the

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
okay I've went ahead and welded all the

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.839 
okay I've went ahead and welded all the
way<00:04:42.539> around<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:44.130> put<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.310> little<00:04:44.400> brace<00:04:44.669> in

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
way around and I put a little brace in

straight make sure it's straight that
way<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.240> measure<00:04:57.750> from<00:04:57.960> here<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.380> here<00:04:58.650> and

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
way and measure from here to here and

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800 
way and measure from here to here and
there<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.789> there<00:04:59.940> and<00:04:59.970> make<00:05:00.330> sure<00:05:00.360> it's<00:05:00.509> that

way and then we'll look for this twist
in<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.669> to<00:05:02.880> which<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:04.050> might<00:05:04.229> be<00:05:04.409> a<00:05:04.440> little<00:05:04.590> bit

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
in it to which it might be a little bit

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.830 
in it to which it might be a little bit
in<00:05:05.039> there<00:05:05.550> because<00:05:05.819> when<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.270> weld<00:05:06.479> this

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
in there because when you weld this

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.589 
in there because when you weld this
stuff<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.229> kind<00:05:07.440> of<00:05:07.560> flexes<00:05:08.159> a<00:05:08.190> lot<00:05:08.479> so<00:05:09.479> we'll

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
stuff that kind of flexes a lot so we'll

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.330 
stuff that kind of flexes a lot so we'll
see<00:05:09.780> how<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:09.900> works<00:05:12.440> okay<00:05:13.440> there<00:05:13.680> there<00:05:14.099> it<00:05:14.250> is

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
see how it works okay there there it is

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.029 
see how it works okay there there it is
I<00:05:14.610> was<00:05:14.729> gonna<00:05:14.909> paint<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.270> black<00:05:15.710> but<00:05:16.710> couldn't

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
I was gonna paint it black but couldn't

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.409 
I was gonna paint it black but couldn't
find<00:05:17.159> any<00:05:17.250> black<00:05:17.400> paint<00:05:17.699> so<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.909> just<00:05:18.060> have<00:05:18.240> some

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
find any black paint so I just have some

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.680 
find any black paint so I just have some
primer<00:05:18.690> so<00:05:19.470> I'll<00:05:19.710> let<00:05:20.099> him<00:05:20.280> primer<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.669> up<00:05:20.840> and

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
primer so I'll let him primer it up and

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.379 
primer so I'll let him primer it up and
that's<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.930> finished<00:05:25.289> stretched<00:05:26.190> swing<00:05:27.180> arm

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
that's the finished stretched swing arm

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.420 
that's the finished stretched swing arm
I<00:05:27.599> guess<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.199> this<00:05:28.560> really<00:05:28.830> in<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.070> swing<00:05:29.280> arm

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
I guess and this really in the swing arm

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.520 
I guess and this really in the swing arm
because<00:05:29.729> Ashley<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.180> motor<00:05:30.360> swing<00:05:30.990> arm<00:05:31.229> it

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
because Ashley the motor swing arm it

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.520 
because Ashley the motor swing arm it
bounces<00:05:31.889> off<00:05:31.979> the<00:05:32.039> swing<00:05:32.669> arm<00:05:32.820> mount<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.389> get<00:05:33.630> 15

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
bounces off the swing arm mount I get 15

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.729 
bounces off the swing arm mount I get 15
strips<00:05:34.830> for<00:05:35.370> instance
