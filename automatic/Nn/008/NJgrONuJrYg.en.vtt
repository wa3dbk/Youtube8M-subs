00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
slightly slightly sharper but also

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.020 
slightly slightly sharper but also
that's<00:01:16.950> because<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.340> smaller<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that's because it's smaller I'm going to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a Jedi where I filmed from different

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.999 
a Jedi where I filmed from different
distances<00:01:24.450> you'll<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.830> see

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
distances you'll see like you can see

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.190

much more on my TV on the right so you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.249 
much more on my TV on the right so you
can<00:01:28.439> kind<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> compare<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.759> better

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
can kind of compare it a little better

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.080 
that is saturated in the viz version
aside<00:02:04.649> from<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.040> haven't<00:02:05.460> seen<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> too

you'll<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> colors<00:02:13.260> different

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
you'll see the colors different

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.020 
you'll see the colors different
but<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.800> least<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.280> much<00:02:17.520> fewer

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

but you know at least we have much fewer
artifacts<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.440> definitely<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.160> my

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
artifacts and it's definitely in my

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.350 
artifacts and it's definitely in my
opinion<00:02:20.990> blurrier<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> adv<00:02:22.800> version<00:02:23.360> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
the original adv uncut release I know I

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.430 
the original adv uncut release I know I
already<00:02:59.640> did<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.209> DVD<00:03:00.660> versus<00:03:00.989> blu-ray<00:03:01.380> so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
already did the DVD versus blu-ray so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.910 
already did the DVD versus blu-ray so
now<00:03:01.680> we're<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:01.980> doing<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:03.080> versus<00:03:04.080> ADB<00:03:04.739> and

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
now we're just doing this versus ADB and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.370 
now we're just doing this versus ADB and
I<00:03:05.040> did<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.400> both<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.930> DVDs<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
I did it with both the DVDs because I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.290 
I did it with both the DVDs because I
thought<00:03:07.590> if<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.800> do<00:03:07.860> blu-ray<00:03:08.310> vs.<00:03:08.700> DVD<00:03:09.120> it's

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
thought if I do blu-ray vs. DVD it's

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.960 
thought if I do blu-ray vs. DVD it's
gonna<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.170> huge<00:03:10.980> world<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.580> difference

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
gonna be like a huge world of difference

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.699 
gonna be like a huge world of difference
so<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.150> did<00:03:12.360> want<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.630> do<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.840> with<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.350> release

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
so I did want to do it with a release

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.320 
so I did want to do it with a release
that<00:03:13.860> people<00:03:14.190> still<00:03:14.520> will<00:03:14.790> buy<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.270> this

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
that people still will buy and this

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.560 
that people still will buy and this
little<00:03:15.570> more<00:03:16.470> fair<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.550> adv<00:03:17.940> version<00:03:18.450> but

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
little more fair on the adv version but

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.270 
little more fair on the adv version but
the<00:03:18.660> adv<00:03:18.930> version<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.470> far<00:03:19.620> as<00:03:19.739> I'm<00:03:19.860> concerned

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
the adv version as far as I'm concerned

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.580 
the adv version as far as I'm concerned
still<00:03:20.549> looks<00:03:21.060> pretty<00:03:21.390> bad<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:22.290> pretty

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
still looks pretty bad it's pretty

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.140 
still looks pretty bad it's pretty
washed<00:03:22.799> out<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:24.180> contrast<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:26.150> how

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
washed out the contrast and how

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.270 
washed out the contrast and how
saturated<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> visitors<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
saturated it is in the visitors and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.699 
saturated it is in the visitors and
doesn't<00:03:29.580> really<00:03:29.700> bother<00:03:29.910> me<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:31.320> find<00:03:31.560> it

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
doesn't really bother me and I find it

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.650 
doesn't really bother me and I find it
to<00:03:31.769> be<00:03:31.799> sharper<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.519> love<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.269> not<00:03:33.450> cut

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
to be sharper I love that it's not cut

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.350 
to be sharper I love that it's not cut
off<00:03:33.890> no<00:03:34.890> it's<00:03:35.100> not<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> setting<00:03:35.760> on<00:03:35.880> my<00:03:35.910> DVD
