this<00:00:01.589> film<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.250> about<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.550> interplay<00:00:03.179> of

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
this film is about the interplay of

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.079

hello my name is Helen Neville and for

and<00:00:21.990> we're<00:00:22.590> particularly<00:00:22.980> interested<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.790> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and we're particularly interested in the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
and we're particularly interested in the
role<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.540> experience<00:00:25.410> or<00:00:25.680> input<00:00:26.220> from<00:00:26.400> the

people who were deaf from birth had a

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.030 
people who were deaf from birth had a
better<00:02:17.510> ability<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:18.140> perceive<00:02:18.410> objects<00:02:18.950> in

the Far periphery of their vision and

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.710 
the Far periphery of their vision and
did<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.140> hearing<00:02:21.440> people<00:02:22.569> knowing<00:02:23.569> that

did the hearing people knowing that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.420 
did the hearing people knowing that
there<00:02:23.930> are<00:02:24.020> sensitive<00:02:24.500> periods<00:02:24.950> for<00:02:25.160> many

aspects of language and cognition we

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.120 
aspects of language and cognition we
decided<00:02:29.599> to<00:02:30.110> develop<00:02:30.739> an<00:02:30.830> intervention

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
decided to develop an intervention

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.030 
decided to develop an intervention
program<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.989> for<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.260> past<00:02:33.500> year<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:34.010> half
