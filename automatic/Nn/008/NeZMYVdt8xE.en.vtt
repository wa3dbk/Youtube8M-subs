00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
really didn't he check last position no

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.929

way<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.159> no<00:01:29.310> way<00:01:29.460> he<00:01:29.490> had<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> set

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
way there was no way he had a set

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
way there was no way he had a set
because<00:01:30.090> he<00:01:30.270> checked<00:01:30.479> last<00:01:30.630> position<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.259> mean

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
because he checked last position I mean

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
because he checked last position I mean
it<00:01:32.340> was<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> way<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.420> playing<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it was just just the way was playing it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.990 
it was just just the way was playing it
as<00:01:33.990> he<00:01:34.380> couldn't<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> set<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.650> i

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
as he couldn't have a set there so i

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.249 
as he couldn't have a set there so i
thought<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> his<00:01:39.390> potential<00:01:39.720> hands<00:01:40.049> were

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
thought one of his potential hands were

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.389 
thought one of his potential hands were
like<00:01:40.500> Jack<00:01:41.310> ten<00:01:41.549> nine<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.960> pair<00:01:43.200> yeah<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.220> he

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
like Jack ten nine and a pair yeah so he

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
like Jack ten nine and a pair yeah so he
bet<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.640> river<00:01:45.860> when<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:46.890> bet<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> river<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:48.079> i

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
bet the river when he bet to river I i

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.679 
bet the river when he bet to river I i
was<00:01:49.560> thinking<00:01:49.860> thinking<00:01:50.130> thinking<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.509> end

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
was thinking thinking thinking and I end

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.630 
was thinking thinking thinking and I end
up<00:01:51.810> paying<00:01:52.110> him<00:01:52.320> off<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.460> four

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

the<00:01:58.010> right<00:01:58.190> way<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.370> think<00:01:58.460> about<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.880> hand

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090

bit<00:02:00.710> more<00:02:00.860> time<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.370> really<00:02:01.870> thought<00:02:02.870> it

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
bit more time and really thought it

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.480 
bit more time and really thought it
through<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.350> would<00:02:03.560> have<00:02:03.650> decided<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.100> fold<00:02:04.370> I

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
think but I didn't take enough time as I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
out a set on the flop it was almost for

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.800 
out a set on the flop it was almost for
sure<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.310> he<00:02:25.400> had<00:02:25.520> if<00:02:25.640> he<00:02:25.790> had<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.510> know<00:02:26.540> a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
sure that he had if he had you know a

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.840 
sure that he had if he had you know a
big<00:02:27.380> flush<00:02:27.590> draw<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.250> called<00:02:28.490> him<00:02:28.580> he<00:02:28.610> turn

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
big flush draw and I called him he turn

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.310 
big flush draw and I called him he turn
over<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> nuts<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:30.020> basically

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
over the nuts and that basically

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.380 
over the nuts and that basically
crippled<00:02:30.890> man<00:02:31.010> up<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.610> pot<00:02:31.910> limit<00:02:32.060> Omaha

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
crippled man up and that pot limit Omaha

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.300 
crippled man up and that pot limit Omaha
torn<00:02:32.630> him<00:02:32.750> i<00:02:32.840> was<00:02:32.930> pretty<00:02:33.080> deep<00:02:33.320> at<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.100> point

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
torn him i was pretty deep at that point

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.070 
torn him i was pretty deep at that point
so<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.700> was<00:02:34.910> one<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.090> my<00:02:35.180> bust<00:02:35.720> out<00:02:35.870> hands

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
so that was one of my bust out hands

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.990 
so that was one of my bust out hands
that<00:02:36.260> regret<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:37.340> think<00:02:37.520> he<00:02:37.610> valued

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
that regret it do you think he valued

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.160 
that regret it do you think he valued
that's<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.300> if<00:02:38.390> he<00:02:38.480> has<00:02:38.570> like<00:02:38.750> let's<00:02:39.080> say

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
that's like if he has like let's say

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.930 
that's like if he has like let's say
king<00:02:39.500> queen<00:02:39.740> Jack<00:02:40.040> which<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:40.520> decently

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
king queen Jack which is a decently

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.580 
king queen Jack which is a decently
likely<00:02:41.270> hand<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.540> think<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.870> gut<00:02:42.080> shot<00:02:42.320> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
likely hand I think like a gut shot and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.500 
likely hand I think like a gut shot and
he<00:02:42.980> turned<00:02:43.220> diamonds<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:44.090> he<00:02:44.209> has<00:02:44.300> something

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
he turned diamonds if he has something

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.699 
he turned diamonds if he has something
like<00:02:44.690> King<00:02:44.900> high<00:02:44.990> time<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.260> think<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.470> value

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
like King high time you think you value

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.520 
like King high time you think you value
bets<00:02:45.860> qinghai<00:02:46.160> diamonds<00:02:46.520> um<00:02:47.170> yeah<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.200> think<00:02:48.380> he

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
bets qinghai diamonds um yeah I think he

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.900 
bets qinghai diamonds um yeah I think he
probably<00:02:48.560> best<00:02:49.040> qinghai<00:02:49.370> diamonds<00:02:49.760> there

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
probably best qinghai diamonds there

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.760 
probably best qinghai diamonds there
yeah<00:02:50.300> just<00:02:50.690> because<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.080> way<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.320> hand<00:02:51.500> plate

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
yeah just because the way the hand plate

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.800 
yeah just because the way the hand plate
yeah<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:52.760> hard<00:02:52.910> for<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.390> car<00:02:53.660> for

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
yeah it's hard for you to have a car for

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.330 
yeah it's hard for you to have a car for
me<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.560> might<00:02:54.709> check<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.070> case<00:02:55.220> I

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
times on a turn or something too if you

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.270 
times on a turn or something too if you
don't<00:02:56.959> have<00:02:57.200> something<00:02:57.230> awesome<00:02:57.530> with<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.950> yes

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
hard for me to have an ace high flush I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.479 
hard for me to have an ace high flush I
could<00:02:59.870> have<00:02:59.959> zero<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.470> mean<00:03:00.709> he<00:03:00.830> do<00:03:00.980> sometimes

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
he could be a good player could be

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.570
