00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
content for the digital space so that's

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.859 
content for the digital space so that's
what<00:00:21.460> we<00:00:21.610> do<00:00:21.820> why<00:00:22.119> we<00:00:22.330> decided<00:00:22.480> to<00:00:22.840> use

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
what we do why we decided to use

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.830 
what we do why we decided to use
violation<00:00:23.619> specifically<00:00:24.460> is<00:00:24.730> we<00:00:25.450> liked<00:00:25.689> the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
violation specifically is we liked the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.929 
violation specifically is we liked the
fact<00:00:26.200> that<00:00:26.410> there<00:00:27.130> were<00:00:27.189> these<00:00:27.310> characters

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
fact that there were these characters

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.269 
fact that there were these characters
and<00:00:28.269> they<00:00:28.449> were<00:00:28.510> really<00:00:29.380> cute<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:29.859> cool<00:00:30.070> and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
and they were really cute and cool and

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.609 
and they were really cute and cool and
had<00:00:30.400> a<00:00:30.430> lot<00:00:30.609> of<00:00:30.640> potential<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.269> them<00:00:31.420> but<00:00:32.019> they

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
had a lot of potential to them but they

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.400 
had a lot of potential to them but they
didn't<00:00:33.010> have<00:00:33.250> a<00:00:33.730> narrative<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.960> them<00:00:35.080> already

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
didn't have a narrative to them already

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.170 
didn't have a narrative to them already
they<00:00:35.559> didn't<00:00:35.830> have<00:00:35.949> a<00:00:35.980> backstory<00:00:36.519> there<00:00:37.059> was

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
they didn't have a backstory there was

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.270 
they didn't have a backstory there was
no<00:00:37.300> violation<00:00:37.750> movie<00:00:38.350> or<00:00:38.530> TV<00:00:38.710> show<00:00:38.949> or

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
no violation movie or TV show or

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.579 
no violation movie or TV show or
anything<00:00:39.670> so<00:00:40.090> we<00:00:40.390> were<00:00:40.690> able<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:41.140> take<00:00:41.379> those

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
anything so we were able to take those

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.760 
anything so we were able to take those
characters<00:00:42.129> and<00:00:42.430> shape<00:00:42.910> them<00:00:43.210> into<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:44.350> story

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
characters and shape them into a story

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.799 
characters and shape them into a story
and<00:00:45.160> that<00:00:45.370> was<00:00:45.550> why<00:00:45.790> Funimation<00:00:46.420> was<00:00:46.570> really

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
and that was why Funimation was really

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.420 
and that was why Funimation was really
attractive<00:00:47.260> to<00:00:47.379> us<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:47.739> then<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.250> lends

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
attractive to us and then it lends

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.400 
attractive to us and then it lends
itself<00:00:48.730> perfectly<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:50.140> stop-motion

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
itself perfectly to this stop-motion

00:00:50.410 --> 00:01:01.730 
itself perfectly to this stop-motion
side

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.370 

so<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.970> first<00:01:03.120> three<00:01:03.330> episodes<00:01:03.480> release<00:01:04.080> at

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
so the first three episodes release at

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.470 
so the first three episodes release at
d23<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:06.000> live<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.780> Sunday<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> then

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
following that it'll be one episode

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.820
