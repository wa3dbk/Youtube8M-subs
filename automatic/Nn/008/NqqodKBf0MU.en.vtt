pretty well you know coming into the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.160 
pretty well you know coming into the
break<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.090> we<00:03:46.239> laid<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> couple<00:03:46.630> eggs<00:03:46.900> there

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
against the Celtics and against the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.710 
against the Celtics and against the
Clippers<00:03:48.790> ball<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.180> all<00:03:49.270> we've<00:03:49.420> been<00:03:49.450> playing

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
Clippers ball and all we've been playing

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.970 
Clippers ball and all we've been playing
pretty<00:03:49.870> well<00:03:49.989> much<00:03:50.380> better<00:03:50.590> than<00:03:50.770> we<00:03:50.830> have

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
pretty well much better than we have

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.280 
pretty well much better than we have
been<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:52.690> just<00:03:52.780> got<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.930> continue<00:03:53.260> to

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
how to reach every single one of them

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.420

individually to bring out the best in

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.460 
individually to bring out the best in
them<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.700> if<00:05:45.760> I<00:05:45.850> don't<00:05:45.910> obsess<00:05:46.720> about<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.260> we
