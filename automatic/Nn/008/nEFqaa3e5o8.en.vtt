which can be an issue for some people

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.819 
which can be an issue for some people
but<00:00:45.420> other<00:00:45.570> people<00:00:45.899> love<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.680> can

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
just get to the whole dehydrator wall at

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.189 
just get to the whole dehydrator wall at
once<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.320> has<00:00:50.129> nine<00:00:50.460> trays<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.629> seems

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
once it has nine trays and it seems

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.270 
once it has nine trays and it seems
lately<00:00:52.980> square<00:00:54.440> tray<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> great

because<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.840> dehydrating<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:59.160> tend<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
because as we are dehydrating we tend to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
because as we are dehydrating we tend to
rotate<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.120> trays<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.570> ensure<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.230> run<00:01:01.559> time

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
rotate the trays to ensure in run time

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.240

your<00:01:23.220> wet<00:01:23.460> ingredients<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> fall<00:01:24.600> through<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
your wet ingredients to fall through the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
your wet ingredients to fall through the
holes<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.860> use<00:01:26.070> these<00:01:26.250> perfect<00:01:26.850> shapes

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
holes so we use these perfect shapes

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.990 
holes so we use these perfect shapes
just<00:01:27.210> sit<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.540> top<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.500> are

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870 
and and the temperature is at the back
so<00:01:45.780> whenever<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.410> to<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:47.010> these<00:01:47.310> controls

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
so whenever I want to use these controls

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
so whenever I want to use these controls
I<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.330> kind<00:01:48.510> of<00:01:48.570> pull<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.230> box<00:01:49.650> out<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I have to kind of pull this box out of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.060 
I have to kind of pull this box out of
the<00:01:50.430> microwave<00:01:51.060> space<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:52.200> adjust<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.800> time

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the microwave space to adjust the time

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.160 
the microwave space to adjust the time
and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.400> temperature<00:01:53.580> then<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.660> can<00:01:54.780> hear

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and the temperature then as you can hear

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.680 
and the temperature then as you can hear
they<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.340> turned<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.970> if<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
they just I just turned this on if I

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.960 
they just I just turned this on if I
want<00:01:58.050> you<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.650> have<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.220> listen<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.610> I'm

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
want you to have a listen to that I'm

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.340 
want you to have a listen to that I'm
not<00:02:00.120> sure<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.480> can<00:02:00.600> pick<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.080> on<00:02:01.230> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
not sure if you can pick this up on the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.510 
not sure if you can pick this up on the
video<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.620> not<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.780> quite<00:02:04.080> loud<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:05.370> me

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
video or not but it is quite loud to me

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.050 
video or not but it is quite loud to me
it's<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.790> an<00:02:05.940> issue<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.480> house

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
it's not an issue in the house

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.609 
it's not an issue in the house
you<00:02:09.060> notice<00:02:09.360> sound<00:02:09.690> obviously<00:02:10.290> is<00:02:10.440> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you notice sound obviously is this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
you notice sound obviously is this
loudmouth<00:02:10.830> dryer<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:12.570> when<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
loudmouth dryer and when it's in that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.260 
loudmouth dryer and when it's in that
microwave<00:02:13.680> space<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.370> doesn't<00:02:14.940> all

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
microwave space it actually doesn't all

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.330 
microwave space it actually doesn't all
kind<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.660> little<00:02:15.870> sound<00:02:16.140> even<00:02:16.590> firstborns

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
kind of little sound even firstborns

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.570 
kind of little sound even firstborns
around<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.660> yeah<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.190> run<00:02:20.400> through

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
around it and yeah it can run through

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.890 
around it and yeah it can run through
the<00:02:20.670> night<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:20.970> obviously<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.420> upset<00:02:21.870> your

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the night and obviously not upset your

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.350 
the night and obviously not upset your
sleep<00:02:22.320> for<00:02:22.950> me<00:02:23.100> anyway<00:02:23.520> I'm<00:02:23.670> fine<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.180> some

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
sleep for me anyway I'm fine but some

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.510 
sleep for me anyway I'm fine but some
people<00:02:24.630> find<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.960> little<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.380> too<00:02:25.560> noisy<00:02:25.770> some

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
people find a little bit too noisy some

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.920 
people find a little bit too noisy some
people<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.880> put<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.450> another<00:02:27.510> room

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
people like to put this in another room

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.490 
people like to put this in another room
but<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.100> put<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.520> another<00:02:29.730> room<00:02:30.500> so

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
but all of you put it in another room so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.930 
but all of you put it in another room so
it's<00:02:31.650> quite<00:02:31.800> easy<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.160> set<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.550> temperature

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
it's quite easy to set the temperature

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.700 
it's quite easy to set the temperature
here<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.690> Fahrenheit<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.560> gives

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
here it's in Fahrenheit it gives

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.220 
here it's in Fahrenheit it gives
yourself<00:02:35.070> these<00:02:35.310> options<00:02:35.790> as<00:02:35.910> well<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.960> goes

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
yourself these options as well it goes

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.670 
yourself these options as well it goes
right<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:38.000> 155<00:02:39.000> degrees<00:02:39.210> Fahrenheit<00:02:39.960> and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
right up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.260 
right up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit and
all<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.920> way<00:02:41.010> down<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.430> zero<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.090> then<00:02:42.240> you

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
all the way down to zero and then you

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.360 
all the way down to zero and then you
can<00:02:42.510> set<00:02:42.690> your<00:02:42.720> timer<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.290> goes<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.950> 24

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
can set your timer and goes up to 24

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.479 
can set your timer and goes up to 24
hours<00:02:45.470> look<00:02:46.470> great<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.130> turn<00:02:47.310> this

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
hours look great you can just turn this

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.220 
hours look great you can just turn this
on<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.910> temperature<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.450> want<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:49.080> my

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
on to the temperature you want and in my

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.930 
on to the temperature you want and in my
net<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:49.680> long<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.010> you're<00:02:50.130> long<00:02:50.280> it'll<00:02:50.700> click

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
net as long as you're long it'll click

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.260 
net as long as you're long it'll click
off<00:02:51.090> automatically<00:02:51.750> when<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.200> done<00:02:53.000> okay<00:02:54.000> so

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
off automatically when it's done okay so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.440 
off automatically when it's done okay so
this<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.770> donor<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.459> it's<00:02:56.580> slightly<00:02:57.150> taller

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
this is a donor and it's slightly taller

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.850 
this is a donor and it's slightly taller
in<00:02:57.750> size<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> square<00:02:59.880> shape<00:03:00.300> so

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
in size and it's not a square shape so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.650 
in size and it's not a square shape so
one<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.040> things<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.580> do<00:03:03.390> have<00:03:03.570> an

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
one of the things that I do have an

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.560 
one of the things that I do have an
issue<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.320> sedona<00:03:04.650> news<00:03:05.300> which<00:03:06.300> is<00:03:06.450> a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
issue with the sedona news which is a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.590 
issue with the sedona news which is a
few<00:03:06.810> things<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:08.520> first<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.030> all<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.420> what

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
few things is first of all this is what

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.390 
few things is first of all this is what
the<00:03:09.690> trace<00:03:09.930> up<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.290> as<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.830> see<00:03:11.130> they're

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the trace up like as you can see they're

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.320 
the trace up like as you can see they're
not<00:03:11.550> square

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
not square

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.080 
not square
so<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.470> wanted<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.860> rotate<00:03:14.340> your<00:03:14.459> trace<00:03:14.790> as

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
so if you wanted to rotate your trace as

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.000 
so if you wanted to rotate your trace as
you<00:03:15.360> would<00:03:15.480> dehydrated<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.200> even<00:03:16.470> drive<00:03:16.680> time

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
you would dehydrated for even drive time

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.490 
you would dehydrated for even drive time
you<00:03:17.640> can't<00:03:17.940> actually<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.780> because<00:03:19.110> it's

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
you can't actually do that because it's

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.949 
you can't actually do that because it's
not<00:03:19.709> going<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.100> stick<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.790> space<00:03:21.660> really

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
not going to stick in that space really

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.560 
not going to stick in that space really
nicely<00:03:22.230> at<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.620> because<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:23.100> not<00:03:23.250> square

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
nicely at all because it's not square

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.660 
nicely at all because it's not square
and<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.870> see<00:03:25.110> here<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.890> material<00:03:26.519> on

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and you can see here to the material on

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.729 
and you can see here to the material on
the<00:03:26.850> trays<00:03:27.239> are<00:03:27.600> actually<00:03:28.019> quite<00:03:28.230> heavy<00:03:28.560> this

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
the trays are actually quite heavy this

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.280 
the trays are actually quite heavy this
is<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> really<00:03:29.280> heavy<00:03:29.430> plastic<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.720> mesh

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
is a really heavy plastic the mesh

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.440 
is a really heavy plastic the mesh
screen<00:03:31.680> as<00:03:31.860> well<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.250> also<00:03:32.430> very<00:03:32.790> thick<00:03:33.150> and

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
screen as well is also very thick and

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.600 
screen as well is also very thick and
the<00:03:33.630> holes<00:03:33.930> are<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.170> lot<00:03:34.320> smaller<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> think

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
the holes are a lot smaller so I think

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.520 
the holes are a lot smaller so I think
this<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.030> one<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.330> reasons<00:03:36.690> why<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:36.930> found

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
this is one of the reasons why I found

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.680 
this is one of the reasons why I found
that<00:03:37.950> Sedona<00:03:38.489> actually<00:03:39.000> takes<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.330> lot<00:03:39.360> longer

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
that Sedona actually takes a lot longer

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.229 
that Sedona actually takes a lot longer
to<00:03:39.870> dehydrate<00:03:40.620> compared<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.640> excalibur

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
to dehydrate compared to the excalibur

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.600 
to dehydrate compared to the excalibur
is<00:03:43.019> because<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.620> drying<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.370> air

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
is because this drying this air

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.729 
is because this drying this air
circulation<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.480> not<00:03:45.660> as<00:03:45.870> efficient<00:03:46.320> and

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
circulation is just not as efficient and

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.970 
circulation is just not as efficient and
because<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.640> trays<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.120> nvidia<00:03:48.890> one<00:03:49.890> of

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
because of the trays the nvidia one of

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.800 
because of the trays the nvidia one of
the<00:03:50.040> things<00:03:50.250> i<00:03:50.400> do<00:03:50.460> love<00:03:50.940> about<00:03:50.970> sedona<00:03:51.600> of

the things i do love about sedona of

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.290 
the things i do love about sedona of

that up on the video or not but it's a

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.740 
that up on the video or not but it's a
little<00:05:10.000> bit<00:05:10.090> quieter<00:05:10.570> than<00:05:10.630> the<00:05:11.110> Excalibur

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.629 

and<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:17.590> will<00:05:17.740> notice<00:05:17.949> too<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.280> when<00:05:18.550> you

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
and you will notice too that when you

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.969 
and you will notice too that when you
open<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:19.150> door<00:05:19.449> and<00:05:19.780> has<00:05:20.020> an<00:05:20.139> automatic<00:05:20.530> shut

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
open this door and has an automatic shut

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.550 
open this door and has an automatic shut
off<00:05:21.210> again<00:05:22.210> it's<00:05:22.539> a<00:05:22.690> feature<00:05:22.930> that<00:05:23.169> I'm<00:05:23.350> not

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
off again it's a feature that I'm not

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.010 
off again it's a feature that I'm not
fussy<00:05:23.949> about<00:05:23.979> because<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:25.210> kind<00:05:25.570> of<00:05:25.660> like<00:05:25.840> the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
fussy about because I kind of like the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.170 
fussy about because I kind of like the
fact<00:05:26.199> that<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.979> food<00:05:27.190> is<00:05:27.340> still<00:05:27.460> being<00:05:27.850> drier

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
fact that the food is still being drier

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.939 
fact that the food is still being drier
dammit<00:05:28.510> that<00:05:28.539> constant<00:05:29.139> temperature<00:05:29.620> is<00:05:29.740> not

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
dammit that constant temperature is not

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.340 
dammit that constant temperature is not
being<00:05:30.160> altered<00:05:31.030> by<00:05:31.270> it<00:05:31.510> being<00:05:31.750> turned<00:05:31.960> on<00:05:32.229> or

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
being altered by it being turned on or

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.960 
being altered by it being turned on or
not<00:05:32.440> all<00:05:32.650> time<00:05:32.979> whenever<00:05:33.310> you<00:05:33.430> open<00:05:33.729> up<00:05:33.820> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
not all time whenever you open up the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.379 
not all time whenever you open up the
door<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:35.440> because<00:05:35.979> of<00:05:36.010> a<00:05:36.160> strange<00:05:36.610> shape<00:05:36.970> you

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
door and because of a strange shape you

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.270 
door and because of a strange shape you
probably<00:05:37.750> will<00:05:38.020> struggle<00:05:38.380> to<00:05:38.560> get<00:05:38.800> this<00:05:38.979> into

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
probably will struggle to get this into

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.570 
probably will struggle to get this into
your<00:05:39.370> microwave<00:05:39.430> space<00:05:40.210> a<00:05:40.419> little<00:05:40.570> bit<00:05:40.780> more

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
your microwave space a little bit more

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.210 
your microwave space a little bit more
and<00:05:42.580> is<00:05:43.060> a<00:05:43.090> lot<00:05:43.570> larger<00:05:43.780> than<00:05:44.020> than<00:05:44.590> the

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
and is a lot larger than than the

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.170 
and is a lot larger than than the
Excalibur<00:05:45.760> I<00:05:47.639> think<00:05:48.639> this<00:05:48.789> one<00:05:48.970> is<00:05:49.000> probably

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
Excalibur I think this one is probably

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.640 
Excalibur I think this one is probably
going<00:05:49.539> to<00:05:49.599> save<00:05:49.810> you<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:49.990> bit<00:05:50.110> of<00:05:50.169> money<00:05:50.380> when<00:05:50.560> it

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
going to save you a bit of money when it

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.170 
going to save you a bit of money when it
comes<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.979> the<00:05:51.070> power<00:05:51.250> bill<00:05:51.520> because<00:05:51.910> there's

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
comes to the power bill because there's

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.750 
comes to the power bill because there's
nighttime<00:05:52.860> modes<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.280> daytime<00:05:54.430> mode

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760
