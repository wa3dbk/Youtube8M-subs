00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
 It is an impression that 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.340
 So we went to the eve of the night before, and we went to the calm station small second grade general selection 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.999
 Report the reporter 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:12.570
 First of all appeared in total Mitsuru Yoshida see intip 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.909
 The same intensity is seen still and is it corrosion? 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.960
 It is not at all 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.570
 With the prefectural police saying good news 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.609
 I lost it 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.989
 I tried to share it 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.989
 It feels like I'm out of the space that I'm sitting in front of 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.920
 Particularly comfortable to ride at the same time I went 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.790
 is not it 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.730
 Until I talk in trial operation 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.670
 It is good or bad though 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 9th place in 16 that can do rice 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.660
 What will it be to improve h2s? 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.010
 I agree 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 Women are outside the same program 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.510
 I'm adjusting heavy light 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.310
 Still clear talk 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.780
 can do 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.809
 How is the spot price in Mikoshi 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.280
 I'm worried that there aren't many crowns outside box 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.630
 I do not do it 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.460
 I'm full of anxiety 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.270
 Will it be in court before political party support rate? 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.210
 I would like to claim man-hours in 53 minutes 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.950
 Finally, please give a message to the fans 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.400
 I'm sorry that ett is bad 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.520
 I also say that I want to make it through the turnover rate 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 But i will 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.880
 It is formed in the year of appearance with the second boat and has specific 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.100
 Was 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.130
 In addition, I exchange exchange of persuasion in information with Mr. Yoshida 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.720
 is 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.280
 Then it is Yumoto Yamada, who has appeared in 4 processes. 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 Yamada-sensei transferred 6 races from 3 courses in 6 races 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.080
 When the first day's cremation is getting worse from now on about the review 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.450
 I was talking 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.869
 It seems that it was bodybuilding, but the goodness of the movement is lost 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.510
 It means that I have been 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.510
 And also the difficulty of adjustment while repeating propeller adjustment and operation 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.500
 It seemed to feel 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.670
 Mr. Yamada I made adjustments mainly after this 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.580
 It is easy to decide how to start but this race is 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.219
 It is a comment that I would like to make adjustments and decide to be from other companies 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.549
 It is about other Samurai players who appeared in the unusual post process 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.269
 Aged examination, but after wearing one from three courses 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.269
 I decided to start the rule was rolling 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.930
 A bad story with a run about France before this race 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.019
 It wasn't that but I was talking about going legs 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.419
 I was trying to improve by adjusting the gear case around this point 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.359
 And yes 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.999
 Then, with this alone, the leg is improved and it is easy to ride 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.479
 It seems to have uploaded 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.959
 If the temperature drops for this race, it will be better before the store opens 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.969
 It was said to be 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.149
 It is a comment that one course wants to wear 1215 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.620
 The ichat time is from the pit at Marugame racetrack final race No. 12 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.529
 In the race I told you exactly what the Japan-Korea selection was
