00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
be real real careful I've actually
learned<00:02:38.640> how<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.150> about<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.080> year

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
learned how to do this a about a year

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.089 
learned how to do this a about a year
ago<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.950> I'm<00:02:41.489> still<00:02:41.520> iffy<00:02:42.300> about<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:43.099> it's

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
ago and I'm still iffy about it but it's

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.740 
ago and I'm still iffy about it but it's
basically<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.730> soon<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.120> push<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> button

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
basically as soon as you push the button

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.050 
basically as soon as you push the button
it<00:02:46.349> ignites<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.920> fire<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:47.489> away<00:02:47.819> rather

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
it ignites the fire right away rather

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.690 
it ignites the fire right away rather
than<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:49.770> clips<00:02:51.770> here<00:02:52.770> where<00:02:53.129> it<00:02:53.430> just

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
than the the clips here where it just

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.839 
than the the clips here where it just
basically<00:02:53.910> clips<00:02:54.300> onto<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.660> fuse<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.379> you

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
basically clips onto the fuse and you

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.550 
basically clips onto the fuse and you
wide<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.269> then<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.629> does<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.989> magic<00:02:58.050> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
wide it and then it does it's magic and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.400 
wide it and then it does it's magic and
lights<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> fuse<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.410> anyways

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
lights the fuse and so on so on anyways

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.290 
lights the fuse and so on so on anyways

fuse<00:03:30.960> this<00:03:31.200> basically<00:03:31.950> slaps<00:03:32.400> quick<00:03:32.610> beads<00:03:32.820> in

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
fuse this basically slaps quick beads in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.780 
fuse this basically slaps quick beads in
the<00:03:33.060> face<00:03:33.300> this<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.590> fast<00:03:34.830> as<00:03:35.040> all<00:03:35.220> hail<00:03:35.460> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the face this as fast as all hail I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.370 
the face this as fast as all hail I
really<00:03:36.120> don't<00:03:36.270> want<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.510> melt<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:36.840> open<00:03:37.260> it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
really don't want to melt like open it

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.270 
really don't want to melt like open it
up<00:03:37.530> but<00:03:37.800> basically<00:03:40.400> basically<00:03:41.660> when<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:43.280> fuse

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
up but basically basically when you fuse

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.510 
up but basically basically when you fuse
this<00:03:44.550> with<00:03:44.820> actual<00:03:44.970> fireworks<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:47.220> way<00:03:47.340> I've

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
this with actual fireworks the way I've

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.040 
this with actual fireworks the way I've
learned<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.180> basically<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.630> take<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.810> knife

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
learned it is basically you take a knife

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.510 
learned it is basically you take a knife
and<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.350> cut<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.650> little<00:03:49.800> slip<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.280> gotta<00:03:50.430> be

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
and you cut a little slip you gotta be

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.160 
and you cut a little slip you gotta be
real<00:03:50.700> real<00:03:50.850> careful<00:03:50.910> obviously<00:03:51.900> not<00:03:52.050> to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
real real careful obviously not to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.760 
real real careful obviously not to
ignite<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.840> slide<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.260> fuse<00:03:55.530> in

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
ignite it and you slide the fuse in

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.920 
ignite it and you slide the fuse in
basically<00:03:56.250> an<00:03:57.120> indirection<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.810> it's

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
basically an indirection that it's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.110 
basically an indirection that it's
running<00:03:58.230> in<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.650> slide<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.160> tape<00:03:59.910> it

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
running in so you slide it in tape it

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.990 
running in so you slide it in tape it
and<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:01.650> could<00:04:01.770> have<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.310> bunch<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.670> cakes<00:04:02.850> go

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and you could have a bunch of cakes go

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.620 
and you could have a bunch of cakes go
over<00:04:03.120> literally<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:04.050> know<00:04:04.140> fast<00:04:04.650> at<00:04:04.860> one<00:04:05.070> time

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
over literally you know fast at one time

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:12.020 
over literally you know fast at one time
so<00:04:06.630> let's<00:04:06.810> go<00:04:06.990> along<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.530> guys<00:04:11.030> canister

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
so let's go along you guys canister

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
quite a few here actually one two

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.520 
quite a few here actually one two
three<00:06:06.880> and<00:06:07.330> these<00:06:07.780> are<00:06:07.930> longer<00:06:08.139> ones<00:06:08.410> I<00:06:08.470> think

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
three and these are longer ones I think

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.339
