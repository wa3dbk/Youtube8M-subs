00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.020 
this book and i used my gypsy to weld
the<00:02:32.430> images<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.170> page<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.370> they<00:02:35.580> would<00:02:35.760> cut

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the images to the page so they would cut

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.100 
the images to the page so they would cut
out<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.690> then<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:41.220> these<00:02:41.430> actual

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
out like this and then for these actual

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.500 
out like this and then for these actual
the<00:02:43.110> layers<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.830> images<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.459> put<00:02:45.120> those<00:02:45.269> on

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the layers of the images I put those on

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.550 
the layers of the images I put those on
my<00:02:45.540> imagine<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.890> there's<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.150> ton<00:02:48.450> of

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
my imagine because there's just a ton of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.650 
my imagine because there's just a ton of
little<00:02:49.560> pieces<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.280> different<00:02:51.030> colors<00:02:51.390> that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
little pieces and different colors that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.630 
little pieces and different colors that
you<00:02:51.720> need<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.170> use<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.650> cut<00:02:52.890> these<00:02:53.069> people<00:02:53.489> out

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you need to use to cut these people out

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.580 
you need to use to cut these people out
so<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.450> found<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.230> easier<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:57.230> all<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.290> did<00:02:58.560> was

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
so I found it easier to all I did was

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.009 
so I found it easier to all I did was
cut<00:02:58.890> them<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> same<00:02:59.370> size<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.360> did

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
cut them at the same size that I did

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.849 
cut them at the same size that I did
them<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:02.250> my<00:03:02.580> gypsy<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.420> i<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:04.350> colored<00:03:04.680> them

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
them on my gypsy and i just colored them

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.460 
them on my gypsy and i just colored them
in<00:03:05.209> using<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.359> colors<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.810> patterns<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.320> my

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
in using the colors and patterns on my

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.140 
in using the colors and patterns on my
magic<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.340> was<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.200> much<00:03:10.410> easier<00:03:11.150> than

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
magic and that was so much easier than

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.210 
magic and that was so much easier than
putting<00:03:12.420> all<00:03:12.720> these<00:03:12.900> little<00:03:13.290> pieces<00:03:14.010> of
