00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.519
 hi friends and friends today I'm going to 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.960
 show a very simple touch inside the 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:12.879
 tulle for me this one is very, very 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.249
 easy to do especially work in 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:19.750
 amount and I'll show you another way 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:23.170
 also to make these these appliques of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.109
 tulle but this one seemed very simple and 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.990
 it's also a little bit wild after 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.839
 it is matched if it is cut 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.629
 tips it's getting pretty good 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.520
 before you like me I also add 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.829
 some little flowers you can make 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.530
 color that you want it was 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.200
 adding some little flowers you can 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.199
 add many more flowers that stand out 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.780
 about I put a few because I only did it 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.890
 samples yes but you later what 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.920
 Arman to taste and palate 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 what are we going to need a 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 little ball of cloth is larger than 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.210
 that I know where you are going to see using a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 number three that is between this one and this one yes 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.290
 and we will do we will put a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 brooch stick it going to nail 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.979
 here and we are going to start to paste the ones of the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.979
 crimes of tulle if we are going to put 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.410
 here on this base with the gun we're going 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.410
 to put silicone and we will go hitting 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.990
 them and around all around arming 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.340
 circles mostly 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.340
 so I'm going to need 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.920
 I'm cutting for that size you 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:51.979
 is about 50 wide he folded it by the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.680
 half like that and I cut high where are you 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.130
 9 centimeters 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.460
 9 centimeters tall and folded them by the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.340
 I fold it again I turn it to 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.329
 Bend 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.329
 and short 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:18.300
 short there sticks a cut and there is a 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.570
 it would be a square yes highlighted these 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.680
 courses the sides and I'll fold it 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.680
 so like that and here 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.690
 I'll give it if I'm going to be there and it's going 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.690
 to stay like this 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.800
 to this one like a little badminton flower 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.850
 to this and this is what I'm going to put the 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:49.600
 glue and I'm going to stick it on the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.180
 daily top as you see here are tips yes 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.700
 and then and these then you will 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.489
 give shape that we are going to cut giving 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.130
 a more rounded shape 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.040
 so that's how easy it is, as I say 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.920
 that gives a little bit of an aspect a 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.770
 bit more wild and I like the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.790
 truth that I like how is another 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.040
 way if they want something to be softer the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.180
 tips that look nicer go to 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.520
 grab 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.750
 also a strip of tulle 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.670
 can fold it in half 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:33.709
 if they are going to pass him with the needle 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.709
 a pill if the whole bottom part 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.960
 they pass the pill they pass the 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.450
 Bastilla to the end and from there 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.700
 they will stay 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:52.020
 everything adjusted so 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:57.570
 if all juntitos yes 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.580
 to this and also they are going to hit it gives to 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.860
 another aspect only that is also 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.480
 quite laborious but if you have 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.210
 take the job is also going to be very 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.730
 nice yes and you get a little cut 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.850
 also to the spare parts and the van 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.580
 sticking like this one if they're stuck 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.680
 to the lime adjust they make an auction and go 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.650
 to stay the flower also so that they go 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.600
 Pasting the this one can be for over 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.600
 all for bigger balls 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.090
 is going to be more more higher yes 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.460
 well after you that are going to be 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.530
 they are simply going to paint the pots 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.180
 depends on the pot that they use good 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.040
 forms are going to put the plaster are going to 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.620
 let it set a bit when still 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.320
 it is humid and they are going to introduce the stick 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.720
 so that it is already marked and looks good 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.900
 durito yes and after they have painted 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.470
 you are going to grab tulle and they are going to 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.150
 scatter around here if they are going to 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.140
 put the sea in the same way as the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.300
 flower and put it all around and here you 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.460
 you can paint and put what you want are 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.640
 Clay pots are left much more 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.520
 pretty and they're going to put something like that on 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.580
 base and good I hope you served them 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.790
 as I tell you, it 's very easy, it's not any 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.590
 science I hope they do and that 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.270
 after I commented they feel they gave everything 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.280
 for the 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.620
