00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:12.610
 Yes Hello My name is Yu Terapiku In a Terapiku ebay export today 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:16.180
 Explain the basic research method using 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:23.400
 Well, first of all it's tera peak 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:28.810
 I think there are 2 types of 2100 yen and 3900 yen 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.329
 In the direction of full 900 yen because there is not so much meaning of 2100 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.140
 Please make a contract 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:41.750
 In Well many things I research method we have a to 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:47.260
 Only basic people would like to introduce this time 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.260
 Puppet Let's go to category research first 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.250
 If you hit the category or Yamanaka, something like this will appear 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.490
 this 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.480
 Red mark 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:08.360
 Are but a well-Search 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.440
 It becomes a keyword category 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.940
 So these things from these categories 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.700
 Coupon 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.700
 I think that it will be quite helpful to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.810
 8 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.120
 For example, what 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.280
 but 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.090
 a 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.260
 For example, action figures in the table 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.320
 Quite Well After doing 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.159
 Most also in Gori Te 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.570
 This because it becomes a category to become popular 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.570
 I would like to investigate 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.130
 Though various categories come out 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.250
 It is here 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.590
 I will try to search 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.740
 Then bet this doing 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.530
 is not it 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.530
 The swayed ones will come out 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.660
 a This is the number of bids 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.319
 You can do it in print order 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.569
 After the end section 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.980
 No 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.720
 You can also sort in order 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.460
 But that's why 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.760
 It has been seven days now 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.379
 If this is 30 days, it takes 32 hours 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.379
 Data comes out 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.220
 Since there is no little today time I 8 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.580
 I will stop at home 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.800
 I guess next 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.800
 Ask them entered the commodity research 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.269

 A Te 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.380
 I would like to do a search research with this keyword 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.910
 this 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:15.390
 Even if it is 30 days or 90 people in the past, it is fine, but if it is too long 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:21.410
 Today will be alive for 30 days as it takes 2 crowns to see 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.410
 Make a plan on Teze eBay site 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:47.620

 When cleaned a 8 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.350
 It was killed because it was expensive now 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.270

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.740
