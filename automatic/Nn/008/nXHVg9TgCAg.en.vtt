this<00:00:14.650> is<00:00:14.830> just<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:15.309> standard<00:00:15.940> one<00:00:16.630> it's<00:00:17.020> got<00:00:17.349> a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
this is just the standard one it's got a

this is just the standard one it's got a
that<00:00:17.830> built-in<00:00:18.730> desk<00:00:19.540> top<00:00:19.810> module<00:00:20.110> rather

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:20.649 
that built-in desk top module rather

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.940 
that built-in desk top module rather
than<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.130> whole<00:00:21.399> mob<00:00:21.700> X<00:00:21.939> module<00:00:22.480> which<00:00:23.439> cost

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
than the whole mob X module which cost

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.600 
than the whole mob X module which cost
extra<00:00:24.610> and<00:00:25.419> it's<00:00:26.169> got<00:00:26.349> a<00:00:26.380> bat<00:00:26.739> volume<00:00:27.189> port

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
extra and it's got a bat volume port

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.740 
extra and it's got a bat volume port
instead<00:00:28.270> of<00:00:28.599> a<00:00:28.720> stick<00:00:29.219> at<00:00:30.219> ten<00:00:30.790> you<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.059> tie<00:00:31.480> and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
instead of a stick at ten you a tie and

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.459 
instead of a stick at ten you a tie and
it's<00:00:31.989> hundred<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:32.710> fifteen<00:00:33.280> volts<00:00:33.910> which<00:00:34.120> is

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's hundred and fifteen volts which is

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.310 
it's hundred and fifteen volts which is
us<00:00:35.469> voltage<00:00:36.280> rather<00:00:36.519> than<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.969> UK<00:00:37.539> one<00:00:37.870> so<00:00:38.289> I

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
us voltage rather than the UK one so I

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.549 
us voltage rather than the UK one so I
have<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:38.829> use<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:38.980> voltage<00:00:39.760> converter<00:00:40.379> which<00:00:41.379> I

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
have to use a voltage converter which I

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.650 
have to use a voltage converter which I
have<00:00:41.679> here<00:00:43.559> okay<00:00:44.559> so<00:00:44.620> let's<00:00:45.190> get<00:00:45.399> this<00:00:45.579> open<00:00:45.850> it

read that and on the back of the leave
is<00:02:53.299> just<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.870> serial<00:02:54.470> number<00:02:56.890> okay<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.150> yeah

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
is just the serial number okay so yeah

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.370 
is just the serial number okay so yeah
we'll<00:03:00.350> see<00:03:00.650> under<00:03:01.190> these<00:03:02.150> are<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:03.140> two

we'll see under these are the two

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.949 
we'll see under these are the two
balanced<00:03:04.070> inputs<00:03:04.700> in<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.480> middle<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.930> can

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
balanced inputs in the middle you can

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.440 
balanced inputs in the middle you can
actually<00:03:06.200> put<00:03:06.620> 6.3<00:03:07.459> millimeter<00:03:07.880> check<00:03:08.180> on

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
actually put 6.3 millimeter check on

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.449 
actually put 6.3 millimeter check on
both<00:03:08.660> Fleming's<00:03:09.049> off<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.709> instead<00:03:10.070> of<00:03:10.130> running

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459

least<00:03:16.880> also<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:18.440> he's<00:03:18.769> got<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.430> volume<00:03:20.000> knob

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
least also on he's got the volume knob

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.380 
least also on he's got the volume knob
and<00:03:21.819> then<00:03:22.819> it's<00:03:22.970> got<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:24.549> low<00:03:25.549> high<00:03:26.030> and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
and then it's got the low high and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.099 
and then it's got the low high and
medium<00:03:26.600> gain<00:03:27.079> switch<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:29.290> cross<00:03:30.290> feed<00:03:30.680> enough

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
medium gain switch and cross feed enough

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.030 
medium gain switch and cross feed enough
on<00:03:33.109> that<00:03:33.350> back

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
on that back

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.620 
on that back
you've<00:03:34.310> got<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.940> unbalanced<00:03:35.930> input<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:37.630> then

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
you've got the unbalanced input and then

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.039 
you've got the unbalanced input and then
you<00:03:38.810> got<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.290> coop<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:40.100> input<00:03:40.870> don't<00:03:41.870> know<00:03:41.989> if

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
you got the coop so input don't know if

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.110 
you got the coop so input don't know if
I<00:03:42.170> pronounced<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.709> right<00:03:42.859> then<00:03:43.489> you've<00:03:43.730> got

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
I pronounced that right then you've got

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.650 
I pronounced that right then you've got
a<00:03:44.709> source<00:03:45.709> selector<00:03:46.430> which<00:03:46.639> is<00:03:46.850> analog<00:03:47.420> and

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
a source selector which is analog and

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.789 
a source selector which is analog and
digital<00:03:49.150> then<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.299> got<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.510> digital<00:03:50.900> input

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
digital then you got a digital input

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.270 
digital then you got a digital input
selector<00:03:52.370> which<00:03:52.579> is<00:03:52.609> USB<00:03:54.070> coaxial<00:03:55.070> and

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
selector which is USB coaxial and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.449 
selector which is USB coaxial and
optical

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.949 

which<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.060> one<00:03:59.120> up<00:03:59.420> to<00:04:01.599> then<00:04:02.599> you've<00:04:02.810> got

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
which is this one up to then you've got

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.190 
which is this one up to then you've got
a<00:04:02.989> charging<00:04:03.680> port<00:04:03.980> which<00:04:04.189> is<00:04:04.370> there<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.200> the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
a charging port which is there and the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.509 
a charging port which is there and the
power<00:04:06.500> on/off<00:04:07.010> switch<00:04:07.390> just<00:04:08.390> there<00:04:09.310> which<00:04:10.310> is

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
power on/off switch just there which is

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.670 
power on/off switch just there which is
quite<00:04:10.909> a<00:04:10.939> lot<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.269> switch<00:04:11.510> actually<00:04:11.780> then<00:04:12.349> that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
quite a lot of switch actually then that

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.819 
quite a lot of switch actually then that
analog<00:04:13.340> selector<00:04:14.150> which<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.689> can<00:04:14.989> switch

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
analog selector which you can switch

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.210 
analog selector which you can switch
between<00:04:16.039> balanced<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.060> unbalanced<00:04:18.220> okay

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
between balanced and unbalanced okay

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.640 
between balanced and unbalanced okay
then<00:04:19.579> you've<00:04:19.789> got<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.060> sort<00:04:20.570> balanced<00:04:21.109> input

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
then you've got that sort balanced input

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.330 
then you've got that sort balanced input
