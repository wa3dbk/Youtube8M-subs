00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.830
 well it him everyone knows esor 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.040
 so today we find ourselves for our 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.840
 videos on battlefield 4 aubarÃ¨de 50 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.060
 so I can not do you a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.860
 very long gameplay at the bar is 50 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.850
 knowing that the bar is unfortunately 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.010
 we can not see her in class 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.260
 scout it must be picked up on the ground 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.480
 as you just saw it in mode 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.890
 domination be in conquest mode so 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.260
 I managed to make you a little 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.489
 clean gameplay gameplay will tell the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.559
 bars and 50 to be able to a small 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.240
 little to present to you for those who do not 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.900
 can unfortunately not play at the 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.210
 beta 2 bat son 4 so this bar is is 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.680
 really huge inity not precisely on 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.239
 your daughter 3 if I'm wrong in the water 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.130
 was not at all on battlefield 3 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.440
 is there he finally made his appearance 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.780
 on battlefield katsav is really 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.910
 fun it's a sniper that just huge 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.110
 who one shot every time or almost 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.700
 it's very rare that they do so quickly 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.009
 marker compared to the two snipers 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.630
 common m 40 to 5 for example and that's 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.710
 true that sniper he congratulates marc body 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.960
 but it's very rare for example it's 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.580
 when one pulls in the legs them or 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 in the feet so that's it really 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.320
 if you touch your enemy 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.479
 really a side or call so that's 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.979
 very rare but most of the time you 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.840
 kill it there you can see the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.729
 left that a small screen and this screen 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.409
 in festive lets know to which 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.750
 distance you're going to shoot and that allows 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.570
 also be able to judge with bedside asset 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.040
 the reset so that it allows by 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.810
 example if you're 6 and a half is 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.799
 appeared 400 meters you'll put there 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.840
 where you called several times 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.210
 especially bedside and you go m 400 m and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.049
 you're just going to have to aim for the player 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.820
 and then shoot 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.909
 so it's much simpler this is it 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.409
 you're not on battlefield 3 and we 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.210
 find this system a little bit on 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.870
 arma 2 so it's really cool 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.660
 because you also play dz 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.190
 on arma 2 in the name of ruth rose and this 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.990
 system there it's really super nice 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.510
 so you can see that even from 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 far we still happens a one 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.240
 shot your enemy most of the time and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.190
 He starts to cry as fairly accurate 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.450
 so I do not know if we changed at 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.520
 early it was a little galley we go 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.530
 then say that that hyper automatic 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.630
 unlike what I can finally 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.970
 here is the apple unlike the m45 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.800
 so it's really cool that offers 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.720
 a very advantageous gameplay compared 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 his opponent for example because 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.930
 we are not obliged every time to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.030
 recharge with the man 40 to 5 2 of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.290
 target euros so if we lose 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.910
 time each time to recharge then 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.410
 that his and a half and for the look 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.420
 for example we can withdraw immediately 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.380
 afterwards to be able to finish it then 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.030
 it's definitely better 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.890
 especially when we bankrupt this marker 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.090
 lets next after to shoot and that's 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.220
 really nice 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.930
 so here is a little bit for the bar is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.610
 of 50 no you see a little bit on the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.710
 left that showed the distance so 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.400
 it's super nice and it's true that 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.530
 on this map 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.790
 I advise you to play forgiveness if 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.770
 you play your sneijder domination 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.350
 it's very complicated to make a score 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.410
 positive I advise playing on the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.360
 roof of if you can play on the rate 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.640
 precisely because if you have on the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.520
 points it's ea or b you go 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.640
 open bondage smashed pasquale 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.620
 joris on 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.450
 to assault weapons they are really 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.550
 very often there I blow you 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.260
 really recommending joy on the rooftops 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.990
 a little bit or outside the maps 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.880
 we'll say on the sides at least you 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.200
 have a fairly wide angle of view and that 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.300
 you avoid being of your help in the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.510
 very musty corners and make you 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.459
 you must be here 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.750
 little bit for this gameplay aubarÃ¨de 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.000
 I really hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.410
 to clarify me I did a little 8 0 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.910
 1 is not it me tremendously 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.530
 allowed you to make another case to his 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.400
 clean we'll say I'll try you in 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.080
 redo the bars 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.280
 as soon as i can if i can have aulas 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.840
 the bar is much longer I 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.760
 certainly you will be offered but it's 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.070
 true that she has cepandant super nice of 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.590
 see what kind of snipers we will tell 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.269
 on battlefield 4 and who finally on the one 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.580
 shot totally not like on mount 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.680
 orford 3 where we do so said marker 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.880
