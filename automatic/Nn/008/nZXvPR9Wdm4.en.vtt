 flattened body coloring of fish can be 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.250
 different but everyone has consistently 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.010

 dim lighting eats the most pocket 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.789
 which are going to however cook as well 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.550
 not squeamish green algae

 remained alive 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.409
