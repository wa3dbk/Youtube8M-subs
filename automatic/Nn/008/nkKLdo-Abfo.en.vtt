 Hello guys 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.080
 It's ok with you guys, I'm the Luiz guy. 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.290
 I'm bringing one more tip today teaches 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 for you how to remove the notification from the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 voice mail 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.949
 I think it's too boring that it bothers 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.830
 a lot and I do not like to look at it was 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 there on my notifications tab 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.810
 so all I 'm talking about is where 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.449
 is the notifications tab stay here enough 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.140

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.140
 on top 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.250
 this way we will go to the first 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.430
 Notifications 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.829
 here below we can see new mail 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.340
 and that's what we want to eliminate. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
 Let's take it out of here, but how will I go? 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.899
 do that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.719
 there are two methods used from 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.020
 from android 4.0 onwards if I'm not 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.899

 only it has a personal detail these two 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.280
