00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hmm 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.120
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.120
 me 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.400
 U 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.030
 Well yes Ne Well also somehow 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.030
 bell 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:34.489
 Every time I go to the movies, I have a strong desire 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.489
 How it has been considerably with the self-confidence by the memo Prefecture of lessons also rear also Rondo 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.430
 The brakes eliminate the front and rear wheel play 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.539
 A system that can improve the grip surprisingly well and feel safer if the operation is done 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.539
 I made possible 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.540
 That's why this week Rod Doria works well 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.990
 Memo check whether you can do making 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.990
 Let's start with a review of all the weak points and brakes 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.990
 Hmm 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:10.530
 Position of quite I're ride to the taste hit that person array But surely the wing machine of woman 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:19.140
 Man foot fetish tube 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:21.340
 Umeka becomes distant and turns a little more paralysis I say to the cross over from the place of the arches to the cross over 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.630
 It is better to really went Shah at a price Once was 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:31.179
 You can see that the mountain is great but it was sticky but if you understand it it will be a normal fare 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.800
 Te got a stick in the place is dark with little thought little Kato than Well most I sent down 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.330
 I guess 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:42.840
 Because the dear brake can be seen from the movement when it is placed on the high step 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.840
 It is recommended because it makes it easier to get a sense of pedal stroke 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.480
 However, the position of the foot to put on the step is in an easy position when confidence comes to add to the power 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:58.360
 There is no problem to return 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:01.380
 We delicately operate the front brake and the rear brake in one stroke and manufacture them vividly 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.380
 Can you do 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.450
 It 's a front dive writing out whether Kana-chan is really working hard to be heard by Miya 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.860
 It is not a guy 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.770
 Yes 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.340
 Oops is too concentrated on the rear and the front is neglected 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.630
 Ron and the brake is applied and Juwa' from losing the play 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.630
 Two- step operation is a demon 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.740
 Consciously following the delicate operation 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.740
 Can you break 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.090
 I is crispy 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.110
 How about my feeling now 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.110
 To watch 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:15.200
 Buber Mochoi NiÃ±o 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.760
 When I took it to the moon, I'm jealous of stepping on the brakes 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.430
 If it is a play that tires are easy to receive on the ground department Gahn and more and more 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.780
 Not all are that led even when you have slipped from stable and 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.080
 Ka' is those who are using the previous actually care see through even the day before 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:35.050
 I do not 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:38.050
 Oh steadily in fact more and more in the fact that one does not extend it would be so Neo tired there so 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.210
 It was changed and you to use the zone a brake 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:46.030
 Made without matching business card 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:48.750
 If you use the rear brake, the rear suspension will sink, so even if the front brake is applied 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.750
 It becomes difficult 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:59.739
 In addition to that , it is more effective because the juice of the tire does not come off because it does not become the previous weight 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.739
 Can use the rear brake 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.730
 It front also rear also is Ueki I know very important in terms of manipulate well the bike 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.170
 Well I a Tokyo 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.170
 If you use the front and back properly, you can say that you can stay on a bike 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.170
 Hmm 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.100
 ban
