quadruple 0 steel wool and you put it at
the<00:01:13.319> tip<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> did<00:01:14.550> is<00:01:14.700> bunched<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.179> up

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the tip what I did is bunched it up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.590 
the tip what I did is bunched it up
fairly<00:01:15.539> tight<00:01:16.369> giving<00:01:17.369> plenty<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.240> steel<00:01:18.450> wool

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
fairly tight giving plenty of steel wool

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.290 
fairly tight giving plenty of steel wool
underneath<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> there's<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.039> nice<00:01:20.610> soft

give<00:01:22.130> near<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> tip<00:01:23.459> I<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.539> wrapped

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
give near the tip I then wrapped

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.380 
give near the tip I then wrapped
everything<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.619> tape<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.069> you<00:01:26.190> can<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
everything in tape as you can see the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
important thing is to leave a little bit

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
important thing is to leave a little bit
of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> aluminum<00:01:30.080> available<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:31.410> that<00:01:31.440> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
responsive I go ahead and turn on my

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.300 
responsive I go ahead and turn on my
iPhone<00:01:39.000> here

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
iPhone here

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.130 
iPhone here
and<00:01:41.409> go<00:01:42.409> ahead<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.770> just<00:01:42.950> slide<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.430> open<00:01:44.140> you

and go ahead and just slide it open you
can<00:01:45.500> see<00:01:45.710> it's<00:01:45.830> very<00:01:46.070> responsive<00:01:46.729> there's

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
can see it's very responsive there's

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.969 
can see it's very responsive there's
hardly<00:01:47.420> any<00:01:47.690> touching<00:01:47.930> needed<00:01:48.470> I'm<00:01:48.770> gonna

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
hardly any touching needed I'm gonna

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.600 
hardly any touching needed I'm gonna
open<00:01:49.159> up<00:01:49.430> our<00:01:49.610> sketchbook<00:01:50.210> app<00:01:50.420> here<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:52.340> for

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
open up our sketchbook app here so for

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.600 
open up our sketchbook app here so for
instance<00:01:53.060> let's<00:01:53.330> start<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.750> new<00:01:53.780> sketch<00:01:54.320> here

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.490 

just<00:01:58.610> like<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.000> pencil<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.050> make<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.740> black

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
just like the pencil and make it black

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.450 
just like the pencil and make it black
and<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:03.740> can<00:02:03.770> kind<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.369> see<00:02:06.190> how<00:02:07.190> this

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
and you can kind of see how this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.680 
and you can kind of see how this
functions<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:10.039> it's<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.640> little<00:02:10.789> easier<00:02:11.270> than

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
functions so it's a little easier than

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.710 
functions so it's a little easier than
sketching<00:02:12.230> with<00:02:12.380> your<00:02:12.590> fingers<00:02:12.980> sometimes

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
sketching with your fingers sometimes

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.300 
sketching with your fingers sometimes
