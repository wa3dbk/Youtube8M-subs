floor I was able to just to be myself
and<00:04:37.620> not<00:04:38.070> having<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.630> really<00:04:39.630> learn

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
and not having to really learn

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.780 
and not having to really learn
everything<00:04:41.670> all<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.830> fire<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.640> know<00:04:44.700> I

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
everything all in the fire you know I

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.340 
everything all in the fire you know I
was<00:04:45.270> learning<00:04:45.510> it<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:45.810> at<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:45.990> same<00:04:46.020> time<00:04:46.290> I

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
was learning it but at the same time I

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.160

was<00:04:46.470> prepared<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.520> think<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.850> preparation

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
was prepared and I think the preparation

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.990 
was prepared and I think the preparation
as<00:04:49.170> all<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.890> these<00:04:50.010> young<00:04:50.220> players<00:04:50.400> have

learned and will learn as they go

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.610 
learned and will learn as they go
continue<00:04:53.820> their<00:04:53.940> career<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.780> preparation<00:04:55.470> of
