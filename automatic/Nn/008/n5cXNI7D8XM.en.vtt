00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
we get kill like that it's good if we

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
we get kill like that it's good if we
both<00:01:26.520> push<00:01:26.759> together<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.330> check<00:01:27.690> but<00:01:28.140> looks

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
both push together and check but looks

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.450 
both push together and check but looks
like<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:29.009> no<00:01:29.190> one<00:01:29.310> else<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
Pro I don't have these and I can't um I

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.810 

now<00:06:18.170> since<00:06:18.380> we<00:06:18.500> saw<00:06:18.650> one<00:06:18.890> there<00:06:19.100> we<00:06:19.520> can<00:06:19.670> also

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
now since we saw one there we can also

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.220 
now since we saw one there we can also
assume<00:06:20.180> that<00:06:20.240> there's<00:06:20.540> a<00:06:20.630> possibility<00:06:21.080> of

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
assume that there's a possibility of

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.720 
assume that there's a possibility of
their<00:06:21.380> second<00:06:21.680> guy<00:06:21.740> here<00:06:21.950> so<00:06:22.130> I'm<00:06:22.250> not<00:06:22.520> gonna

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
their second guy here so I'm not gonna

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.060 
their second guy here so I'm not gonna
poke<00:06:23.030> out<00:06:23.210> watch<00:06:23.450> top<00:06:23.690> center<00:06:23.990> as<00:06:24.080> of<00:06:24.200> yet<00:06:24.380> I'm

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
poke out watch top center as of yet I'm

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.090 
poke out watch top center as of yet I'm
still<00:06:25.310> scared<00:06:25.730> possibility<00:06:26.480> there<00:06:26.830> on<00:06:27.830> one

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
still scared possibility there on one

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.770 
still scared possibility there on one
hand<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.550> might<00:06:28.820> be<00:06:28.910> able<00:06:29.030> to<00:06:29.120> assume<00:06:29.360> here<00:06:29.630> in<00:06:29.720> a

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
hand I might be able to assume here in a

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.880 
hand I might be able to assume here in a
little<00:06:29.960> bit<00:06:30.080> that<00:06:30.110> there's<00:06:30.380> no<00:06:30.590> one<00:06:30.740> there

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.030 
basically use that as an indicator if
someone<00:07:08.360> has<00:07:08.480> a<00:07:08.510> flake<00:07:08.780> on<00:07:08.900> me<00:07:08.960> so<00:07:09.620> for<00:07:09.740> example

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
someone has a flake on me so for example

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.380 
someone has a flake on me so for example
does<00:07:10.250> someone<00:07:10.700> grab<00:07:10.820> that<00:07:10.940> needle<00:07:11.210> right

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
does someone grab that needle right

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.520 
does someone grab that needle right
there<00:07:11.600> now<00:07:11.780> I<00:07:11.810> know<00:07:11.960> if<00:07:12.080> someone's<00:07:12.320> coming

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
there now I know if someone's coming

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.130 
there now I know if someone's coming
behind<00:07:12.770> me<00:07:12.890> right<00:07:13.040> here<00:07:13.630> just<00:07:14.630> like<00:07:14.780> that<00:07:14.990> just

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
behind me right here just like that just

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.580 
behind me right here just like that just
like<00:07:15.320> I<00:07:15.380> said

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
like I said

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.560 
like I said
so<00:07:15.860> you<00:07:16.460> can<00:07:16.580> always<00:07:16.700> use<00:07:16.910> an<00:07:17.030> indicator<00:07:17.390> it's

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
so you can always use an indicator it's

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:36.920 
so you can always use an indicator it's
like<00:07:17.690> a<00:07:17.840> flank<00:07:18.169> prevention

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.440 

but<00:07:37.930> more<00:07:38.380> so<00:07:38.590> when<00:07:38.860> like<00:07:39.610> that<00:07:39.970> needle<00:07:40.210> Frank

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:40.450 
but more so when like that needle Frank

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.260 
but more so when like that needle Frank
thing<00:07:40.660> is<00:07:40.810> mainly<00:07:41.560> with<00:07:42.400> better<00:07:42.790> weapons<00:07:43.030> than

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.270 
thing is mainly with better weapons than

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.670 
thing is mainly with better weapons than
needler<00:07:43.660> so<00:07:43.930> I<00:07:43.960> would<00:07:44.080> say<00:07:44.230> like<00:07:44.410> especially

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
needler so I would say like especially

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.140 
needler so I would say like especially
if<00:07:44.830> there's<00:07:44.950> like<00:07:45.040> a<00:07:45.070> scatter<00:07:45.430> shot<00:07:45.550> or<00:07:45.970> like

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.150 
if there's like a scatter shot or like

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.790 
if there's like a scatter shot or like
brackets<00:07:46.660> or<00:07:46.810> snipe<00:07:47.050> you<00:07:47.230> know<00:07:47.350> obviously

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 
brackets or snipe you know obviously

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.710 
brackets or snipe you know obviously
you'd<00:07:47.950> go<00:07:48.160> for<00:07:48.340> those<00:07:48.400> but<00:07:48.700> you<00:07:48.940> can<00:07:49.270> use<00:07:49.600> those

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 
you'd go for those but you can use those

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.540 
you'd go for those but you can use those
as<00:07:49.930> a<00:07:50.050> idea<00:07:50.530> if<00:07:50.650> someone's<00:07:50.950> gonna<00:07:51.070> get<00:07:51.280> a<00:07:51.310> flank
