00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.440
 Moisture spray from clinic and also 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.680
 I'm here for the first time in this video 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.119
 test and try it thought that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.460
 just makes sense together with you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.949
 the first impression a bit too 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.810
 confirm and try and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.189
 That's why I link all products 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.579
 csi cream the mine skin and really like that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.320
 well balanced, I'll take another 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.239
 bit the infection from concealer of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.610
 benefit and you see this too 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.559
 concealer core and around it too 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.300
 a little bit of that gel-like thing great 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.039
 great for under the eyes 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.390
 I 'm blown away by the concealer 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.579
 I have now several months 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 and I'll process that again 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 nice with the pendulum in the eye in the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.690
 skin in and fix the whole thing with 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 my mac studio fix brother that I yes 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.890
 also idolatrous love and for the summer 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.539
 is that great because you really 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 does not sweat at all and that says 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.560
 just this shiny a bit off 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.500
 and fixes the make up easily 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.439
 Fabulous and next I'll take 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.140
 then the minus in the finish of mac and that 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.600
 is also just the pdac i mean and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.150
 I use that as a big one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.670
 controlled or depending and wear 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.530
 that too soft 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.570
 in my cheekbones one way around 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.390
 a slight breunings effect such a 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.590
 to create slight shading and that 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.720
 I'll do that on the whole 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.720
 sleep on the nose and also on 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.100
 a new addition is this money 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.409
 Plus, and I have that quite often 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.090
 really up for a natural look 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.430
 conjured the cheeks and have just 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.710
 the childlike with and used 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.470
 then also my new meteorites 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.239
 from goller and yes I could yes 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.069
 hard for hours 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.050
 but we just leave it now 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.209
 make at the 20 seconds 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.000
 and yes, I just wear it 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.920
 my bank on and in the overall view the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.090
 you see, it really takes care of that 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.090
 a beautiful one 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.040
 jwd balanced again and totally 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.510
 shining off we continue with the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.240
 eyes and then I like to take it easy 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.940
 my brother from mac and worked 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.580
 also in the lid fold and that worries 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.650
 for a totally even picture 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.950
 because that's easy, too 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.030
 the sleeps on the cheeks and even 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.250
 billions of all the shades 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.710
 finds just as I do that a 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.690
 bit on the lower lash line and 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.720
 if I deepened a bit year 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 want to have an effect on this smokie 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.190
 but only very often then I take 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.750
 still this light tone of patrice and 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.770
 works really nice in the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.810
 eyelet 1 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.190
 and if I have a little bit more now 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.140
 wants to have dramatic 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.610
 I also do not always 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.130
 namely a little gel alone 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.650
 and also working to gently beautiful in 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.020
 close to the eyelash edge and blinded 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.640
 the good with that a bit 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.140
 looks smoky and then I take 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.600
 also like again the meteorite 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.640
 Pearls, first of all, fixes the beautiful angela 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.350
 alone and secondly, it also takes care of that 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.880
 time for such a nice highlight on the eye 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.510
 and I wear that a bit too 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.560
 below under the eyes on next 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.269
 then the eyebrows 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.030
 I just drive a bit 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.760
 and make a little eyebrow 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.130
 money on it and we are as good as 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.140
 done the carol on it and then 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.640
 the lipstick can come too 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.150
 from the clear this great new yes 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.459
 how hot tip perfect he is called yes 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.100
 is such a beautiful color just super great 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.709
 supple on the lips and cares 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.680
 really for a great grooming effect 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.810
 and does not dry out at all I am 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.750
 so insane and away from everyone 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.620
 these great products and yes sometimes 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.650
 is just nice to treat yourself something 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.419
 Here you see the finished happiness looks 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.479
 Of course, my hair is fresh too 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.280
 That's why someday still know 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.810
 the situation is also hopped high 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.050
 I was up made 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.210
 oh and that was the tutorial i did 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.660

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.660
