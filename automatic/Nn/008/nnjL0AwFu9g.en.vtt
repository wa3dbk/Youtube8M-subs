should be proud of it this facility is
all<00:00:42.300> business<00:00:42.720> it's<00:00:43.470> not<00:00:43.769> a<00:00:43.979> cushy<00:00:44.250> assignment

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
all business it's not a cushy assignment

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.420 
all business it's not a cushy assignment
and<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.900> particular<00:00:46.470> technical<00:00:46.830> challenge

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and one particular technical challenge

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.090 
and one particular technical challenge
that<00:00:47.640> prompted<00:00:48.059> frequent<00:00:48.600> hand<00:00:48.870> wringing<00:00:49.110> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that prompted frequent hand wringing we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.060 
that prompted frequent hand wringing we
have<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.339> limited<00:00:50.640> bandwidth<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.540> at

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
have a limited bandwidth here at

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.119 
have a limited bandwidth here at
national<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.479> I<00:00:54.479> think<00:00:55.229> having<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.739> group<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
national and I think having a group of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.620 
national and I think having a group of
around<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.120> bus<00:00:57.299> people<00:00:57.659> you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
around out of bus people you

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.550 
around out of bus people you
so<00:00:59.320> it's<00:01:00.130> a<00:01:00.220> matter<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.810> finding<00:01:01.810> a<00:01:02.170> balance

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
so it's a matter of finding a balance

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.250 
so it's a matter of finding a balance
many<00:01:03.310> on<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.640> team<00:01:03.850> in<00:01:04.270> here<00:01:04.480> for<00:01:04.690> months<00:01:04.960> and
