caramels<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.950> you're<00:02:44.160> counting<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:45.120> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
caramels if you're counting I like to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.120 
caramels if you're counting I like to
use<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> craft<00:02:45.720> caramels<00:02:46.260> get<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> best<00:02:46.709> kind

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.979 
use the craft caramels get the best kind
we're<00:02:47.790> going<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.970> put<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.150> over<00:02:48.420> very<00:02:48.780> low

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
we're going to put that over very low

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.259 
we're going to put that over very low
heat<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.850> add<00:02:50.910> two

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
heat and I'm going to add two

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.900 
heat and I'm going to add two
tablespoons<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:52.170> milk<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.190> use<00:02:53.340> milk<00:02:53.700> or

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
tablespoons of milk you can use milk or

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.000 
tablespoons of milk you can use milk or
light<00:02:54.150> cream<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.320> want<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.709> stir

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
light cream so you just want to stir

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.340 
light cream so you just want to stir
this<00:02:56.220> continually<00:02:57.000> over<00:02:57.359> low<00:02:57.480> heat<00:02:57.510> until<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
this continually over low heat until the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.780 
this continually over low heat until the
caramels<00:02:58.859> melt<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.430> then<00:02:59.549> we're<00:02:59.640> going<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
caramels melt and then we're going to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.780 
caramels melt and then we're going to
drizzle<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.269> all<00:03:00.390> over<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:01.049> bars<00:03:01.489> so<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.640> is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
drizzle it all over the bars so this is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.770 
drizzle it all over the bars so this is
going<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.000> take<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.209> while<00:03:05.269> ok<00:03:06.269> that<00:03:06.480> took

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
going to take a while ok that took

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.960 
going to take a while ok that took
almost<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.440> full<00:03:07.829> 10<00:03:08.100> minutes<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.640> melt<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
almost a full 10 minutes to melt the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.819 
almost a full 10 minutes to melt the
caramels<00:03:09.420> which<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> right<00:03:10.769> amount

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
caramels which is just the right amount

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.190 
caramels which is just the right amount
of<00:03:11.070> time<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.579> base<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.940> cool<00:03:12.120> anyway<00:03:12.569> so

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
of time for the base to cool anyway so

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.750 
of time for the base to cool anyway so
now<00:03:13.380> we're<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.560> going<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.950> drizzle<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.340> all

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
now we're just going to drizzle that all

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.220 
now we're just going to drizzle that all
over<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.299> base<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:17.900> think<00:03:18.900> someone's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
over the base I think someone's

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.539 
over the base I think someone's
definitely<00:03:19.410> going<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:19.980> want<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.220> lick<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
definitely going to want to lick the

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.990 
definitely going to want to lick the
spoon<00:03:20.819> after<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.299> layer<00:03:22.640> ok<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.730> once<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
spoon after this layer ok and once the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.819 
spoon after this layer ok and once the
caramel<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.420> spread<00:03:24.959> I'm<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.560> sprinkle

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.800 
caramel is spread I'm going to sprinkle
over<00:03:26.160> 1<00:03:26.489> cup<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.819> semi-sweet<00:03:27.239> chocolate<00:03:27.959> chips
