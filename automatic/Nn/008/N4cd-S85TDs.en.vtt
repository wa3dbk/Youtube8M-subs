00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the detail there because under the hood

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
the detail there because under the hood
it<00:02:08.160> looks<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.610> rate<00:02:08.820> alright<00:02:09.270> let's<00:02:09.479> take<00:02:09.600> a

peek in the hood you know I get excited

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400 
peek in the hood you know I get excited
about<00:02:10.979> these<00:02:11.190> cars<00:02:11.490> because<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.790> love<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
about these cars because I love this and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.020 
about these cars because I love this and
these<00:02:13.530> are<00:02:13.680> open<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.190> here<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.610> they<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.880> the

these are open in here and they have the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.850 
these are open in here and they have the
ram<00:02:15.240> air<00:02:15.420> flaps<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:16.080> them<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.500> isn't<00:02:16.680> a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
ram air flaps in them so this isn't a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.640 
ram air flaps in them so this isn't a
true<00:02:17.250> ram<00:02:17.610> air<00:02:17.910> system<00:02:18.450> setup<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.410> just

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
true ram air system setup it's not just

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.500 
true ram air system setup it's not just
a<00:02:19.770> hood<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.580> check<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.820> out
