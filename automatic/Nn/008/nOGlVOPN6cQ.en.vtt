00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
painters tape which I cut out this was

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
painters tape which I cut out this was
very<00:00:54.870> difficult<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.710> was<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.070> worried<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
very difficult but I was very worried to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
actually cut the tape on the resin

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.490 
actually cut the tape on the resin
itself<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.829> dangerous<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.550> that

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
itself it's very dangerous to do that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
itself it's very dangerous to do that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the frame of course now I do have to add

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.740 
the frame of course now I do have to add
some<00:02:27.650> pinstripes<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.760> front<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.570> back

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
skirt armor however there are different

skirt armor however there are different
kind<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.820> pinstripes<00:02:32.180> these<00:02:32.630> have<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.870> jagged

kind of pinstripes these have a jagged

kind of pinstripes these have a jagged
edge<00:02:33.410> on<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:33.680> side<00:02:34.630> now<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.660> wanted<00:02:35.960> to<00:02:36.110> do<00:02:36.260> is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
edge on one side now I wanted to do is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.440 
edge on one side now I wanted to do is
create<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.040> stencil<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:38.150> make<00:02:38.300> these

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
create a stencil to make these

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.030 
create a stencil to make these
pinstripes<00:02:38.900> do<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.290> stole<00:02:39.590> an<00:02:39.680> idea<00:02:39.950> from

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
pinstripes do that I stole an idea from

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.940 
pinstripes do that I stole an idea from
GT<00:02:40.340> 8259<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.300> took<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.960> corner<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.470> for<00:02:42.680> sale

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
GT 8259 and took a corner of a for sale

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.550 
GT 8259 and took a corner of a for sale
sign<00:02:43.480> cut<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> stencil<00:02:44.810> out<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
sign cut a stencil out of that and the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.290 
sign cut a stencil out of that and the
reason<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:45.860> did<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.520> plastic<00:02:46.970> is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
reason I did that is this plastic is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.030 
reason I did that is this plastic is
hard<00:02:47.750> enough<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.290> cannot<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.590> cut<00:02:48.860> by<00:02:49.010> a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
hard enough that it cannot be cut by a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.860 
hard enough that it cannot be cut by a
hobby<00:02:49.310> knife<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.790> could<00:02:49.940> use<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.390> hobby<00:02:50.720> knife

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
hobby knife so I could use a hobby knife

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.870 
hobby knife so I could use a hobby knife
to<00:02:51.050> cut<00:02:51.170> around<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:52.160> create<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.580> shape

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
to cut around it to create this shape

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.210 
to cut around it to create this shape
and<00:02:53.120> some<00:02:53.690> painters<00:02:53.930> tape<00:02:53.990> use<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.040> mirror

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
and some painters tape use the mirror

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.070 
and some painters tape use the mirror
image<00:02:55.460> technique<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.630> get<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.840> on<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.990> other

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
image technique to get it on the other

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.350 
image technique to get it on the other
side<00:02:57.170> now<00:02:57.830> every<00:02:58.820> one<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.060> these<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.330> not

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
side now every one of these is not

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.810 
side now every one of these is not
identical<00:03:00.260> as<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.740> here<00:03:01.070> they're

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
identical as you can see here they're

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.460 
identical as you can see here they're
slightly<00:03:02.330> different<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:02.930> they're<00:03:03.110> very<00:03:03.290> very

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
slightly different but they're very very

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.680 
slightly different but they're very very
close<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.220> that's<00:03:04.310> good<00:03:05.240> enough<00:03:05.270> for<00:03:05.570> me

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
close and that's good enough for me

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.030 
close and that's good enough for me
quite<00:03:05.900> frankly<00:03:06.230> I'm<00:03:06.410> never<00:03:06.590> going<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:06.770> get<00:03:06.920> it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
quite frankly I'm never going to get it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.030 
quite frankly I'm never going to get it
perfectly<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.760> same<00:03:07.790> as<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.180> last<00:03:08.360> one<00:03:08.980> now<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
perfectly the same as the last one now I

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.860 
perfectly the same as the last one now I
did<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.340> gray<00:03:10.610> paint<00:03:11.000> underneath<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:11.780> then

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
did the gray paint underneath and then

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.270 
did the gray paint underneath and then
the<00:03:11.990> pinstripe<00:03:12.350> on<00:03:12.410> top<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.830> doesn't<00:03:13.100> mean<00:03:13.190> I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
the pinstripe on top that doesn't mean I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.770 
the pinstripe on top that doesn't mean I
had<00:03:13.460> to<00:03:13.520> do<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.670> couple<00:03:14.000> extra<00:03:14.210> coats<00:03:14.600> for<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.860 
had to do a couple extra coats for the
yellow<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.100> turned<00:03:16.280> out<00:03:16.400> all<00:03:16.550> right<00:03:18.550> as

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
yellow but it turned out all right as

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.080 
yellow but it turned out all right as

see a new knee section and like I said
that<00:04:54.860> white<00:04:55.130> section<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.610> top<00:04:55.790> is<00:04:56.000> stock

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.100 
that white section of the top is stock
but<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.950> spent<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.490> good<00:04:58.940> almost<00:04:59.360> two<00:04:59.660> weeks<00:04:59.900> just

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
I still got a ways to go though see a

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.680 
I still got a ways to go though see a
lot<00:05:28.070> of<00:05:28.400> detail<00:05:28.790> work<00:05:28.820> went<00:05:29.210> into<00:05:29.300> this<00:05:29.479> guy

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
lot of detail work went into this guy

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.820 
lot of detail work went into this guy
and<00:05:30.200> you<00:05:30.320> see<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.620> backside<00:05:30.860> view<00:05:32.830> new

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
and you see the backside view new

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.610 
and you see the backside view new
thrusters<00:05:34.370> on<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.640> back<00:05:34.960> which<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.110> lined<00:05:36.440> up

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
thrusters on the back which I lined up

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.620
