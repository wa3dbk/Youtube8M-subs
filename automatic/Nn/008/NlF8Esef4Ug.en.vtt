00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
is something you can try out it's a very

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.039 
is something you can try out it's a very
particular<00:01:10.369> style<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:11.570> won't<00:01:11.780> come<00:01:11.930> to

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
particular style it won't come to

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.230 
particular style it won't come to
actually<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.530> everyone<00:01:12.950> but<00:01:13.579> if<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:13.880> play

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
actually to everyone but if you play

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.270 
actually to everyone but if you play
around<00:01:14.390> with<00:01:14.659> this<00:01:14.869> kind<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.500> movement<00:01:15.770> you'll

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
around with this kind of movement you'll

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.069 
around with this kind of movement you'll
see<00:01:16.490> how<00:01:16.640> this<00:01:16.790> gives<00:01:16.969> you<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.329> feel<00:01:17.719> of<00:01:17.990> being

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you see how he just stays loaded up with

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.570 
you see how he just stays loaded up with
those<00:01:42.390> hips<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.500> long<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.070> then<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:44.310> really

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
those hips so long and then it's really

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.620 
those hips so long and then it's really
late<00:01:45.030> where<00:01:45.810> he<00:01:46.580> lets<00:01:47.580> that<00:01:47.820> front<00:01:48.120> foot<00:01:48.300> open

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
late where he lets that front foot open

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.090 
late where he lets that front foot open
up<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.440> triggers<00:01:49.830> hip

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
up and that kind of triggers hip

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
up and that kind of triggers hip
rotation<00:01:50.760> those<00:01:50.880> hips<00:01:51.180> open<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.660> and

rotation those hips open up and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.980 
rotation those hips open up and
everything<00:01:52.590> whips<00:01:53.220> around<00:01:53.400> as<00:01:54.000> he<00:01:54.480> firms<00:01:54.780> up

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
everything whips around as he firms up

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
who tends to lack early momentum or

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740 
who tends to lack early momentum or
Yahoo<00:02:14.010> swings<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.670> front<00:02:14.910> foot<00:02:15.150> open<00:02:15.510> and

Yahoo swings the front foot open and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.960 
Yahoo swings the front foot open and
potentially<00:02:16.290> lose<00:02:16.440> some<00:02:16.709> power<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.070> way<00:02:17.370> try

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
potentially lose some power that way try

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.490 
potentially lose some power that way try
to<00:02:18.000> incorporate<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.050> movement

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
to incorporate this kind of movement
