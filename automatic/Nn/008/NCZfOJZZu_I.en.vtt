 which you read the most books and at 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.100
 I was really happy in one 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.600
 or dan cron at banon because me too 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.840

 I chose the kingdoms account with 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.239
 charm and beauty because that really has 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.960
 been more and more crescendo is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.500
 I really loved it is for current 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.710
 reading in progress 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.640
 then my reading is the goal 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.899
 kingdom of emmanuel square rink deposit 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.500
 the drink that accompanies t reading i 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.629
 not super original but I do not have a 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.510
 special drink to read I know that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.949

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.300

 paper really me it's both 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.939
 Besides, I think that really 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.020
 reading is very convenient to go 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.290
 at school for example 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.330
 I do not like to be afraid of damaging it and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.140
 I can have full full I have 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.670
 really the choice 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.189
 but hey that's me it's really 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.110

 at all known and that I find that it is 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.370
 really a little nugget 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.140
 youtube buzz and their accessories moment 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.360
 important part of my life as readers and everything 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.700
 this little world that I discovered j for 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.370
 just the novel you just came from 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.610
 finish at all their cathy coast hugo 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.320
 kapoor kind the kind of novel you will not read 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.900
 never bah I think it will be the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.650
 poetry because I really do not feel 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.650
 at all the need 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.460
 but otherwise the day I will read more of the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.040
 everything I think is really 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.270
 classic she for languages ​​the novel the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.560
 longer than I've read ben I have not 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.060
 used to quote harry potter in 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.790
 your videos but here it hits twice 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.050
 so that's when it's over because I 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.260
 think that in pocket he has to do a little 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.480
 over 1000 pages yeah that's it thousand 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.520
 thirty pages really when I told him 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.010
 finished I had the impression of having mounted 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.750
 the remains m for major the novel that 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.210
 Because you're the biggest hangover 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.550

 first testimonials I was saying and that 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.060
 was hard to chain on something else 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.410
 so my bag all after ben it was 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.900
 disaster not really I'm not 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.040

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.140
 I still continued to read but 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.910
 really it was hard hate like 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.100
 number the number of libraries you 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.440

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.840

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.620
 three high as me the novel that you have 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.000
 read several times 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.920

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.150
 I like this atmosphere 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.520
 q why high a quote from a book 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.170
 that you have read who inspires you or who 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.460

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.480
 best to make us appreciate what 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.690

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.460

 turns shelves closer and takes 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.370
 the 27th book then the twenty seventh 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.070
 it's the manatine game with a content of 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.990
 didier van cauwelaert that I had seen in 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.000

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.030
 crazy books that I still have not read 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.510

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.690

 as the book leaves to steal your 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.650
 sleep so this book does not really 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.140
 stole my sleep but I like them 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.580

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.050
 really nonstop I absolutely wanted 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.540
 the movie where I was really at bottom 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.890

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.020
 kind of love and that's fine 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.670
