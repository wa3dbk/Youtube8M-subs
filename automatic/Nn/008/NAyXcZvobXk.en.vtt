drive so let's get going you just kind

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.090 
drive so let's get going you just kind
of<00:00:35.480> jam<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.840> there

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.050 

pop<00:00:44.699> it<00:00:44.879> up

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.280 

work<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.840> little<00:00:50.990> bit<00:00:51.230> around<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.220> edges<00:00:53.290> the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
work a little bit around the edges the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.980 
work a little bit around the edges the
second<00:00:54.830> side<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:55.910> quite<00:00:56.270> a<00:00:56.300> bit<00:00:56.540> tougher<00:00:56.900> to

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
second side is quite a bit tougher to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.920 
second side is quite a bit tougher to
get<00:00:57.110> into<00:00:58.240> so<00:00:59.240> let's<00:00:59.390> see<00:00:59.540> if<00:00:59.630> we<00:00:59.720> can<00:00:59.900> make

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
get into so let's see if we can make

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:09.000 
get into so let's see if we can make
that<00:01:00.140> happen

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.020 

maybe<00:01:09.610> start<00:01:10.360> back

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.010

lift<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.620> off<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.940> be<00:01:27.060> much

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
lift it off it's going to be much

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.790 
lift it off it's going to be much
tougher<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:27.990> first<00:01:28.170> time<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.590> dare

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
tougher to do the first time you dare

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.649 
tougher to do the first time you dare
take<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.280> apart<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:30.090> second<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:30.540> I've<00:01:30.630> done

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
