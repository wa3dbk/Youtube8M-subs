00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Welcome to the technical virtual manual of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.760
 challenge the constructive system challenges 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.309
 combines system execution speed 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.809
 of dry construction with the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 versatility of construction 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.260
 traditional in this video we will learn 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.330
 how to build with blocks retar 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.310
 using models and 3d views with the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.350
 latest technology for a better 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.189
 observation of construction with 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.189
 re tag blocks 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.090
 next we will see a construction 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.180
 common in which the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.280
 leveling band it is necessary that the 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.110
 first steps are totally to the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.660
 perfection 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.040
 since the introduction will be what I achieve 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 that our work ends more 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.320
 simply 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.899
 to run vertical tensors in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 corners there are blocks or they are 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.300
 bricks equal to the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 standard blocks 25 centimeters high 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.550
 by 50 centimeters long with a hole 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.400
 circular that allows to pass a bar 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.620
 steel and cast concrete inside 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.690
 when you consider anchoring the roof 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.250
 up to the foundation level in case of 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.770
 that you want to reinforce the masonry 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.900
 foreseeing possible settlements of 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.090
 ground or when necessary to rivers 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.190
 behind roofs that must resist strong 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.190
 winds we will need the blocks 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.979
 the type of concrete that we should use 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.630
 is fixing mortar bars tak 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.000
 I placed mortar, rod fixer, retainer 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.090
 preparing according to the indications of the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.220
 bag this will help create a column 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.200
 inside the blocks or so 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.610
 we will create a much more resistance 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.119
 fortified now for the home to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.119
 build 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.710
 next we will show you that with the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.799
 fixing mortar bars challenges you 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.689
 you can make some reinforcements for it 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.750
 paddle the blocks of the first and 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.780
 second course brush the gutter for 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.030
 remove the dust place a bar 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.770
 8 mm steel in each gutter 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.659
 trying that they remain with 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.729
 Mortar coating below and 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.680
 above the bar 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.950
 fill with mortar bar clamp 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.610
 retat in ras e so as to match the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.610
 surface 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.290
 this is a way of how you should 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.330
 8 mm thick bars remain 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.510
 for reinforcements in the first and second 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.460
 spun remember you have to respect 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.550
 the openings of the doors that then 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.650
 we will also place with the 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.190
 rods and with mortar rods fixator 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.320
 straight 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.930
 we suggest making reinforcements in front of 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.120
 that is to say under the windows to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.800
 place on the bottom back to 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.100
 channel the blocks that are of 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.050
 support of the windows that will help us 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.850
 to reinforce and have more confidence at 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.290
 place the windows if they are 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.270
 large or heavy long seen from 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.280
 above the blocks have to be of 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.819
 same way on a level since these 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.099
 blocks are perfectly cut 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.549
 should be exactly like that with 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.549
 prolixity 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.600
 we enter the interior of the house 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.710
 and we go to our first room 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.820
 we see the windows excellently 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.770
 placed stairs to challenge where now 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.150
 we will go up to see the second floor and 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.150
 then we will go back down 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.470
 we keep seeing the windows we 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.720
 we will go to the second room 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.720
 we see the inside more deeply 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.879
 now we will start going down by the same 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.920
 stairs challenges that thanks to challenges with 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.750
 the steps or stairs we can 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.370
 build stairs much more 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.909
 easy and faster than 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.909
 traditional 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.760
 we can see that the blocks of 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.100
 Corners are cut to size for 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.270
 that fit the blocks that we name the 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.270
 start of this video 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.800
 now we will get into the bathroom we can 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.530
 see that the floor tiles are 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.410
 placed the same then they will go 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.440
 placed on the wall to challenge since 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.440
 these blocks withstand humidity 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.440
 satisfactorily 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.449
 we see the small living room overlooking the 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:00.529
 park we will go to see the kitchen for 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.529
 look how it has been 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 Excellent 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.669
 We will go to our room with your 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.379
 respective bed furniture and your TV 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.379
 for a pleasant comfort 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.740
 very well that would be our house of 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.570
 challenge that we are leaving and then 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.160
 the necessary materials to be able 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.920
 have a challenge house 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.880
 Meanwhile we can enjoy this 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.880
 home that we have already finished 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:01.709
 very good for house constructions 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:05.789
 type challenge we will need solid blocks 

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:09.519
 of 25 x 50 by the thickness of your choice 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:11.709
 blocks or also 25 x 50 for the 

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:16.749
 desired thickness greater than 15 centimeters 

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:18.639
 Thick blocks equal 25 x 50 per 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:21.699
 The desired thickness greater than 15 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.669
 Thickness Fixing Mortar 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.099
 of bars to fill the blocks or 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.279
 inside for chest reinforcements 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.559
 that we have previously named 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:34.569
 adhesive mortar for the correct 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.279
 application you can use the spoon when 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.489
 adora canal that has the desired thickness 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:41.349
 of the block challenges that the adhesive mortar 

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:43.719
 reta- which is prepared with three parts of 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:46.179
 adhesive mortar and a part of water with 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:49.040
 this mixture we can now stick the blocks 

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:51.110
 to challenge cinnamon dor 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.180
 to finish the blocks in the first and 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.750
 second row and to finish in the 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.060
 parts where the light connections will go 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.040
 rubber mallet to carry to the position 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.960
 end of the brick and ensure a 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.270
 intimate contact of the surface of the 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.410
 same with adhesive mortar board 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:12.010
 retat we reached the end of this video 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:15.520
 thank you very much graphic designer
