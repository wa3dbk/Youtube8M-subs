00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello girls, well, nothing, I'm going to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 make a villaguay of these that I 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.070
 they like me a lot and well, nothing today 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.990
 I'm going to do a super simple thing 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 I 've seen a lot that is now very 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.240
 fashionable and good, because you usually know that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.340
 they wear a lot the toreras are the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 jackets these as well as cardio 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.090
 but straps and well, well, I've 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 been investigating and such and such and I have 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.600
 seen that there is a way to do it with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.210
 all the colors that you want or that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.239
 have without buying anything 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.079
 example I have this handkerchief vale is a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.120
 pink if superfluous super long and such and 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.829
 well then it 's elastic then with this 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.820
 handkerchief let's do 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.610
 a vest to put it on and go out 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 street to say it somehow and it's 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.629
 super simple so if you're interested 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.829
 stay to see it when what we are going to 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.420
 to do is open the handkerchief and stretch it 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.800
 good to catch the tips first this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.250
 point and then take this one 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.310
 and put the ends together I hope it looks 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.310
 all right 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.549
 it's good then we have the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.580
 half of the handkerchief now that is now is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.280
 shorter handkerchief 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.130
 of agreement then of the two tips 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.400
 we take and make a knot 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.540
 as small as possible 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.540
 [Music] 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.380
 we press well 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.829
 without charge us handkerchief but 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.009
 we squeeze well and then for the part 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.189
 that is bent so we open it and 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.079
 we have our vest I will teach 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.310
 how is it still good with the shirt 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.979
 that there is still not much 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.340
 but good and I show you we put it 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.340
 A) Yes 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.009
 and well, I'm going to focus on how it looks 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.549
 it would be like this is a pretty vest 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.549
 original 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.080
 and good because you know if you have 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.080
 any good is like this 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.840
 since it is very nice if you do not want 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.819
 spend money on a vest and you have 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.439
 enough scarves, I think that this 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.209
 it's a super original way we go 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.220
 create a custom vest on top 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.030
 it will not take you to anyone will be the only one and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.130
 they will tell you that we have bought and your hair 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.650
 and I think it's a super original way 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.540
 because then you untied the knot and 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.120
 you have your scarf your scarf you what you 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.290
 you want the truth so I do not expect anything 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 what did you like 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.040
 if you do it or anything you already know 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.380

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.569

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.220

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.830

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.690

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.850
