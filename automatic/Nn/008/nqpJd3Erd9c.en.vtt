okay<00:00:00.810> we're<00:00:01.020> doing<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.319> demonstration<00:00:01.560> of

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
okay we're doing a demonstration of

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.789 
okay we're doing a demonstration of
amplitudes<00:00:03.120> in<00:00:03.540> audio<00:00:03.959> tools<00:00:04.290> which<00:00:04.650> is

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
amplitudes in audio tools which is

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.400 
amplitudes in audio tools which is
available<00:00:05.040> as<00:00:05.370> an<00:00:05.430> in-app<00:00:05.700> purchase<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.660> it

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
available as an in-app purchase and it

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.820 
available as an in-app purchase and it
is<00:00:07.529> designed<00:00:08.370> primarily<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> line<00:00:09.389> input

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
is designed primarily as a line input

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.009 
is designed primarily as a line input
test<00:00:10.830> function<00:00:11.460> however<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.179> did<00:00:12.389> want<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> show

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
test function however I did want to show

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.230 
test function however I did want to show
the<00:00:13.349> setup<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.980> I'm<00:00:14.130> using<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.700> demonstrate

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the setup that I'm using to demonstrate

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.290 
the setup that I'm using to demonstrate
it<00:00:15.590> which<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:17.190> simplicity<00:00:17.580> I've<00:00:18.029> just

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
it which for simplicity I've just

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.450 
it which for simplicity I've just
plugged<00:00:18.600> pair<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.350> headphones<00:00:19.529> into<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
plugged pair of headphones into the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.269 
plugged pair of headphones into the
output<00:00:20.609> Jack<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.600> I'm<00:00:22.380> gonna<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.710> using<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
output Jack and I'm gonna be using the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.820 
output Jack and I'm gonna be using the
microphone<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.330> face<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> first<00:00:25.380> part

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
microphone of I face for the first part

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.759 
microphone of I face for the first part
of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> test<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.150> second<00:00:27.510> part<00:00:27.750> we'll<00:00:28.619> do

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
of the test for the second part we'll do

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.420 
of the test for the second part we'll do
a<00:00:28.800> different<00:00:29.250> setup<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.210> will<00:00:30.570> include

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
a different setup and that will include

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.940 
a different setup and that will include
just<00:00:32.430> patching<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.480> input<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> output<00:00:34.230> on

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
just patching the input to the output on

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.869 
just patching the input to the output on
I<00:00:35.670> aw<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.940> interface<00:00:37.489> okay<00:00:38.489> now<00:00:38.640> we're<00:00:38.790> going

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
I aw do interface okay now we're going

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
I aw do interface okay now we're going
to<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.059> ahead<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> demonstrate<00:00:39.540> amplitude

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to go ahead and demonstrate amplitude

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
to go ahead and demonstrate amplitude
sweep<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:41.790> I've<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
sweep and as you can see I've got the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
sweep and as you can see I've got the
sweep<00:00:42.570> time<00:00:42.780> set<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> seven<00:00:43.620> seconds<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:45.000> can

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
sweep time set to seven seconds we can

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.700 
sweep time set to seven seconds we can
go<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> thirty<00:00:45.750> second<00:00:46.170> sweep<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
go up to a thirty second sweep and the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
go up to a thirty second sweep and the
longer<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> sweep<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.660> accuracy

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
longer the sweep the more accuracy

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
longer the sweep the more accuracy
especially<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> low<00:00:50.219> frequencies<00:00:50.910> but

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
especially at the low frequencies but

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
especially at the low frequencies but
for<00:00:52.170> purposes<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.680> demonstration<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.579> will

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
for purposes of demonstration this will

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.990 
for purposes of demonstration this will
serve<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.469> ahead<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
serve and so all we do is go ahead and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
serve and so all we do is go ahead and
push<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.270> play<00:00:57.870> button<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.559> starts<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
push the play button which starts a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.250 
push the play button which starts a
sweep<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.270> thing<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.080> there's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
sweep and the thing is here there's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
sweep and the thing is here there's
there's<00:01:07.470> no<00:01:07.619> filtering<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> input<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there's no filtering on the input so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
there's no filtering on the input so
that's<00:01:09.750> why<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.229> primarily<00:01:10.680> designed<00:01:10.950> as

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that's why this is primarily designed as

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
that's why this is primarily designed as
a<00:01:11.310> line<00:01:11.580> input<00:01:11.970> function<00:01:12.450> where<00:01:12.570> there's<00:01:12.750> not

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
a line input function where there's not

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920 
a line input function where there's not
room<00:01:13.680> acoustics<00:01:14.000> interacting<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.240> background

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
room acoustics interacting or background

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
room acoustics interacting or background
noise<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.330> we've

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
noise but but what you can see is we've

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600 
noise but but what you can see is we've
got<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> sweep<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> input<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.310> use<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
got a sweep of the input we can use a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.600 
got a sweep of the input we can use a
cursor<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.299> look<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.020> any<00:01:22.220> frequency<00:01:23.220> on

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
cursor and look at any frequency on

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.789 
cursor and look at any frequency on
there<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.259> also<00:01:25.409> apply

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
there and then we can also apply

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
there and then we can also apply
smoothing<00:01:26.549> after<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> fact<00:01:27.270> which<00:01:27.450> is

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
smoothing after the fact which is

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.990 
smoothing after the fact which is
non-destructive<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> look<00:01:29.850> at

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
non-destructive so we can have a look at

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.359 
non-destructive so we can have a look at
that<00:01:30.180> again<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.320> zoom<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> frequency

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that again we can zoom the frequency

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
that again we can zoom the frequency
scale<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.200> as<00:01:34.200> well<00:01:34.579> zoom<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.970> DB<00:01:36.390> scale<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
scale and as well zoom the DB scale and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.929 
scale and as well zoom the DB scale and
of<00:01:37.470> course<00:01:37.650> double<00:01:37.979> tap<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.430> any<00:01:38.549> time<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of course double tap at any time to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
of course double tap at any time to
bring<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.229> what<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.280> do

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
bring it back so what if you want to do

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
bring it back so what if you want to do
a<00:01:41.460> sweep<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> limited<00:01:42.659> frequency

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
a sweep of just a limited frequency

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.590 
a sweep of just a limited frequency
range<00:01:43.470> well<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.520> easy<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:45.450> go

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
range well that's really easy just go

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.740 
range well that's really easy just go
ahead<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> zoom<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.649> frequency<00:01:47.189> scale<00:01:47.750> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
ahead and zoom the frequency scale to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.520 
ahead and zoom the frequency scale to
reflect<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.890> range<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.549> want<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.149> study<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
reflect the range you want to study so

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.190 
reflect the range you want to study so
I've<00:01:53.189> set<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.640> there<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> couple

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
I've set it there for you know a couple

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.069 
I've set it there for you know a couple
hundred<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.710> about<00:01:55.799> five<00:01:56.130> K<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
hundred to about five K and I'm going to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:06.530 
hundred to about five K and I'm going to
go<00:01:58.200> ahead<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.590> run<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.369> one

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.260 

and<00:02:07.540> that's<00:02:08.380> our<00:02:08.560> suite<00:02:08.890> if<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.670> double<00:02:10.030> tap<00:02:10.060> to

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
and that's our suite if I double tap to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.910 
and that's our suite if I double tap to
bring<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.840> obviously<00:02:11.320> there's<00:02:11.500> no<00:02:11.620> data

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
bring it in obviously there's no data

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.210 
bring it in obviously there's no data
before<00:02:12.160> or<00:02:12.550> after<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:12.910> point<00:02:13.800> now<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.860> save

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
before or after that point now the save

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.190 
before or after that point now the save
and<00:02:15.400> recall<00:02:15.550> features<00:02:16.210> are<00:02:16.360> very<00:02:16.480> powerful<00:02:16.780> in

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
and recall features are very powerful in

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.590 
and recall features are very powerful in
this<00:02:17.290> module<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.490> if<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.790> go<00:02:18.910> into<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.210> save<00:02:19.420> and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
this module so if I go into the save and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.260 
this module so if I go into the save and
recall<00:02:19.720> module<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.190> let's<00:02:21.850> go<00:02:21.970> ahead<00:02:22.090> and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
recall module and let's go ahead and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.260 
recall module and let's go ahead and
store<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.730> course<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
store this one and of course you have to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.800 
store this one and of course you have to
give<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.570> name<00:02:25.780> say<00:02:26.940> test<00:02:29.070> store<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.570> let's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
give it a name say test store and let's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.150 
give it a name say test store and let's
go<00:02:31.959> ahead<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.320> recall<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.550> one<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.830> now

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
go ahead and recall that one and now

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.120 
go ahead and recall that one and now
that<00:02:36.400> appears<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.910> screen<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.450> yellow<00:02:38.130> so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
that appears on the screen in yellow so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.250 
that appears on the screen in yellow so
let's<00:02:39.370> go<00:02:39.489> ahead<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.790> record<00:02:39.880> another<00:02:40.390> sweep

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
let's go ahead and record another sweep

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.400 
let's go ahead and record another sweep
on<00:02:41.560> top<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:43.390> we'll<00:02:43.690> just<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:44.290> know

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
on top of that and we'll just you know

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.910 
on top of that and we'll just you know
maybe<00:02:44.680> use<00:02:44.920> similar<00:02:45.720> range<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:47.110> frequency<00:02:47.709> but

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
maybe use similar range of frequency but

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.100 
maybe use similar range of frequency but
not<00:02:48.160> quite<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.820> same<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.300> doesn't<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
not quite the same it doesn't have to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:03:00.930 
not quite the same it doesn't have to
match<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:58.950> there<00:02:59.950> we<00:03:00.100> can<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.550> reference

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
match and there we can see the reference

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.750 
match and there we can see the reference
curve<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.750> current<00:03:02.110> curve<00:03:02.380> we<00:03:03.250> also<00:03:03.430> have

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
curve and the current curve we also have

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.090 
curve and the current curve we also have
difference<00:03:04.209> mode<00:03:04.420> available<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:05.440> if<00:03:05.950> that's

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
difference mode available and if that's

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.580 
difference mode available and if that's
turned<00:03:06.519> on<00:03:06.700> then<00:03:07.540> we<00:03:07.810> can<00:03:07.840> easily<00:03:08.290> see<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
turned on then we can easily see the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.789 
turned on then we can easily see the
difference<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.190> two<00:03:09.340> graphs<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:10.799> this

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
difference of the two graphs in this

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.610 
difference of the two graphs in this
case<00:03:12.220> DB<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.180> now<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.780> notice<00:03:14.170> back<00:03:14.380> on<00:03:14.560> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
case DB you now you notice back on the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.470 
case DB you now you notice back on the
setup<00:03:14.830> page<00:03:15.130> we<00:03:15.310> can<00:03:15.459> pick<00:03:15.730> different<00:03:15.760> units

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
setup page we can pick different units

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.850 
setup page we can pick different units
such<00:03:16.690> as<00:03:17.040> volts<00:03:18.040> RMS<00:03:18.549> if<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:18.940> want<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.860> that

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
such as volts RMS if we want and that

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.970 
such as volts RMS if we want and that
changes<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.370> scale<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.000> read<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.799> volts<00:03:23.799> which

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
changes a scale to read in volts which

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.160 
changes a scale to read in volts which
could<00:03:24.280> be<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.850> know<00:03:24.970> we're<00:03:25.269> useful<00:03:25.720> for<00:03:25.989> this

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
could be you know we're useful for this

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.890 
could be you know we're useful for this
function<00:03:26.920> now<00:03:27.400> I'm<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.209> go<00:03:28.299> ahead<00:03:28.420> and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
function now I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.000 
function now I'm going to go ahead and
switch<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.830> inputs<00:03:31.200> okay<00:03:32.200> now<00:03:32.500> we've<00:03:32.650> plugged

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
switch the inputs okay now we've plugged

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.699 
switch the inputs okay now we've plugged
a<00:03:33.400> balanced<00:03:34.299> cable<00:03:34.570> for<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.110> input<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
a balanced cable for the input to the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
output of I audio interface and we go

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.530 
output of I audio interface and we go
ahead<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.769> selected<00:03:39.280> line<00:03:39.610> as<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.150> input

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
ahead and selected line as the input

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.470 
ahead and selected line as the input
source<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.290> mid-range<00:03:42.250> will<00:03:42.700> leave<00:03:42.880> volts<00:03:43.360> as

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
source and mid-range will leave volts as

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.390 
source and mid-range will leave volts as
our<00:03:43.660> units<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.769> we're<00:03:44.920> going<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.070> go<00:03:45.190> ahead

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
our units and we're going to go ahead

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.110 
our units and we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:45.519> run<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.970> sweep<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.760> course<00:03:48.970> we

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
and run this sweep and of course we

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.440 
and run this sweep and of course we
don't<00:03:49.209> hear<00:03:49.480> anything<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:50.110> as<00:03:50.380> well<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:51.450> can

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
don't hear anything and as well I I can

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.300 
don't hear anything and as well I I can
talk<00:03:52.780> while<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.380> going<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.799> because<00:03:53.980> it's

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
talk while this is going on because it's

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.830 
talk while this is going on because it's
a<00:03:54.630> yeah<00:03:56.250> voltage<00:03:57.250> only<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.390> can<00:03:58.420> see<00:03:58.750> as

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
a yeah voltage only and you can see as

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.460 
a yeah voltage only and you can see as
you'd<00:03:58.989> expect<00:03:59.530> the<00:04:00.180> voltage<00:04:01.290> reading<00:04:02.290> is

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
you'd expect the voltage reading is

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.340 
you'd expect the voltage reading is
really<00:04:02.890> flat<00:04:03.220> 20<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.790> 20<00:04:04.090> km<00:04:04.390> IATA<00:04:04.720> interface

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
really flat 20 to 20 km IATA interface

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.110 
really flat 20 to 20 km IATA interface
and<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:08.110> in<00:04:08.440> units<00:04:09.160> of<00:04:09.280> volts<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.880> we<00:04:09.970> can

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
and that is in units of volts and we can

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.370 
and that is in units of volts and we can
of<00:04:10.239> course<00:04:10.270> switch<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:11.190> units<00:04:12.190> in<00:04:12.340> decibels

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
of course switch to units in decibels

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.560 
of course switch to units in decibels
we<00:04:14.560> also<00:04:14.740> see<00:04:15.160> things<00:04:16.080> very<00:04:17.080> flat<00:04:17.470> there<00:04:18.570> so

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
we also see things very flat there so

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.810 
we also see things very flat there so
again<00:04:19.840> we<00:04:20.050> can<00:04:20.230> do<00:04:20.470> save<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.640> recall

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
again we can do save and recall

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.560 
again we can do save and recall
difference<00:04:22.630> mode<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:24.060> all<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.420> normal

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
difference mode and all the normal

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.430 
difference mode and all the normal
features<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.320> we<00:04:26.470> have<00:04:26.500> in<00:04:27.040> audio<00:04:27.490> tools<00:04:28.440> so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
features that we have in audio tools so
