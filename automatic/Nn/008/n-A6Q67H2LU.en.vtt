00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.750
 plus 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.670
 Hi, everyone, how are I doing today? 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.529
 model as you see in this case to do 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.480
 the braid in cord but of root already 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.270
 You will see that it is very easy and nothing will leave you 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.980
 with the tutorial 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.360
 good as always the first thing 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.420
 we do is brush the hair well and 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.220
 leave it well untangled to be able to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.790
 do partitions well let's take 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 the hair section so only in the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.830
 side to make a braid from here and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.989
 then drop everything and that 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.910
 integrate in the mane then first 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.910
 we take the front 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.360
 and we leave then 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 and now these two parts are going 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.640
 rolling up I'm going to roll it towards the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.920
 left side and to the right side 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.060
 let's make the first crossing 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 A) Yes 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.170
 when we have crossed once we take 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.660
 a little hair I like the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.660
 root braids and we integrate it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.920
 we turn 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.189
 I was turning to the left side 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.499
 because nothing integrated the hair and turn and now 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.500
 we come back to make a cross towards the 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:20.430
 right 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:24.800
 and like a lock of hair from the other side 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.800
 another crossing another bug 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.590
 i 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.570
 two 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.350
 good and for example once we arrived 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.400
 here to the ear we stop catching hair and 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.240
 what we do 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.610
 roll the strands that we have 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.610
 we are turning the whole braid 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.310
 yes 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.220
 and that's how easy it is to make the braid 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.230
 the cord is integrated into the hair 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.690
 we can continue with everything but doing 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.170
 more braids or integrate it into a 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.170
 collected 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.050
 If I liked it, you know, you give it 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.090
 to the line and I shared it with all of you 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.700
 friends do not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.700
