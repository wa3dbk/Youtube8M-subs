00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
this game wouldn't be as fun as I

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.330 
this game wouldn't be as fun as I
thought<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.750> would<00:01:44.869> be<00:01:45.049> given<00:01:46.040> that<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:46.250> know

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.920 
thought it would be given that you know
there<00:01:46.490> was<00:01:46.610> there's<00:01:46.880> these<00:01:47.060> point<00:01:47.450> streak<00:01:47.780> so

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
there was there's these point streak so

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.420 
there was there's these point streak so
why<00:01:48.049> not<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.229> was<00:01:48.439> really<00:01:48.920> worried<00:01:49.159> about<00:01:49.220> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
why not I was really worried about the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.300 
why not I was really worried about the
point<00:01:49.640> streaks<00:01:49.909> but<00:01:50.810> after<00:01:51.710> seeing<00:01:52.009> them<00:01:52.220> you

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
point streaks but after seeing them you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.399 
point streaks but after seeing them you
know<00:01:52.430> being<00:01:53.240> used<00:01:53.540> in<00:01:53.720> game<00:01:53.960> they<00:01:54.229> weren't

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
know being used in game they weren't

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.139 
know being used in game they weren't
really<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:54.860> bad<00:01:55.040> i<00:01:55.100> mean<00:01:55.369> they<00:01:55.549> they<00:01:55.579> seemed

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
really that bad i mean they they seemed

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.030 
really that bad i mean they they seemed
okay<00:01:56.630> i<00:01:56.659> didn't<00:01:57.020> really<00:01:57.140> find<00:01:57.500> one<00:01:57.710> kill

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
streak

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.779 
streak
extremely<00:01:59.659> overpowered<00:02:00.460> although<00:02:01.460> there<00:02:01.700> are

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
extremely overpowered although there are

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:02.740 
extremely overpowered although there are
a<00:02:01.820> couple<00:02:01.939> times<00:02:02.240> when<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.479> was<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.689> know

getting base raped basically we're

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.730 
getting base raped basically we're
playing<00:02:05.719> second<00:02:06.049> control<00:02:06.350> as<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:06.619> see

right<00:02:06.770> now<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.609> another<00:02:07.880> game<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.679> my<00:02:09.679> team

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
right now on another game and my team

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.490 
right now on another game and my team
just<00:02:10.399> couldn't<00:02:10.789> could<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.690> all<00:02:11.900> my<00:02:12.050> blogs<00:02:12.200> so

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
just couldn't could have all my blogs so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.050 
just couldn't could have all my blogs so
we<00:02:12.590> got<00:02:12.739> out<00:02:12.890> cap<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.430> we<00:02:13.550> were<00:02:13.670> pushed<00:02:13.970> back

we got out cap and we were pushed back

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.940 
we got out cap and we were pushed back
into<00:02:14.300> our<00:02:14.480> spot<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:15.319> was<00:02:15.440> probably<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.769> only

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
into our spot that was probably the only

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.589 
into our spot that was probably the only
time<00:02:16.069> when<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.670> killstreaks<00:02:17.090> became<00:02:17.450> you

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
time when the killstreaks became you

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.440 
time when the killstreaks became you
know<00:02:17.629> a<00:02:17.720> little<00:02:18.080> overpowered<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.670> other<00:02:20.239> than

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
know a little overpowered but other than

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.089 
know a little overpowered but other than
that<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.810> doesn't<00:02:21.049> really<00:02:21.230> seem<00:02:21.650> like<00:02:21.680> they

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
that it doesn't really seem like they

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.610 
that it doesn't really seem like they
were<00:02:22.160> too<00:02:22.459> bad<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> mean<00:02:24.110> I'm<00:02:24.260> completely

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
were too bad so I mean I'm completely

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.100 
were too bad so I mean I'm completely
fine<00:02:25.040> with<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.549> yeah<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:26.930> happy

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
fine with that and yeah I'm really happy

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.130 
fine with that and yeah I'm really happy
other<00:02:27.830> than<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.129> I've<00:02:28.459> been<00:02:28.489> playing<00:02:29.330> I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
other than that I've been playing I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.690 
other than that I've been playing I
think<00:02:30.349> mainly<00:02:30.560> three<00:02:30.950> games<00:02:31.190> i<00:02:31.430> think<00:02:31.640> i

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
think mainly three games i think i

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.400 
think mainly three games i think i
played<00:02:31.760> sector<00:02:32.420> control<00:02:32.720> which<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.079> this<00:02:33.230> one

played sector control which is this one
a<00:02:34.220> hotspot<00:02:35.060> which<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:36.079> rush

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
a hotspot which is like the the rush

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.640 
a hotspot which is like the the rush
very<00:02:36.680> shot<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:38.060> know<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.900> battlefield<00:02:39.380> 3

or something like that i am in medal of
honor<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.140> described<00:03:00.799> it<00:03:00.920> as<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> back<00:03:01.849> on

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
honor and I I described it as a back on

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.180 
honor and I I described it as a back on
my<00:03:02.120> search<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.599> destroy<00:03:02.720> combined<00:03:03.500> with<00:03:03.650> i

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
my search and destroy combined with i

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.009 
my search and destroy combined with i
think<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.760> was<00:03:04.819> capture<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.299> flag<00:03:05.510> and

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
think it was capture the flag and

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.319 
think it was capture the flag and
overall<00:03:06.319> that<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:07.130> is<00:03:07.280> fun<00:03:07.790> if<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.090> haven't

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
overall that it is fun if you haven't

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.670 
overall that it is fun if you haven't
played<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.690> i<00:03:08.780> would<00:03:08.930> highly<00:03:09.109> suggest<00:03:09.260> playing

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
played it i would highly suggest playing

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.099 
played it i would highly suggest playing
it<00:03:09.859> but<00:03:09.950> keep<00:03:10.130> in<00:03:10.220> mind<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:11.180> not<00:03:11.269> gonna<00:03:11.690> be<00:03:11.900> as

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
it but keep in mind it's not gonna be as

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.740 
it but keep in mind it's not gonna be as
chaotic<00:03:13.040> as<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:14.030> know<00:03:14.120> let's<00:03:14.329> say<00:03:14.450> sector

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
chaotic as you know let's say sector

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.960 
chaotic as you know let's say sector
control<00:03:15.139> or<00:03:15.470> hotspot<00:03:16.250> or<00:03:16.280> any<00:03:16.609> other<00:03:16.819> other

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
maps just because there's no response so

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.890 
maps just because there's no response so
keep<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.849> mind<00:03:19.970> there<00:03:20.269> are<00:03:20.299> no<00:03:20.569> response

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
sensitivity was really low or something

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.569 
sensitivity was really low or something
but<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.230> was<00:04:09.319> really<00:04:09.709> hard<00:04:09.950> for<00:04:10.010> me<00:04:10.189> to<00:04:10.310> turn

the
the<00:04:11.610> actual<00:04:11.909> switch<00:04:12.180> filleted<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.840> know<00:04:12.930> to

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989

those crayon boxes are one of those

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.379 
those crayon boxes are one of those
proximity<00:04:19.049> mines<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.739> like<00:04:19.949> Joe<00:04:20.340> Webb<00:04:21.030> give

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
proximity mines that like Joe Webb give

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.140 
proximity mines that like Joe Webb give
of<00:04:21.959> stuff<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.889> basically<00:04:23.400> what<00:04:23.610> what<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.030> is

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
of stuff and basically what what it is

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.850 
of stuff and basically what what it is
it's<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.509> it's<00:04:25.020> like<00:04:25.080> approximately<00:04:25.680> mind

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
it's it's it's like approximately mind

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.680 
it's it's it's like approximately mind
so<00:04:26.039> if<00:04:26.100> someone<00:04:26.310> walks<00:04:26.669> near<00:04:27.000> and/or<00:04:27.360> trips

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
so if someone walks near and/or trips

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.659 
so if someone walks near and/or trips
one<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.960> those<00:04:28.050> wires<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.500> blows<00:04:28.770> up<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.280> it

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
one of those wires it blows up and it

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.730 
one of those wires it blows up and it
might<00:04:30.090> kill<00:04:30.600> them<00:04:30.840> but<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.350> know<00:04:31.410> depending

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
might kill them but you know depending

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.480 
might kill them but you know depending
on<00:04:31.860> how<00:04:31.949> closely<00:04:32.220> are<00:04:32.460> it'll<00:04:32.729> duh<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.840> guess<00:04:34.710> do

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
on how closely are it'll duh I guess do

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.499 
on how closely are it'll duh I guess do
different<00:04:35.789> amount<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.030> damage<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.389> right

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
different amount of damage so right

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.320 
different amount of damage so right

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
don't really think it's in the way too

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.310 
don't really think it's in the way too
much<00:04:59.250> i<00:04:59.580> like<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> i<00:05:00.360> like<00:05:00.630> how<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.780> killfeed

much i like the i like how the killfeed
is<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.560> lot<00:05:01.889> faster<00:05:02.130> like<00:05:03.030> compared<00:05:03.810> to

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
is a lot faster like compared to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.900 
is a lot faster like compared to
battlefield<00:05:04.320> 3<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:05.250> kill<00:05:05.490> feed<00:05:05.639> is<00:05:05.759> like

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
battlefield 3 the kill feed is like

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.210 
battlefield 3 the kill feed is like
extremely<00:05:06.479> slow<00:05:06.870> I'm<00:05:07.320> pretty<00:05:07.590> like<00:05:07.830> for<00:05:08.130> an

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
extremely slow I'm pretty like for an

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.159 
extremely slow I'm pretty like for an
example<00:05:08.250> let's<00:05:08.970> say<00:05:09.120> x<00:05:09.300> pac<00:05:09.479> leaves<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.990> game

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
example let's say x pac leaves the game

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.469 
example let's say x pac leaves the game
I<00:05:10.470> could<00:05:11.190> still<00:05:11.430> see<00:05:11.580> him<00:05:11.729> getting<00:05:11.940> kills<00:05:12.270> in

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
I could still see him getting kills in

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.089 
I could still see him getting kills in
the<00:05:12.570> kill<00:05:12.750> I'd<00:05:12.960> like<00:05:13.229> five<00:05:13.620> minutes<00:05:13.680> after

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
the kill I'd like five minutes after

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.700 
the kill I'd like five minutes after
that's<00:05:14.430> left<00:05:14.669> like<00:05:14.910> it's<00:05:15.449> that<00:05:15.659> slow<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.320> don't

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
that's left like it's that slow I don't

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.810 
that's left like it's that slow I don't
know<00:05:16.770> maybe<00:05:16.919> it's<00:05:17.159> not<00:05:17.250> that<00:05:17.460> slow<00:05:17.669> i'm

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
know maybe it's not that slow i'm

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.490 
know maybe it's not that slow i'm
probably<00:05:18.030> exaggerating<00:05:18.630> but<00:05:18.780> in<00:05:19.020> Medal<00:05:19.470> of

the<00:06:46.720> VoIP<00:06:47.350> in<00:06:47.560> this<00:06:47.770> game<00:06:47.949> is<00:06:48.130> kind<00:06:48.430> of<00:06:48.550> kind<00:06:48.789> of

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
the VoIP in this game is kind of kind of

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.020 
the VoIP in this game is kind of kind of
iffy<00:06:49.650> given<00:06:50.650> that<00:06:50.680> it<00:06:50.860> is<00:06:50.949> pc<00:06:51.430> pc<00:06:51.699> and

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
iffy given that it is pc pc and

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.550 
iffy given that it is pc pc and
religious<00:06:52.479> about<00:06:52.630> pc<00:06:52.930> players<00:06:53.139> but<00:06:53.349> i<00:06:53.380> think

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
religious about pc players but i think

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.779 
religious about pc players but i think
pc<00:06:53.830> players<00:06:54.009> I'm<00:06:54.160> were<00:06:54.250> content<00:06:54.699> with

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
pc players I'm were content with

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.550 
pc players I'm were content with
themselves<00:06:55.360> or<00:06:55.810> you<00:06:56.020> know<00:06:56.110> that<00:06:56.289> they're<00:06:56.440> more

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
themselves or you know that they're more

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.439 
themselves or you know that they're more
personal<00:06:57.130> I<00:06:57.220> guess<00:06:57.370> you<00:06:57.460> could<00:06:57.520> say<00:06:57.699> compared

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
personal I guess you could say compared

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:59.580 
personal I guess you could say compared
to<00:06:58.479> like<00:06:58.599> you<00:06:58.720> know<00:06:58.750> the<00:06:58.900> xbox<00:06:59.320> is<00:06:59.470> in

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
to like you know the xbox is in

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.290 
to like you know the xbox is in
PlayStation<00:07:00.160> 2<00:07:00.340> because<00:07:00.699> they're<00:07:01.060> they're

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
PlayStation 2 because they're they're

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.900 
PlayStation 2 because they're they're
used<00:07:01.509> to<00:07:01.599> having<00:07:01.660> VoIP<00:07:02.349> we're<00:07:03.190> really<00:07:03.610> not

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
used to having VoIP we're really not

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.370 
used to having VoIP we're really not
that<00:07:04.180> much<00:07:04.389> I<00:07:04.539> mean<00:07:04.660> I<00:07:04.690> think<00:07:04.810> the<00:07:05.020> only<00:07:05.139> game

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
that much I mean I think the only game

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.279 
that much I mean I think the only game
that<00:07:05.410> I<00:07:05.590> truly<00:07:06.070> think<00:07:06.340> VoIP<00:07:06.820> is<00:07:07.060> enabled<00:07:07.570> is<00:07:08.020> in

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289 
that I truly think VoIP is enabled is in

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:10.589 
that I truly think VoIP is enabled is in
counter-strike<00:07:09.070> in<00:07:09.520> tf2<00:07:09.910> and<00:07:10.090> those<00:07:10.330> are<00:07:10.449> two

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
counter-strike in tf2 and those are two

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:11.879 
counter-strike in tf2 and those are two
different<00:07:10.630> communities<00:07:11.289> that<00:07:11.440> probably<00:07:11.770> will

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
different communities that probably will

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.219 
different communities that probably will
never<00:07:12.039> ever<00:07:12.250> play<00:07:12.550> medal<00:07:12.729> of<00:07:12.849> honor<00:07:13.030> so<00:07:13.570> yeah<00:07:14.199> I

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
never ever play medal of honor so yeah I

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:16.260 
never ever play medal of honor so yeah I
don't<00:07:14.500> know<00:07:14.590> it<00:07:14.800> seems<00:07:15.039> out<00:07:15.160> of<00:07:15.190> place<00:07:15.310> for<00:07:16.090> now

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
don't know it seems out of place for now

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.120 
don't know it seems out of place for now
because<00:07:16.570> people<00:07:17.110> don't<00:07:17.500> really<00:07:17.800> like<00:07:17.979> to<00:07:18.099> talk

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
because people don't really like to talk

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.560
