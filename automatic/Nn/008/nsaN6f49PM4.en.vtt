00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.790
 the fight for power is a battlefield 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 there is a lobbyist of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 past the energy turnaround 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.040
 want to stop the money 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 simply to earn it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.140
 I can burn fossil fuels 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.270
 Do not listen anymore, they look like that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390
 Everything breaks and the wheel breaks 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.130
 That's the way it is and I wonder 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.539
 where is the intelligence we we 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.160
 have the vulnerable bath 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 württemberg and there I met one 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 dedicated people actually 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.680
 he believed can with the pferdeäppel 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.630
 Industrial supply with electricity 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.489
 enforceable they have really, really 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.530
 witnessed how the world is changing 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 and that really surprises me 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.809
 Otherwise, we'll make clever ones years later 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.809
 impression 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.430
 Renewable energy is ready for the market and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.789
 we do not need a conventional one 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.789
 energies 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.220
 solar rays just come up 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.410
 earth surface and I do not have to 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.150
 wars lead to this resource of 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.270
 solar radiation available to me 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.270
 do 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.510
 building systems is you the major 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 strategy for building the authoritative cheese 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.340
 to extreme problems 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.440
 one has only responsibility for that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.230
 what you do but also what you do 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.300
 then lets go we have to change 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.990
 and if you are in 100 or 200 years 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.190
 adjust 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.190
 then the earth is broken 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.710
 I think it's just global 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.720
 revolution with 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.720
 people say it does not go on like that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.560
 and it's the fire burning in me and 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.860
 I thought it in the frame of mine 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.860
 possibilities
