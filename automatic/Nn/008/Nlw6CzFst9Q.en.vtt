00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
lining and I started doing that and I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
lining and I started doing that and I
felt<00:01:11.700> there's<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.450> something<00:01:12.720> missing<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
I moved on to the next level which was
incorporating<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> Gundam<00:01:16.860> markers

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
incorporating the use of Gundam markers

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.789 
incorporating the use of Gundam markers
and<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.210> bought<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> set<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> basic<00:01:19.320> Gundam

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
colors for Gundam markers and I ended up

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.700 
colors for Gundam markers and I ended up
just<00:01:23.820> using<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.180> mainly<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.659> touch-up<00:01:25.259> markers

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
just using a mainly as touch-up markers

like I didn't really paint parts i just
touched<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.780> nut<00:01:27.990> marks<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:30.079> that<00:01:31.079> still

because<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.570> touching<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.350> doing

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
because just touching it up or doing

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
because just touching it up or doing
some<00:01:49.740> minor<00:01:49.979> painting<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> application<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
some minor painting and application of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
some minor painting and application of
stickers<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:53.340> won't<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.579> enough<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.880> me<00:01:54.000> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
stickers just won't be enough for me I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
stickers just won't be enough for me I
will<00:01:54.420> want<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.840> give<00:01:55.380> them<00:01:55.500> full<00:01:55.680> paint<00:01:55.890> jobs

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
will want to give them full paint jobs

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.100 
will want to give them full paint jobs
and<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.850> basic<00:01:57.950> plan<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.310> to<00:02:00.270> start<00:02:00.540> off<00:02:00.719> with

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and my basic plan is to start off with

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.200 
and my basic plan is to start off with
cleans<00:02:01.920> parts<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:03.509> may<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.899> lightly<00:02:04.229> sanded

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
cleans parts that may be lightly sanded

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
cleans parts that may be lightly sanded
or<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.469> probably<00:02:07.619> better<00:02:07.890> just

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
or or actually it's probably better just

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.430 
or or actually it's probably better just
to<00:02:08.640> clean<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> parts<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.569> then<00:02:10.020> use<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to clean the parts up and then use a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.720 
to clean the parts up and then use a
base<00:02:10.920> coat<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.310> prime

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
base coat of prime

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.119 
base coat of prime
and<00:02:12.269> then<00:02:12.599> after<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:12.989> then<00:02:13.409> apply<00:02:13.680> my<00:02:13.860> paint

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
and then after that then apply my paint

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.890 
and then after that then apply my paint
and<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:14.640> after<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> paint's<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.750> been

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and then after the paint's have been

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.470 
and then after the paint's have been
cured<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.409> dried<00:02:16.680> properly<00:02:17.099> i<00:02:17.519> also<00:02:18.060> want<00:02:18.390> to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
cured and dried properly i also want to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.570 
cured and dried properly i also want to
apply<00:02:18.720> some<00:02:18.959> top<00:02:19.170> coat<00:02:19.200> now<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.159> thing<00:02:20.190> I've

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
apply some top coat now one thing I've

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.820 
apply some top coat now one thing I've
noticed<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.060> isn't<00:02:21.599> really<00:02:21.659> mentioned<00:02:22.260> at

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
noticed that isn't really mentioned at

or model kit areas however I've come

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.140 
or model kit areas however I've come
across<00:02:45.569> more<00:02:46.049> concerned<00:02:46.410> about<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.829> in<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
across more concerned about this in the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.580 
across more concerned about this in the
Transformers<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> other<00:02:48.840> action<00:02:49.260> figure

Transformers and other action figure

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.400 
Transformers and other action figure
collecting<00:02:50.280> communities<00:02:50.700> out<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:50.970> because

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
collecting communities out there because

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.770 
collecting communities out there because
for<00:02:52.410> example<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:52.859> some<00:02:53.040> people<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.519> had

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
for example if some people have had

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.849 
for example if some people have had
transformers<00:02:54.780> with<00:02:54.930> white<00:02:55.140> plastic<00:02:55.650> pieces

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
transformers with white plastic pieces

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.970 
transformers with white plastic pieces
that<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.400> discolored<00:02:56.940> under<00:02:57.209> sunlight<00:02:57.980> over

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that have discolored under sunlight over

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.920 
that have discolored under sunlight over
time<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.459> I<00:03:00.150> think<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.420> same<00:03:00.629> thing<00:03:00.840> could

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
time and I think the same thing could

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.500 
time and I think the same thing could
probably<00:03:01.170> happen<00:03:01.410> with<00:03:01.859> the<00:03:02.160> abs<00:03:02.910> plastics

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
probably happen with the abs plastics

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.930 
probably happen with the abs plastics
and<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.109> polystyrene<00:03:04.560> plastics<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.459> are

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and the polystyrene plastics that are

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.509 
and the polystyrene plastics that are
used<00:03:06.299> in<00:03:06.450> model<00:03:06.810> kits<00:03:07.019> commonly<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.370> do

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
used in model kits commonly and so I do

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.089 
used in model kits commonly and so I do
plan<00:03:08.879> on<00:03:08.910> using<00:03:09.209> top<00:03:09.599> coat<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.410> but<00:03:10.709> also<00:03:10.920> I

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
plan on using top coat but but also I

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.710 
plan on using top coat but but also I
want<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.430> look<00:03:11.579> for<00:03:11.790> top<00:03:11.970> coats<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.299> provide

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
want to look for top coats that provide

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.509 
want to look for top coats that provide
UV<00:03:12.930> protection<00:03:14.629> I<00:03:15.629> think<00:03:16.019> mr.<00:03:16.470> super<00:03:16.919> clear

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
UV protection I think mr. super clear

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.240 
UV protection I think mr. super clear
has<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> variation<00:03:18.780> where<00:03:18.959> it's<00:03:19.049> like<00:03:19.169> has<00:03:19.859> UV

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
has a variation where it's like has UV

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.309 
has a variation where it's like has UV
protection<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.030> might<00:03:21.180> use<00:03:21.359> mr.<00:03:22.019> super

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
protection it so I might use mr. super

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.050 
protection it so I might use mr. super
clear<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.769> can<00:03:22.889> find<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.280> or<00:03:23.790> other

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
clear if I can find it or other

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.539 
clear if I can find it or other
variations<00:03:24.980> additionally<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.010> do<00:03:26.190> plan<00:03:26.489> on

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
variations additionally I do plan on

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.110 
variations additionally I do plan on
trying<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.389> krylon<00:03:28.169> fusion<00:03:28.200> paints<00:03:29.120> because

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
trying out krylon fusion paints because

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.110 
trying out krylon fusion paints because
it's<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.959> hear<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.519> supposed<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it's I hear that it's supposed to be a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.780 
it's I hear that it's supposed to be a
formula<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.109> bonds<00:03:34.709> with<00:03:34.859> plastic<00:03:35.400> well

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
formula that bonds with plastic well

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.210 
formula that bonds with plastic well
it's<00:03:36.329> made<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.660> bond<00:03:37.079> with<00:03:37.169> plastic<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:37.950> maybe

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
it's made to bond with plastic so maybe

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.030 
it's made to bond with plastic so maybe
I<00:03:38.310> could<00:03:38.519> skip<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.819> primer<00:03:39.239> stage<00:03:39.739> or<00:03:40.739> if<00:03:40.859> not

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
I could skip the primer stage or if not

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.710 
I could skip the primer stage or if not
doesn't<00:03:41.459> matter<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:41.910> I'm<00:03:42.269> interested<00:03:42.510> in

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
doesn't matter but I'm interested in

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.839 
doesn't matter but I'm interested in
that<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.959> also<00:03:43.109> it's<00:03:43.620> formulated<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.489> be<00:03:44.669> an

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
that and also it's formulated to be an

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.150 
that and also it's formulated to be an
outdoor<00:03:45.329> paint<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:46.319> supposed<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.620> be<00:03:46.739> put<00:03:47.069> on

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
outdoor paint it's supposed to be put on

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.520 
outdoor paint it's supposed to be put on
like<00:03:47.400> lawn<00:03:47.669> furniture<00:03:47.970> for<00:03:48.419> example<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.500> I

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
like lawn furniture for example so I

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.259 
like lawn furniture for example so I
think<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.190> kind<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.519> paint<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.030> can

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
think it's a kind of paint that can

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.259 
think it's a kind of paint that can
withstand<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:52.200> constant<00:03:53.130> UV<00:03:53.370> exposure<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:54.120> if<00:03:54.209> i

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
withstand a constant UV exposure so if i

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.270 
withstand a constant UV exposure so if i
use<00:03:54.510> chronolog<00:03:55.019> fusion<00:03:55.349> paint<00:03:55.560> for<00:03:55.739> example<00:03:56.129> i

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
use chronolog fusion paint for example i

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.270 
use chronolog fusion paint for example i
think<00:03:56.879> i<00:03:57.030> can<00:03:57.090> avoid<00:03:57.540> using<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:58.260> UV<00:03:58.829> treated

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
think i can avoid using a UV treated

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.759 
think i can avoid using a UV treated
topcoat<00:03:59.879> if<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.419> just<00:04:00.599> use<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.720> standard<00:04:01.109> topcoat

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
topcoat if I just use a standard topcoat

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.059 
topcoat if I just use a standard topcoat
to<00:04:02.310> reach<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.299> desired<00:04:03.480> finish<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.230> want<00:04:04.500> which

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
to reach the desired finish I want which

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.800 
to reach the desired finish I want which
is<00:04:05.099> usually<00:04:05.519> going<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.669> be<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.790> map<00:04:06.209> or<00:04:06.419> a<00:04:06.480> flat

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
is usually going to be a map or a flat

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.319 
is usually going to be a map or a flat
finish<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.579> could<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.120> use<00:04:09.239> a

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
finish I think I could just use a

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.740 
finish I think I could just use a
standard<00:04:09.599> top<00:04:10.230> coat<00:04:11.000> now<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.120> far<00:04:12.269> as<00:04:12.329> Gundam

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
standard top coat now as far as Gundam

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.839 
standard top coat now as far as Gundam
markers<00:04:13.109> and<00:04:13.260> know<00:04:13.440> how<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:13.859> use<00:04:13.919> them<00:04:14.280> like

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
markers and know how do I use them like

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.520 
markers and know how do I use them like
I<00:04:15.000> said<00:04:15.180> earlier<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.569> just<00:04:15.840> basically<00:04:16.169> use<00:04:16.380> them

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
I said earlier I just basically use them

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.319 
I said earlier I just basically use them
to<00:04:16.650> touch<00:04:16.799> up<00:04:17.010> nub<00:04:17.190> marks<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.699> I<00:04:17.820> actually<00:04:18.030> it

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
to touch up nub marks and I actually it

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.840 
to touch up nub marks and I actually it
to<00:04:18.449> be<00:04:18.510> honest<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:18.989> haven't<00:04:19.440> used

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
to be honest I haven't used

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.190 
to be honest I haven't used
done<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.060> markers<00:04:20.450> in<00:04:20.600> months<00:04:20.900> now<00:04:21.050> I<00:04:21.080> just

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
done the markers in months now I just

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.500 
done the markers in months now I just
don't<00:04:21.530> find<00:04:21.770> the<00:04:21.890> use<00:04:22.070> for<00:04:22.280> them<00:04:22.490> because<00:04:22.970> you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
don't find the use for them because you

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.640 
don't find the use for them because you
know<00:04:23.570> since<00:04:23.810> I'm<00:04:23.900> planning<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.350> paint<00:04:24.530> the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
know since I'm planning to paint the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.070 
know since I'm planning to paint the
model<00:04:24.890> kits<00:04:25.220> there's<00:04:26.030> no<00:04:26.180> use<00:04:26.450> for<00:04:26.720> me<00:04:26.750> just<00:04:27.020> to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
model kits there's no use for me just to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.470 
model kits there's no use for me just to
simply<00:04:27.440> paint<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.280> part<00:04:28.550> or<00:04:28.790> touch<00:04:29.000> up<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.240> part

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
simply paint a part or touch up a part

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.610 
simply paint a part or touch up a part
if<00:04:29.600> it's<00:04:29.720> going<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.930> be<00:04:29.990> covered<00:04:30.260> by<00:04:30.350> paint

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
if it's going to be covered by paint
