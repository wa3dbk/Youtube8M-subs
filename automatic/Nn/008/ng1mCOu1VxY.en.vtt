00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.970 
re-explain part of my pleated skirt
tutorial<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.750> realized<00:00:04.259> that<00:00:04.350> when<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.500> made<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
tutorial I realized that when I made the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.559 
tutorial I realized that when I made the
tutorial<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.609> didn't<00:00:05.819> explain<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.240> part<00:00:06.420> where

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
tutorial I didn't explain the part where

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.240 
tutorial I didn't explain the part where
we<00:00:06.600> find<00:00:06.870> out<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.140> width<00:00:07.290> very<00:00:07.560> well<00:00:07.770> using

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
we find out the width very well using

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.890 
we find out the width very well using
math<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:08.880> today<00:00:09.059> I'm<00:00:09.150> gonna<00:00:09.240> never<00:00:09.389> explain<00:00:09.750> it

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
math so today I'm gonna never explain it

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.660 
math so today I'm gonna never explain it
keep<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.500> mind<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.830> do<00:00:10.950> use<00:00:11.219> imperial

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
keep in mind that I do use imperial

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.640 
keep in mind that I do use imperial
units<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.630> made<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.900> original<00:00:13.019> tutorial

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
units and I made the original tutorial

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.870 
units and I made the original tutorial
using<00:00:13.980> imperial<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.490> I'm<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.759> go<00:00:14.820> ahead

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
using imperial so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.430 
using imperial so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.179> here<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:15.599> if<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.870> use<00:00:16.020> metric

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
and do that here but if you use metric

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.630 
and do that here but if you use metric
go<00:00:16.590> ahead<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.830> use<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.220> process<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
go ahead and use that the process is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.310 
go ahead and use that the process is
exactly<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.060> same<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.390> easier<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.810> units<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
exactly the same just easier on units a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
exactly the same just easier on units a
quick<00:00:20.070> reminder<00:00:20.279> about<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> length<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.119> your

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
on to the width so to find out how much

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.359 
on to the width so to find out how much
fabric<00:00:28.680> we're<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> need<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.310> the

entire width of our skirt we're going to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.179 
entire width of our skirt we're going to
need<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> find<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.990> few<00:00:31.140> numbers<00:00:31.439> first<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
need to find a few numbers first the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.290 
need to find a few numbers first the
first<00:00:32.369> thing<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> need<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.120> find

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
first thing we're going to need to find

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030 
first thing we're going to need to find
is<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> width<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.960> our<00:00:34.110> pleat<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
is the width of our pleat so make a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.680 
is the width of our pleat so make a
pleat<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.340> way<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.390> then

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
pleat the way you like it and then

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.610 
pleat the way you like it and then
measure<00:00:36.870> how<00:00:37.110> wide<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
measure how wide it is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.490 
measure how wide it is
this<00:00:38.190> plane<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.430> three<00:00:38.790> inches<00:00:39.120> wide<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> after

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
this plane is three inches wide so after

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.720 
this plane is three inches wide so after
you<00:00:40.590> find<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:40.920> wide<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.489> ahead<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you find out how wide it is go ahead and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.770 
you find out how wide it is go ahead and
write<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.850> number<00:00:42.270> down<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:42.690> we're

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
write that number down because we're

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
write that number down because we're
going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:43.050> using<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.410> again<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.399> next

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
going to be using it again the next

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.770 
going to be using it again the next
number<00:00:44.820> you're<00:00:44.910> gonna<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> find<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
number you're gonna want to find is the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
number you're gonna want to find is the
fullness<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.410> pleat<00:00:46.739> now<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> fullness

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is the amount of fabric that the pleat

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.170 
is the amount of fabric that the pleat
takes<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.440> now<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> find<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.640> how<00:00:50.730> high<00:00:51.000> your

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
takes up now to find out how high your

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
takes up now to find out how high your
pleat<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> mark<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> beginning<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.710> end<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
chalk some of these pins here so now

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.750 
chalk some of these pins here so now
that<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.199> mark<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.620> ahead<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.859> unpin<00:00:59.489> your

we<00:01:55.400> have<00:01:55.520> 8<00:01:56.140> times<00:01:57.140> 3<00:01:57.680> equals<00:01:58.660> 24<00:01:59.660> inches<00:01:59.990> and

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
we have 8 times 3 equals 24 inches and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
out but that doesn't tell us how much

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.870 
out but that doesn't tell us how much
width<00:02:14.750> we're<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.380> need<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.890> end<00:02:16.040> so

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
width we're going to need in the end so

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.580 
width we're going to need in the end so
to<00:02:16.970> get<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.330> type<00:02:17.690> measurement<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.350> take

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
to get that type measurement you take

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
to get that type measurement you take
that<00:02:18.770> date<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.990> multiply<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.140> by<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.350> 10

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
that date you multiply that by the 10

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.520 
that date you multiply that by the 10
because<00:02:23.270> that's<00:02:23.450> how<00:02:23.540> fuller<00:02:23.870> pleats<00:02:24.200> are<00:02:24.380> so

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.080 
you multiply the number of pleats you
have<00:02:26.300> by<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.110> fullness<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.709> your<00:02:27.890> pleat<00:02:28.130> 8

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
times 10 equals 80 inches plus one it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.690 
times 10 equals 80 inches plus one it
for<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.580> zipper<00:02:35.770> 81<00:02:36.770> inches<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:37.580> our
