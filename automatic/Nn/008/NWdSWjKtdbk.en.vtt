because<00:01:06.509> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.659> way<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.899> gearbox<00:01:07.259> is

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
because of the way the gearbox is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.139 
because of the way the gearbox is
compared<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.100> other<00:01:08.250> bikes<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.880> roll

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
compared to these other bikes they roll

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.630 
compared to these other bikes they roll
it<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.619> race<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.399> go<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it and in the race I have to go all the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
it and in the race I have to go all the
way<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> first<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:12.990> take

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
way down to first and so I have to take

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
way down to first and so I have to take
a<00:01:13.140> totally<00:01:13.470> different<00:01:13.740> line<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:15.030> know

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
a totally different line but you know

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.429 
a totally different line but you know
obviously<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.689> working<00:01:15.929> out<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.289> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
obviously it's working out all right the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.649 
obviously it's working out all right the
time<00:01:16.649> is<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:16.979> similar<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:18.479> make<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
time is pretty similar and just make a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
time is pretty similar and just make a
dude<00:01:22.039> corkscrew<00:01:23.039> is<00:01:23.100> definitely<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> favorite

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
dude corkscrew is definitely a favorite

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.880 
dude corkscrew is definitely a favorite
corner<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.539> because<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.959> its<00:01:25.080> weirdness<00:01:25.649> you

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
corner just because of its weirdness you

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
ridge coming up so you go break up a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.320 
ridge coming up so you go break up a
hill<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:31.979> down<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> hill<00:01:32.580> into<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.149> and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
hill and then down a hill into it and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.539 
hill and then down a hill into it and
then<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.929> turn<00:01:34.110> left<00:01:34.409> 90<00:01:34.860> degrees<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.459> then

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
then you turn left 90 degrees and then

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.999 
then you turn left 90 degrees and then
you<00:01:36.149> can't<00:01:36.330> see<00:01:36.539> anything<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:37.709> supposed

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
to turn off of this right-hander and you

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:41.990 
to turn off of this right-hander and you
can't<00:01:40.890> see<00:01:41.069> where<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.190> supposed<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.580> so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it's very unique and fun but the way

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.809 
it's very unique and fun but the way
that<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> right-hander<00:01:46.289> is<00:01:46.319> its<00:01:46.920> bank<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.759> you

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
that the right-hander is its bank so you

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.609 
that the right-hander is its bank so you
can<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.299> dig<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.319> get<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.470> lot<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
can really dig in there and get a lot of

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.790 
can really dig in there and get a lot of
traction<00:01:50.000> get<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.179> of<00:01:51.209> there<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.629> so<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.739> a

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
traction get out of there and so it's a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.499 
traction get out of there and so it's a
lot<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> fun<00:01:53.099> to<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.550> get<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:53.879> the<00:01:54.000> gas<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.479 
lot of fun to just get on the gas and
you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.050> feel<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.259> bike<00:01:55.530> flexing<00:01:56.160> under<00:01:56.369> all

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
you can feel the bike flexing under all

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:58.170 
you can feel the bike flexing under all
the<00:01:56.640> g-forces<00:01:57.330> loads

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
the g-forces loads

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.570 
the g-forces loads
that's<00:01:58.960> just<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.260> really<00:01:59.470> fun<00:01:59.500> corner<00:02:00.010> they're

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
started off with basically a bike out of

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.390 
started off with basically a bike out of
a<00:02:18.129> crate<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:19.599> we've<00:02:19.840> made<00:02:20.049> it<00:02:20.170> into<00:02:20.500> that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
a crate and now we've made it into that

a crate and now we've made it into that
geico<00:02:21.549> yellow<00:02:22.060> maybe<00:02:22.299> it's<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.840> little<00:02:23.409> bit<00:02:23.590> of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
geico yellow maybe it's a little bit of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.260 
geico yellow maybe it's a little bit of
gold
