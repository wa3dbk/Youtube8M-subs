00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:11.110
 and good 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.110
 wrong 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 3 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.960
 back 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.650
 please 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.650
 no no 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 hello youtube friends like they've been 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.730
 in this new video that I bring you a 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.870
 small video of how to clone blocks of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.650
 various forms with the child model 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 craft using the btr track is very 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.420
 simple no more than you need to have 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.980
 minimum one block of what you want 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.899
 to explore 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.899
 Now I'm going to teach you with 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.200
 first we need to have the blockade 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.510
 at least what we want to prove already 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.970
 be 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.000
 block of block network network block are 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.130
 gold block of iron and so on 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.120
 try using several blocks of 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.120
 different max 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.350
 of minerals like the diesel bumper show 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.200
 you can not get 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.080
 know the mother 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.020
 with this guy 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.340
 Now if you received, I did not know that you were resisting 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 the concrete of the explosions 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:58.909
 in this blog various blocks for 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.240
 move I say you have to put each one 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.899
 you need different blocks that are not 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.209
 of the mods for example this one that 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.209
 we feel 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 Amen 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.590
 the changes 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.249
 to espanyol to better understand how 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.249
 there is the matter 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.000
 the tin block and the copper block 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.370
 It does not work I tried it but you can use 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 emerald blocks iron block 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.750
 blue pencil block and block 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.170
 diamond what subtracted a block of 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.170
 carbon 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.930
 when another any block that is of the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.930
 Minecraft base obsidian 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.250
 you can also clone the clay 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.250
 for him 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.360
 also the rose tom can also be 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.360
 die 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.270
 carbon 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.530
 the iron 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.980
 good aguayo in one of cooper so that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.980
 see that it does not work 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.760
 also very good clay 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.060
 This is the stone or reinvigorated 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.060
 since 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.300
 the industry that I'm going to try to see if 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.140
 you can clone it, you have not tried 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.940
 it's not a mineral it's a compound by well 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.940
 say it more 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.810
 the woods I think you can also 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.810
 clone has not really tried 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.480
 we put the fuel 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.370
 and which comprise 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.989
 I 'm not sorry what you've looked at with those 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.989
 mothers find some charcoal 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.530
 I've lost with a coal is made 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.140
 since we have all train to 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.550
 beltrÃ¡n kids strike the track wilde 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.460
 kraft train 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.680
 we just open it in this position 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.080
 we put the tevez base block below 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.639
 of the lives obviously the ways and the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.009
 block that we want to clone for example 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.759
 I'm going to thunder here 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.759
 The coal coke coal network are diamond 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.810
 I'm going to put the close are then because 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.810
 I have to give fuel 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.230
 starts 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.550
 well I think there is some step 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.580
 preferably put only one what 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.580
 break 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.840
 but what laziness for the city 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.670
 redstone but good 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.670
 then I put it back the week 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.960
 the coal that I already know 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.590
 other blocks that can also be 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.610
 clone 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.610
 as in gold 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.180
 the tip of a link 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:52.180
 allows us now for this fund 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.180
 and that's it 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.980
 while for the now out there it's fine 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.980
 that 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.639
 peoples many channels responds to gold 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.170
 because the relationship replaced Juan 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.889
 west with rice 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.949
 Y 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:22.729
 it stops because we already have the blocks 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.729
 that from 1 only very good wave 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.270
 Yes now 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.210
 missing by 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.210
 and those that can not be cloned 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.370
 and it goes on its way without putting it because 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.090
 can not train us simply because 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.090
 About other modes 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:51.160
 same good 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.280
 but good so you can work so 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.510
 if you use survival mode like I do not 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.510
 I want to get you with the creative 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:06.820
 and make everything easier because 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.940
 beginning yes battles to start 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.010
 make the train and girls and scouts green 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.310
 having that would be much easier 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.310
 all 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.969
 then I would make other videos of how 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:27.080
 he has also managed to see the video that I have 

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:27.080
 fact 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.350
 they are trees of a bronze mod 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:37.310
 enchantment 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:39.990
 and I want to fire with a monster that 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:43.000
 it comes breaking these trees 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.680
 let's see if we get 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.070
 I say goodbye 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.120
 the question is that this the master 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.120
 I think it's not going to come out 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.060
 good 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.380
 that's all for today if you liked the 

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:06.270
 aic video subscribe and until the 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.270
 next see you
