00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 in the first half of 2010 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.480
 the story of this amazing fruit there was no conversation with its more 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.850
 important that we 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.850
 the next mine a customer molecule with two parts linked 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 When we drink the juice of the devil fruit the next mine goes through our 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.240
 digestive tract festival 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.770
 today dissolved dissolved in the liver liver of the painter but always sepal to the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.840
 our body of many of the essential nutrients we eat every two 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.680
 children should release a certain amount of this animal protein in the 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.699
 blood flow 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.840
 where it would be converted to scent nina 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.240
 substance trapped by proteins 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.860
 through the bloodstream it is transported to all tissues of the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.920
 body 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.220
 to understand what would happen if you know what you level the molecular-- 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.790
 for the next mine to become terminal 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.330
 subject above called by a stranger in cpi is required 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.619
 Yes, I will continue to default. 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.789
 the next mine 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.150
 connecting the two ends of the molecule 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 releasing the chain without use 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.870
 then this new structure merges happens on the hill a hormone 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.160
 previously produced in the brain when formed the molecule called stephenie 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.159
 meyer 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.610
 once the window formed it is simulated 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.990
 for many body proteins 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.050
 these proteins need to keep together to function properly 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.980
 there is specific space and certain proteins that allow them to narrate 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.860
 linear 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.610
 many of these proteins I am unable to perform any of their functions 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.760
 take over 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.750
 not all of our own need to end to work but many 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.159
 vital proteins that act as hormones antibodies enzymes 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.570
 we need to finish 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.639
 the surgery occurred per cent for the races that are 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.630
 without first responsibilities 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.930
 structure the hair 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.069
 lost the three proteins allow to make most of the structure of the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.440
 even the second cell itself allows the transport of 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.930
 important liquid nutrients allowing them to pass through the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.139
 by the memory in the air 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:29.990
 3rd 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.439
 sagemcom mormonism body proteins 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.100
 and with that capacity may not the whole process 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.100
 the only one at the molecular level-- 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.750
 as well as antibodies to support 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.690
 the immune system antibodies attack destructive invaders as 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.860
 also fine and disabled wines 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.810
 finally 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.980
 tives to public agents in the most facilitated all chemical production in the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.959
 our body our cells that are constantly broke and new 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.379
 chemical components are 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.780
 built protein systems that allow this to happen now 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.920
 we understand why after finishing close impose 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.530
 during our bodies we also know that natural supplies' for 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.850
 us through the food we ate because several people noticed the 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:16.169
 benefits 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.019
 with the regular use of fruit juice demon there are several reasons 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.139
 of the port that the body and zigic a supply and this of coruche hill one 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.200
 they return to the goal of soil micronutrients due to 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.249
 festivities his loved ones and the abusive use of him other via dutra are 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:33.449
 disabled 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.569
 diseases 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.389
 turnover or stressful life 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.809
 even aging will feel an increased need for protein 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:44.799
 to meet these needs 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.769
 and keep your body healthy 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.049
 we can increase the supply of protectionism and noni juice for 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.560
 overcome the nefarious effects illuminating suites to restore it healthy 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.909
 ability to assimilate proteins 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.639
 plants and humans can finish well prepared plants 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.540
 use to finish differently some plants have ended as 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.609
 way of storing the subway would say that they need to grow to keep 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.359
 families for each plants added molecules 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.540
 the girl's aunt 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.700
 this group around her 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.630
 so that it does not dissolve 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.820
 it does not save itself thus becoming a chemical component to the kangoo art 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.469
 many of these alkaloids 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:30.499
 are drugs or drugs exist more than 10 thousand each by some unknown 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:35.369
 of them including catarina cocaine active heroin and morphine crime plants 

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:39.329
 So Caloric Is Stabilized Girl Style There Must Have Been Tragedy That 

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:43.879
 works efficiently for plants but problems occur when 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.949
 that we have saved an obsession we have introduced our bodies 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.319
 for example if you smoke a cigarette 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.319
 large quantitative team cast in the body 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.929
 although nicotine is native to the tobacco plant by the cblc positively 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:03.879
 Jacobin's structure on proteins exposed 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.729
 assimilation of the old mine the proteins accept iguatemi pieces and 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:08.229
 marina 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.990
 what would they naturally want or talk about in reserve time and 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.639
 payment 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.240
 in place of the qualifiers 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.139
 the tip to active nicotine 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.810
 the actions of the protein likewise here the venus sisters and activate only that of 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.990
 less efficient and although nicotine is able to activate the 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.199
 wrong assimilation of nicotine serve to inhibit its efficiency if you 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.039
 continue smoking your fellow countrymen's cigarettes adapt to nicotine that 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.319
 slowly change the shape of the protein so that it can adapt 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.229
 the nicotine teams of heroines 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.229
 the role of ironies in the body has many other applications 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.379
 she works in two deep for anesthesia because she works with the company for fine 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.839
 are produced in the brain that to avoid pain they produce sensations of 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:59.849
 euphoria in two rows are soft produced in our bodies and are 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.259
 responsible for producing and saving 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.460
 as we predicted the liver is the main place 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.840
 the second largest storage place and the 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.219
 skin 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.919
 after finishing it is transformed into tironi in the rock the whole body 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.659
 and my leg 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.099
 has a considerable amount near the mine is necessary to 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.469
 maintain healthy scalp and hair while using the products 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.050
 Skin Care Hair Containing Next Mine 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.030
 any conditions to have hair travel have improvements 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.050
 we describe only some applications 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.300
 in this list of advantages 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.870
 in the afternoon with potential that illumination debt
