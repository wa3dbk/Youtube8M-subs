although young talents it's 45 million
too<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:37.950> obviously<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> pay<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
too much obviously we have to pay a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.719 
too much obviously we have to pay a
premium<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.320> they<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.250> we've<00:01:41.460> got<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
premium because they know we've got the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.130 
premium because they know we've got the
money<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.509> know<00:01:42.630> we've<00:01:42.780> got<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
money we know they know we've got it to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.929 
money we know they know we've got it to
spend<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
spend and it's just the way that the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.700 
spend and it's just the way that the
market<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.509> well<00:01:45.659> especially<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.500> English

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
market is as well especially for English

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.830 
market is as well especially for English
players<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.820> 45<00:01:48.240> million<00:01:48.420> pounds<00:01:48.720> in

comments below the update is though that

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.530 
comments below the update is though that
apparently<00:01:53.640> City<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> deal

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
apparently City want to get the deal

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
apparently City want to get the deal
done<00:01:54.570> before<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> pre-season<00:01:55.890> tour<00:01:56.219> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
done before the pre-season tour to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.300 
done before the pre-season tour to
Australia<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.689> thing<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:57.960> though<00:01:58.380> Liverpool

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
Australia the thing is though Liverpool

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
Australia the thing is though Liverpool
playing<00:01:59.909> brisbane<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.479> adelaide<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
playing brisbane and adelaide at the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.609 
playing brisbane and adelaide at the
same<00:02:01.860> time<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.610> city<00:02:02.939> are<00:02:03.630> also<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.200> brisbane

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
same time that city are also in brisbane

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.660 
same time that city are also in brisbane
and<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.659> impossible<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and so it's not impossible to think that

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.089 
and so it's not impossible to think that
maybe<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.000> deal<00:02:09.179> will<00:02:09.450> get<00:02:09.629> done<00:02:09.899> down<00:02:10.709> under

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
maybe the deal will get done down under

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.320 
maybe the deal will get done down under
in<00:02:11.250> Australia<00:02:12.080> they<00:02:13.080> could<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.530> medic

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
in Australia they could have the medic

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.640 
in Australia they could have the medic
melbourne<00:02:15.330> city<00:02:15.570> FC<00:02:15.780> they've<00:02:16.200> got<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
melbourne city FC they've got the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
reason why he doesn't have to sign

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.400 
reason why he doesn't have to sign
before<00:02:22.830> city<00:02:23.460> go<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.760> their<00:02:23.910> tour<00:02:24.150> maybe<00:02:24.900> when
