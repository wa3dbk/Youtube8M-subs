realize not everyone has a max cape but

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
realize not everyone has a max cape but
if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> could<00:01:23.310> bring<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.580> skill<00:01:23.880> cape<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.119> has

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
a pretty decent armor bonus as well

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
a pretty decent armor bonus as well
you're<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.390> want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> pretty

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you're going to want to have a pretty

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.840 
you're going to want to have a pretty
decent<00:01:28.979> armor<00:01:29.100> bonus<00:01:29.280> that's<00:01:29.610> why<00:01:29.729> I'd

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
decent armor bonus that's why I'd

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.940 
decent armor bonus that's why I'd
probably<00:01:30.060> recommend<00:01:30.420> gano<00:01:30.990> over<00:01:31.439> subjugation

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
probably recommend gano over subjugation

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370 
probably recommend gano over subjugation
but<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.540> my<00:01:33.720> stats<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
but just because of my stats and the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.780 
but just because of my stats and the
give<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:34.770> bringing<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.520> survive

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
give that I'm bringing I can survive

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
give that I'm bringing I can survive
pretty<00:01:36.090> well<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.450> subjugation<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
pretty well with subjugation and it

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.960 
ahead and do that and then you want to
go<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.349> the<00:03:09.560> glacier<00:03:09.920> cave<00:03:10.250> I'm<00:03:10.459> assuming<00:03:10.880> if

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
go to the glacier cave I'm assuming if

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.460 
go to the glacier cave I'm assuming if
you<00:03:11.060> looked<00:03:11.299> up<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.569> guide<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.019> probably

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
you looked up this guide you probably

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.110 
you looked up this guide you probably
already<00:03:12.709> know<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.220> quest<00:03:13.489> ritual<00:03:13.880> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
already know that the quest ritual the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.110 
already know that the quest ritual the
madera<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.599> required<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.200> kill<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> glaciers

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
madera is required to kill the glaciers

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.640 
madera is required to kill the glaciers
so<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.150> assume<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.780> probably<00:03:18.049> have<00:03:18.410> that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
so I assume that you probably have that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.650 
so I assume that you probably have that
done<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.370> anyway<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:20.359> want<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.540> make

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
done but anyway you just want to make

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.750 
done but anyway you just want to make
sure<00:03:20.720> your<00:03:21.019> momentum<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.620> activated<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.430> then

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
sure your momentum is activated and then

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.180 
sure your momentum is activated and then
you<00:03:22.880> want<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.120> overload<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:24.620> course<00:03:24.889> if<00:03:25.069> you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
you want to overload of course if you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.160 
you want to overload of course if you
brought<00:03:25.700> any<00:03:25.880> oars<00:03:26.209> such<00:03:26.600> as<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> penance

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170
