00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey what's up everybody buddy Blackford
here<00:00:02.669> with<00:00:02.879> another<00:00:03.060> After<00:00:03.480> Effects<00:00:03.780> cs6

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
here with another After Effects cs6

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.710 
here with another After Effects cs6
tutorial<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:05.130> I'm<00:00:05.580> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:06.000> teach<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.240> how

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
tutorial and I'm going to teach you how

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.910 
tutorial and I'm going to teach you how
to<00:00:06.750> use<00:00:07.639> enable<00:00:08.639> character<00:00:09.210> 3d<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:10.380> text

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
to use enable character 3d in your text

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.680 
to use enable character 3d in your text
options<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.580> make<00:00:11.759> things<00:00:12.000> like<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.440> here<00:00:13.519> so

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
options to make things like this here so

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.779 
options to make things like this here so
when<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.839> enable<00:00:16.139> per<00:00:16.529> character<00:00:16.859> 3d<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.609> get

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
when you enable per character 3d you get

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.529 
when you enable per character 3d you get
another<00:00:19.310> axis<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.820> work<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
another axis that you can work with and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.130 
another axis that you can work with and
that<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.890> z-axis<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.510> gives<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.779> like

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that is the z-axis and it gives you like

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.640 
that is the z-axis and it gives you like
a<00:00:26.070> different<00:00:26.820> kind<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.150> 3d<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.349> where

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a different kind of 3d going on where

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.230 
a different kind of 3d going on where
don't<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> camera<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
don't really need a camera and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.540 
don't really need a camera and
everything<00:00:30.300> which<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> pretty<00:00:31.380> nice<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.070> I'm

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
everything which is pretty nice so I'm

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
everything which is pretty nice so I'm
going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.450> showing<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> how<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> make

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
going to get to showing you how to make

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.069 
going to get to showing you how to make
something<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> let's<00:00:36.030> start<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
something like that and let's start so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.420 
something like that and let's start so
I'm<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> delete<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.770> my<00:00:37.950> text<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.370> I'm

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I'm going to delete out my text and I'm

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.900 
I'm going to delete out my text and I'm
just<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> write<00:00:39.000> something<00:00:39.559> in<00:00:40.640> my<00:00:41.640> text

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
just going to write something in my text

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.319 
just going to write something in my text
box<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:44.899> think<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> -<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> we've

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
box here I think is it - there so we've

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.729 
box here I think is it - there so we've
got<00:00:48.539> our<00:00:48.660> text<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
got our text here I'm just going to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.660 
got our text here I'm just going to
scale<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.190> ooh<00:00:50.780> 3<00:00:51.780> yes<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.190> scaled<00:00:53.489> up

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
scale it up ooh 3 yes and it's scaled up

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
scale it up ooh 3 yes and it's scaled up
here<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.280> better

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
here so we can just see a little better

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.830 
here so we can just see a little better
and<00:00:57.980> what<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.489> is<00:01:00.289> I'm<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.090 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
add<00:01:03.860> something<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.070> has<00:01:05.580> Z<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:07.229> z<00:01:07.500> axis<00:01:07.950> on

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
add something that has Z the z axis on

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.690 
add something that has Z the z axis on
it<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.580> something<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.030> opacity<00:01:10.430> won't<00:01:11.430> work

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it so something like opacity won't work

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.630 
it so something like opacity won't work
because<00:01:11.970> there<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.659> no<00:01:12.930> z<00:01:13.229> axis<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.220> I'm

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
because there is no z axis on it so I'm

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
because there is no z axis on it so I'm
going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> try<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.360> gonna<00:01:15.509> use<00:01:15.630> position

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
going to try I'm gonna use position

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.570 
going to try I'm gonna use position
because<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> best<00:01:17.400> way<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
because that's the best way to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.390 
because that's the best way to
demonstrate<00:01:18.380> now<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:19.950> down<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.159> at

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
demonstrate now if we look down here at

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.749 
demonstrate now if we look down here at
the<00:01:20.490> range<00:01:20.700> selector<00:01:21.270> we've<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.780> 0<00:01:22.680> 0<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the range selector we've got 0 0 the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.719 
the range selector we've got 0 0 the
left<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> X<00:01:24.659> down<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.580> next

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
left one is X down here and the one next

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.020 
left one is X down here and the one next
to<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> y-axis<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to it is the y-axis so you can see that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.300 
to it is the y-axis so you can see that
and<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.049> know<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.500> being<00:01:31.590> able<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and you know that from being able to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.090 
and you know that from being able to
move<00:01:33.180> position<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> beginning<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
move position from like the beginning of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
move position from like the beginning of
our<00:01:35.280> tutorials<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.630> we're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
our tutorials here so we're going to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.310 
our tutorials here so we're going to
come<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.680> animate<00:01:38.100> again<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.720> click<00:01:40.170> on

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
come up to animate again and click on

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.270 
come up to animate again and click on
enable<00:01:40.920> per<00:01:41.430> character<00:01:41.939> 3<00:01:42.890> now<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.130> see

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
enable per character 3 now you can see

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450 
enable per character 3 now you can see
we've<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> z<00:01:45.030> axis<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
we've got the z axis going on here to be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370 
we've got the z axis going on here to be
able<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:48.960> better<00:01:49.110> I'm

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
able to see this a little better I'm

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.770 
able to see this a little better I'm
going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.710> switching<00:01:50.040> between<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.329> active

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
going to be switching between the active

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.980 
going to be switching between the active
camera<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.409> custom<00:01:53.130> view<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.579> where<00:01:54.479> custom

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
camera and custom view one where custom

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.639 
camera and custom view one where custom
view<00:01:55.170> 1<00:01:55.200> has<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:56.100> dummy<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> dummy<00:01:57.899> camera

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
view 1 has a dummy like a dummy camera

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.010 
view 1 has a dummy like a dummy camera
already<00:01:58.979> set<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.340> us<00:01:59.689> I'm<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.869> go

going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.270> scrub<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.439> see<00:02:04.680> how<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> can

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
going to scrub and you can see how I can

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.969 
going to scrub and you can see how I can
move<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.939> z<00:02:06.149> axis<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.719> which<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
move in the z axis now which is this

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.380 
move in the z axis now which is this
blue<00:02:08.310> arrow

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
blue arrow

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.920 
blue arrow
so<00:02:11.390> let's<00:02:12.260> open<00:02:12.880> up<00:02:13.880> our<00:02:14.030> range<00:02:14.300> selector<00:02:14.750> here

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
so let's open up our range selector here

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.350 
so let's open up our range selector here
and<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.450> move<00:02:17.990> my<00:02:18.050> start<00:02:19.150> nothing's<00:02:20.150> going

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
and if I move my start nothing's going

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.500 
and if I move my start nothing's going
to<00:02:20.420> happen<00:02:20.750> right<00:02:20.870> now<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.130> set<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
to happen right now we have to set the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.290 
to happen right now we have to set the
position<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:25.580> be<00:02:26.980> where<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.160> wanted<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.760> start

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
position to be where we wanted to start

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.940 
position to be where we wanted to start
out<00:02:29.510> from<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.110> then<00:02:30.290> where<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.680> right<00:02:30.890> now

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
out from and then where it is right now

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.460 
out from and then where it is right now
is<00:02:31.340> where<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.540> position<00:02:33.050> is<00:02:33.320> going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.740> end<00:02:33.940> so

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
is where the position is going to end so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.850 
is where the position is going to end so
let's<00:02:36.470> do<00:02:36.710> something<00:02:37.160> like<00:02:38.110> negative<00:02:39.110> 400

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
let's do something like negative 400

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.740 
let's do something like negative 400
because<00:02:40.280> when<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.700> go<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> negatives<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
because when you go in the negatives it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.020 
because when you go in the negatives it
comes<00:02:41.960> towards<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.560> camera<00:02:42.800> when<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:43.670> go<00:02:43.820> in

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
comes towards the camera when you go in

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.610 
comes towards the camera when you go in
the<00:02:44.120> positive<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.840> goes<00:02:45.050> away<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.410> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
the positive it it goes away from the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.320 
the positive it it goes away from the
camera<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> there's<00:02:47.720> negative<00:02:48.110> 400<00:02:48.620> there<00:02:48.830> and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
camera so there's negative 400 there and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.790 
camera so there's negative 400 there and
then<00:02:50.330> if<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.690> want<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.230> look<00:02:51.440> kind<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.740> like

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
then if you want it to look kind of like

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.490 
then if you want it to look kind of like
right<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.480> you're<00:02:53.480> going<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.900> want<00:02:54.170> to

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
right on you're going to want to

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.280 
right on you're going to want to
increase<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.400> height<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:56.000> I'll<00:02:56.540> try<00:02:56.810> negative

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
increase the height so I'll try negative

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.700 
increase the height so I'll try negative
100<00:02:57.860> not<00:02:58.670> exactly<00:02:59.000> sure<00:02:59.330> how<00:02:59.900> high<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.470> let's

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
100 not exactly sure how high so let's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.220 
100 not exactly sure how high so let's
go<00:03:00.830> back<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.190> our<00:03:01.430> active<00:03:01.820> camera<00:03:02.210> we<00:03:03.050> can<00:03:03.170> see

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
go back to our active camera we can see

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.930 
go back to our active camera we can see
that<00:03:03.560> we've<00:03:03.680> got<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.920> increase<00:03:04.280> how<00:03:04.640> high<00:03:04.880> it

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
that we've got to increase how high it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.910 
that we've got to increase how high it
goes<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:06.190> there<00:03:07.190> we<00:03:07.310> go<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:09.760> now<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:12.350> move

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
goes so there we go and now if I move

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.070 
goes so there we go and now if I move
the<00:03:13.100> start<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:14.330> going<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:14.690> right<00:03:14.900> on

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
the start here it's going to right on

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.680 
the start here it's going to right on
there<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:16.250> all<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.430> have<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.850> do<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.209> just

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
there so all I have to do now is just

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.130 
there so all I have to do now is just
animate<00:03:18.170> my<00:03:18.590> start<00:03:19.000> from<00:03:20.000> 0<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.420> 100<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:23.140> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
animate my start from 0 to 100 and it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.820 
animate my start from 0 to 100 and it
should<00:03:24.290> be<00:03:24.410> issued<00:03:24.709> just<00:03:24.830> right<00:03:25.040> on

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.420 

you<00:03:29.190> do<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.640> ram<00:03:29.940> preview<00:03:30.120> here<00:03:30.420> real<00:03:30.750> quick<00:03:30.960> and

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
you do a ram preview here real quick and

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.199 
you do a ram preview here real quick and
this<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.550> what<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:32.790> get

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.699 

so<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:38.530> was<00:03:38.650> easy<00:03:38.680> enough<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:41.290> if<00:03:41.590> you

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
so that was easy enough now if you

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.099 
so that was easy enough now if you
really<00:03:42.040> want<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.370> make<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.549> like<00:03:42.849> fly-in<00:03:43.540> we

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
really want to make it like fly-in we

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.809 
really want to make it like fly-in we
can<00:03:44.290> add<00:03:44.439> some<00:03:44.739> motion<00:03:45.099> blur<00:03:45.129> to<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.579> real

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
can add some motion blur to it real

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.849 
can add some motion blur to it real
quick<00:03:45.989> make<00:03:46.989> sure<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.379> button<00:03:47.709> right<00:03:47.739> here

quick make sure this button right here

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.399 
quick make sure this button right here
is<00:03:48.129> enabled<00:03:48.549> which<00:03:48.939> enables<00:03:49.689> motion<00:03:50.019> blur<00:03:50.230> for

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
is enabled which enables motion blur for

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.309 
is enabled which enables motion blur for
your<00:03:50.560> layers<00:03:50.769> and<00:03:51.069> then<00:03:52.060> click<00:03:52.359> on<00:03:52.599> this

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
your layers and then click on this

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.890 
your layers and then click on this
column<00:03:54.010> right<00:03:54.040> here<00:03:54.189> and<00:03:54.519> that'll<00:03:55.510> add<00:03:55.719> some

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
column right here and that'll add some

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.599 
column right here and that'll add some
motion<00:03:56.170> blur<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.530> look<00:03:56.709> like<00:03:56.889> your<00:03:57.129> letters

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
motion blur it look like your letters

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:05.069 
motion blur it look like your letters
are<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:57.939> flying<00:03:58.359> in<00:03:59.969> like<00:04:00.969> this<00:04:03.719> so<00:04:04.719> this<00:04:05.019> is

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
are like flying in like this so this is

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.589 
are like flying in like this so this is
kind<00:04:05.439> of<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:05.680> like<00:04:06.219> flying<00:04:06.879> in<00:04:07.090> or<00:04:07.329> like<00:04:07.480> a

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
kind of like like flying in or like a

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.830 
kind of like like flying in or like a
write<00:04:07.840> on<00:04:08.019> kind<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.650> something<00:04:09.639> like<00:04:09.700> a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
write on kind of something like a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.330 
write on kind of something like a
typewriter<00:04:10.840> like<00:04:11.079> smashing<00:04:11.769> them<00:04:11.889> down<00:04:12.099> or

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
typewriter like smashing them down or

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.789 
typewriter like smashing them down or
something<00:04:12.579> like<00:04:12.639> that<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.689> that's<00:04:14.560> how<00:04:14.739> you

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
something like that so that's how you

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.939 
something like that so that's how you
use<00:04:15.159> the<00:04:15.209> enable<00:04:16.209> per<00:04:16.509> character<00:04:16.780> 3d<00:04:17.259> pretty

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
use the enable per character 3d pretty

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.180 
use the enable per character 3d pretty
much<00:04:18.130> all<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.340> does<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.759> just<00:04:18.789> add<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.919> the

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
much all it does is just add on the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.279 
much all it does is just add on the
z-axis<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:22.060> I'll<00:04:22.750> tell<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.530> which<00:04:25.289> character

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
z-axis and I'll tell you which character

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.969 
z-axis and I'll tell you which character
or<00:04:26.470> which<00:04:27.360> animators<00:04:28.360> here<00:04:28.599> we<00:04:29.289> can<00:04:29.530> use<00:04:29.800> them

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
or which animators here we can use them

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.029 
or which animators here we can use them
for<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.759> anchor<00:04:33.759> point<00:04:34.030> position<00:04:34.870> scale<00:04:35.710> and

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
for the anchor point position scale and

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.740 
for the anchor point position scale and
rotation<00:04:36.940> we'll<00:04:37.900> all<00:04:38.199> get<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.919> third<00:04:39.750> z-axis

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
rotation we'll all get a third z-axis

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.080 
rotation we'll all get a third z-axis
dimension<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.460> means<00:04:42.729> that<00:04:43.919> blur

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
dimension so that means that blur

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.589 
dimension so that means that blur
opacity<00:04:46.090> skew<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:48.430> fill<00:04:48.669> color<00:04:48.970> stuff<00:04:49.449> like

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
opacity skew the fill color stuff like

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.860 
opacity skew the fill color stuff like
that<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.860> stuff<00:04:51.220> isn't<00:04:51.659> affected<00:04:52.659> when

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
that that that stuff isn't affected when

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.960 
that that that stuff isn't affected when
you<00:04:52.960> enable<00:04:53.229> per<00:04:53.590> character<00:04:53.889> 3d<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:54.820> let's

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
you enable per character 3d so let's

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.330 
you enable per character 3d so let's
remember<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.840> anchor<00:04:56.409> point<00:04:56.650> position

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
remember it is anchor point position

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.050 
remember it is anchor point position
scale<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.150> rotation<00:05:01.620> so<00:05:02.620> let's<00:05:03.460> just<00:05:03.849> add

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
scale and rotation so let's just add

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.300 
scale and rotation so let's just add
something<00:05:04.419> like<00:05:04.690> rotation<00:05:05.349> in<00:05:05.500> for<00:05:05.680> fun

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.610 

so<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.520> went<00:05:09.030> up<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.360> add<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.110> went<00:05:10.410> up<00:05:10.500> to

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
so I went up and add it went up to

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.270 
so I went up and add it went up to
animate<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:12.690> selected<00:05:13.170> a<00:05:13.470> rotation<00:05:14.070> which

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
animate and I selected a rotation which

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
animate and I selected a rotation which
is<00:05:15.740> here<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:18.530> what's<00:05:19.530> come<00:05:19.710> in<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:20.300> somewhere

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
is here and what's come in to somewhere

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.240 
is here and what's come in to somewhere
around<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.750> middle<00:05:21.990> here<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.740> let's<00:05:23.040> mess

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
around the middle here and let's mess

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.100 
around the middle here and let's mess
with<00:05:23.340> our<00:05:23.550> rotation<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.389> see<00:05:24.480> how<00:05:24.750> it<00:05:24.900> works

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
with our rotation and see how it works

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.490 
with our rotation and see how it works
out

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
out

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.680 
out
see<00:05:26.220> we<00:05:26.400> can<00:05:26.550> rotate<00:05:26.760> our<00:05:27.000> characters<00:05:27.480> like

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
see we can rotate our characters like

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.750 
see we can rotate our characters like
that<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:28.850> now<00:05:29.850> they'll<00:05:30.090> flip<00:05:30.360> off<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.930> screen

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
that and now they'll flip off the screen

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.540 
that and now they'll flip off the screen
now<00:05:32.760> they're<00:05:32.940> like<00:05:33.120> flying<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:35.040> you<00:05:35.100> could

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
now they're like flying so you could

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.650 
now they're like flying so you could
also<00:05:35.900> animate<00:05:36.900> this<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.320> other<00:05:37.500> way<00:05:39.169> let<00:05:40.169> me

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
also animate this the other way let me

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.520 
also animate this the other way let me
give<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:42.750> a<00:05:42.780> ramp<00:05:43.050> review

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
give you a ramp review

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.040 
give you a ramp review
so<00:05:43.740> they're<00:05:43.950> like<00:05:44.100> flying<00:05:44.370> in

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.430 

so<00:05:49.639> you<00:05:50.639> could<00:05:50.819> do<00:05:51.210> something<00:05:51.479> where<00:05:52.199> you

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
so you could do something where you

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.350 
so you could do something where you
animate<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.160> other<00:05:53.280> way<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.819> they<00:05:54.090> fly

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
animate this the other way and they fly

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.540 
animate this the other way and they fly
off<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.750> screen<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.590> maybe<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.979> put<00:05:56.220> this<00:05:56.340> at

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
off the screen so maybe I put this at

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.010 
off the screen so maybe I put this at
100<00:05:56.940> down<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.919> then<00:05:59.400> at<00:05:59.550> the<00:05:59.699> end<00:05:59.729> to<00:06:00.449> zero

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
100 down and then at the end to zero

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.980 
100 down and then at the end to zero
I<00:06:01.050> think<00:06:01.830> they'll<00:06:01.949> fly<00:06:02.220> off<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> screen

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.960 

check<00:06:09.650> it<00:06:09.770> out

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.390 

yep

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
yep

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.330 
yep
so<00:06:14.970> there<00:06:15.720> you<00:06:15.840> go<00:06:15.960> there's<00:06:16.169> a<00:06:16.229> couple<00:06:16.860> ways<00:06:16.979> to

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
so there you go there's a couple ways to

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.300 
so there you go there's a couple ways to
use<00:06:17.610> the<00:06:18.120> enable<00:06:19.020> per<00:06:19.169> character<00:06:19.470> 3d<00:06:19.979> and

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
use the enable per character 3d and

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.490 
use the enable per character 3d and
