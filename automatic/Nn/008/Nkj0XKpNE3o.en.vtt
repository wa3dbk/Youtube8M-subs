00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
whole team I think and I've done the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
whole team I think and I've done the
same<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> other<00:00:27.300> game<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.900> I've<00:00:27.960> sped

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
same with the other game and I've sped

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.150 
same with the other game and I've sped
up<00:00:28.380> quite<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> few<00:00:28.920> parts<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:29.990> watching

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
up quite a few parts because watching

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.380 
up quite a few parts because watching
the<00:00:32.160> whole<00:00:32.340> game<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> run<00:00:33.090> around<00:00:33.210> with

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the whole game when you run around with

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750 
the whole game when you run around with
a<00:00:33.540> sniper<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> bit<00:00:34.890> boring<00:00:34.920> because<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
a sniper it's a bit boring because you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.130 
a sniper it's a bit boring because you
have<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> bit<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.420> careful<00:00:36.899> when

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
have to be a bit more careful when

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040 
have to be a bit more careful when
you're<00:00:37.260> using<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.620> sniper<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.930> because<00:00:39.930> if

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you're using the sniper and because if

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
you're using the sniper and because if
you<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.379> go<00:00:40.530> running<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.100> you're<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you just go running in you're going to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.010 
you just go running in you're going to
die<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.079> lot<00:00:43.320> harder<00:00:43.640> otherwise

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
die because it's a lot harder otherwise

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
die because it's a lot harder otherwise
say<00:00:46.020> I've<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.469> three<00:00:46.680> kills<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> moment

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
say I've got three kills in the moment

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
say I've got three kills in the moment
the<00:00:48.300> first<00:00:48.629> round<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> where<00:00:49.230> most<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the first round is where most of the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.920 
the first round is where most of the
action<00:00:49.739> happens<00:00:50.309> anyway<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.539> problem<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
action happens anyway the problem of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
action happens anyway the problem of
using<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> sniper<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.829> hard<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.340> like

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
using a sniper is it's hard to get like

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.540 
using a sniper is it's hard to get like
back<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.270> rounds<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.340> getting<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> good

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
back to back rounds of getting a good

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
back to back rounds of getting a good
amount<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.879> kills<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.390> they're<00:00:57.750> wise

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
amount of kills because they're wise

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.119 
amount of kills because they're wise
onto<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.590> how<00:00:58.770> you're<00:00:59.010> playing<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:01.129> just

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
onto like how you're playing and just

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
onto like how you're playing and just
kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> adapt<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> gets<00:01:03.539> harder<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> kill

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
kind of adapt and it gets harder to kill

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
kind of adapt and it gets harder to kill
them<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:06.380> calling<00:01:07.380> my<00:01:07.470> UAB<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.340> because

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
spot him or something but I just could

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
spot him or something but I just could
not<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.750> him<00:01:39.960> anywhere<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.520> went<00:01:41.670> and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the three games which I'm probably gonna

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.229 
the three games which I'm probably gonna
put<00:02:46.709> up<00:02:46.799> they're<00:02:46.980> not<00:02:47.130> amazing<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:47.940> there's

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
put up they're not amazing but there's

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.789 
put up they're not amazing but there's
still<00:02:48.360> good<00:02:48.750> game<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.230> using<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> sniper

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
still good game to using the sniper

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.339 
still good game to using the sniper
rifle<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> time<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.540> upper<00:02:51.690> wrap<00:02:51.959> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
rifle the time and the upper wrap the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.020 
rifle the time and the upper wrap the
next<00:02:52.620> game<00:02:52.769> i'm<00:02:52.920> going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.099> upload<00:02:53.130> scott<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
next game i'm going to upload scott the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.850 
next game i'm going to upload scott the
round<00:02:54.599> before<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.989> last<00:02:55.170> round<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.620> really

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
round before the last round is really

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.620 
round before the last round is really
good<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> rest<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.940> i'm<00:02:57.420> probably

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
good but the rest of it i'm probably

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.330 
good but the rest of it i'm probably
have<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.959> speed<00:02:58.200> up<00:02:58.319> quite<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> few<00:02:58.799> parts<00:02:59.069> of<00:02:59.190> it

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
have to speed up quite a few parts of it

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.240 
have to speed up quite a few parts of it
but<00:03:00.269> we've<00:03:01.170> speeding<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.650> up<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.160> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
but we've speeding it up it's just a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.250 
but we've speeding it up it's just a
quick<00:03:02.459> view<00:03:02.670> anyway<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.599> is<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.110> is

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
quick view anyway this is that this is

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.479 
quick view anyway this is that this is
