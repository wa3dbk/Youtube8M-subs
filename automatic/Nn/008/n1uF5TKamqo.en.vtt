to<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.229> slightest<00:01:40.740> touch<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.220> because

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
to that the slightest touch will because

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.240 
to that the slightest touch will because
of<00:01:42.210> leverage<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.649> fire<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.070> much

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
of leverage will make this fire are much

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.310 
of leverage will make this fire are much
faster<00:01:44.490> we're<00:01:45.149> using<00:01:45.360> basically<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
faster we're using basically the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.230 
faster we're using basically the
principles<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.950> leverage<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.579> Leonardo<00:01:48.149> da

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
principles of leverage like Leonardo da

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.330 
principles of leverage like Leonardo da
Vinci<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.229> using<00:01:49.380> electronics<00:01:50.159> we're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
Vinci we're not using electronics we're

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.270 
Vinci we're not using electronics we're
using<00:01:50.549> old-fashioned<00:01:51.530> invention<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.770> engine

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
using old-fashioned invention of engine

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
using old-fashioned invention of engine
ability<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> gives<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.259> advantage

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
ability so it gives you an advantage

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.980 
ability so it gives you an advantage
effin<00:01:56.130> advantage<00:01:56.790> over<00:01:57.060> everybody<00:01:57.479> else<00:01:57.780> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
effin advantage over everybody else is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.649 
effin advantage over everybody else is
playing<00:01:58.170> leverage<00:01:59.009> leverage<00:01:59.790> yeah<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> wanted

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
playing leverage leverage yeah I wanted

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420
