okay<00:00:04.770> so<00:00:04.830> this<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.310> iGrow<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.819> basically

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
okay so this is the iGrow and basically

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.160 
okay so this is the iGrow and basically
what<00:00:06.330> we've<00:00:06.450> created<00:00:06.660> here<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
what we've created here is a

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.500 
what we've created here is a
bluetooth-enabled<00:00:07.770> cooking<00:00:08.370> thermometer<00:00:08.510> so

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
bluetooth-enabled cooking thermometer so

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
food and it's going to relay back to an

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.740 
food and it's going to relay back to an
app<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.519> we've<00:00:14.849> created<00:00:15.000> that's<00:00:15.389> currently

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
app that we've created that's currently
