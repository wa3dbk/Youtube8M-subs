00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.090
 Hi, what 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.190
 the engine of the 1200 gs that is going to be 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.250
 presented in March april in our 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.469
 country the big difference with the vehicle 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 with old motor is that it is refrigerated 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 to water but only in places where the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.760
 engine needs cooling that's why 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 also that they have air and water in the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
 refrigeration after we have the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.170
 electronics driving the two cylinders 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.320
 at the top no and the escape is 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.239
 on the underside of the engine and a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.790
 great difference with before is that the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.130
 car is bathed in oil is already in the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.739
 house each inside and can be changed 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.989
 easily to circulate and it gets from the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.200
 front of the engine this is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.900
 go ahead this is back and another thing very 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.390
 important is that 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.220
 the crankshaft is on the top or 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.590
 be here are the following and the 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.070
 pistons and the rest the engine was 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.610
 thank you very much very well here we have the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.350
 new 800 gs with motor protection 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.690
 of the atech tour that here has 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.460
 plastic skates that means that 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.340
 every time we have a meeting 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.800
 close to the floor, let's not scratch 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.100
 all the protector after we have the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 side shields of the engine and 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.050
 fairing 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.420
 and they help us in a fall case that does not 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.600
 let's spoil the whole bike also not 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.490

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.420
