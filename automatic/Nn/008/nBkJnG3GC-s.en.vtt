it's been dropping a fair amount just

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's been dropping a fair amount just
because<00:02:14.359> it's<00:02:14.569> so<00:02:14.749> hard<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.049> do<00:02:15.260> good<00:02:15.439> with

two something like that which is really

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.399 
two something like that which is really
good<00:02:55.430> considered<00:02:55.909> I'd<00:02:56.659> say<00:02:56.870> about<00:02:56.959> ninety

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
good considered I'd say about ninety

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.479 
good considered I'd say about ninety
nine<00:02:57.560> percent<00:02:57.739> of<00:02:57.919> the<00:02:58.010> people<00:02:58.099> out<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
nine percent of the people out of a

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.819 
nine percent of the people out of a
higher<00:02:58.609> KD<00:02:58.969> than<00:02:59.180> me<00:02:59.299> have<00:02:59.750> a<00:03:00.139> lower<00:03:00.379> win-loss

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
higher KD than me have a lower win-loss

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.459 
higher KD than me have a lower win-loss
and<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.669> win-loss<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.329> pretty<00:03:02.750> high<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.260> think

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
and I win-loss is pretty high I think

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.080 
and I win-loss is pretty high I think
it's<00:03:03.560> sitting<00:03:03.799> around<00:03:03.980> just<00:03:04.099> uh<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.819> above

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
it's sitting around just uh just above

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.179 
it's sitting around just uh just above
the<00:03:05.209> seven<00:03:05.629> as<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:06.019> right<00:03:06.169> now<00:03:06.230> which

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
the seven as of right now which

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.059 
the seven as of right now which
definitely<00:03:07.669> isn't<00:03:07.909> bad<00:03:08.560> for<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:09.680> game<00:03:09.919> at

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
definitely isn't bad for this game at

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.349 
definitely isn't bad for this game at
least<00:03:10.219> you<00:03:10.459> know<00:03:10.549> past<00:03:10.790> Call<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.030> Duty's

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
least you know past Call of Duty's

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.059 
least you know past Call of Duty's
that's<00:03:11.569> not<00:03:11.810> as<00:03:11.930> high<00:03:12.079> as<00:03:12.109> I<00:03:12.349> have<00:03:12.620> had<00:03:12.829> but

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
that's not as high as I have had but

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.610 
that's not as high as I have had but
this<00:03:13.250> games<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.549> lot<00:03:13.669> harder<00:03:13.909> because<00:03:14.500> I'm<00:03:15.500> not

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
this games a lot harder because I'm not

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.349 
this games a lot harder because I'm not
just<00:03:15.769> hired<00:03:15.979> to<00:03:16.069> win<00:03:16.340> games<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.970> not

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
just hired to win games and not

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.240 
just hired to win games and not
including<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.930> get<00:03:18.079> dashboard<00:03:18.620> on<00:03:18.859> like<00:03:19.099> it

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
including you get dashboard on like it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.710 
including you get dashboard on like it
seems<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:19.639> every<00:03:19.909> other<00:03:19.939> game<00:03:20.299> which<00:03:20.569> I'm

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
seems like every other game which I'm

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.499 
seems like every other game which I'm
not<00:03:20.870> sure<00:03:21.109> entirely<00:03:21.590> why<00:03:21.889> that<00:03:22.159> is<00:03:22.340> but<00:03:22.699> it<00:03:23.359> is

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:23.509 
not sure entirely why that is but it is

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:27.309 
not sure entirely why that is but it is
just<00:03:23.689> how<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.930> works<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:25.389> um<00:03:26.389> I<00:03:26.449> don't<00:03:27.169> know

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
just how it works and um I don't know

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.199 
just how it works and um I don't know
how<00:03:27.709> I'm<00:03:27.829> gonna<00:03:27.949> quite<00:03:28.250> attempt<00:03:28.609> this<00:03:28.759> 3kt

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
challenge I was we're gonna see I guess

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.379 
challenge I was we're gonna see I guess
how<00:03:31.699> I<00:03:31.729> can<00:03:32.150> even<00:03:32.509> attempt<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.019> but<00:03:33.319> uh<00:03:33.370> I'm<00:03:34.389> not

know<00:03:54.979> when<00:03:55.159> this<00:03:55.280> game<00:03:55.430> first<00:03:55.489> came<00:03:55.969> out<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.359> was

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
know when this game first came out I was

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.409 
know when this game first came out I was
really<00:03:56.780> big<00:03:56.959> on<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.199> m88<00:03:57.739> one<00:03:58.009> right<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.819> m8a1

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
really big on the m88 one right the m8a1

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.110 
really big on the m88 one right the m8a1
and<00:04:00.079> I<00:04:00.829> was<00:04:01.159> doing<00:04:01.370> really<00:04:01.519> good<00:04:01.699> with<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:01.849> it

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
and I was doing really good with that it

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.629 
and I was doing really good with that it
was<00:04:02.209> my<00:04:02.359> favorite<00:04:02.659> gun<00:04:02.870> but<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.560> feel<00:04:04.069> like<00:04:04.280> it's

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
was my favorite gun but I feel like it's

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.729 
was my favorite gun but I feel like it's
nerved<00:04:05.180> even<00:04:05.780> though<00:04:05.930> I'm<00:04:06.139> not<00:04:06.259> sure<00:04:06.319> if<00:04:06.650> it

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
nerved even though I'm not sure if it

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.379 
nerved even though I'm not sure if it
has<00:04:06.769> being<00:04:07.159> it<00:04:07.310> might<00:04:07.519> of<00:04:07.699> being<00:04:07.909> I<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.060> don't

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
has being it might of being I just don't

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.959 
has being it might of being I just don't
know<00:04:08.599> but<00:04:09.229> it<00:04:09.439> seems<00:04:09.739> like<00:04:09.979> the<00:04:10.159> gun<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.639> not<00:04:10.819> as

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:10.969 
know but it seems like the gun is not as

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.550 
know but it seems like the gun is not as
good<00:04:11.150> as<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:11.329> used<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.659> be<00:04:11.810> that's<00:04:12.109> for<00:04:12.259> sure

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
good as it used to be that's for sure

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.800 
good as it used to be that's for sure
and<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:13.729> don't<00:04:14.000> know<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.090> just<00:04:14.120> don't<00:04:14.389> like<00:04:14.539> it<00:04:14.599> as

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
and I don't know I just don't like it as

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.719 
and I don't know I just don't like it as
much<00:04:14.840> as<00:04:15.199> I<00:04:15.229> did<00:04:15.979> when<00:04:16.159> the<00:04:16.219> game<00:04:16.400> first<00:04:16.609> came

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
much as I did when the game first came

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.089 
much as I did when the game first came
out<00:04:17.030> I've<00:04:17.539> been<00:04:17.599> using<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.109> smg's<00:04:18.709> more<00:04:18.919> than

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
out I've been using the smg's more than

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.680 
out I've been using the smg's more than
anything<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:19.459> think<00:04:19.489> pretty<00:04:19.849> sure<00:04:19.940> my<00:04:20.060> top<00:04:20.299> six

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
anything I think pretty sure my top six

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.200 
anything I think pretty sure my top six
guns<00:04:21.079> in<00:04:21.440> this<00:04:21.650> game<00:04:21.889> are<00:04:22.039> all<00:04:22.219> SMGs<00:04:22.909> which<00:04:23.090> is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
guns in this game are all SMGs which is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.460 
guns in this game are all SMGs which is
crazy<00:04:23.479> considering

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
crazy considering

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.860 
crazy considering
up<00:04:25.470> until<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:26.009> call<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.370> duty<00:04:26.580> i<00:04:26.610> never<00:04:27.449> used

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
up until this call of duty i never used

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.200 
up until this call of duty i never used
smg's<00:04:29.180> especially<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.509> I<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:32.520> don't<00:04:32.970> think<00:04:33.120> I've

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
smg's especially in I I don't think I've

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.089 
smg's especially in I I don't think I've
ever<00:04:33.389> really<00:04:33.479> used<00:04:33.900> an<00:04:34.020> SMG<00:04:34.349> that's<00:04:34.800> been<00:04:34.979> in

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
ever really used an SMG that's been in

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.800 
ever really used an SMG that's been in
my<00:04:35.130> top<00:04:35.400> 5<00:04:35.639> weapons<00:04:36.030> in<00:04:36.180> any<00:04:36.270> Call<00:04:36.509> of<00:04:36.539> Duty

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
my top 5 weapons in any Call of Duty

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.990 
my top 5 weapons in any Call of Duty
besides<00:04:37.080> maybe<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.440> mp7<00:04:37.740> other<00:04:38.669> than<00:04:38.819> that

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
besides maybe the mp7 other than that

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.400 
besides maybe the mp7 other than that
I'm<00:04:39.240> pretty<00:04:39.270> sure<00:04:39.660> it's<00:04:39.780> always<00:04:40.080> assault

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
I'm pretty sure it's always assault

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.499 
I'm pretty sure it's always assault
rifles<00:04:40.830> just<00:04:41.250> because<00:04:41.520> I'm<00:04:41.639> an<00:04:41.759> AR<00:04:42.120> type<00:04:42.360> of

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
rifles just because I'm an AR type of

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.589 
rifles just because I'm an AR type of

the<00:04:45.690> smg's<00:04:46.169> I<00:04:46.289> never<00:04:46.500> touched<00:04:46.770> those<00:04:47.039> things

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
the smg's I never touched those things

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.610

a<00:04:51.930> little<00:04:52.080> too<00:04:52.259> dominant<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.370> guys<00:04:53.490> can
