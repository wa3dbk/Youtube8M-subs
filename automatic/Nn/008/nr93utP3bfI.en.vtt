tinier<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.340> think<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.850> balance<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.360> out<00:02:43.450> i'm

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
tinier so I think to balance it out i'm

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:54.340 
tinier so I think to balance it out i'm
going<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.990> put<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.980> in<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> middle

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
my uncle soon I might go through like a

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.170 
my uncle soon I might go through like a
slightly<00:05:05.060> lighter<00:05:05.539> color<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.469> just<00:05:07.180> thinks

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
slightly lighter color to just thinks

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.149 
slightly lighter color to just thinks
this<00:05:08.330> highlight<00:05:08.779> a<00:05:08.889> little<00:05:09.889> bit<00:05:10.069> more<00:05:15.159> there

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
this highlight a little bit more there

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.730 
this highlight a little bit more there
you<00:05:16.279> go<00:05:16.449> and<00:05:17.449> then<00:05:17.509> at<00:05:17.749> the<00:05:17.810> very<00:05:17.870> end<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.499> want

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
you go and then at the very end you want

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.369 
you go and then at the very end you want
to<00:05:18.919> flatten<00:05:19.550> your<00:05:19.759> image<00:05:20.029> and<00:05:20.930> there<00:05:21.259> you<00:05:21.349> go

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:21.379 
to flatten your image and there you go

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:22.839 
to flatten your image and there you go
you'll<00:05:21.800> have<00:05:21.949> to<00:05:22.099> probably<00:05:22.279> scale<00:05:22.669> it<00:05:22.819> down

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
you'll have to probably scale it down

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.929 
you'll have to probably scale it down
just<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.419> tinsy<00:05:23.749> bit<00:05:24.460> that's<00:05:25.460> where<00:05:25.669> you<00:05:25.759> do<00:05:25.909> i

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939 
just a tinsy bit that's where you do i

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:27.640 
just a tinsy bit that's where you do i
usually<00:05:26.300> do<00:05:26.389> percent<00:05:26.840> because<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.199> keeps<00:05:27.379> it

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
usually do percent because it keeps it

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.089 
usually do percent because it keeps it
even<00:05:28.249> in<00:05:29.229> proportion<00:05:30.229> instead<00:05:30.650> of<00:05:30.710> trying<00:05:30.889> to

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
even in proportion instead of trying to

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.219 
even in proportion instead of trying to
guess<00:05:31.340> you<00:05:32.150> know<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:33.969> that's<00:05:34.990> pretty<00:05:35.990> much<00:05:36.110> it

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
guess you know and that's pretty much it

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.809 
guess you know and that's pretty much it
as<00:05:36.439> how<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.650> make<00:05:36.830> collages<00:05:37.099> it's<00:05:37.490> pretty

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
as how you make collages it's pretty

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.269 
as how you make collages it's pretty
simple<00:05:38.029> once<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.389> can<00:05:38.599> figure<00:05:39.020> it<00:05:39.259> out<00:05:39.349> I'd

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
simple once you can figure it out I'd

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.909 
simple once you can figure it out I'd
