00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.130
 and today philippe we go 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.020
 take a closer look at 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.430
 fish to fish actually you 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.380
 have spoken in the titles of 9:30 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.760
 we are not going to invent a fish by 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.840
 compared to another fish we will try 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.220
 to talk about the crisis that is going through the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.869
 french fishing right now fisherman 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.579
 to the fishmonger and suddenly the 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.810
 consumer who has small problems of 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.599
 wallet right now because the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.490
 price flambent must know that 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.079
 normally to have fish 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.880
 sufficiently accordingly on the 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.439
 stalls it is necessary that the boats in all 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.870
 Fishing harbors average 22 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.100
 days a month and then to pay 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.149
 payroll taxes paid wages and 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.859
 since the beginning of the year some 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.320
 boats in some points are 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.519
 out ten days it's precisely 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.140
 the consequences on the entire industry 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.879
 on the whole chain it is not necessary in 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.079
 to want to fishmongers is not to 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.519
 legal fishing fish no equal 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.660
 stalls not very trimmed and when there is a 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.489
 little fish and well actually 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.780
 it is relatively expensive fish 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.129
 yesterday furrowed three markets in the region 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.379
 Paris to raise some prices 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.800
 on these species of fish we will say 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.079
 town 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.170
 Prices have soared you had hake 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.780
 yesterday at 27 euros 95 of the yellow place at 23.90 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.790
 from sole to 21.95 and even 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.340
 squid at 25 euros 95 on average 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.320
 between 4 and 5 euros more than in time 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.670
 normal then if we pay attention to his 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.979
 philippe purse what kind 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 fossil consumed so we there on the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.710
 floors of other species who she 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.310
 actually he is stopped at less than 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.140
 May 20 to see even less than 10 euros 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 so this crisis is dramatic for the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.930
 world of fishing but it can be 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.579
 also we get used to consume 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.869
 differently to say to myself I'm going to 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.490
 report on drinks less 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.020

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.219
 prestigious and I'm going to teach them 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.049

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.299

 cook whole in the oven where he cut into 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.820
 cobblestones serve it with a pepper it 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.380
 was also proud of the gray bream 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.869
 not breeding but gray bream 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.579
 two lines that were at 13 euros 90 that 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.840
 you ask the possoni of you the 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.560
 work in a net and get bored with 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.600

 lisette lisette is the mackerel but 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.050
 when he is smaller he is called 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.420
 shortage 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.050
 lastly last fish while we 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.130
 totally abandoned because we know

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.410
 crime researcher can be small or a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.760
 as big as mackerel it's between 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.320
 the sardine the mackerel he walks 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.330
 often bench with mackerel this is 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.530
 for that we entrust him but he 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.110
 you have to cook it the same way you ask 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 also the relatively thick ones you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.590
 ask the fishmonger of volta having 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.640

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.020

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.510
 seafood products that are 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.500
 available in abundance and whose 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.060
 stocks are not in danger

 basically it's to alert you to you 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.780
