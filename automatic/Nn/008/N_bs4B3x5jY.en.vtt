00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
technically if you have one from let's

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.100

say<00:01:16.290> five<00:01:17.290> months<00:01:17.649> ago<00:01:17.830> let's<00:01:18.460> say<00:01:18.759> 1.1<00:01:19.720> if<00:01:19.960> you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
say five months ago let's say 1.1 if you

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.170 
say five months ago let's say 1.1 if you
have<00:01:20.200> them<00:01:20.350> run<00:01:20.530> one<00:01:20.950> from<00:01:21.190> there<00:01:21.369> technically

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
have them run one from there technically

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.450 
have them run one from there technically
you<00:01:22.450> could<00:01:22.720> click<00:01:23.110> restore<00:01:23.590> on<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.130> one<00:01:24.310> and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
you could click restore on that one and

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.410 
you could click restore on that one and
it<00:01:24.549> would<00:01:24.640> take<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.940> all<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.090> way<00:01:25.180> back<00:01:25.360> to

copying items I will go on minecraft and

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.160 
copying items I will go on minecraft and
it<00:01:42.040> should<00:01:42.310> be<00:01:42.640> one<00:01:43.000> point<00:01:43.299> two<00:01:43.450> point<00:01:43.659> five<00:01:43.869> it

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
it should be one point two point five it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.350 
it should be one point two point five it
should<00:01:44.290> be<00:01:44.440> downgraded<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.940> reasons<00:01:46.270> you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
should be downgraded and the reasons you

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.469 
should be downgraded and the reasons you
want<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.690> do<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.580> for<00:01:48.580> example<00:01:48.670> optifine

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
want to do this is for example optifine

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.480 
want to do this is for example optifine
is<00:01:49.689> not<00:01:49.930> upgraded<00:01:50.409> yet<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:51.130> lot<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.280> people

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
is not upgraded yet and a lot of people

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.190 
is not upgraded yet and a lot of people
can't<00:01:51.820> play<00:01:51.970> minecraft<00:01:52.450> without<00:01:52.720> not<00:01:52.869> be<00:01:53.020> fine

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
can't play minecraft without not be fine

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.120 
can't play minecraft without not be fine
because<00:01:53.409> they<00:01:53.560> don't<00:01:53.710> have<00:01:53.770> put<00:01:53.979> enough

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
because they don't have put enough

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.490 
because they don't have put enough
computers<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.600> they<00:01:55.869> wouldn't<00:01:56.290> be<00:01:56.409> able

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
computers and so they wouldn't be able

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.620 
computers and so they wouldn't be able
to<00:01:56.650> play<00:01:56.770> one<00:01:57.010> foot<00:01:57.189> 3.1<00:01:57.790> yet<00:01:57.820> but<00:01:58.240> let's<00:01:58.420> say

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
to play one foot 3.1 yet but let's say

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.050 
to play one foot 3.1 yet but let's say
upgraded<00:01:59.229> for<00:01:59.409> them<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.799> they<00:02:00.790> didn't<00:02:01.000> know

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
upgraded for them and they didn't know

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.670 
upgraded for them and they didn't know
how<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.240> downgrade<00:02:01.479> will<00:02:01.840> decide<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.470> or

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
how to downgrade will decide to it or

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.370 
how to downgrade will decide to it or
let's<00:02:03.610> say<00:02:03.909> your<00:02:04.240> server<00:02:04.509> scuzzbucket<00:02:05.080> i

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
let's say your server scuzzbucket i

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.870 
let's say your server scuzzbucket i
don't<00:02:05.680> know<00:02:05.799> for<00:02:06.009> sure<00:02:06.070> if<00:02:06.220> they<00:02:06.430> have<00:02:06.610> but<00:02:06.850> i

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
don't know for sure if they have but i

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.180 
don't know for sure if they have but i
don't<00:02:07.090> think<00:02:07.229> they've<00:02:08.229> upgraded<00:02:08.440> let's<00:02:09.040> say

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
don't think they've upgraded let's say

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.590 
don't think they've upgraded let's say
bucket<00:02:09.489> servers<00:02:09.790> have<00:02:09.910> been<00:02:09.970> upgraded<00:02:10.479> for

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
bucket servers have been upgraded for

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.420 
bucket servers have been upgraded for
you<00:02:10.750> then<00:02:11.049> you<00:02:11.350> would<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.530> downgrade<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.190> be

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
you then you would just downgrade and be

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.310 
you then you would just downgrade and be
