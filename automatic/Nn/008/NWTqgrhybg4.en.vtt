00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.429
 born in sicily 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
 hello, I am what in two metallic sleeves and I will talk to you about one of the mandates and 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.940
 most famous and at the same time controversial of the world made by osamu tezuka 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.200
 jungle cta and tello as in the European version kimba the white lion 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.580
 before starting or said that the information has been taken out of my mind 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.160
 xd and the wikipedia we go there now I will tell you the story story 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.440
 begins in africa 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.610
 when a lion called 'caesar' decides to create a place where animals can 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.300
 live in peace 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.100
 when he rescued a few livestock animals the people he 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.310
 belonged said cattle send a hunter to avoid these events 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 that hunters called hiv but amec according to the Japanese version 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.950
 then that hunter uses a tape that reproduced a sound equal to that of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.770
 What your partner does is what good is captured when caught by the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.410
 hunter and thus attract caesar 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.680
 when Caesars went to where he was exposing he was killed and the lioness 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 who was pregnant at the time was transported to a zoo 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.109
 during the trip he has his son and that's when he wanted him and 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.349
 teaches the ideals for which his father died 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.730
 later the plane suffered an accident causing everyone to die 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.759
 except kimbab 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.339
 when it seemed that kindle was also going to die his mother appeared in the 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.259
 stars and managed to give him hope 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:32.299
 when he arrived on land he was trapped by humans from whom he learned 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.999
 very much and I decide that I would take everything I learned when I returned to their land and 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.689
 that he would fulfill his father's dream 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.909
 the European version of jungle tahiti and it was softened in some aspects that 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.879
 could affect the plot for example in the Japanese version caesar leader the 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.919
 gained to feed the predators while in the European simply 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.339
 I released them among other things 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.999
 this anime had a lot of controversy with disney and since there were many 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.929
 similarities with the lion king of disney 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.359
 the just thing that the American company gave was that nobody from the 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.079
 company had heard about kimba until the movie the king was released 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:07.699
 Lion 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.689
 a person asked rory disney and in an interview if there would be some 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.829
 good maternal figures in some future animated film of disney and disney 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.540
 replied that timba's mother 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.370
 in the lion king next year 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.429
 it will be adorable 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.869
 matthew broderick indicated that he understood that he had been hired 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.900
 as a voice actor for a fight and the disney timba 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.120
 the white lion plus a preview of the film included 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.640
 in the platinum edition of the lion king's dvd shows a portrait of a lion 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.589
 white puppy controversy does not involve the story of the lion king 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.559
 disney movies often diverging from the story of which 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:48.539
 are based so this can not be considered as a test of any 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:52.589
 it's the similarity of the characters and certain specific scenes that 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.129
 they are in doubt 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.769
 It has been reported numerous times that beats tuca production company ltd was looking for a 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.300
 Animation company of the United States of America to take to Kimba 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.759
 back to the North American audience 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.319
 the reports indicate that they had conversations with the dysmetria 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.369
 it is believed that the lion king was developed from the pilot of 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.109
 Kimba made for his face 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.129
 citation needed the tezuka / disney connection extends back for years 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.189
 the doctor jesús who sought and obtained the license to adapt disney bambi and 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.529
 in a manga for the Japanese market 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:30.389
 that tuca met walt disney and at the 1964 world fair 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.309
 where disney said he hoped to do something like the tezuka star boy 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:37.969
 Disney animators and they were hired to train the team of 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.069
 tezuka in the use of color when the production of the television series 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.249
 of timba the white lion started 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.259
 a strange coincidence is that when the English version of Kimba was 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.359
 producing the character was going to be called simba which means lion in 

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:55.359
 Swahili is the name of lion protagonist of 'the lion king' 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.750
 but as simba was not considered registrable 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.360
 they changed the s for one face 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.800
 and they got the name of kimba that is known in almost every country 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.780
 a curiosity was that the simpsons brought back the controversy of 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.719
 king and lion to the general public in the ramón episode of springfield 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:17.110
 at the end of the same mufasa appears in heaven as he did in the lion king and 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.110
 you say you must avenge my death 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.610
 in episode 13 of fifth the concept of avenging death is mentioned 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.779
 from the parents of quimbaya 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.619
 in conclusion it is a good mood and which I have made the decision to see it in 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:33.619
 original version with subtitles and I recommend it 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:00.329
