this<00:01:29.310> tool<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> while<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:31.350> looks<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.619> little

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
this tool for a while it looks a little

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
this tool for a while it looks a little
intimidating<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.520> eyes<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.509> shame<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
intimidating but eyes kind of shame to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
intimidating but eyes kind of shame to
myself<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.770> was<00:01:35.040> intimidated<00:01:35.430> by<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.759> once

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
myself that I was intimidated by at once

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.190 
myself that I was intimidated by at once
I<00:01:36.060> figured<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.450> how<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> use<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:36.960> it's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I figured out how to use it because it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
I figured out how to use it because it's
really<00:01:37.380> easy<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.549> holds<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.270> head

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
really easy it just holds the head

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.719 
really easy it just holds the head
in<00:01:39.570> place<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> doesn't<00:01:40.829> spin<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.610> you're

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
in place so it doesn't spin when you're

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.999 
in place so it doesn't spin when you're
trying<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> off<00:01:43.520> um<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.939> also<00:01:45.060> need

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
trying to take it off um you also need

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.370 
trying to take it off um you also need
freon<00:01:47.009> remover<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.780> looks<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.110> giant

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
freon remover it just looks like a giant

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
freon remover it just looks like a giant
nut<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.040> sticks<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> end<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
set and I use vice-grip species of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.109 
set and I use vice-grip species of
monkey<00:01:54.060> wrench<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.479> anything<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> oh

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
monkey wrench or anything like that oh

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.480 
monkey wrench or anything like that oh
well<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.240> dirt<00:01:58.009> all<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.460> take

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
well it's dirt all you do is you take

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.240 
well it's dirt all you do is you take
the<00:01:59.670> freehub<00:02:00.060> remover<00:02:00.770> stick<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> end

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the freehub remover stick it in the end

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.789 
the freehub remover stick it in the end
of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.399> COG<00:02:02.579> set<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:03.290> then<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.439> use<00:02:04.680> your

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
of the COG set there then you use your

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.620 
of the COG set there then you use your
chain<00:02:05.100> whip<00:02:05.310> because<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:05.880> happens<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
chain whip because what happens is the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.300 
chain whip because what happens is the
clock<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> wants<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> spin<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.890> way<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
clock so it wants to spin this way and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
clock so it wants to spin this way and
you<00:02:08.550> need<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> turn<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.149> bolt<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.750> way<00:02:09.899> too

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you need to turn the bolt that way too

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.760 
you need to turn the bolt that way too
so<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.979> chain<00:02:11.280> holds

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
so this chain holds

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.220 
so this chain holds
place<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.080> counter<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
place so you can just counter the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.520 
place so you can just counter the
direction<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.950> spin<00:02:15.960> then<00:02:16.960> why<00:02:17.110> do<00:02:17.200> you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
direction of the spin then why do you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.820 
direction of the spin then why do you
grab<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.960> bowl<00:02:20.670> give<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.850> little<00:02:22.030> Turner

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
where there's space is wider and so you

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.060 
where there's space is wider and so you
just<00:03:20.980> line<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.250> up<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:22.510> wider<00:03:22.750> space<00:03:23.550> on<00:03:24.550> the
