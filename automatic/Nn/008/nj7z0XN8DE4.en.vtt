00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.310 
now I've had baby asparagus super thin
pencil-thin<00:00:47.760> asparagus<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.750> didn't<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
pencil-thin asparagus that didn't have a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
pencil-thin asparagus that didn't have a
whole<00:00:49.440> lot<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> fiber<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> just

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
whole lot of fiber down here and I just

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.630 
whole lot of fiber down here and I just
snapped<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.420> off<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.899> ate<00:00:52.110> them<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
but what I'm doing because these guys

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
but what I'm doing because these guys
are<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.260> older<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.800> mean<00:00:56.280> more

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
are a little bit older I mean more

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.590 
are a little bit older I mean more
tender<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.000> towards<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> tip

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
tender as they get towards the tip

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
tender as they get towards the tip
tougher<00:00:58.230> down<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.340> since<00:01:00.000> most<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
tougher down here so since most of the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
tougher down here so since most of the
fibers<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.899> outside<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.620> lay<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.160> down<00:01:02.219> on

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
fibers on the outside I lay this down on

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.280 
fibers on the outside I lay this down on
a<00:01:02.730> surface<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a surface I don't do that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.140 
a surface I don't do that
because<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.619> might<00:01:04.769> snap<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.309> lay<00:01:05.939> them<00:01:06.119> down

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
because I might snap them lay them down

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.080 
because I might snap them lay them down
and<00:01:06.619> peel<00:01:07.619> them<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:08.040> quickly<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and peel them very quickly so when it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
and peel them very quickly so when it
comes<00:01:09.270> time<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> trim<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:09.990> guys<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.500> I'm

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
comes time to trim these guys what I'm

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.580 
comes time to trim these guys what I'm
gonna<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.220> grab<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> stalks<00:01:12.869> grab

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
gonna do is grab one of the stalks grab

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
gonna do is grab one of the stalks grab
it<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> tip<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> bottom<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.420> bend

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
it at the tip and at the bottom and bend

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.609 
it at the tip and at the bottom and bend
it<00:01:16.400> now<00:01:17.400> typically<00:01:18.000> where<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> breaks<00:01:18.619> that's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it now typically where it breaks that's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.450 
it now typically where it breaks that's
where<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.820> tough<00:01:21.150> fiber<00:01:21.509> ends<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.280> more

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
where the tough fiber ends and the more

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.030 
where the tough fiber ends and the more
tender<00:01:23.820> part<00:01:24.060> begins<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> I'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> use

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
tender part begins so I'm going to use

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.219 
tender part begins so I'm going to use
this<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.700> from<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> tip<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> middle<00:01:28.049> as

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this one from the tip to the middle as

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.160 
this one from the tip to the middle as
the<00:01:28.710> template<00:01:29.630> where<00:01:30.630> I'm<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> cut<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
when I tie them into a bundle it's gonna

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.170 
when I tie them into a bundle it's gonna
keep<00:01:46.530> them<00:01:46.680> nice<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> secure<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.939> close
