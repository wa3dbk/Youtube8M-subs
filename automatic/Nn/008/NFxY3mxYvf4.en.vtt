water a little floatier and a little
more<00:03:28.380> springy<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:30.600> seems<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.200> could

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
more springy so it seems like I could

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.949 
more springy so it seems like I could
turn<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.860> little<00:03:31.950> faster<00:03:32.610> but<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.630> didn't

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
turn this a little faster but it didn't

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.309 
turn this a little faster but it didn't
quite<00:03:34.170> track
