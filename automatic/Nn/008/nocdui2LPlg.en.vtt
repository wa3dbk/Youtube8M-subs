00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 hi friends today i will show you how 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:14.179
 build and clean petrol injectors 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.900
 the do it yourself then we have ours 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.210
 designator we have seen that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.470
 however it was clogged so we have it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.000
 found we find it okay 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:31.289
 I needed a piece of sauce of 10 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 diameter 10 magazine see it a scissor 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.600
 as an electrician or even the one who conceals 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.920
 within our equal sense I put 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.760
 a duct tape kucher one 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.309
 small strap 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.850
 but of the costs of this measure of the tube 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:57.019
 he must tighten it and more or less a meter 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.049
 of cable approximately normal cable which 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:04.610
 for houses and cars not too big 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:09.229
 thin as in the government itself a 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.860
 pay it in the face of the styles e 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.220
 rightly a product that is still the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.280
 rapporteur in this case I use the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.000
 manufacturer for cleaning product 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.270
 carburetor cleaner carburetors 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.990
 sales talked about carburetor 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:40.039
 those these sterile then can not tell us 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.470
 because even as little as you will see 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.229
 the fuel inlet connection 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.479
 in the engine it should be a diameter 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.800
 outside of 9 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.800
 and this is a bit fatiguing on this side 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:05.920
 we simply take a lighter 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 and we hope slightly the end that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:18.040
 we have to find her in the injector in 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:24.040
 so soften the rubber and let's go to 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:30.850
 visit it we are waiting for a reflection 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.940
 freda we see the rows of the band not 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:51.700
 abnormal headband is definitely got it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:53.230
 won by pushing the strap after you 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.049
 he will soon ask for much more 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.769
 in the final the product is like the forum is 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.769
 too large 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.220
 we will risk losing both pressure and 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.780
 product or wasted 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.519
 we see our insulator we must 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.739
 increase for a moment on the thickness of the 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.739
 debut of the family canister 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:47.700
 wanting to take away from us is important 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:53.610
 increase your dreams 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.610
 let's see how we put it on the table 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.680
 let's see the suvs 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:15.780
 we are in clear teeth this possible 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.780
 point we turn the tape in the oven to smoke 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.010
 to close the hole because it does not have 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:32.110
 reopened well we want passenger 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:34.920
 around the button between the canister 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.920
 go to your his 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.520
 make sure not to say a dispute 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:57.510
 the impression is reproduced I was attached 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.510
 to the can button 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:16.930
 I would say that the word having a 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:22.620
 at this point we take the two beams 1 in 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:29.710
 previously I entered them I entered 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:31.120
 remember to also use a new spin off 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.100
 I wish they were crushed 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:39.610
 because we have to connect to the two pins 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.640
 of the injector for others has become 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.910
 current we must take one 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.910
 any 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.720
 then this cable free 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.720
 here we do not connect it to the heart 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.100
 here we go
