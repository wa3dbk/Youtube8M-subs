00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.079
 ooijer 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.980
 The Rockers had to known today the thieves of Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.839
 timo study 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.949
 yes rule hear it is good in good timothy the crucial handled 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 97 knows and the judge is a player later faster than maze stats me 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 am, however, know 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.520
 9 9 ball reading Vienna has been forced to judge 8 and 9 to have located 9 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 finish up 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.110
 9 megaton shots 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.800
 you name it it is all just really sick high had to be quietest 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.530
 of course 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.270
 seeking support from a 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 33 speed 8 9 sprint speed it really everything is just that way 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.220
 she already let the plan know 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.270
 all going on 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.299
 but the manufacturer has made with and then I have the pluses and the 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.610
 negatives 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.000
 so that he again in the great church of Naarden 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.660
 yes plus and minus points of ronaldo 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.010
 care for a hefty however very big plus is of course 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 that is dribbling 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.440
 best player in between so high 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.890
 very beautiful piece 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 really rest 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 I think 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.240
 that it is just one of the best drummers and the game 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 I have used messi timothy and of course not 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.900
 I do have the normal messi and that 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.570
 dribbled well but I think it is rather a bastard with those five star skills 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.280
 yet 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.240
 otherwise drew bloom what you just dribble with knives 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.310
 but I think I'm going to shrink through five stars so much fun for the games 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.740
 of little balls with deep 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.250
 defenders and they try to blow out 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
 and then yes really that is also just trimbos and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.460
 they also got agents just so easily away alone 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.119
 the small disadvantage that is the point 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.239
 very small minus this 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.259
 is that it then? 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.399
 if he is good with the skills that he is then yes that are usually just not 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.809
 mid-March on the pole or the keeper picks him up to be neat and sized 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.459
 yes that is already by young people 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.989
 Here you can still see the power of Ronaldo, which is really incredibly high 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.259
 have really struggled to keep up 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.690
 and yes that is also true for the articles with that ps of him and then 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.519
 the power to it is very difficult 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.309
 to keep a still out of here really a wonderful long shot of ronaldo that 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.689
 year was one of the few weekend that scored nicely 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.079
 most were just about being certain type kept him like 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 that rabat was actually with the keeper, Joepie 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.859
 but I have had a reasonable chance with it, though 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.680
 yes it wasn't really that pretty how a dork that actually did a bit 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.319
 expected for ronaldo 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.189
 already delicious shot torture year crossing palin then he gets rebound in 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.509
 fortunately the score does 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.729
 but that is just a typical ronaldo that she simply finishes wonderfully 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.419
 and then 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:15.119
 yes that you see it a lot with him like here just away with a 9 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.449
 9 finish perfectly runs over the keeper 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.879
 sat this ball or society 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.230
 or the goalkeeper could just catch but baron though this is all so perfect 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.019
 That's why it's already healthy to keep your delicious volley with the atmosphere 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.429
 with the weak legs 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.889
 I have therefore experienced parcom and feel worthy to me just like five stars 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.240
 listen to spirit 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.369
 weak leg 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:41.329
 here again just with the power and ps of ronaldo wooden the defender again 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:41.730
 in 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.430
 and he will let it go until I can easily get my hands on it again 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.379
 have the shooting bonus of mezzo league for twente too 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.239
 total couple no how bothered that that was really dramatic 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.449
 they say four stars 8 you might as well be home to his habit 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.599
 yes I notice just about no difference here still the ps of ronaldo 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.360
 And yes, who still has a very minor disadvantage 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.659
 as the second half 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:06.959
 is busy 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.029
 then there is ronaldo 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.749
 nine out of ten times worse 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.749
 I do not know if that is possible that I will get a preview 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.229
 but of course he only has 80 stamina so it could well be that 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.079
 he just went to the first half 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.499
 yes actually wasted your strength that's a shame because yes 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.760
 it is actually that your people just play the whole law with heaven 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.210
 but unfortunately that will not work because that 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.830
 yes not mine has mine and is soon tired 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.029
 beware as well that was us with 92 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.090
 and the council 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.319
 I didn't really wash it with him but it just did 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.289
 for example, the chance is that I gave a ball and the rebound went in 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.569
 another such thing 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.490
 that is also not wrong that ramaker may nevertheless have a colossus and yes i have 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.599
 the europact penalties i had four and five years of summer the ronald i have one 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.120
 couple pulled out 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.930
 and 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.740
 yes you just shoot one without problems and the advantage is that you like you 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.800
 it all goes to homicide in area you just go nuts with that 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.050
 You just go stealing a ball or a turkey scoop 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.180
 And yes you have lived 9 out of 10 times to have to defend a penalty s such 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.289
 stupid rule to get in 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.839
 and there in itself an advantage 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.300
 because yes you can if you are a bit behind the competition 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.849
 just have a shit with him and then 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.580
 yes countries says cor again at the same level or year 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.559
 had that match win 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:29.910
 just here again 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.590
 the defender 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.069
 must have a way through it though 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.139
 he is just gone and there cancers or score themselves 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.400
 and that's so simple because of the alto 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.900
 get that free kick or penalty of course 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.360
 and we help 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.590
 Here's another nice stitch you can take with the keeper who fahlin jackets 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.920
 what 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.210
 and that sometimes happens but it was nice to join a government 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.780
 although all free kicks 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.919
 this follows 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.680
 Paal I haven't really had much of this song distance league 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.320
 Imagine that not very much for me I really did not have many chances to be with him 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.680
 take free kicks 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.780
 here comes a nice and quiet Quran 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.240
 and yes that was real 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.869
 just nice and cool 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:07.830
 then yes 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.090
 the gram here so all plus and minus put on a row but often one 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.979
 give the sec back to his employer and then continue with the 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.610
 minus and plus 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.150
 all that just to have a list of readers positive millers shot food 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.910
 second steal 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.069
 the four stars that are the example of spain 12 volts 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.529
 good free kicks 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.489
 penalties are really super a finishing is just perfect everything makes it that way 

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:35.219
 Whatever the strength within sixteen meters is good to keep defenders off 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.469
 and the downsides are that he gets tired really fast especially the second half 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.680
 all cost 4 million cage ditch ridiculously high 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.230
 and they don't feel like 2 9 what I have basically made the pole zero 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.750
 have been able to do with him 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.300
 yes I think that's a shame 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.830
 that's why I give a decent out of 8 out of 10 points 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.439
 and yes guys this was the playbook of team or animals crucial ronaldo 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:00.639
 I can tell you it was nice admit I have a thumbs up and I see you 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.899
 there at a next episode what time goal
