hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.340 
hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:02.790> we're<00:00:03.120> going<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.270> talk<00:00:03.330> about<00:00:03.600> how<00:00:04.319> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
segment we're going to talk about how to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.509 
segment we're going to talk about how to
plant<00:00:04.890> bamboo<00:00:05.430> as<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.120> screen<00:00:07.099> so<00:00:08.099> there's<00:00:08.280> many

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
plant bamboo as a screen so there's many

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.640 
plant bamboo as a screen so there's many
different<00:00:08.610> types<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.330> bamboos<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.500> when

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
different types of bamboos and so when

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.740 
different types of bamboos and so when
you're<00:00:10.769> deciding<00:00:11.070> which<00:00:11.460> variety<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.269> use<00:00:12.540> as

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
you're deciding which variety to use as

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.749 
you're deciding which variety to use as
a<00:00:12.809> screen<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.769> screen<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.219> your<00:00:14.370> neighbors

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
a screen to screen out your neighbors

the road the street a cliff whatever it
is<00:00:17.820> you've<00:00:18.570> got<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.930> make<00:00:19.080> sure<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.920> know

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
is you've got to make sure that you know

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.620 
is you've got to make sure that you know
which<00:00:20.340> type<00:00:20.550> you're<00:00:20.789> using<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
which type you're using and it's a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.179 
which type you're using and it's a
variety<00:00:22.020> that's<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.560> taller<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
variety that's going to get taller and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.730 
variety that's going to get taller and
there's<00:00:23.760> two<00:00:24.210> main<00:00:24.630> families<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.320> bamboos

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
there's two main families of bamboos

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.679 
there's two main families of bamboos
I'll<00:00:26.010> show<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:27.090> you've<00:00:27.269> got<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> make

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
I'll show you now you've got to make

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.939 
I'll show you now you've got to make
sure<00:00:27.720> there's<00:00:28.019> two<00:00:28.170> types<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.560> bamboos

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
sure there's two types of bamboos

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.429 
sure there's two types of bamboos
there's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> clumping<00:00:29.910> bamboos<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:31.050> stays

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
there's the clumping bamboos that stays

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.620 
there's the clumping bamboos that stays
more<00:00:31.859> compact<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:32.969> put<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
more compact you can put it right in the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.690 
more compact you can put it right in the
ground<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.620> generally<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.130> lot<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> them<00:00:35.550> get

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
ground they generally a lot of them get

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
ground they generally a lot of them get
really<00:00:36.090> tall<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.719> make<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.170> good

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
really tall and they make really good

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.020 
really tall and they make really good
screens<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.579> take<00:00:38.760> over

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
screens because they don't take over

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.459 
screens because they don't take over
into<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> neighbor's<00:00:39.600> yard<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.290> they

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
into the neighbor's yard at all they

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.920 
into the neighbor's yard at all they
stay<00:00:40.680> compact<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.940> you've<00:00:42.090> got<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> running

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
stay compact then you've got the running

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
stay compact then you've got the running
varieties<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> bamboos<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.000> of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
varieties of the bamboos and a lot of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
varieties of the bamboos and a lot of
them<00:00:45.270> stay<00:00:45.539> shorter<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:47.070> make<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
them stay shorter so they don't make a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459 
them stay shorter so they don't make a
good<00:00:47.550> screen<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> even<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> larger

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
good screen and even the larger

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
good screen and even the larger
varieties<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.070> make<00:00:50.579> great<00:00:50.820> screens<00:00:51.300> but

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
varieties they make great screens but

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.880 
varieties they make great screens but
you've<00:00:51.809> got<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.140> careful<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.620> they

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
you've got to be careful because they

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.350 
you've got to be careful because they
will<00:00:53.039> take<00:00:53.190> over<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> neighborhood<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.090> get

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
will take over the neighborhood and get

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880 
will take over the neighborhood and get
into<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> neighbor's<00:00:54.960> yard<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.590> down<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
into the neighbor's yard and down the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
into the neighbor's yard and down the
street<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.430> no<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.539> happy<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.020> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the ground and you want to just make

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
the ground and you want to just make
sure<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> root<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> covered<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
sure that the root is covered up but the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.100 
sure that the root is covered up but the
actual<00:01:13.920> greenery<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.909> exposed<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:15.990> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
actual greenery is exposed and so that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.749 
actual greenery is exposed and so that
as<00:01:16.229> easy<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.040> no<00:01:17.220> different<00:01:17.460> than

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
as easy as that it's no different than

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
as easy as that it's no different than
the<00:01:17.880> grass<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.450> lawn<00:01:18.630> whereas<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the grass in your lawn whereas if you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.370 
the grass in your lawn whereas if you
have<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.130> clumping<00:01:20.939> bamboos<00:01:21.479> they're<00:01:21.840> perfect

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
have a clumping bamboos they're perfect

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.320 
have a clumping bamboos they're perfect
for<00:01:22.470> screens<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.430> their<00:01:23.759> roots<00:01:24.000> don't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
for screens because their roots don't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
for screens because their roots don't
really<00:01:24.630> take<00:01:24.869> over<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.619> keep<00:01:25.799> them<00:01:25.979> in

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
really take over you can keep them in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.620 
really take over you can keep them in
containers<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.060> put<00:01:27.180> them<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:27.450> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
containers or you can put them right in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
containers or you can put them right in
the<00:01:27.720> ground<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.860> lot<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> varieties

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the ground and a lot of the varieties

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
the ground and a lot of the varieties
get<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.270> tall<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.930> there's<00:01:31.049> beautiful

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
get really tall and there's beautiful

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.490 
get really tall and there's beautiful
different<00:01:32.220> types<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.840> foliage<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.170> different
