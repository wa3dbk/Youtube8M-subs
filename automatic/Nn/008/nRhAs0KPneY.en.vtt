heavy heavy chopsticks I recommend

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.100

getting<00:02:16.610> something<00:02:17.000> more<00:02:17.330> along<00:02:17.570> those<00:02:17.780> lines

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
getting something more along those lines

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.930 
getting something more along those lines
which<00:02:18.680> are<00:02:18.830> hollow<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.310> nowhere<00:02:19.640> near<00:02:19.850> as

that<00:02:22.460> these<00:02:23.330> two<00:02:23.540> would<00:02:23.630> probably<00:02:23.990> weigh

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
that these two would probably weigh

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.050
