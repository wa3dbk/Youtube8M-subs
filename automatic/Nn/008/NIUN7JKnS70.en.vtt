an<00:01:19.020> idea<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.409> what's<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:21.180> type

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
an idea of what's going on and what type

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
an idea of what's going on and what type
of<00:01:21.390> controls<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.200> generated<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> how

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
of controls can be generated and how

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.060 
of controls can be generated and how
easy<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.229> generate<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.650> different

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
easy it is to generate these different

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.460 
easy it is to generate these different
models<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:27.270> nice<00:01:27.420> preview<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
models I get a really nice preview and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.399 
models I get a really nice preview and
update<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:30.180> these<00:01:30.420> different<00:01:30.990> changes

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
update as I make these different changes

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859 
update as I make these different changes
so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.820> what<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> geometry<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so I know what the geometry is going to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
so I know what the geometry is going to
look<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.049> before<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.829> generator<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> real

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
look like before I generator get a real

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
look like before I generator get a real
good<00:01:36.329> idea<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:37.470> save<00:01:37.770> time<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.579> generating

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
good idea to save time when generating

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.960 
good idea to save time when generating
these<00:01:39.360> these<00:01:39.630> complex<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.009> surface

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
these these complex the surface

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
these these complex the surface

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
i get a precise outcome what I what I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
i get a precise outcome what I what I
see<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.780> building<00:01:49.259> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
see is what I get when building this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.100 
see is what I get when building this
this<00:01:49.890> different<00:01:50.280> geometry<00:01:50.899> now<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> other

this different geometry now the other
thing<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.619> might<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.420> when

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
thing that I might want to do when

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.410 
thing that I might want to do when
working<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.869> these<00:01:55.140> components<00:01:55.829> is

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
working with these components is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.219 
working with these components is
possibly<00:01:57.420> i<00:01:57.509> might<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> make<00:01:58.020> some

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
possibly i might want to make some

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
possibly i might want to make some
changes<00:01:58.770> down<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.579> road<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> meant<00:02:00.479> what

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
changes down the road so I meant what

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.179 
changes down the road so I meant what
might<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> make<00:02:01.200> some<00:02:01.380> changes<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> some

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
might want to make some changes to some

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
might want to make some changes to some
of<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.369> original<00:02:02.490> sketch<00:02:03.180> geometry<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.380> in

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
of the original sketch geometry with in

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.249 
of the original sketch geometry with in
autodesk<00:02:05.130> inventor<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.759> very<00:02:06.000> easily<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.750> i

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
autodesk inventor and very easily if i

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
autodesk inventor and very easily if i
go<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.649> there<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.099> i<00:02:08.310> decide<00:02:08.640> i<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.000> go

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
go in there and i decide i want to go

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
go in there and i decide i want to go
ahead<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> change<00:02:09.629> some<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> ellipse

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
ahead and change some of the ellipse

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.700 
ahead and change some of the ellipse
features<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.930> component<00:02:13.379> or<00:02:13.440> change

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
features of this component or change

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220 
features of this component or change
the<00:02:13.890> dimensions<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.640> ellipse<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:15.230> I'm

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the dimensions on the ellipse here I'm

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.480 
the dimensions on the ellipse here I'm
going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.500> able<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.740> go<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.160> on<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
going to be able to go in there on the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.670 
going to be able to go in there on the
fly<00:02:17.700> make<00:02:17.970> these<00:02:18.180> changes<00:02:18.450> finish<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.620> up

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
fly make these changes finish that up

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.440 
fly make these changes finish that up
and<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.810> handle<00:02:21.920> automatically<00:02:22.920> build

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.500 
and have the handle automatically build
rebuild<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.780> me<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.340> don't<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> go<00:02:27.060> in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
rebuild for me so I don't have to go in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.740 
rebuild for me so I don't have to go in
there<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.920> worry<00:02:29.490> about<00:02:29.610> updating<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
there and and worry about updating the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.480 
there and and worry about updating the
different<00:02:31.110> loft<00:02:31.320> commands<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.920> geometry<00:02:32.430> is

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
different loft commands the geometry is

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.770 
different loft commands the geometry is
going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> update<00:02:32.850> automatically<00:02:33.540> now<00:02:33.750> I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
going to update automatically now I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.300 
going to update automatically now I
might<00:02:34.020> not<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.440> how<00:02:34.650> some<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.070> stuff

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
might not like how some of that stuff

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.640 
might not like how some of that stuff
turned<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.420> again<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.990> go<00:02:37.200> back<00:02:37.380> in

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
turned out so again I can go back in

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.430 
turned out so again I can go back in
there<00:02:37.860> after<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> fact<00:02:38.970> make<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.900> geometric

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
there after the fact make the geometric

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.080 
there after the fact make the geometric
conditions<00:02:40.920> or<00:02:41.070> geometric<00:02:41.490> changes<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.060> that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
conditions or geometric changes to that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.780 
conditions or geometric changes to that
model<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.720> then<00:02:43.110> update<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.340> assembly

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
model and then update the the assembly

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.120 
model and then update the the assembly
for<00:02:45.030> me<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.300> immediately<00:02:45.810> I've<00:02:46.230> built<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
for me and immediately I've built a the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.720 
for me and immediately I've built a the
single<00:02:47.550> lofted<00:02:48.270> component<00:02:49.460> around<00:02:50.460> the
