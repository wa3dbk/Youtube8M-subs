00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 good how about in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.270
 try to break all those myths that the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.410
 people are invented about the otakus the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.809
 truth is that they have a lot of imagination 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 listen to a lot of nonsense so 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.820
 I'm going to try to break all those myths 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.619
 fools that were invented for that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 Of course I am a drawing 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.419
 good i am happy 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.779
 we start new options that give you 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.779
 for ass 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.340
 d 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.260
 step of discussions also step of 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.750
 fights I just write songs where 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.190
 I express my ideas not only to begin 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.840
 I want to break the typical myth that 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.490
 people do not stop saying and I think the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.530
 greater nonsense than heard one day 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:59.690
 no no no no no drawings do not have 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.010
 what is it for young children for example 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.660
 I'm going to make a drawing that is not 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.760
 unanimous but that will also be worth you 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.740
 the simpsons are really a critic 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.570
 social to Americans because in the 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.250
 anime is the same as it has many 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.140
 genres I really believe that this the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.720
 people think about it because of the dubbing that 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.640
 We have especially in Spain in Spain 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.380
 the dubs are very bad but not because 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.060
 the people who double it but because 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.280
 they try to convert an anime with better 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.119
 for adults it was a drawing for 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.800
 Small children 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.770
 then the dubbing they do with 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.900
 silly words you have seen wampis 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.150
 bent in Spanish from españa ' estiras 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.530
 strip pulls until my arm pulls 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.049
 how do you do that there are animes for children 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.670
 but there are also animes for adults and 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.369
 if you do not see anime thinking that it is for 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.500
 small children I think you're an idiot what 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.330
 I feel but I think it's the truth another 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.369
 of the nonsense that I usually hear is 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.979
 that we are horny yes or 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.259
 yes we are horny if we get to 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.259
 lie and two if we are horny 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.549
 the clear mistake that we are horny but 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.240
 are not all the men of some 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.940
 women are also heard and there's nothing 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.380
 bad in being it is human nature the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.000
 people think this because normally 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.739
 when they get into their porn page 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.650
 favorite there's always a section that 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.660
 says sitting and then in their heads 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.950
 empty they think that we 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 we are all day 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.790
 dale that I hit you dale that I hit you dale 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 I hit you, I hit you and it's not like that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.709
 at least in my case, of course, it is always 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.780
 there is a typical sexual pervert but 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.069
 those are everywhere so you get 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.900
 put in your porn page and you see a 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.310
 Hentai section that does not mean that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.400
 we have all day watching 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.319
 people there is clear zeal that is there you if 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.819
 you want to see it and if not then I do not 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.380
 respect 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.790
 there what you do but I have clear 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.630
 that we are not more pages than 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.330
 others are equal 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.090
 they are like that and another myth that they say to me 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.150
 the people are typical of the animes and not 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.640
 it's worth nothing 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.890
 my mother how do you like to waste time 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.170
 and make it a football field and split 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.750
 the face with the opposite team yes 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.720
 that is worth something as I like 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.020
 your thoughts are ready yes 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.860
 sir and watch the trash is also worth 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.450
 for something this is also true for something not 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.520
 no but what it's worth for something really 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.209
 is to see the brother but as you see that and 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.190
 clear, and then weird, I'm not a mother 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.020
 mine in my life has taught me many 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.670
 values in yours I really do not know 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.320
 but I think it's worth more than all those 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.330
 things that I have told you if you are one of those who 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.709
 He says it's not worth anything, I advise you 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.110
 You see anime and you 'll see how you 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.970
 repent of what you said if you 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.010
 You will regret another myth that I am used to 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.070
 To say enough is that otaku are 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.470
 geeks and without social life and my question 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.450
 is you have ever gone to some 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.090
 exhibition or some manga room 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.769
 normally expositions or 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.110
 Sleeping rooms are usually bursting 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.930
 of people if you say that people 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.849
 They are drinks are geeks and without social life 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.859
 they are really judging us before 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.510
 know them because if you do not know 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.329
 someone like you know he has no life 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.950
 social you are worried about knowing him is 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.109
 very sad but people have a 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.799
 mold of how they have to be and if you 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.799
 you come out of that already 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.030
 and if they look weird they do not come near you 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.530
 but the fault is not of the otakus but 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.840
 of them and if they think we are 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.980
 geeks at a certain point I understand it already 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.390
 I 've seen several cosplays 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.150
 internet and the truth is that you had to 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.220
 laugh as many people disguise themselves as 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.930
 to make fun of the otakus not what 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.660
 I understand like a guy who weighs 200 kilos 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.280
 and with a beard here is disguised 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.230
 of sailor moon the truth is that I do not 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.760
 I understand but well I do not say anything every 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.650
 one with his life can do what 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.920
 want but do not judge a large number 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.690
 of people for a few please be 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.190
 coherent friend of mine and to finish 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.570
 I want to talk about the typical environment that 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.390
 it also has me very tired that is the 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.910

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.090

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.050

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.340

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.280
