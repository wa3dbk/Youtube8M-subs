fingers then I use reverse it and I
don't<00:01:40.470> hold<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> couple

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
don't hold it more on this a couple

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.730 
don't hold it more on this a couple
seconds<00:01:41.909> yeah<00:01:42.329> um<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> turns<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
seconds yeah um it turns out that the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.170 
seconds yeah um it turns out that the
longer<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:44.909> tighter

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
longer you go the more you just tighter

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.819 
longer you go the more you just tighter
them<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.479> pull<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.229> back<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.649> then

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
them out pull them back and then

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
them out pull them back and then
released<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:49.399> release<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> other<00:01:50.700> two<00:01:50.939> pull

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
released to release the other two pull

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.010 
released to release the other two pull
them<00:01:51.899> down<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.430> separate<00:01:54.000> them<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
them down and then I separate them this

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.340 
them down and then I separate them this
way<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.600> these<00:01:57.600> pretty<00:01:57.930> much<00:01:58.079> give<00:01:58.259> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
way and these pretty much give you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.160 
way and these pretty much give you
everything<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.829> need<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.270> get<00:02:00.270> stressed<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
everything you need to get stressed the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
everything you need to get stressed the
last<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.240> want<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> be

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
last thing I do is and you want to be

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.149 
last thing I do is and you want to be
careful<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.259> because<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
careful with this because now you do it

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.430 
careful with this because now you do it
for<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.310> while<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.969> been<00:02:06.030> pretty

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
for a while so I have been pretty

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.390 
for a while so I have been pretty
our<00:02:06.500> part<00:02:07.030> but<00:02:08.290> give<00:02:09.290> them<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.470> good<00:02:09.619> stretch<00:02:10.040> in

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
our part but give them a good stretch in

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.370 
our part but give them a good stretch in
between<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.880> again<00:02:14.150> only<00:02:14.570> open<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.110> couple<00:02:15.260> of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
between and again only open a couple of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.980 
between and again only open a couple of
seconds<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:15.830> do<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.870> after<00:02:17.870> everything

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
seconds I do that and after everything

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.780 
seconds I do that and after everything
I've<00:02:18.260> been<00:02:18.290> through<00:02:18.530> my<00:02:19.010> fingers<00:02:19.070> feel<00:02:19.610> as

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
I've been through my fingers feel as

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.400 
I've been through my fingers feel as
nimble<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.150> they<00:02:20.330> ever<00:02:20.510> have<00:02:20.810> been<00:02:21.140> playing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
nimble as they ever have been playing

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.920 
nimble as they ever have been playing
for<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> lot<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.950> years<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.360> play<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.810> for

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
for a lot of years and I can play it for

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.810 
for a lot of years and I can play it for
two<00:02:24.050> hours<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.380> night<00:02:24.620> without<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.100> problem<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.700> do

two hours a night without a problem I do

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.110 
two hours a night without a problem I do
this<00:02:26.120> before<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.840> after<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.710> play<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.970> I

this before and after I play and I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.000 
this before and after I play and I
recommend<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.660> do<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.810> same<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.500> vary

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
it up you'll find it works better for

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.500
