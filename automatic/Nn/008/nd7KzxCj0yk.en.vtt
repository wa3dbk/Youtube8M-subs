00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.870
 and how are we going to do this technique 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.539
 the transfer technique is done with 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.539
 this product called transit 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.970
 and that is used on laser photocopies 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.160
 worked on paper works the common paper 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.160
 of 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.590
 the fresh copier we can work 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.960
 the one of the person not because it can be that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 it clears a bit I will go every day 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 on paper 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 work and photocopy of the result 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.309
 It is guaranteed we can work with 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.440
 photocopies in black and white with 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.870
 color photocopies and photocopies that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 have text has to always be 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.269
 in a mirror because although the written letter 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 it's so short the other way around I'm going to work 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.920
 supporting the image then are the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.229
 young as two they exactly the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 stamps have the reverse of mind mark 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:10.970
 very good, let's apply the back 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.970
 league with a brush and quite a lot 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.180
 well, I want to make you a 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.210
 comment on the indications of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.420
 transmit bottle 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.940
 before it was done a little more 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.770
 complex had many more steps 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.330
 it gave me a little bit of work towards 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.060
 transfer now we're going to do it 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.360
 fast simple and simple way 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.860
 we have to apply 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.160
 the product we set the image did not work 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.440
 the printed part will go on the wood 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.250
 let's do enough pressure 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.510
 so that the paper is well stuck 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 so I do not have lumps and balloons 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.650
 that they are arriving in addition the surplus 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.390
 then removing the excess and without 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.229
 wait 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.470
 I will use almost with the same humidity 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.910
 that has the paper and the product I'm going 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.569
 to wet a little bit because with the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.180
 cameras and lights a little dries 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.260
 but this is not necessary do not wait 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.350
 directly apply the image and with the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.830
 moisture of the product look test for 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.910
 remove the pulp before the process 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.100
 I had six or eight hands between crossed 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.510
 wait for the drying came in hand and the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.800
 another one now it is not necessary to look 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.160
 you directly apply the product 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.430
 with enough quantity about that you're going to 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.060
 fix the image and then with the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.200
 moisture it has on paper 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:58.050
 while you're going to start floating 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.560
 of the pulp and in the case that it ends 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.819
 check out the whole family that is easy 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.819
 impeccable has no paper left 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.600
 impressive the only thing that remains is from 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.210
 the ink 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.790
 and you 're never going to break the image 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.100
 passing him because what I feel quite 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.680
 force look clear, refloating strong 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.960
 to eliminate everything almost do not give me that way 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.840
 Water 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.210
 a question that is bought faster 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.210
 that at home but with humidity is the 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.540
 product simply of failure 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.540
 leaks 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 You can do this even on a 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.709
 on a on a scratched background has already 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.099
 you can use it as the end of the 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.109
 I work like crazy that it was this 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.510
 then if you want, protect it with 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.010
 papers or with one more way behind 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.810
 the same thing you're going to do if you're working 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.810
 with some color photocopies 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:04.459
 very well 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.459
 impeccable 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.090
 grace is next
