00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.220
 next exercise 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.399
 which we will reach onopko 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:13.019
 and essentially lighter than the previous one 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.039
 plant tical point of view idle 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.240
 these glasses 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.800
 how does it differ from the previous in this 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.630
 topic 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.630
 three lots and recorded one at hand to me 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.039
 like at the same time 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.239
 respectively most 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.039
 fingers index and middle 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.760
 new bottom corner with is usually 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.790
 right thumb 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.610
 subsequent well that's related to 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.360
 upper voice respectively 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.800
 index and middle 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.950
 as I said by bending his fingers here in 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.960
 these joints should be monitored so that when 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.430
 no conclusion 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.590
 it would be like this 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.460
 twitching brush 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 so people war brush that is due 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.960
 fingers only at the expense of fingers 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.600
 there is no sound in 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.070
 in no case 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.480
 strain 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 here these here as i said is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.810
 at the same time 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.690
 and then he 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.690
 the subsequent notes in the answer are being executed 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.490
 index and middle fingers 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.570
 at the same time strictly at the same time not 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.730
 assuming what these expenses are 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.080
 so to speak however it does nothing 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.570
 fall asleep zykov 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.380
 that is, when the notes 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.730
 is played 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.910
 Gremio strictly want simultaneously 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.310
 what 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 on rasp so to speak 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.610
 Well, here she is of course in this exercise there 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.460
 should be guided 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 appreciation to all the rules 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.249
 I have already 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.360
 said that is from reno thousand 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.910
 on going from one consonance 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.750
 different today mini nokia fingers 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.940
 left hand 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.930
 on going from one consonance 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.730
 another can hold it 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.560
 of course they should stay in place 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.770
 Well, these are randomly initially CR shares 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.430
 who meet here and 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.280
 valid 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.229
 as soon as in one project 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.229
 this is the seventh some flat 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.819
 Well, here is the period of the EU results EU 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.429
 I think they should not you 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.109
 cause some question so here 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:22.670
 these 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.889
 in the seaside let's say in this project 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.099
 and acts on the data but here fsin 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.399
 but also around in motogp armenia 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:35.179
 Paris and their on the floor tons or 1 2 on 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.279
 the guitar and here it is a note in b flat is played 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.319
 respectively on a third country on 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.649
 third year 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.609
 and this is this flat 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.629
 according to the second string 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.259
 the second lot is played and these notes 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:50.459
 si 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.479
 and this time 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.169
 later played with all the more because 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:55.789
 these are flat and 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.609
 not by chance acts on it and there is a south 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.220
 Korea 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.500
 and there are other products for this particular 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.539
 strong 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.959
 through to the end since 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.059
 but the same goes for this 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.759
 so here too there are random experts 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 racing 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.139
 passing sharp and sharp 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.259
 accordingly, this period is not 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.029
 going in the third year 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.949
 on the third country of the world 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.389
 up sharp in the second year on the second shooting 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.209
 and here 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.349
 although the process of starting operations here is not 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.969
 stood 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.459
 but these previous 10 years for these minutes and 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.219
 here the same thing means it 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.039
 the event will take place on the third 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.739
 year 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.069
 on the third side and until sharp in the second year 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.379
 on the second page 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.379
 keep in mind that there is 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.339
 key marks 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:54.279
 operation fadeevich 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.849
 that means all notes 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.019
 called faa in all octaves 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.299
 should play a half tone 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.129
 input 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.490
 this is consonance 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.379
 third owner 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.189
 is played 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.889
 on 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.489
 third country 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.299
 to second degree 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.389
 stay young 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.459
 On 7 03 doctors here this place 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.090
 need to play in the seventh year 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.110
 This is what I wanted to say about 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.590
 data
