00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.150
 in the world there is a huge amount 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.290
 whose why is easier 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.819
 where only by plane you can fly 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.819
 but I'll get sick 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.819
 on one plane 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.599
 for takeoff and landing you need at least 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.209
 small hard surface 

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:29.140
 which to the area 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.519
 back in 1951 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.519
 Antonov Design Bureau 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.470
 Peter option multipurpose 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.400
 aircraft en 2 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.800
 to service areas of the extreme 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 north and far east 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.770
 There were strong zatulin 380 such aircraft 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.550
 analogues of which was not that distant 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.280
 time does not exist now 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.970
 all these planes with full dedication 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.280
 served then the full workings of his 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.700
 resource 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.470
 but the sixties seventies 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.770
 the era of widespread use 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.260
 production of seaplanes 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.810
 was discontinued 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.070
 there were times when fuel was valued at 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.170
 carbonated water level 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 and a plane ticket was cheaper than a ticket 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.960
 train sleeper 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.479
 at the same time production 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.060
 an 2 aircraft on a wheeled landing gear 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.659
 lasted until 1995 they were released 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.850
 about 15 thousand 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.030
 today in the cis countries 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.900
 Aircraft en 2 has about 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.979
 six thousand units half of which 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.159
 having sufficient resource over 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.650
 fifty percent and almost all of them are not 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.040
 operated at the same time north where 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.229
 other hard to reach 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810
 areas in dire need of 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.930
 relatively cheap kind of trance 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.800
 but the seaplane returned 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.280
 the operation of which is 2 to 3 times cheaper than 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.180
 twice 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.190
 land ankvab conversion 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.080
 for several hours 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.870

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.329
 is it possible not to the courtyard of the house 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.979
 the project has excellent flight qualities 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.189

 Planned mass production of seaplane 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:11.219
 I can not believe that such an aircraft 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.309
 only the past will remain 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.469
 he still 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:16.150
 have worked
