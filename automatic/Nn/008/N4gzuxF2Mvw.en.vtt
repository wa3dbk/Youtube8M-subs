00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.160 
learning online and to do it in a way
which<00:00:41.040> works<00:00:41.370> because<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
which works because we all know that you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.810 
which works because we all know that you
don't<00:00:43.320> want<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.739> use<00:00:43.950> technology<00:00:44.190> which

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
don't want to use technology which

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
don't want to use technology which
breaks<00:00:45.149> down<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.469> doesn't<00:00:46.620> work

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
breaks down or which just doesn't work

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.139 
breaks down or which just doesn't work
in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> classroom<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:47.910> great

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
in the classroom you can have great

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
in the classroom you can have great
ideas<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.590> work<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
ideas but if they don't work in the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.830 
ideas but if they don't work in the
classroom<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.550> no<00:00:50.700> good<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.660> what

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
classroom then no good and that's what

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.389 
classroom then no good and that's what
we're<00:00:52.110> researching<00:00:52.469> into<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.949> Cambridge

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
we're researching into a Cambridge

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.790 
we're researching into a Cambridge
University<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> things<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.590> try

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
University so one of the things we try

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
University so one of the things we try
to<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.100> personal<00:00:56.520> demons<00:00:57.000> project<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to do personal demons project was to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.760 
to do personal demons project was to
make<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:59.300> something<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.570> everybody<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.649> we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
make it something for everybody so we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.439 
make it something for everybody so we
got<00:01:01.920> something<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:03.000> sorts<00:01:03.359> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
got something in there but all sorts of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.000 
got something in there but all sorts of
different<00:01:03.510> styles<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> learning<00:01:04.409> would<00:01:04.799> use

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
different styles of learning would use

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.490 
different styles of learning would use
the<00:01:05.189> web<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.700> real<00:01:06.119> multimedia<00:01:06.869> potential

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the web for real multimedia potential

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
the web for real multimedia potential
we've<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.220> animation<00:01:09.000> we've<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.390> video

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
we've got animation we've got video

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.980 
we've got animation we've got video
we've<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.470> audio<00:01:10.740> we've<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.790> text<00:01:12.450> we've<00:01:12.810> got

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we've got audio we've got text we've got

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.570
