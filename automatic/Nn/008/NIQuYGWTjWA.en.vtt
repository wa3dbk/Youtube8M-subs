00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
advanced technique it's called the the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
advanced technique it's called the the
boost<00:01:03.449> jump<00:01:03.690> flying<00:01:04.110> thing<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.680> made<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.430> up

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
boost jump flying thing I made it up

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.480 
boost jump flying thing I made it up
right<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> over<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> water<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.460> down

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
like 80 rings probably 20 it's right

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.620 
like 80 rings probably 20 it's right
there<00:01:48.460> at<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.640> end<00:01:48.820> see<00:01:49.000> only<00:01:49.090> red<00:01:49.300> thing<00:01:49.479> and
