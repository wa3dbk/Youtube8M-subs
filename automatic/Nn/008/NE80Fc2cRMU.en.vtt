00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
fall asleep you do basically as much as

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.910

but<00:01:27.430> obviously<00:01:27.790> it<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.000> set<00:01:28.180> up<00:01:28.299> for<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.479> Sun

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
but obviously it the set up for the Sun

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.750 
but obviously it the set up for the Sun
so<00:01:28.930> it's<00:01:29.080> not<00:01:29.229> just<00:01:29.290> its<00:01:30.010> own<00:01:30.159> pokemon<00:01:30.640> it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
so it's not just its own pokemon it

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.609 
so it's not just its own pokemon it
relies<00:01:31.000> on<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.180> team<00:01:31.420> which<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.780> good<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.320> bad

I<00:01:32.680> guess<00:01:33.010> in<00:01:33.130> my<00:01:33.159> opinion<00:01:33.610> offensive<00:01:34.570> wise<00:01:34.810> I'd

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
I guess in my opinion offensive wise I'd

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.649 
I guess in my opinion offensive wise I'd
give<00:01:35.470> grass<00:01:35.890> types<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.460> three-drop<00:01:37.150> cheese<00:01:37.479> out

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
give grass types a three-drop cheese out

power<00:02:05.530> moves<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:06.100> mean<00:02:06.400> compared<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.270> fire

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
power moves I mean compared to fire

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.949 
power moves I mean compared to fire
types<00:02:07.869> they<00:02:08.079> do<00:02:08.139> not<00:02:08.439> have<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.979> ones

types they do not have a ones

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.380 
types they do not have a ones
move<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:10.829> just<00:02:11.249> pure<00:02:11.579> power<00:02:11.819> they<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.150> not

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
move that's just pure power they do not

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.869

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
hundred besides that power with but

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.129 
hundred besides that power with but
power<00:02:17.849> like<00:02:18.060> when<00:02:18.299> do<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.510> see<00:02:18.659> that<00:02:18.810> really

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
power like when do you see that really

power like when do you see that really
in<00:02:19.290> my<00:02:19.499> opinion<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.340> boost<00:02:20.639> grass<00:02:21.030> types

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
in my opinion to boost grass types

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
in my opinion to boost grass types
offensive<00:02:22.049> game<00:02:22.230> you're<00:02:22.530> gonna<00:02:22.680> need<00:02:22.889> a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
offensive game you're gonna need a

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.129 
offensive game you're gonna need a
busted<00:02:23.639> grass<00:02:23.909> type<00:02:24.180> move<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.569> mean<00:02:24.719> they<00:02:24.900> have

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
busted grass type move I mean they have

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.259 
busted grass type move I mean they have
Giga<00:02:25.889> Drain<00:02:26.129> which<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.549> pretty<00:02:26.760> good<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.180> my

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
Giga Drain which is pretty good in my

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.940 
Giga Drain which is pretty good in my
opinion<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:28.139> it's<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.439> not<00:02:28.709> powerful

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
opinion but it's just not powerful

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.470 
opinion but it's just not powerful
enough<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.579> mean<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.819> had<00:02:29.969> the<00:02:30.030> secondary

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
enough I mean you had the secondary

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.020 
enough I mean you had the secondary
effect<00:02:30.810> are<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.409> gain<00:02:31.650> HP<00:02:32.189> which<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.879> pretty

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
effect are you gain HP which is pretty

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.449 
effect are you gain HP which is pretty
cool<00:02:33.299> but<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.709> strong<00:02:35.040> enough<00:02:35.099> you

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
cool but it's just not strong enough you

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.409 
cool but it's just not strong enough you
know<00:02:35.549> what<00:02:35.579> I'm<00:02:35.730> trying<00:02:35.909> to<00:02:35.939> say<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.299> it's

more<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.689> a<00:02:36.750> defensive<00:02:37.200> move<00:02:37.349> now<00:02:37.590> when<00:02:37.739> you

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
more of a defensive move now when you

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.830 
more of a defensive move now when you

grass types need a really really busting

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
selection than that in my opinion fire

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.080 
selection than that in my opinion fire
types<00:02:48.659> have<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.049> range<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.829> fire<00:02:50.159> moves<00:02:50.549> flat

rather the defensive my opinion and
grass<00:03:12.959> types<00:03:13.199> could<00:03:13.409> be<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> threat<00:03:13.949> but

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
grass types could be a threat but

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.189 
grass types could be a threat but
honestly<00:03:15.090> grass<00:03:15.389> types<00:03:15.629> were<00:03:15.780> never<00:03:15.959> really

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
meant to be super offensive so they need

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.379 
meant to be super offensive so they need
something<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:20.009> know<00:03:20.129> more<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.879> catch<00:03:21.060> up<00:03:21.269> with

something you know more to catch up with

other Pokemon and grass ties want to get

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.369 
other Pokemon and grass ties want to get
better<00:03:23.489> defensively<00:03:24.269> they<00:03:24.569> would<00:03:24.810> need<00:03:25.049> a

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
better defensively they would need a

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.610 
better defensively they would need a

fire grass and water

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.210 
fire grass and water
I<00:04:19.500> mean<00:04:19.859> grass<00:04:20.130> types

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
I mean grass types

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.180 
I mean grass types
kind<00:04:21.579> of<00:04:21.820> at<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> disadvantage<00:04:22.270> because<00:04:22.930> they

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
kind of at a disadvantage because they

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.530 
kind of at a disadvantage because they
originally<00:04:24.190> when<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.580> play<00:04:24.820> as<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.060> little<00:04:25.270> kid

grass<00:04:26.170> types<00:04:26.530> get<00:04:26.770> demolished<00:04:27.250> by<00:04:27.370> fire<00:04:27.580> types

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
grass types get demolished by fire types

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.950 
grass types get demolished by fire types
you<00:04:28.030> know<00:04:28.120> what<00:04:28.210> I'm<00:04:28.270> trying<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:28.450> say<00:04:28.570> here<00:04:28.750> and

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
you know what I'm trying to say here and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.040 
you know what I'm trying to say here and
grass<00:04:29.410> types<00:04:29.710> if<00:04:29.950> they're<00:04:30.160> too<00:04:30.370> slow<00:04:30.870> they<00:04:31.870> can

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
grass types if they're too slow they can

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.540 
grass types if they're too slow they can
lose<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.380> water<00:04:32.590> types<00:04:32.860> because<00:04:33.010> water<00:04:33.310> types

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
lose to water types because water types

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.100 
lose to water types because water types
can<00:04:33.670> learn<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.940> high<00:04:34.030> speed<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.570> grass<00:04:34.810> types

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
can learn the high speed so grass types

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.010 
can learn the high speed so grass types
in<00:04:35.260> my<00:04:35.380> opinion<00:04:35.800> add<00:04:36.010> this<00:04:36.250> very<00:04:36.520> crucial<00:04:37.090> very

to think and it's more than just

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.680 
to think and it's more than just
battling<00:04:42.400> there's<00:04:42.580> more<00:04:42.850> skill<00:04:43.300> involved

Pokemon<00:04:44.350> than<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.620> would<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.460> that's

Pokemon than you would think and that's

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.360 
Pokemon than you would think and that's
a<00:04:46.510> prime<00:04:46.810> example<00:04:46.840> shown<00:04:47.620> in<00:04:47.740> grass<00:04:47.950> types<00:04:48.220> in

a prime example shown in grass types in
my<00:04:48.430> opinion<00:04:48.760> grass<00:04:49.000> types<00:04:49.270> add<00:04:49.570> more<00:04:50.460> thinking
