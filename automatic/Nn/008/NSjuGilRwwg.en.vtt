00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.740
 on the magazine website fish with us 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.830
 there were a few questions about 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.559
 bait runner and what is this reel like with 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.859
 work for her as well as settle I decided 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.920
 answer this question in our video 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.640
 application what is a coil with 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 by bayraner 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 the principle is the same as that of ordinary 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.500
 inertia- free coils, too, the spool even 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 front brake system here what 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.690
 business coil in the same 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.910
 stopper reverse rotor but this 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
 coils have additional brake 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.370
 system what is it here it just 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.739
 called the baytranner what it looks like 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.590
 comes back to i- u-bracket back 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.840
 which includes this mechanism and what 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.530
 makes this mechanism it frees 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.300
 shpulyu 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 see if byte is off 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 runmario does not work as usual 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.820
 insulation coil depending on 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.189
 brake clamp or go easy or 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.270
 the same when it frees the biker on 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:13.280
 shpule starts to rotate freely 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 giving the line but usually these reels 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 used when catching carp because 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.869
 if working with one front system 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.070
 brakes you already understand 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.310
 main line 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 under some fish certain let's say 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.439
 there are 10 kilogram carp and this one 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.869
 really new carb freely carry off 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.810
 this fishing rod with the coil when 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.590
 will bite because he will have a big 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.560
 resistance 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.180
 and if we enable bait runner spools 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.180
 is released and he can freely 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.119
 fishing line you just take the bait 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.670
 turn the handle from the stand 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.670
 bait runner turns off and coil 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.369
 It begins to operate normally as 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 and adjust the front brake system 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.890
 as well as normal and spinning 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.460
 reels attach the bait to something 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 there 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.950
 to a tree trunk for example we stretch 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:14.160
 fishing line and begin to slowly tighten 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.830
 brake until you feel it 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.200
 very strong tension a little bit 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.360
 let go of the brake and we are ready for fishing 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.550
 there is dramatically we will not tear at 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.790
 jerks fish or when powerful sweeps a 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.650
 then we can adjust 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.840
 bait runner here in the back 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 coil parts have special 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.640
 drummer for that turning into a left 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.060
 it weakens the side 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.840
 to stop the spool of turning to the right 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.690
 side gradually and and pinches that is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.780
 under the leash on your gear you can already 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.420
 adjust school spool freedom 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.050
 rotates freely so the carp will start 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.050
 pull the line and then in general you 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.480
 already starting to work in normal mode 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.239
 coils meaning you make a turn 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.370
 grip and the coil is already working like a 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.769
 spinning fishing or as float 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.320
 catching already due to front brake 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.500
 systems, well, I'll show for clarity 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:24.450
 how does the coil photo pull the forest something 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.850
 from here it is sharply under it 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.420
 there was a front brake adjustment 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.540
 systems and so under tension 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.140
 and now turn on bait runner someone she 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.360
 already gone loose general whole point 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
 baitrunner 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.170
 I hope that everything will be clear now 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.170
 anyone who wants to catch bait runner
