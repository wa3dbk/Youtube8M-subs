00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I think we've got it in the bank to be

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.690 
I think we've got it in the bank to be
honest<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.660> it's<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> ottomans<00:01:19.500> boys

version<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.630> bit<00:01:55.690> more<00:01:56.590> powering<00:01:57.159> inserted<00:01:57.600> in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
version a bit more powering inserted in

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.620 
version a bit more powering inserted in
a<00:01:58.690> high<00:01:58.869> resistance<00:01:59.440> level<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.420> rebbe

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
a high resistance level so the rebbe

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.410 
a high resistance level so the rebbe
guys<00:02:01.869> should<00:02:02.320> be<00:02:02.440> slightly<00:02:02.940> more<00:02:03.940> comparable

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420
