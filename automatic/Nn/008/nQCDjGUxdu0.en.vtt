hey<00:00:00.870> guys<00:00:01.170> in<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.500> tutorial<00:00:02.129> I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:03.060> to

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hey guys in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.869 
hey guys in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.570> how<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.020> create<00:00:04.529> fluid<00:00:05.430> effects

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
show you how to create fluid effects

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.310 
show you how to create fluid effects
using<00:00:06.750> Autodesk<00:00:07.379> Maya<00:00:08.120> 2013<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.750> i've<00:00:10.019> already

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
using Autodesk Maya 2013 so i've already

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.060 
using Autodesk Maya 2013 so i've already
launched<00:00:10.980> my<00:00:11.130> mire<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:12.500> the<00:00:13.500> first<00:00:13.740> thing<00:00:13.920> we

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
launched my mire so the first thing we

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.340 
launched my mire so the first thing we
need<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> do<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.790> create<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.719> create<00:00:15.870> new

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
need to do is to create to create new

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.980 
need to do is to create to create new
scene<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.970> then<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.480> need<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.779> go<00:00:18.930> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
scene in here so then we need to go to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.609 
scene in here so then we need to go to
the<00:00:19.369> fluid<00:00:20.369> section<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.000> choose<00:00:21.619> 3d

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the fluid section and choose 3d

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.150 
the fluid section and choose 3d
container<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.640> an<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.300> emitter<00:00:24.949> then<00:00:25.949> at

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
container with an with emitter then at

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.279 
container with an with emitter then at
the<00:00:26.340> moment<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.300> our<00:00:27.510> emitter

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the moment we can see our emitter

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.880 
the moment we can see our emitter
it's<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.070> hidden<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.289> to<00:00:31.289> display<00:00:31.710> our

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it's like hidden so to display our

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.970 
it's like hidden so to display our
emitter<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.579> need<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.880> go<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> basic

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
emitter we need to go to the basic

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.490 
emitter we need to go to the basic
emitter<00:00:34.980> attributes<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:36.059> choose

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
emitter attributes and then choose

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.530 
emitter attributes and then choose
instead<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.680> Omni<00:00:38.280> will<00:00:38.610> choose<00:00:38.940> volume<00:00:39.870> now

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
instead of Omni will choose volume now

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.069 
instead of Omni will choose volume now
will<00:00:42.540> reduce<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:45.079> fluid<00:00:46.079> drop<00:00:46.350> off<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.050> my

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
will reduce the fluid drop off to all my

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.360 
will reduce the fluid drop off to all my
so<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> way<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> zero<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:52.309> go<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so all the way to zero and then go to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.170 
so all the way to zero and then go to
the<00:00:53.610> fluid<00:00:53.969> shape<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:57.140> at<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> moment<00:00:58.770> our

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
the fluid shape so at the moment our

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.369 
the fluid shape so at the moment our
base<00:01:00.180> resolution<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.109> set<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.180> zero<00:01:03.180> no<00:01:03.870> sorry

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
base resolution is set to zero no sorry

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.719 
base resolution is set to zero no sorry
it's<00:01:04.979> set<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> ten<00:01:06.170> we'll<00:01:07.220> increase<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> base

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it's set to ten we'll increase the base

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
it's set to ten we'll increase the base
resolution<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.479> fourteen<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:12.409> we'll

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
resolution to fourteen and then we'll

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.429 
resolution to fourteen and then we'll
also<00:01:13.920> set<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.700> auto<00:01:15.180> resize<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.869> we<00:01:18.869> we

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
also set to auto resize and then we we

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380 
also set to auto resize and then we we
need<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> content<00:01:20.520> details<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.240> do

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
need to go to the content details and do

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.499 
need to go to the content details and do
some<00:01:21.630> settings<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.270> moment

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
some settings in here so at the moment

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.420 
some settings in here so at the moment
we<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> too<00:01:26.610> much<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:27.860> smoke<00:01:28.860> because

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
we can see it too much our smoke because

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.929 
we can see it too much our smoke because
it's<00:01:29.810> we<00:01:30.810> need<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.650> shaded<00:01:32.159> mode<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it's we need to go to the shaded mode to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.289 
it's we need to go to the shaded mode to
do<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.439> yeah<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.100> either<00:01:35.340> press<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.850> v

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
do that yeah you can either press the v

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.140 
do that yeah you can either press the v
button<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.369> press<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.850> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
button and or you can press on this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.510 
button and or you can press on this
smooth<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.259> shade<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.750> we'll<00:01:42.750> increase<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
smooth all shade then we'll increase the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.109 
smooth all shade then we'll increase the
keyframe<00:01:44.869> number<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> keyframes<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.060> now<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
keyframe number of keyframes and now you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.780 
keyframe number of keyframes and now you
can<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> smoke<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.399> too

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
can see the smoke but it's too

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.250 
can see the smoke but it's too
it<00:01:53.790> doesn't<00:01:54.120> look<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.450> realistic<00:01:55.020> smoke

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
it doesn't look like a realistic smoke

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.070 
it doesn't look like a realistic smoke
so<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.550> some<00:01:56.580> settings<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.330> then

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
so we will do some settings and then

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.040 
so we will do some settings and then
I'll<00:01:58.710> go<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.220> density<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.210> content

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
I'll go to the density and content

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.240 
I'll go to the density and content
details<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.250> density<00:02:02.670> section<00:02:03.830> we'll<00:02:04.830> set

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
details in the density section we'll set

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.340 
details in the density section we'll set
that<00:02:05.540> dissipation<00:02:06.560> zero<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:08.300> five<00:02:09.350> hundred

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
that dissipation zero point five hundred

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.720 
that dissipation zero point five hundred
and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:12.230> we'll<00:02:13.230> increase<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.920> noise<00:02:14.340> as

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and then we'll increase the noise as

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:22.550 
and then we'll increase the noise as
well<00:02:17.810> then<00:02:18.810> go<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.730> velocity<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.300> set<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
well then go to the velocity and set the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.260 
well then go to the velocity and set the
villa<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.100> swirled<00:02:23.730> section<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.959> -<00:02:25.650> about<00:02:25.860> -

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
villa the swirled section to - about -

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.990 
villa the swirled section to - about -
1000<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:28.320> then<00:02:28.500> turbulence<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.490> well<00:02:29.670> but

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
1000 and then turbulence as well but

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.180 
1000 and then turbulence as well but
actually<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.020> don't<00:02:31.200> need<00:02:31.470> turbulence<00:02:32.070> that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
actually we don't need turbulence that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.190 
actually we don't need turbulence that
much<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.820> we'll<00:02:33.060> choose<00:02:34.280> zero<00:02:35.280> point<00:02:35.580> zero

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
much so we'll choose zero point zero

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.040 
much so we'll choose zero point zero
down<00:02:37.700> 50<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.560> speed<00:02:40.950> must<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:43.610> zero<00:02:44.610> point

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
down 50 and the speed must be zero point

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.010 
down 50 and the speed must be zero point
100<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.680> temperature<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.840> temperature

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
100 the temperature of the temperature

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.310 
100 the temperature of the temperature
is<00:02:49.640> unavailable<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:50.700> because<00:02:51.239> we<00:02:51.900> need<00:02:52.080> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
is unavailable now because we need to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.030 
is unavailable now because we need to
set<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:53.280> temperature<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.300> here<00:02:54.330> as<00:02:55.040> dynamic

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
set the temperature in here as dynamic

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.660 
set the temperature in here as dynamic
instead<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.640> off<00:02:56.820> zero<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.500> we'll<00:02:59.070> use<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
instead of off zero so we'll use the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.880 
instead of off zero so we'll use the
temperature<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.970> fuel<00:03:02.970> as<00:03:03.180> well<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.290> go

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
temperature and the fuel as well so go

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.789 
temperature and the fuel as well so go
back<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.540> temperature<00:03:06.540> settings<00:03:07.049> and

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
back to the temperature settings and

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.580 
back to the temperature settings and
then<00:03:07.980> dissipation<00:03:08.730> must<00:03:09.030> be<00:03:09.269> like<00:03:12.590> 0.55

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
then dissipation must be like 0.55

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.860 
then dissipation must be like 0.55
hundred<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.670> then<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.810> noise<00:03:16.140> must<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:17.870> zero

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
hundred and then a noise must be zero

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.600 
hundred and then a noise must be zero
point<00:03:19.049> five<00:03:19.380> five<00:03:19.650> thousand<00:03:20.340> five<00:03:21.330> hundred<00:03:22.610> so

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
point five five thousand five hundred so

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.339 
point five five thousand five hundred so
let's<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.150> what<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.420> looks<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:24.810> now

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.860 

now<00:03:30.980> we<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.400> see<00:03:31.609> something<00:03:31.879> that<00:03:32.090> looks<00:03:32.329> like

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
now we can see something that looks like

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.629 
now we can see something that looks like
a<00:03:32.930> smoke<00:03:34.209> but<00:03:35.209> it's<00:03:35.510> too<00:03:35.930> wide<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.499> we<00:03:37.099> need<00:03:37.430> to

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
a smoke but it's too wide so we need to

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.839 
a smoke but it's too wide so we need to
change<00:03:37.999> the<00:03:38.239> color<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.930> our<00:03:39.290> smoke<00:03:39.829> to<00:03:40.489> do<00:03:40.639> that

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
change the color of our smoke to do that

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:53.619 
change the color of our smoke to do that
go<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.450> arm<00:03:42.129> shading<00:03:43.359> now<00:03:44.359> sorry<00:03:44.689> go<00:03:45.439> to<00:03:52.629> to

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
go to the arm shading now sorry go to to

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:02.400 
go to the arm shading now sorry go to to
do<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:54.019> go<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.349> the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.010 

color<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.840> then<00:04:04.840> click<00:04:05.770> on<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.160> white<00:04:07.020> color

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
color and then click on this white color

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.910 
color and then click on this white color
and<00:04:08.440> then<00:04:08.770> choose<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.580> color<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.300> want<00:04:10.920> in

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
and then choose the color you want in

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.480 
and then choose the color you want in
this<00:04:12.100> case<00:04:12.310> we'll<00:04:12.610> choose<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:13.030> dark<00:04:13.990> color

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
this case we'll choose it dark color

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:23.090 
this case we'll choose it dark color
then<00:04:15.490> go<00:04:18.360> click<00:04:19.360> on<00:04:19.540> this<00:04:19.720> right<00:04:20.380> arrow<00:04:21.150> then

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
then go click on this right arrow then

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.290 
then go click on this right arrow then
just<00:04:24.100> drag<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.790> almost<00:04:25.150> all<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.450> way<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.780> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
just drag it almost all the way to the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.200 
just drag it almost all the way to the
red<00:04:28.860> color<00:04:32.190> then<00:04:33.190> see<00:04:33.430> what<00:04:33.640> it<00:04:33.730> looks<00:04:34.000> like

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
red color then see what it looks like

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.440 
red color then see what it looks like
now<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:37.570> can<00:04:37.780> press<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.170> playback<00:04:38.650> button

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
now you can press the playback button

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:49.059 
now you can press the playback button
whenever<00:04:40.450> you<00:04:40.840> can

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.949 

it<00:04:50.069> looks<00:04:50.339> like<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.759> dissipation<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.629> our

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:51.959 
it looks like the dissipation of our

00:04:51.959 --> 00:05:00.559 
it looks like the dissipation of our
density<00:04:52.529> is<00:04:53.129> to<00:04:54.089> love<00:04:54.449> so<00:04:55.139> we'll<00:04:59.119> set<00:05:00.119> it<00:05:00.270> back

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
density is to love so we'll set it back

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.730 
density is to love so we'll set it back
to<00:05:00.629> zero

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.050 

then<00:05:06.310> see

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.880 

it<00:05:09.480> looks<00:05:09.780> like<00:05:09.960> something<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.890> fire<00:05:12.530> go<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:13.590> the

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
it looks like something a fire go to the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.810 
it looks like something a fire go to the
Container<00:05:15.560> properties<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.860> then<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.370> choose

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
Container properties and then I choose

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.060 
Container properties and then I choose
some<00:05:18.210> set<00:05:19.110> some<00:05:19.490> higher<00:05:20.490> resolution

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
some set some higher resolution

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:31.629 
some set some higher resolution
let's<00:05:23.070> choose<00:05:27.170> 1810<00:05:28.170> see

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:39.670 

now<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.240> looks<00:05:32.389> like<00:05:32.689> a<00:05:32.840> fire

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:47.620 

you<00:05:40.220> can<00:05:40.400> also<00:05:40.639> preview<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.540> on<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:42.380> render

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.730 

and<00:05:49.990> we'll<00:05:50.990> set<00:05:51.230> it<00:05:51.700> will<00:05:53.410> reduce<00:05:54.410> the

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
and we'll set it will reduce the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.620 
and we'll set it will reduce the
resolution<00:05:54.920> best<00:05:55.520> because<00:05:55.760> we<00:05:55.940> need<00:05:56.300> to<00:05:56.480> do

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
resolution best because we need to do

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.030 
resolution best because we need to do
some<00:05:56.900> more<00:05:57.080> settings<00:05:57.710> in<00:05:57.980> container<00:05:58.790> details

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
some more settings in container details

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.300 
some more settings in container details
right<00:06:01.040> now<00:06:01.340> it<00:06:01.610> looks<00:06:02.590> it<00:06:03.590> looks<00:06:03.830> like<00:06:04.070> we're

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
right now it looks it looks like we're

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.700 
right now it looks it looks like we're
getting<00:06:04.520> somewhere<00:06:05.000> but<00:06:05.450> well<00:06:06.410> we<00:06:07.340> have<00:06:07.660> more

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
getting somewhere but well we have more

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.870 
getting somewhere but well we have more
things<00:06:09.710> to<00:06:09.980> do<00:06:10.100> on<00:06:10.310> this<00:06:10.550> fluid<00:06:11.090> fire<00:06:12.370> in<00:06:13.370> each

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
things to do on this fluid fire in each

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.380 
things to do on this fluid fire in each
of<00:06:14.060> these<00:06:14.210> sections<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:15.910> that's<00:06:16.910> all<00:06:17.150> for<00:06:17.330> this

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
of these sections so that's all for this

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.010 
of these sections so that's all for this
tutorial

and we will continue working on this

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.800 
and we will continue working on this
fluid<00:06:21.830> so<00:06:22.220> don't<00:06:22.520> forget<00:06:22.670> to<00:06:22.970> subscribe<00:06:23.570> and

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810
