00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.870 

okay<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:08.740> just<00:01:09.070> looking<00:01:09.310> at<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.640> here

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
initially looks like this frame this

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.400 
initially looks like this frame this
frame<00:01:16.360> housing<00:01:16.960> here<00:01:17.229> is<00:01:17.410> all<00:01:17.590> metal<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:20.350> is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
frame housing here is all metal this is

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.320 
frame housing here is all metal this is
plastic<00:01:21.160> pulleys<00:01:21.670> are<00:01:21.820> made<00:01:21.940> out<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.119> plastic

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
plastic pulleys are made out of plastic

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.389 
plastic pulleys are made out of plastic
here<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:26.110> housing<00:01:26.560> here<00:01:26.890> is<00:01:27.009> made<00:01:27.190> out<00:01:27.369> of

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
here this housing here is made out of

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.749 
here this housing here is made out of
plastic<00:01:27.729> as<00:01:28.119> well<00:01:32.220> looks<00:01:33.220> like<00:01:33.369> it's<00:01:33.610> pretty

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
plastic as well looks like it's pretty

00:01:33.759 --> 00:02:13.390 
plastic as well looks like it's pretty
well<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:37.240> the<00:02:03.900> leg<00:02:04.900> straps<00:02:09.179> grips

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.690 

so<00:02:15.530> that's<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.710> x-factor<00:02:17.100> right<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so that's the x-factor right out of the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.110 
so that's the x-factor right out of the
box<00:02:21.800> looks<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.100> resistance<00:02:23.580> bands<00:02:23.880> are

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
box looks like the resistance bands are

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.640 
box looks like the resistance bands are
like<00:02:24.360> wrapped<00:02:25.820> retyped<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:28.520> plastic<00:02:30.650> my

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
like wrapped retyped in this plastic my

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.620 
like wrapped retyped in this plastic my
first<00:02:33.770> initial<00:02:34.770> thought<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.510> cutting<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
first initial thought is cutting the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.570 
first initial thought is cutting the
bottom<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.320> get<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.590> your<00:02:38.060> cut<00:02:39.060> these<00:02:39.240> open<00:02:39.450> but

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.060 

want<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.700> careful<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:46.040> don't<00:02:48.860> cut<00:02:49.860> into

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
want to be careful you don't cut into

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.520 
want to be careful you don't cut into
the<00:02:50.400> bands<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.130> would<00:02:53.460> just<00:02:53.610> stay<00:02:54.530> pullback

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the bands so I would just stay pullback

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:18.590 
the bands so I would just stay pullback
on<00:02:55.740> these<00:02:57.650> bands<00:02:58.650> out<00:02:58.980> first<00:03:17.360> go<00:03:18.360> ahead<00:03:18.420> and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
on these bands out first go ahead and
