00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.400 

this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.319> box<00:00:01.589> method<00:00:02.360> okay<00:00:03.360> put<00:00:04.290> the

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
this is the box method okay put the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.010 
this is the box method okay put the
first<00:00:04.650> term<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.220> box<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.420> last<00:00:06.690> curve

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
first term in box a and the last curve

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.570 
first term in box a and the last curve
in<00:00:07.170> Bacchus<00:00:07.379> key

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:24.570 

multiply<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:16.640> first<00:00:16.939> and<00:00:17.180> last<00:00:17.390> turn

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.150 

the<00:00:24.910> product<00:00:25.390> should<00:00:25.900> be<00:00:26.050> factored<00:00:26.590> in<00:00:26.950> these

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
the product should be factored in these

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.620 
the product should be factored in these
numbers<00:00:27.400> should<00:00:27.850> equal<00:00:28.180> 19

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.300 

there<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:34.170> four<00:00:34.440> people<00:00:34.560> right<00:00:34.860> there

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
there is just four people right there

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.250 
there is just four people right there
like<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.580> get<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> shut<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.060> I<00:00:36.390> should<00:00:36.750> equal<00:00:36.960> 19

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
like we get a shut up I should equal 19

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.950 
like we get a shut up I should equal 19
it's<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.740> negative<00:00:37.920> 19<00:00:38.810> okay

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it's because it's negative 19 okay

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's because it's negative 19 okay
we're<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.380> factoring<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:46.400> so<00:00:48.260> put<00:00:49.260> each<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
we're just factoring here so put each of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.610 
we're just factoring here so put each of
these<00:00:50.129> terms<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.820> box<00:00:51.150> see<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.750> Box<00:00:52.020> B<00:00:52.200> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
these terms in box see in Box B it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
these terms in box see in Box B it
doesn't<00:00:52.980> matter<00:00:53.129> which<00:00:53.370> term<00:00:53.640> goes<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> which

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
doesn't matter which term goes in which

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
doesn't matter which term goes in which
box<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.290> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> work<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
box so I'm going to work out to be the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.060 
box so I'm going to work out to be the
same

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
same

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.360 
same
now<00:00:58.700> we<00:00:59.120> need<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.420> find<00:00:59.630> a<00:00:59.960> common<00:01:00.560> multiple<00:01:00.829> of

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
now we need to find a common multiple of

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.740 
now we need to find a common multiple of
box<00:01:02.060> B<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.630> Boxey<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:05.000> common<00:01:05.330> multiple<00:01:05.720> here

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
box B and Boxey the common multiple here

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.990 
box B and Boxey the common multiple here
I<00:01:06.050> believe<00:01:06.440> would<00:01:06.710> be<00:01:06.890> too<00:01:07.400> negative<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:10.000> now

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
I believe would be too negative and now

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.700 
I believe would be too negative and now
we<00:01:11.630> need<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.840> find<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:12.080> common<00:01:12.260> multiple<00:01:12.680> for

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
we need to find a common multiple for

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.060 
we need to find a common multiple for
Box<00:01:13.040> B<00:01:13.340> involve<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:14.290> common<00:01:15.290> multiple<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:15.770> going

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
Box B involve a common multiple is going

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.680 
Box B involve a common multiple is going
to<00:01:16.190> be<00:01:16.660> K<00:01:18.850> okay<00:01:19.850> now<00:01:20.180> we<00:01:20.240> need<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.450> find<00:01:20.570> a

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
to be K okay now we need to find a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.290 
to be K okay now we need to find a
common<00:01:20.869> multiple<00:01:21.410> for<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.740> foxy<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.550> a<00:01:25.240> now<00:01:26.240> we

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
common multiple for it foxy and a now we

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.060 
common multiple for it foxy and a now we
need<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.600> find<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:26.840> common<00:01:27.050> multiple<00:01:27.619> for<00:01:27.650> BOTS

need to find a common multiple for BOTS

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.399 
need to find a common multiple for BOTS
D<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.850> B

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.430 

right<00:01:33.100> now<00:01:33.549> we<00:01:34.090> need<00:01:34.270> to

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.550 

multiply<00:01:40.370> them<00:01:40.550> out<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.360> know<00:01:41.800> just<00:01:42.800> straight

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
multiply them out you know just straight

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:53.530 
multiply them out you know just straight
the<00:01:44.510> 3k

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.710 

and<00:01:54.050> use<00:01:55.060> distributive<00:01:56.060> property<00:01:56.480> you<00:01:56.600> can

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
and use distributive property you can

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.010 
and use distributive property you can
foil<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.200> out<00:01:58.180> no<00:01:59.180> it's<00:01:59.420> going<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.720> solve<00:01:59.930> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
foil that out no it's going to solve the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:09.889 
foil that out no it's going to solve the
problem<00:02:00.350> through<00:02:00.500> now

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.089 

don't<00:02:10.899> bring<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.500> walk<00:02:11.739> away<00:02:11.950> close<00:02:12.579> shut<00:02:14.099> do

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
don't bring the walk away close shut do

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.630 
don't bring the walk away close shut do
this<00:02:15.250> again<00:02:15.549> outside<00:02:16.480> or<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.049> go<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> dog

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
this again outside or you go like a dog

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.330 
this again outside or you go like a dog
I<00:02:19.000> guess<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.260> other<00:02:20.500> ones<00:02:20.769> are<00:02:20.920> kept<00:02:21.129> on<00:02:21.159> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
I guess the other ones are kept on the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.360 
I guess the other ones are kept on the
ground<00:02:21.579> it's<00:02:21.909> kind<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.090> fishy<00:02:22.480> manga<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:24.280> got

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
ground it's kind of fishy manga you got

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.470 
ground it's kind of fishy manga you got
I<00:02:24.400> mean<00:02:24.579> yeah

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.199 

nope<00:02:28.629> no<00:02:28.959> they're<00:02:29.470> gonna<00:02:29.560> hear<00:02:29.769> up<00:02:29.859> all<00:02:29.980> this

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
nope no they're gonna hear up all this

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.740 
nope no they're gonna hear up all this
 hello<00:02:31.720> fins<00:02:36.120> social<00:02:37.120> indicate<00:02:37.569> so

 hello fins social indicate so
that's<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.109> answer

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
that's the answer

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.440 
that's the answer
and<00:02:39.519> look<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:41.170> writing<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.799> kids<00:02:42.209> know<00:02:43.209> here

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
and look it writing the kids know here

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.960 
and look it writing the kids know here
guys<00:02:43.750> um<00:02:44.109> you<00:02:44.829> know<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.010> need<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> negative<00:02:45.730> 5

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
guys um you know you need a negative 5

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.909 
guys um you know you need a negative 5
instead<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:46.659> positive<00:02:46.870> 5<00:02:47.290> here<00:02:47.590> because

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
instead of a positive 5 here because

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.030 
instead of a positive 5 here because
negative<00:02:48.340> 5<00:02:48.579> times<00:02:49.450> positive<00:02:49.810> 3<00:02:50.349> K<00:02:50.590> equals

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
negative 5 times positive 3 K equals

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.089 
negative 5 times positive 3 K equals
negative<00:02:51.220> 15<00:02:51.549> K<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.769> here<00:02:53.769> we<00:02:53.919> need<00:02:54.040> a

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
negative 15 K and here we need a

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.250 
negative 15 K and here we need a
positive<00:02:54.549> 2<00:02:54.730> K<00:02:54.970> versus<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.599> negative<00:02:55.750> 2<00:02:56.049> K

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
positive 2 K versus the negative 2 K

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.199 
positive 2 K versus the negative 2 K
because<00:02:56.650> 2k<00:02:57.579> x<00:02:58.419> 3k<00:02:59.079> equals<00:02:59.379> 6<00:02:59.919> K<00:03:00.159> squared<00:03:00.549> we

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
because 2k x 3k equals 6 K squared we

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.059 
because 2k x 3k equals 6 K squared we
need<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.359> negative<00:03:01.599> 5<00:03:01.959> here<00:03:02.260> comes<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.680> negative

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
need a negative 5 here comes a negative

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.159 
need a negative 5 here comes a negative
2<00:03:03.340> because<00:03:03.879> they<00:03:04.150> cancel<00:03:04.450> out<00:03:04.689> to<00:03:04.840> be<00:03:04.959> positive

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
2 because they cancel out to be positive

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.789 
2 because they cancel out to be positive
10<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.919> you<00:03:06.519> need<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:07.139> 2k<00:03:08.139> here<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> negative

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799
