all<00:00:01.469> right<00:00:01.589> new<00:00:01.740> blower<00:00:01.979> motor<00:00:02.340> resistor<00:00:02.520> in

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
all right new blower motor resistor in

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.630 
all right new blower motor resistor in
that's<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.990> new<00:00:04.140> one<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.310> old<00:00:05.460> one

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
that's the new one this is the old one

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.960 
that's the new one this is the old one
and<00:00:05.700> actually<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.960> old<00:00:07.109> one<00:00:07.290> doesn't<00:00:07.970> doesn't

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
and actually the old one doesn't doesn't

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.169 
and actually the old one doesn't doesn't
look<00:00:09.240> too<00:00:09.480> terrible<00:00:10.070> I've<00:00:11.070> seen<00:00:11.400> them<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.790> lot

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
look too terrible I've seen them a lot

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.010 
look too terrible I've seen them a lot
worse<00:00:12.450> than<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.200> actually<00:00:13.440> looks

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
worse than this this actually looks

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.269 
worse than this this actually looks
looks<00:00:16.020> pretty<00:00:16.289> good<00:00:17.060> sometimes<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.720> them

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
looks pretty good sometimes you see them

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.509 
looks pretty good sometimes you see them
this<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:21.060> ceramic<00:00:21.720> wrapping<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.310> all

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
this the ceramic wrapping here is is all

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.370 
this the ceramic wrapping here is is all
broken<00:00:23.970> apart<00:00:25.099> these<00:00:26.269> contacts<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.630> all

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
broken apart these contacts are all

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.600 
broken apart these contacts are all
rusted<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.199> looks<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.610> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
rusted out and this one looks like this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.270 
rusted out and this one looks like this
one<00:00:32.730> looks<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.480> fairly<00:00:34.280> fairly

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
one looks like it's in fairly fairly

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.100 
one looks like it's in fairly fairly
good<00:00:35.579> condition<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.239> don't<00:00:36.300> know<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.809> this

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
good condition I don't know this this

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.200 
good condition I don't know this this
may<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.980> been<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.190> replacement<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:39.000> some

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
may have been a replacement at some

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.260 
may have been a replacement at some
point<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.790> here's<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.300> got<00:00:44.270> just

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
point as well so here's what we got just

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.700 
point as well so here's what we got just
to<00:00:45.360> verify<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:47.719> our<00:00:48.719> test<00:00:49.379> leads

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to verify here we have our test leads

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150 
to verify here we have our test leads
hooked<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.660> negative<00:00:52.379> positive<00:00:52.739> going

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
hooked up to a negative positive going

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.330 
hooked up to a negative positive going
after<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> blower<00:00:53.699> motor<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.719> right<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.340> we

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
after the blower motor so right now we

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.030 
after the blower motor so right now we
have<00:00:57.079> 0<00:00:58.079> volts<00:01:02.420> speed<00:01:03.420> 1<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> hear<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
have 0 volts speed 1 you can hear the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.860 
have 0 volts speed 1 you can hear the
blower<00:01:05.220> motor<00:01:05.549> running<00:01:06.590> 2<00:01:09.470> 3

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
blower motor running 2 3

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.100 
blower motor running 2 3
for<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.730> have<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.480> about<00:01:15.600> nine<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
for and we have just about nine and a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.770 
for and we have just about nine and a
half<00:01:16.140> volts<00:01:16.620> which<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.860> uh<00:01:17.180> which<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> correct

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
half volts which is uh which is correct

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.180 
half volts which is uh which is correct
and<00:01:19.050> just<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:20.960> just<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> verify<00:01:22.620> this<00:01:22.680> here

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
and just to just to verify this here

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.980 
and just to just to verify this here
because<00:01:23.370> sometimes<00:01:24.000> these<00:01:24.210> blower<00:01:24.480> motors

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
because sometimes these blower motors

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.300 
because sometimes these blower motors
what<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.260> happen<00:01:25.620> is<00:01:25.710> they'll<00:01:25.890> pull<00:01:26.100> too

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
what will happen is they'll pull too

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.590 
what will happen is they'll pull too
many<00:01:26.550> amps<00:01:27.920> we're<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.520> I'm<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
many amps we're going to I'm going to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.900 
many amps we're going to I'm going to
put<00:01:30.900> an<00:01:30.990> amp<00:01:31.170> clamp<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.760> how

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
put an amp clamp on here and see how

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.570 
put an amp clamp on here and see how
many<00:01:32.970> amps<00:01:33.330> were<00:01:33.570> pulling<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.460> just<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
many amps were pulling here just to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.070 
many amps were pulling here just to
verify<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.300> think<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.050> a

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
verify but I think this is going to be a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.969 
verify but I think this is going to be a

know<00:01:46.890> why<00:01:47.240> they<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.270> they<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.290> shotgun<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
know why they just they just shotgun a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.850 
know why they just they just shotgun a
