00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.900 
will show you the map I found it's a
survival<00:00:11.410> island<00:00:11.620> and<00:00:12.070> in<00:00:12.190> order<00:00:12.580> to<00:00:12.760> make

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
survival island and in order to make

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.850 
survival island and in order to make
this<00:00:13.060> map<00:00:13.300> you<00:00:13.480> need<00:00:13.600> to<00:00:13.780> enter<00:00:14.050> this<00:00:14.200> c4<00:00:14.530> the

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
this map you need to enter this c4 the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.249 
this map you need to enter this c4 the
world<00:00:15.040> generator<00:00:15.490> you<00:00:16.390> can<00:00:16.600> copy<00:00:16.839> it<00:00:17.019> from<00:00:17.169> the

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
world generator you can copy it from the

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.739 
world generator you can copy it from the
description<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:18.160> get<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:18.880> safe<00:00:19.179> also<00:00:19.390> from

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:19.749 
description and get the safe also from

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.589 
description and get the safe also from
the<00:00:19.839> description<00:00:20.380> i<00:00:20.560> will<00:00:20.589> put<00:00:20.980> it<00:00:21.189> there<00:00:21.599> so

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
the description i will put it there so

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.109 
the description i will put it there so
you<00:00:23.259> probably<00:00:23.710> want<00:00:23.919> to<00:00:24.009> choose<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.519> survival

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
you probably want to choose the survival

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.200 
you probably want to choose the survival
mode<00:00:25.329> but<00:00:25.630> you<00:00:25.839> can<00:00:26.109> also<00:00:26.259> pick<00:00:26.769> up<00:00:26.919> a<00:00:27.220> hardcore

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
mode but you can also pick up a hardcore

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.649 
mode but you can also pick up a hardcore
mode<00:00:28.390> for<00:00:29.019> this<00:00:29.230> map<00:00:29.949> and<00:00:30.189> we'll<00:00:31.089> have<00:00:31.269> further

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:31.659 
mode for this map and we'll have further

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.930 
mode for this map and we'll have further
ado<00:00:32.050> i<00:00:32.079> will<00:00:32.259> show<00:00:32.590> you<00:00:32.649> this<00:00:32.859> map<00:00:33.100> which<00:00:33.910> is

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
ado i will show you this map which is

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.290 
ado i will show you this map which is
pretty<00:00:34.359> small<00:00:35.050> one<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.850> good<00:00:37.059> for<00:00:37.270> a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
pretty small one really good for a

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.330 
pretty small one really good for a
survival<00:00:38.050> island<00:00:38.230> i<00:00:38.559> think<00:00:40.800> well<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.160> we

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
survival island i think well so we

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.389 
survival island i think well so we
spawned<00:00:42.899> underwater<00:00:43.899> just<00:00:44.469> near<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.769> island

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
spawned underwater just near the island

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.799 
spawned underwater just near the island
and<00:00:46.109> as<00:00:47.109> you<00:00:47.260> can<00:00:47.410> see<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:48.760> probably<00:00:49.390> not<00:00:49.570> see

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
and as you can see are probably not see

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.310 
and as you can see are probably not see
there<00:00:50.410> isn't<00:00:50.710> any<00:00:50.920> land<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:52.140> visible<00:00:53.140> from

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
there isn't any land and visible from

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.160 
there isn't any land and visible from
here<00:00:53.379> so<00:00:54.250> there's<00:00:54.489> only<00:00:54.670> one<00:00:54.820> tree<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:56.050> need

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
here so there's only one tree you need

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.400 
here so there's only one tree you need
to<00:00:56.379> manage<00:00:56.800> your<00:00:56.829> wood<00:00:57.239> very<00:00:58.239> well<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:59.199> can

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
to manage your wood very well you can

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.660 
to manage your wood very well you can
get<00:00:59.649> some<00:00:59.949> iron<00:01:00.249> ore<00:01:00.699> from<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:01.660> hole<00:01:01.929> and<00:01:02.670> on

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
get some iron ore from this hole and on

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.560 
get some iron ore from this hole and on
the<00:01:03.999> other<00:01:04.239> side<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.950> island<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.850> then

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
the other side of the island and then

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.660 
the other side of the island and then
there's<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:08.020> hole<00:01:08.320> i<00:01:08.619> will<00:01:08.979> show<00:01:09.189> you<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.579> a

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
there's a hole i will show you it in a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.060 
there's a hole i will show you it in a
second<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:14.200> hole<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.619> can<00:01:14.799> find

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
second and in this hole you can find

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.630 
second and in this hole you can find
coal<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:16.329> all<00:01:16.540> you<00:01:16.659> have<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.869> pretty<00:01:17.350> much<00:01:17.640> one

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
coal so all you have is pretty much one

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.870 
coal so all you have is pretty much one
tree<00:01:19.770> hopefully<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:20.860> can<00:01:21.009> get<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.430> saplings

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
tree hopefully you can get the saplings

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.260 
tree hopefully you can get the saplings
from<00:01:22.119> it<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:23.280> plant<00:01:24.280> them<00:01:24.579> so<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:24.939> can<00:01:25.090> get

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
from it and plant them so we can get

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.940 
from it and plant them so we can get
more<00:01:25.450> wood<00:01:25.630> because<00:01:26.170> otherwise<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.799> would<00:01:26.890> be

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
more wood because otherwise it would be

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.240 
more wood because otherwise it would be
pretty<00:01:27.100> tough<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.579> survive<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.350> dig

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
pretty tough to survive and you can dig

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.709 
pretty tough to survive and you can dig
yourself<00:01:31.799> dig<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.950> way<00:01:33.100> down<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:34.479> for

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
yourself dig the way down here for

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.800 
yourself dig the way down here for
example<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.500> see<00:01:35.860> what's<00:01:36.100> there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
example and see what's there

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.469 
example and see what's there
so<00:01:37.860> nothing<00:01:38.860> more<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.579> this<00:01:39.759> island<00:01:40.000> it's

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
so nothing more is on this island it's

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.350 
so nothing more is on this island it's
pretty<00:01:40.780> damn<00:01:41.049> small<00:01:41.350> but<00:01:42.250> i<00:01:42.280> think<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:43.180> is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
pretty damn small but i think this is

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.859 
pretty damn small but i think this is
the<00:01:43.509> best<00:01:43.689> for<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.200> survival<00:01:44.950> island<00:01:45.130> so

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the best for the survival island so

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.420 
the best for the survival island so
that's<00:01:46.869> pretty<00:01:47.140> much<00:01:47.289> it<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.680> this<00:01:47.829> video<00:01:48.159> i

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
that's pretty much it in this video i

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.270 
that's pretty much it in this video i
