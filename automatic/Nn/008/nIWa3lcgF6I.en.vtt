00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 The ears, the mind, the body, the second part with Paul Katz 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 I can not tell you how much you have to think 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Versus how much you need to listen, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 They should not be against each other, but rather interconnected. Okay? 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 But listening is what you want to develop. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Before you step on stage you say, 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 "Well, I will surround myself and I will listen." 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 I personally started developing this thing for myself, when I get on stage, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 I imagine myself as if my ears grow a lot. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 This is a fact. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 These ears then become like an electric vacuum cleaner, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 And start pumping votes so as not to escape any sound. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 If your ears control what you are doing here, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 You are well trained and ready, so you will not have to think much. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 The brain is present in case I need him, 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I know, for example, that part of it is planned in advance. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 I will go on stage and say: 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 "Well, when I change the position of the hand, I will remind myself to raise my consciousness up." 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 In fact, something like that I plan ahead, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 But basically I try to get to the stage 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Where I can climb onto the stage without much awareness and thinking. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 In a lot of times I got off the stage, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 In fact, I do not remember what happened, 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 But there is an inner feeling that ... it was wonderful. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 People feel tense and panic, 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 And they do not think, neither feel nor hear. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 These can lead to disaster, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 But what I'm talking about, and what I think you're talking about, too, 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It's the situation that holds you on stage and during the show 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Where your senses become more aware, and hear more sharp, 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 So that your feelings and connection with the cello machine more intense. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Of what it is in everyday life where we sit here and talk about it.
