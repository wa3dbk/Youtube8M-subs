00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
but a lot of the time windows will

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.189 
but a lot of the time windows will
install<00:00:28.140> updates<00:00:28.650> automatically<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:30.929> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
install updates automatically and you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.100 
install updates automatically and you
won't<00:00:31.769> realize<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:33.270> its<00:00:33.420> installed<00:00:33.600> and

won't realize that its installed and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.100 
won't realize that its installed and
sometimes<00:00:35.070> those<00:00:35.370> updates<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.239> stop<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
sometimes those updates will stop you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.350 
sometimes those updates will stop you
from<00:00:37.140> being<00:00:37.620> able<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> run<00:00:38.280> certain<00:00:38.820> programs
