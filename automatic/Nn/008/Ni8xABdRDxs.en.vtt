00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
about it before it's also a good idea to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
about it before it's also a good idea to
collect<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.180> little<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> rain<00:01:00.809> water<00:01:01.100> if

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.479 
collect a little bit of rain water if
things<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.210> bad<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.860> saw

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
things got really really bad and we saw

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.179 
things got really really bad and we saw
sustained<00:01:06.180> loss<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.990> electricity<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:08.130> water

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sustained loss of electricity or water

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.270 
sustained loss of electricity or water
supply<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.990> collect<00:01:10.200> rain<00:01:10.619> water<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
supply you can collect rain water to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.120 
supply you can collect rain water to
drink<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.960> least<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.380> will<00:01:13.530> sustain<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
drink and at least that will sustain you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.640 
drink and at least that will sustain you
and<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.400> family<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> while<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.259> we're

of course on these you'll see that the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.430 
of course on these you'll see that the
the<00:02:47.160> spacing<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.580> wide<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:49.209> these<00:02:50.140> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
the spacing is pretty wide in these and

a lot of people use a window screen

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.130 
a lot of people use a window screen
because<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.330> course<00:02:52.540> it's<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:52.990> just

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
because of course it's going to be just

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.160 
because of course it's going to be just
my<00:02:53.380> new<00:02:53.590> spacing<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:55.360> all<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.600> have<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:55.930> is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
my new spacing but all you have to do is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.699 
my new spacing but all you have to do is
just<00:02:56.980> take<00:02:57.160> some<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.790> cover<00:02:58.709> your

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
just take some of this and cover your

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.730 
just take some of this and cover your
buckets<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.970> if<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.360> need<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.630> secure<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.260> you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
buckets and if you need to secure it you

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.250 
buckets and if you need to secure it you
can<00:03:02.890> always<00:03:03.520> take<00:03:03.910> some<00:03:04.180> bungee<00:03:04.390> cord<00:03:04.810> or<00:03:05.080> some

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
can always take some bungee cord or some

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.800 
can always take some bungee cord or some
rope<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.770> just<00:03:06.030> tie<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.060> around<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.570> edges

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
rope and just tie it around the edges

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.110 
rope and just tie it around the edges
there<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.190> will<00:03:09.310> help<00:03:09.459> keep<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.970> big

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
there and that will help keep the big

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.540 
there and that will help keep the big
leaves<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.690> big<00:03:10.840> debris<00:03:11.260> from<00:03:12.040> getting<00:03:12.130> into

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
leaves and big debris from getting into

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.600 
leaves and big debris from getting into
your<00:03:12.670> water<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.769> use<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.980> met<00:03:15.370> this

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
your water if you use the met this

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.590 
your water if you use the met this
smaller<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:17.440> window<00:03:17.860> screening<00:03:18.300> then<00:03:19.300> that

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
smaller like window screening then that

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.420 
smaller like window screening then that
will<00:03:19.780> help<00:03:19.810> keep<00:03:20.260> bugs<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.100> stuff<00:03:21.190> like<00:03:21.370> that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
will help keep bugs and stuff like that

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.970 
will help keep bugs and stuff like that
from<00:03:21.850> getting<00:03:22.180> into<00:03:22.390> your<00:03:22.590> water<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.830> can

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
from getting into your water you can

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.090 
from getting into your water you can
also<00:03:24.160> take<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.160> piece<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.190> plywood<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:30.040> a

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
also take just a piece of plywood just a

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.650 
also take just a piece of plywood just a
little<00:03:30.310> bit<00:03:30.430> bigger<00:03:30.610> than<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.940> size<00:03:31.150> of

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
little bit bigger than the size of

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.650 
little bit bigger than the size of
whatever<00:03:32.410> you're<00:03:32.590> using<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:34.269> can<00:03:34.420> take

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
whatever you're using and you can take

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.350 
whatever you're using and you can take
that<00:03:34.690> cut<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.560> out<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.550> can<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:36.910> lay<00:03:37.180> it

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
that cut it out and you can just lay it

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.900 
that cut it out and you can just lay it
over<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.500> top<00:03:39.570> right<00:03:40.570> after<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.959> rains<00:03:41.230> and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
over the top right after the rains and

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.300 
over the top right after the rains and
then<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.150> can<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:44.140> put<00:03:44.709> that<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:44.920> top<00:03:45.100> and

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
then you can that put that on top and

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.440 
then you can that put that on top and
that<00:03:45.430> will<00:03:45.580> help<00:03:45.700> keep<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.000> bugs<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.269> you

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
that will help keep the bugs that you

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.030 
that will help keep the bugs that you
can<00:03:46.600> see<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.989> don't<00:03:47.320> know<00:03:47.470> if<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.739> see<00:03:47.920> in

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
can see I don't know if you can see in

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.820 
can see I don't know if you can see in
there<00:03:48.190> thurs<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.180> bug<00:03:49.390> debris<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:50.019> there

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
there thurs it's a bug debris in there

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.650 
there thurs it's a bug debris in there
and<00:03:51.040> like<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.700> said<00:03:51.820> since<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.120> use<00:03:52.269> this<00:03:52.390> for<00:03:52.600> the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
and like I said since I use this for the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.690 
and like I said since I use this for the
garden<00:03:53.080> I'm<00:03:53.709> not<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.130> worried<00:03:54.370> about<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.550> but

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
garden I'm not that worried about it but

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.150 
garden I'm not that worried about it but
if<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.820> were<00:03:55.000> using<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.450> for<00:03:56.160> drinking

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
if you were using this for drinking

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.710 
if you were using this for drinking
water<00:03:57.660> then<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.760> would<00:04:00.880> want<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.360> keep<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.660> a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
water then you would want to keep it a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.120 
water then you would want to keep it a
little<00:04:01.750> bit<00:04:02.019> cleaner<00:04:02.320> they<00:04:02.950> do<00:04:03.010> make<00:04:05.130> units

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
little bit cleaner they do make units

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.060 
little bit cleaner they do make units
and<00:04:06.400> things<00:04:06.760> now<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.890> our<00:04:08.890> pretty<00:04:09.790> high<00:04:10.330> tech

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
and things now that our pretty high tech

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.990 
and things now that our pretty high tech
but<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.160> course<00:04:12.310> they're<00:04:12.459> going<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.640> cost<00:04:12.850> you

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
but of course they're going to cost you

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.140 
but of course they're going to cost you
quite<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.209> bit<00:04:13.269> of<00:04:13.480> money<00:04:13.510> if<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.739> buy<00:04:15.130> those<00:04:15.400> so

for drinking water then you could

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.839 
for drinking water then you could
certainly<00:04:28.870> do<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.310> what<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.460> would<00:04:30.580> need<00:04:30.729> to

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
anything that you would use it would

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.659 
anything that you would use it would
hold<00:04:39.840> liquid<00:04:40.840> for<00:04:41.050> drinking<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:42.490> could

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
hold liquid for drinking and you could

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.050 
hold liquid for drinking and you could
put<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.090> in<00:04:43.270> these<00:04:44.080> types<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.560> containers<00:04:45.060> what

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
put it in these types of containers what

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.339 
put it in these types of containers what
you<00:04:46.210> would<00:04:46.360> need<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.599> do<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.080> would<00:04:47.169> need

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
you would need to do is you would need

you would need to do is you would need
to<00:04:47.500> get<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.830> out<00:04:48.479> dip<00:04:49.479> out<00:04:49.599> a<00:04:49.630> bucket<00:04:50.080> of<00:04:50.229> water

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
to get you out dip out a bucket of water

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.520 
to get you out dip out a bucket of water
and<00:04:51.490> then<00:04:52.419> what<00:04:52.569> I<00:04:52.599> would<00:04:52.720> suggest<00:04:52.960> would<00:04:53.410> be

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
and then what I would suggest would be

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.120 
and then what I would suggest would be
to<00:04:53.620> get<00:04:53.740> some<00:04:53.949> cheese<00:04:54.250> cloth<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:56.009> put<00:04:57.009> the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
to get some cheese cloth and put the

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.480 
to get some cheese cloth and put the
cheese<00:04:57.310> cloth<00:04:57.610> over<00:04:58.180> another<00:04:58.539> bucket<00:04:58.840> and

cheese cloth over another bucket and

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.850 
cheese cloth over another bucket and
just<00:05:00.490> pour<00:05:00.909> that<00:05:01.090> water<00:05:01.349> across<00:05:02.349> the<00:05:02.470> cheese

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
just pour that water across the cheese

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.779 
just pour that water across the cheese
cloth<00:05:03.130> into<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.639> new<00:05:03.819> bucket<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.900> strain<00:05:05.319> out

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
cloth into the new bucket to strain out

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.460 
cloth into the new bucket to strain out
any<00:05:06.789> of<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.240> grass<00:05:08.110> or<00:05:08.590> leaves<00:05:09.130> or<00:05:10.470> bud

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
any of the grass or leaves or bud

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.040 
any of the grass or leaves or bud
remnants<00:05:11.919> that<00:05:11.979> might<00:05:12.220> be<00:05:12.340> in<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.580> water<00:05:12.699> and

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
remnants that might be in the water and

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.930 
remnants that might be in the water and
then<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.620> can<00:05:14.860> do<00:05:14.979> one<00:05:15.159> or<00:05:15.280> two<00:05:15.310> things<00:05:15.550> if<00:05:15.849> you

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
then you can do one or two things if you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.050 
then you can do one or two things if you
use<00:05:16.090> this<00:05:16.270> type<00:05:16.479> of<00:05:16.509> container<00:05:17.669> once<00:05:18.669> you<00:05:18.789> put

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
use this type of container once you put

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.460 
use this type of container once you put
you<00:05:19.240> could<00:05:19.419> put<00:05:20.190> anywhere<00:05:21.190> from<00:05:21.370> two<00:05:21.699> to<00:05:21.729> four

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
you could put anywhere from two to four

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.219 
you could put anywhere from two to four
small<00:05:23.470> drops<00:05:23.860> of<00:05:24.630> regular<00:05:25.830> plain<00:05:26.940> bleach

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
small drops of regular plain bleach

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.110 
small drops of regular plain bleach
you'll<00:05:29.229> just<00:05:29.409> drop<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:29.860> in<00:05:29.979> there<00:05:30.190> take<00:05:30.909> it

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
you'll just drop it in there take it

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.930 
you'll just drop it in there take it
swish<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.110> around<00:05:32.169> real<00:05:32.590> good<00:05:32.800> and<00:05:33.039> then<00:05:33.130> that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
swish it around real good and then that

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.640 
swish it around real good and then that
will<00:05:34.090> be<00:05:34.180> enough<00:05:34.449> to<00:05:34.599> sterilize<00:05:35.139> the<00:05:35.440> water

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
will be enough to sterilize the water

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.430 
will be enough to sterilize the water
for<00:05:36.009> you<00:05:36.190> should<00:05:36.789> you<00:05:36.940> need<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.210> drink<00:05:37.479> it<00:05:37.690> the

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
for you should you need to drink it the

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.080 
for you should you need to drink it the
other<00:05:38.620> method<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.219> can<00:05:39.370> use<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.550> courses

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
other method that you can use a courses

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.600 
other method that you can use a courses
you<00:05:40.240> can<00:05:40.270> always<00:05:40.659> boil<00:05:40.990> your<00:05:41.229> water<00:05:41.289> and<00:05:41.860> if

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
you can always boil your water and if

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.180 
you can always boil your water and if
you<00:05:42.880> boil<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.509> water<00:05:43.800> then<00:05:44.800> that<00:05:44.979> will

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
you boil the water then that will

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.610 
you boil the water then that will
sterilize<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.909> enough<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.840> drink<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.259> it

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
sterilize it enough to drink it it

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.080 
sterilize it enough to drink it it
probably<00:05:47.889> isn't<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.460> most<00:05:48.639> ideal<00:05:48.820> situation

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
probably isn't the most ideal situation

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.999 
probably isn't the most ideal situation
but<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.380> is<00:05:50.530> enough<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:51.039> keep<00:05:51.190> you<00:05:51.370> alive<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:52.750> a

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
but it is enough to keep you alive in a

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.860 
but it is enough to keep you alive in a
kind<00:05:54.009> of<00:05:55.080> worst-case<00:05:56.080> scenario<00:05:56.909> it<00:05:57.909> will<00:05:58.240> be

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
kind of worst-case scenario it will be

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.120 
kind of worst-case scenario it will be
enough<00:05:59.169> for<00:05:59.319> you<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.560> your<00:05:59.650> family<00:06:00.099> to

enough for you and your family to
survive<00:06:00.699> on<00:06:01.080> until<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.259> can<00:06:02.409> get<00:06:02.560> a<00:06:02.620> better

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
survive on until you can get a better

survive on until you can get a better
source<00:06:03.250> of<00:06:03.460> water<00:06:04.139> so<00:06:05.139> anyway<00:06:05.620> that's<00:06:06.190> just

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
source of water so anyway that's just

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.620 
source of water so anyway that's just
some<00:06:06.699> tips<00:06:06.909> that<00:06:07.060> I<00:06:07.210> had<00:06:07.509> for<00:06:08.789> sharing<00:06:09.789> my

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
some tips that I had for sharing my

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.140 
some tips that I had for sharing my
ideas<00:06:10.659> about<00:06:11.349> collecting<00:06:11.830> rainwater<00:06:12.069> I<00:06:12.520> will

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
ideas about collecting rainwater I will

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.010 
ideas about collecting rainwater I will
tell<00:06:13.449> you<00:06:13.630> that<00:06:13.930> if<00:06:14.139> you<00:06:14.289> are<00:06:14.440> gardening

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
tell you that if you are gardening

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.450 
tell you that if you are gardening
especially<00:06:17.039> that<00:06:18.479> if<00:06:19.479> you<00:06:19.930> use<00:06:19.960> rainwater<00:06:20.460> it

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
especially that if you use rainwater it

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.279 
especially that if you use rainwater it
will<00:06:21.699> be<00:06:21.819> much<00:06:22.120> much<00:06:22.419> better<00:06:22.719> for<00:06:23.169> your

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
will be much much better for your

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.270 
will be much much better for your
gardens<00:06:23.830> than<00:06:24.900> tap<00:06:25.900> water<00:06:25.930> from<00:06:26.830> the<00:06:27.039> faucet

on<00:06:27.669> the<00:06:27.819> side<00:06:28.000> of<00:06:28.030> the<00:06:28.180> house<00:06:28.389> I<00:06:28.719> learned<00:06:29.710> that

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.920 

this<00:06:32.919> year<00:06:33.310> especially<00:06:33.940> we've<00:06:34.569> had<00:06:34.720> such<00:06:34.900> a

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
this year especially we've had such a

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.309 
this year especially we've had such a
dry<00:06:35.289> spell<00:06:35.650> this<00:06:36.520> year<00:06:36.970> and<00:06:37.150> I've<00:06:37.569> had<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.960> use

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
dry spell this year and I've had to use

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:41.070 
dry spell this year and I've had to use
the<00:06:38.650> garden<00:06:39.250> hose<00:06:39.490> to<00:06:39.729> water<00:06:39.880> my<00:06:40.210> plants<00:06:40.780> quite

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
the garden hose to water my plants quite

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.920 
the garden hose to water my plants quite
a<00:06:41.110> bit<00:06:41.410> and<00:06:41.729> I<00:06:42.729> can<00:06:43.030> always<00:06:43.330> tell<00:06:43.630> a<00:06:43.660> very

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
a bit and I can always tell a very

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.779 
a bit and I can always tell a very
significant<00:06:44.800> difference<00:06:45.160> when<00:06:45.340> it<00:06:45.460> rains

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
significant difference when it rains

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.999 
significant difference when it rains
because<00:06:46.630> when<00:06:46.900> it<00:06:46.990> rains<00:06:47.229> the<00:06:47.530> plants<00:06:47.919> will

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
because when it rains the plants will

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:51.659 
because when it rains the plants will
shoot<00:06:48.280> up<00:06:48.490> quite<00:06:49.360> a<00:06:49.389> bit<00:06:49.720> and<00:06:50.069> the<00:06:51.069> growth<00:06:51.340> the

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
shoot up quite a bit and the growth the

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.900 
shoot up quite a bit and the growth the
vegetable<00:06:52.120> growth<00:06:52.330> on<00:06:52.569> there<00:06:52.780> you'll<00:06:53.410> see

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
vegetable growth on there you'll see

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.490 
vegetable growth on there you'll see
it's<00:06:54.910> almost<00:06:55.210> like<00:06:55.449> transforming<00:06:56.050> overnight

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
it's almost like transforming overnight

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.309 
it's almost like transforming overnight
when<00:06:57.190> I<00:06:57.220> use<00:06:57.460> the<00:06:57.490> garden<00:06:58.030> hose<00:06:58.270> it's<00:06:58.900> a<00:06:59.020> very

00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 
when I use the garden hose it's a very

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.439 
when I use the garden hose it's a very
very<00:06:59.680> slow<00:07:00.190> process<00:07:00.490> it's<00:07:00.970> almost<00:07:01.240> just

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
very slow process it's almost just

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.270 
very slow process it's almost just
enough<00:07:01.780> just<00:07:02.020> to<00:07:02.110> keep<00:07:02.229> the<00:07:02.380> plants<00:07:02.740> alive<00:07:02.979> but

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
enough just to keep the plants alive but

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.980 
enough just to keep the plants alive but
the<00:07:03.310> vegetables<00:07:03.940> don't<00:07:04.120> grow<00:07:04.300> very<00:07:04.479> well<00:07:04.539> so

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
the vegetables don't grow very well so

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.320 
the vegetables don't grow very well so
