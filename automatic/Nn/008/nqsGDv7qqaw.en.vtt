00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.650
 hi everyone as valentine approaches 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.120
 I know that the video on Tuesday had 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.550
 what to see as love or a theme 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.830
 related to this so I got to 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.960
 think about what to do the video at the end 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.340
 I had the idea of doing it on my five 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.590
 the favorite love scenes 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.690
 videogames that came to me most in 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.369
 that moment and even with some of the 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.080
 emotion I could not help letting go 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.869
 tear I may not agree 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.890
 He said that that will surely happen 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 but for something is my top is not your 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.750
 I'm seeing people say why not 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.630
 there is x scene maybe because I did not play 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.640
 the game or I did not get it that much either 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.739
 a man plays indie since of these 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.079
 I'll make another top later too 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.870
 took the opportunity to explain what 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.870
 spoilers so be careful once 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.989
 explained this let's start 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.449
 to 5 that was never one of the games that 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.730
 most enjoyed the playstation 2 doubt 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.430
 They make my hair dry 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.739
 of the end or the hug but after 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.530
 think about it and remember why the hell 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.060
 So, do not jump, it's going to go towards it, 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.520
 have to give me the hug 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.530
 I could not help dropping a tear when 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.750
 I saw her for the first time not like the hug 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.140
 of which never two that only had to see 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.330
 today do not touch me in order better me 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.610
 center is to think about everything that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.590
 happened is now by his friends and that 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.000
 when he finally finds himself falling and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.310
 sacrifice to wake up 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.200
 becoming a heartless 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.539
 luckily that and he realizes that it is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.750
 the one to feed protect it from the others 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.270
 a heart is thrown him hugging him 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.610
 causing it to return to normal 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.649
 number 4 those that you tell me following 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.509
 for almost a year some 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.789
 you will remember that for the valentine of 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.610
 last year I had a video doing the 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.530
 mission of angie coffee and is that the dinner of 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.619
 reconciliation could not miss in this 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.870
 top the couple a young man who was used 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.120
 making him look like a child 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.280
 and while I was on my way to see the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.320
 granada her wedding mask was stolen 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.650
 doing so you can not show up 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.870
 before and you the fiancee who despite 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.760
 his disappearance of staying one is going to 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.040
 fall over and that his mother insists 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.140
 that it is better to leave it than surely 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.680
 is cheating with creme and in spite of 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.480
 all this year they have hope 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 it's really very moving that something very 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.250
 sad the meeting back to a couple 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.710
 happy in those conditions that everything 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.660
 this mission comes to an end according to how 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.520
 do you can finish in various ways by 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.190
 example if you do not give the pendant of the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.620
 boyfriends sanyÃº this one will go doing that 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.850
 coffee and arrive to the room 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.310
 lamenting that I can not fulfill his 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.320
 promise and if you fail to complete the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.960
 mission with coffee and new you gave him the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.000
 coffee necklace and get stuck while 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.430
 pipe still waiting for him in the room 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.610
 with the thought that you will return 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.680
 where you look at it is very painful 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.780
 fallero in a promise to believe that that 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.690
 Such a special person does not love you anymore 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.310
 when that is not the case and the worst is that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.130
 although the achievements put together 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.030
 the moon will kill them but at least 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.030
 they are happy not 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.670
 final fantasy 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.410
 this game is full of those moments 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.050
 some anguish me as how and how 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.600
 I wanted to tell Garnett what he felt 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.390
 for her and others I thought I had 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.280
 beautiful especially at the end but in 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.470
 this case I'll just stay with a scene 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.170
 of the end it is true that the scene of the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.030
 final was the one that came to me but between 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.370
 the scenes that we can see along 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.680
 of this there is one that I can not avoid that 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.080
 get a smile about life on 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.570
 reunion of date and frank leyn flat 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.700
 play is the strawberry boyfriend he had 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.980
 abandoned burn asia to demonstrate its 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.620
 worth with the spear a few years later 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.620
 in front of he found out that her boyfriend flash 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.110
 lite had died she could not believe that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.630
 and decided to find out if it was true or not 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.970
 on your own when Alexandria is 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.340
 attacking rich cleyra meets with 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.530
 flash law but the illusion of it goes away 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.930
 quick to realize that he has 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.390
 Amnesia does not remember the love I felt 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.400
 for her and even her past 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.440
 It is nothing worse than forgetting but 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.780
 Fewer frames feel happy that it's 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.030
 I live at the end of the game both become 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.720
 to see in the reconstruction of burn asia 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.640
 and is that this scene is beautiful despite 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.310
 that all these ruins while 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.169
 have each other everything is fine and 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.720
 although bradley I'm one with 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.480
 magnesium who has returned his love 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.400
 towards frei since he needs memories that 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.270
 we will make others I missed the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.030
 tears number two the games of the 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.740
 Professor Layton are entertained in addition 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.020
 that are accompanied by some stories 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.970
 Precious is the tell the truth 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.490
 to say which is my favorite of all 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.169
 that I played but if I have to say one 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.330
 scene that was recorded to me in fire in the 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.180
 mind was a scene of the lost future 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.940
 the farewell of clay god as I cry in 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.310
 that part of the game clair is the boyfriend 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.080
 lleyton who died as a victim in the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.389
 accident that was had with a machine 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.789
 of the time I was already testing in 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.979
 this game your old one was collected nilo al 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.530
 future and you find yourself with a 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.270
 girl very similar to clay this one finishes us 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.729
 counting that is the younger sister 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.520
 klein celeste but in the end the game 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.380
 it turns out that it really was klein she 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.259
 traveled to what would be our present 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.819
 before the machine exploded and 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.490
 followed by the sister of Klein 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.349
 so that she suspected nothing lleyton 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.750
 he says goodbye to aiton to fulfill his 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.729
 destiny and die in the accident the 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.039
 simple fact of seeing that poor lleyton 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.020
 can not do anything to prevent it that 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.330
 impotence of having it ahead but not 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.590
 could do anything to avoid it is something 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.590
 that made me cry when I saw him 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.580
 the truth is that it does not come to be because 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.010
 they reminded me of this scene surely the 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.890
 position 1 would have been for the declare and 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.590
 lleyton is the final battle of mother 3 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.020
 for me one of the best battles that 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.240
 I've seen in video games unlike 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.480
 of the others that I named here the love that 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.150
 you see in this scene is fraternal to me 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.710
 it really hurt to see this scene on 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.140
 be fighting against your own brother 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.030
 without you really believing what the mother 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.310
 deceased of them tries to stop them from 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.950
 fight in the middle of combat 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.950
 klaus is enough is not the robot because 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.840
 you are our son and then we are the 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.480
 bucks and when they were a new 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.720
 born and above and noting the like 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.300
 background music is slowly going 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.910
 turning the theme 'love is something that 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.700
 It thrills you and it saddens you to see 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.830
 Lukas forced to attack his brother and the 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.170
 texts that assail you in battle as 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.690
 He never felt as if his heart 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.150
 break never try to contain the 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.770
 tears and it's that the time comes in the 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.050
 that neither of you want to continue 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.539
 fighting the masked 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.780
 the helmet his face is identical to that of 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:57.000
 lucas is about klaus then it's 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.490
 when the worst happens, preventing their 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.280
 own death every time you feel that you have 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.590
 your fault that he died because 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.020
 throws a ray that makes it reflect in 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.789
 the franklin brooch of lukas cloud 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.159
 he received mortal damages 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:12.870
 klaus staggering road to lucas 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.900
 arm class lukas 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.360
 This scene touched me and like 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.879
 in the previous post happens the so 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.800
 far but so close although you had it 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:25.650
 in front you could not do anything to 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.210
 avoid it and well it ends the top what 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.039
 they are your favorite love scenes 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.960
 some videos I hope you liked it 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.960
 the video and until next time
