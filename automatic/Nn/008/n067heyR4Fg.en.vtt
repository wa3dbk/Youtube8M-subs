00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 nice guys and welcome back on bus 92 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.359
 channel we are back with the top 5 ie 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.010
 the top 5 series and the other time 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.540
 we did the goalkeepers today we have 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.740
 the stoppers, that is central defenders 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.049
 guys I just wanted to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 anticipate that the best five golds 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 I choose both in seasons default and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.970
 however there are also other players 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.990
 very strong indeed we see immediately the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.000
 fifth position 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 Chiellini Chelini could also stay in 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.150
 some higher position but there are 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.490
 also other very strong and high players 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.199
 one meter and 85 and in intensity 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.769
 high uniform so this is one here 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.170
 good thing 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.120
 as was done in contrasts and strength e 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.170
 long and strong throw of head like 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.190
 features 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 look at the aggression and the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.870
 interceptions are very high 85 87 90 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 elevation 90 of strength so it is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 really a great defender guys me 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.469
 I highly recommend it though in the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 fruit mode every now and then to me 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.760
 personally to a curb bit him 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.120
 I see that it advances too much even though 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.079
 features there is no such thing though 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.840
 also in the season mode the boys 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.969
 and indeed it manages to contain 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.430
 very well ronaldo as you can well see 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.479
 in the video and therefore I think it deserves 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 to stay in the top 5 in the top4 we have 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.600
 company boys yes company and number 4 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.100
 with one meter and 92 foot height 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 weak even three-star level 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 of attack intensity average defense le 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.280
 specialties are many contrasts 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.810
 tactical force the full defender 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.310
 even guys, however, has one 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.100
 feature that the injury easy 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.759
 even if from 81 interceptions 85 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.490
 reflections 84 and therefore boys in my opinion 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.369
 he is really a good defender but in the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.310
 seasons the team say it is not so 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.570
 strong compared to the big and obviously 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.340
 but in my opinion it is really one of the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.680
 even better because it is perfect 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.290
 in position it is also very physical and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.189
 therefore at each impact it is ready to 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.189
 take the ball 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.120
 is the number 3 position we have thiago 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.680
 silva del paris saint germain boys 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.770
 thiago silva is really a good one 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.090
 player is 83 m high and not very high 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.620
 actually will have a level of 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.760
 intensity in attack and high defense e 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.560
 so this thing to me personally 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.360
 I do n't like the specialties that much 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.040
 are contrasts and tactical and of the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.390
 characteristic long passages is strong 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.700
 of head we say conference 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.550
 at the height of an interception 91 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.910
 aggressive at 75 and rations 90 and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.820
 reflexes 83 strength 81 but also speed 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.740
 click guys 80 is really important 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.200
 he is a very elegant defender I must say 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.240
 but as far as I'm concerned I saw that 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.890
 the attackers suffer a little from the style 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.350
 cristiano ronaldo ie fails to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.080
 but contain too much boys is 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.940
 truly one of the strongest 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.200
 I have to tell the truth among my top 5 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.460
 there's also kyle because i don't know and i do 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.130
 I am very well at least with the 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.590
 chelsea however noticing players like 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.570
 thiago silva and they are really complete 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.040
 almost in everything I can only put them 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.600
 in the top 5 because they are also a lot 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.260
 as fast as you can see on video 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:06.030
 boys ally lots of balls in the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.580
 second position we have sergio ramos 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.110
 guys will try if fought up to 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.330
 end for the first place I must also say 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.000
 he is only one meter tall and only 83 is ok 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.920
 however the intensity of the is a level 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.660
 high heel even if you don't think I have to 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.220
 tell the truth and specialties are 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.020
 contrasts and tactics and features 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.550
 he is strong from head and therefore with thinks 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.489
 he too has his height 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.680
 an aggressiveness of 83 interceptions 87 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.160
 91 survey even boys 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.110
 resistance 82,000 click 73 however it is 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.870
 almost the perfect defender in my opinion 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.140
 because moreover it is also very elegant 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.630
 a bit tiago silva style because 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.130
 hardly that is if goodbye ramos does the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.690
 penalty kick 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.640
 I don't know if you noticed, but it's one of 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.600
 those who always enter when he enters 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.760
 balloon and therefore in my opinion a 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.680
 top 2 also made a tie 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.110
 almost a little less than the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.020
 our first classified boateng e 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.070
 empty boys also very strong is one 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.710
 crazy thing one meter high and 92 to a 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.660
 foot 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.920
 of even four stars and also 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.170
 right back not only defender 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.820
 central specialty contrasts and strength 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.310
 characteristic long passages e 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:21.580
 very long the aggressiveness 82 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.590
 83 quick-click interceptions 85 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.390
 guys with strength 90 so is the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.940
 the big and fast defender 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.620
 perfection according to me these are the types 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.910
 of defenders that I like very much and 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.450
 also very useful in the offensive phase 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.430
 in fact, it also marks the head 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.310
 I must say that I really find myself but 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.740
 really great because it's rib 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.820
 almost impossible to overcome it seems that 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.350
 it never gets there 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.240
 but then eventually lengthen the arm 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.100
 let's say that a little bit like that 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.190
 however with strength he manages to carry 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.500
 away the ball is awesome 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.150
 I must say that he is the perfect defender 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.120
 ideal for every team according to mine 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.880
 point of view boys and then boys 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.710
 with this it is a concluded the top 5 of 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.330
 stopper 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.100
 obviously there are also other players 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.630
 as I said in the video that I am 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.940
 very strong and they could be too 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.650
 a top 5 see cahill see piquet see 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.870
 caceres which is also very strong in 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.280
 model all astra forte caseres e 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.050
 so there are many others 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.370
 I also want to know your opinion with 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.900
 what are the players you are 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.970
 better in defense because one thing also 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.500
 let's say not only based on skill but 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.410
 also Augustine to the style of play 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.940
 so I would like to know and see you in 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.100
 next political that probably 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.210
 they will be sinner or ministers 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.210
 I still have to choose
