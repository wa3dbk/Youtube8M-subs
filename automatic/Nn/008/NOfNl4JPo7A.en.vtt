00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
battery and you know how do I get juice

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.140 
battery and you know how do I get juice
into<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.710> battery<00:02:18.010> by<00:02:18.220> charging<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.910> I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
into this battery by charging it I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.390 
into this battery by charging it I
cannot<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:20.230> go<00:02:20.440> out<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.740> store<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.160> buy<00:02:21.370> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
cannot just go out to a store and buy a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.940 
cannot just go out to a store and buy a
new<00:02:21.730> battery<00:02:21.910> for<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.500> guess<00:02:23.620> what<00:02:23.740> even

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
new battery for this but guess what even

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.040 
new battery for this but guess what even
if<00:02:24.040> i<00:02:24.130> buy<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> new<00:02:24.490> battery<00:02:24.700> for<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.240> you'd

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
if i buy a new battery for this you'd

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.050 
if i buy a new battery for this you'd
have<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.320> like<00:02:26.530> unscrew<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.700> then<00:02:27.970> you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
have to like unscrew this and then you

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.370 
have to like unscrew this and then you
have<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.270> put<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> battery<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.170> then<00:02:29.290> you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
have to put the battery in and then you

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.420 
have to put the battery in and then you
can't<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.770> throw<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:29.920> away<00:02:30.010> because<00:02:30.220> these

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
can't just throw it away because these

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.880 
can't just throw it away because these
are<00:02:30.580> lithium<00:02:30.790> ion<00:02:31.240> batteries<00:02:31.840> which<00:02:32.560> requires

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
are lithium ion batteries which requires

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.760 
are lithium ion batteries which requires
special<00:02:33.280> disposal<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:33.910> yeah<00:02:34.200> keep<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.350> mind<00:02:35.380> I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
special disposal so yeah keep in mind I

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.010 
special disposal so yeah keep in mind I
can't<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:37.000> what<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.150> can<00:02:37.240> do<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.840> like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
can't just do what I can do on like

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.920 
can't just do what I can do on like
let's<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.380> say<00:02:39.090> let's<00:02:40.090> like<00:02:40.420> an<00:02:40.540> old<00:02:40.720> gameboy

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
let's just say let's like an old gameboy

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.150 
let's just say let's like an old gameboy
you<00:02:41.140> actually<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.590> charge<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.010> and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
you actually have to charge this up and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.190 
you actually have to charge this up and
that's<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.430> thing<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:43.390> does<00:02:43.570> not<00:02:43.600> come<00:02:44.050> with

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
that's the thing this does not come with

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.860 
that's the thing this does not come with
a<00:02:44.230> crucial<00:02:44.710> thing<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:45.940> need<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.720> play

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
a crucial thing that you need to play

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.110 
a crucial thing that you need to play
your<00:02:47.110> game<00:02:47.320> system<00:02:47.710> it<00:02:47.830> doesn't<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.000> to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
your game system it doesn't you have to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.180 
your game system it doesn't you have to
pay<00:02:49.450> extra<00:02:49.690> for<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.650> keep<00:02:50.830> in<00:02:50.950> mind<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
pay extra for it and keep in mind the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.850 
pay extra for it and keep in mind the
old<00:02:51.400> des<00:02:51.640> cost<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> same<00:02:52.330> price<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.990> comes

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
old des cost the same price and comes

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.650 
old des cost the same price and comes
with<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.370> also<00:02:54.610> costs<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.060> think<00:02:55.270> two<00:02:55.420> hundred

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
with it also costs I think two hundred

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.880 
with it also costs I think two hundred
dollars<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.170> old<00:02:56.910> 3ds<00:02:57.910> XL<00:02:58.390> did<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.080> yet<00:02:59.650> here

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
it is the new 3dsxl costs around two

it is the new 3dsxl costs around two
hundred<00:03:03.190> dollars<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.970> yet<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.270> lacks<00:03:04.630> what

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
this Sun workstation as you can see it's

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.220 
this Sun workstation as you can see it's
working<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.550> fine<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.120> has<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> power<00:03:23.020> supply

in it and as you can see it boots up and
runs<00:03:27.760> just<00:03:28.030> fine<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.880> even<00:03:31.030> boots<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
runs just fine and it even boots to the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.540 
runs just fine and it even boots to the
open<00:03:32.050> firmware<00:03:32.290> prompt<00:03:32.950> now<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.190> might<00:03:33.400> be

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
open firmware prompt now you might be

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.240 
open firmware prompt now you might be
wondering<00:03:33.580> well<00:03:34.060> why<00:03:34.209> am<00:03:34.390> i<00:03:34.480> showing<00:03:34.750> off<00:03:35.020> a

son in this video well let's just say

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.360 
son in this video well let's just say
this<00:03:40.410> computer<00:03:41.410> which<00:03:41.590> probably<00:03:41.860> cost<00:03:42.160> a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
this computer which probably cost a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.460 
this computer which probably cost a
bunch<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.880> money<00:03:43.209> especially<00:03:43.420> for<00:03:44.020> just<00:03:44.230> a

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
bunch of money especially for just a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.310 
bunch of money especially for just a
low-end<00:03:45.370> computer<00:03:45.880> at<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> time<00:03:46.360> let's<00:03:47.110> just

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
low-end computer at the time let's just

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.110 
low-end computer at the time let's just
say<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.560> bought<00:03:47.860> in<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.250> didn't<00:03:48.489> come<00:03:48.910> with<00:03:48.940> a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
say you bought in it didn't come with a

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.910 
say you bought in it didn't come with a
power<00:03:49.360> supply<00:03:49.540> let's<00:03:50.170> see<00:03:50.350> how<00:03:50.440> well<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.680> works

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
power supply let's see how well it works

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.850 
power supply let's see how well it works
without<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.790> power<00:03:51.940> supply<00:03:52.390> let's<00:03:53.200> see<00:03:53.470> just

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
without the power supply let's see just

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.259 
without the power supply let's see just
how<00:03:54.519> well<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:55.120> can<00:03:55.150> work<00:03:55.480> oh<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:57.700> just<00:03:57.730> powered

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
how well it can work oh it just powered

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.509 
how well it can work oh it just powered
off<00:03:58.420> guess<00:03:58.780> what<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.680> pulled<00:03:59.950> this<00:04:00.070> cable

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
off guess what I just pulled this cable

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.960 
off guess what I just pulled this cable
out<00:04:00.640> it's<00:04:01.180> not<00:04:01.300> doing<00:04:01.690> anything<00:04:02.670> I'm<00:04:03.670> look

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
out it's not doing anything I'm look

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.740 
out it's not doing anything I'm look

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
thing with this if you buy a new 3d s

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.010 
thing with this if you buy a new 3d s
you're<00:05:48.310> getting<00:05:48.550> ripped<00:05:48.850> off<00:05:49.090> because

you're getting ripped off because

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.990 
you're getting ripped off because
Nintendo<00:05:50.470> couldn't<00:05:51.340> bother<00:05:51.520> to<00:05:51.760> pack<00:05:51.940> a

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
Nintendo couldn't bother to pack a

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.820 
Nintendo couldn't bother to pack a
ten-dollar<00:05:52.690> charger<00:05:53.200> for<00:05:53.380> free<00:05:53.560> with<00:05:53.740> their

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
ten-dollar charger for free with their

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.500 
ten-dollar charger for free with their
system<00:05:54.220> I'm<00:05:54.700> saying<00:05:55.000> 10<00:05:55.180> hours<00:05:55.390> because

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
system I'm saying 10 hours because

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.970 
system I'm saying 10 hours because
that's<00:05:55.750> how<00:05:55.840> much<00:05:55.960> they<00:05:56.080> charge<00:05:56.380> for<00:05:56.440> online

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
that's how much they charge for online

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.370 
that's how much they charge for online
it<00:05:57.610> probably<00:05:57.940> costs<00:05:58.330> even<00:05:58.510> less<00:05:58.930> than<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:59.140> in

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
it probably costs even less than that in

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.480 
it probably costs even less than that in
raw<00:05:59.590> materials<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:01.960> yeah<00:06:02.110> there<00:06:02.320> you<00:06:02.410> go<00:06:02.490> new

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
raw materials so yeah there you go new
