since 2004 my career in cable design
began<00:00:27.500> with<00:00:27.950> a<00:00:27.980> simple<00:00:28.460> test<00:00:28.700> that<00:00:29.000> I

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
began with a simple test that I

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.069 
began with a simple test that I
performed<00:00:29.750> on<00:00:29.989> my<00:00:30.290> stereo<00:00:30.800> system<00:00:31.279> in<00:00:31.810> 1980<00:00:32.810> I

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
performed on my stereo system in 1980 I

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.319 
performed on my stereo system in 1980 I
had<00:00:33.920> been<00:00:34.040> trying<00:00:34.310> various<00:00:34.730> interconnect

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
had been trying various interconnect

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.869 
had been trying various interconnect
cables<00:00:35.750> including<00:00:36.530> some<00:00:36.800> that<00:00:37.489> were<00:00:37.640> fairly

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
cables including some that were fairly

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.450 
cables including some that were fairly
expensive<00:00:38.329> on<00:00:38.719> my<00:00:38.899> stereo<00:00:39.199> system<00:00:39.710> between

the<00:00:40.699> amp<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.090> preamp<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.840> could<00:00:42.679> hear<00:00:43.070> the

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
the amp and preamp I could hear the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.759 
the amp and preamp I could hear the
cables<00:00:43.969> changing<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:44.539> sound<00:00:44.780> but<00:00:45.530> none<00:00:45.739> of

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
cables changing the sound but none of

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.080 
cables changing the sound but none of
them<00:00:45.920> seemed<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.250> be<00:00:46.429> letting<00:00:46.789> all<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:47.030> the

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
them seemed to be letting all of the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.419 
them seemed to be letting all of the
music<00:00:47.269> through<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:48.559> shortened<00:00:49.129> one<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.370> the

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
music through so I shortened one of the

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.619 
music through so I shortened one of the
cables<00:00:49.879> to<00:00:50.089> a<00:00:50.120> length<00:00:50.449> of<00:00:50.660> only<00:00:51.050> two<00:00:51.469> inches

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
cables to a length of only two inches

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.759 
cables to a length of only two inches
move<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.839> components<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.530> could

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
move to the components so I could

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.889 
move to the components so I could
reconnect<00:00:55.190> them<00:00:55.460> back<00:00:55.789> to<00:00:56.030> back<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.510> I

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
reconnect them back to back and I

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.099 
reconnect them back to back and I
listened<00:00:57.289> again<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:58.640> setup<00:00:59.059> was<00:00:59.749> fairly

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
listened again that setup was fairly

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.779 
listened again that setup was fairly
awkward<00:01:00.260> as<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:00.739> can<00:01:00.890> see<00:01:01.070> here<00:01:01.309> as<00:01:01.429> I<00:01:01.550> had<00:01:01.670> to

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
awkward as you can see here as I had to

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.079 
awkward as you can see here as I had to
draw<00:01:01.969> on<00:01:01.999> the<00:01:02.210> diagram<00:01:02.629> but<00:01:03.499> the<00:01:03.559> sound

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
draw on the diagram but the sound

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.410 
draw on the diagram but the sound
improvement<00:01:05.089> I<00:01:05.210> heard<00:01:05.540> was<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.050> revelation<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
improvement I heard was a revelation the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.120 
improvement I heard was a revelation the
sound<00:01:08.660> improves<00:01:09.050> so<00:01:09.230> dramatically<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:09.950> I

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
sound improves so dramatically that I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.860 
sound improves so dramatically that I
quickly<00:01:10.430> realized<00:01:10.940> I<00:01:11.120> had<00:01:11.240> discovered<00:01:11.780> the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
quickly realized I had discovered the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.410 
quickly realized I had discovered the
best<00:01:12.110> tool<00:01:12.470> for<00:01:12.500> cable<00:01:13.100> design<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.120> I<00:01:14.210> also

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
best tool for cable design and I also

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.480 
best tool for cable design and I also
realized<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.200> cable<00:01:15.650> design<00:01:15.800> with<00:01:16.310> my

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
realized that cable design with my

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.870 
realized that cable design with my
colleague<00:01:16.970> since<00:01:17.780> then<00:01:18.370> every<00:01:19.370> cable<00:01:19.610> I've

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
colleague since then every cable I've

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.580 
colleague since then every cable I've
produced<00:01:20.330> has<00:01:20.810> been<00:01:21.020> designed<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.500> provide
