sacrificed himself to make cha-cha guard
but<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.490> almost<00:02:03.759> sublime<00:02:04.179> this<00:02:04.420> anyway

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
but you almost sublime this anyway

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.290 
but you almost sublime this anyway
because<00:02:07.100> being<00:02:07.400> amplified<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.120> to<00:02:08.180> be

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
because being amplified up is to be

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.210 
because being amplified up is to be
careful<00:02:08.720> Tom<00:02:08.960> we're<00:02:09.170> getting<00:02:09.380> crushed<00:02:09.650> up<00:02:09.950> for

careful Tom we're getting crushed up for
stop<00:02:10.520> back<00:02:10.790> again<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.660> got<00:02:11.810> an<00:02:11.900> option<00:02:12.050> right

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
stop back again you got an option right

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.440 
stop back again you got an option right
now<00:02:12.590> they<00:02:12.740> get<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.920> hunter<00:02:13.340> kills<00:02:13.610> or<00:02:14.150> they<00:02:14.300> can

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
now they get a hunter kills or they can

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.090 
now they get a hunter kills or they can
go<00:02:14.570> for<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.840> ranks<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.260> looks<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.650> kills<00:02:15.920> be

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
go for the ranks and looks like kills be

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.380 
go for the ranks and looks like kills be
the<00:02:16.250> main<00:02:16.400> objective<00:02:16.910> here

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390

I<00:02:27.080> suppose<00:02:27.610> next<00:02:28.610> though<00:02:28.880> that's<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
I suppose next though that's in the

I suppose next though that's in the
movie<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.780> then<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:31.370> moving<00:02:31.760> key<00:02:32.360> is

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
movie is then that moving key is

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.290 
movie is then that moving key is

fallen they smart they guard they can
