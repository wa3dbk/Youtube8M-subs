00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
some kind of prick on the net but let's

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.620 
some kind of prick on the net but let's
begin<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> tutorial<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:20.220> how<00:00:20.820> this

once I had my decimate apply I select

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
once I had my decimate apply I select
the<00:01:29.640> floor<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.630> four<00:01:30.810> corners<00:01:32.960> great<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the floor to the four corners great a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.130 
the floor to the four corners great a
new<00:01:34.470> group<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> assign<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.240> corners<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.900> loop

new group and assign the corners to loop

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.310 
new group and assign the corners to loop
now<00:01:37.890> control<00:01:38.490> H<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.240> add<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.659> hook<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.970> for

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
now control H to add a hook to this for

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
now control H to add a hook to this for
vertex<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.880> move

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
vertex and you can see that I can move

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.710 
vertex and you can see that I can move
the<00:01:45.630> vertex<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.070> hook<00:01:47.420> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.570> going

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the vertex with this hook this is going

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.700 
the vertex with this hook this is going
to<00:01:48.840> come<00:01:49.350> handy<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.100> few<00:01:50.729> seconds<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:51.750> we're

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to come handy in a few seconds now we're

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.490 
to come handy in a few seconds now we're
going<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.220> our<00:01:53.759> plane<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> we're<00:01:55.350> going

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
going to take our plane and we're going

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
going to take our plane and we're going
to<00:01:55.649> add<00:01:55.829> some<00:01:56.340> cloth<00:01:56.850> dynamics<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.119> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
to add some cloth dynamics to it and the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.899 
to add some cloth dynamics to it and the
cloth<00:02:00.360> falls<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.320> falls<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.670> not

cloth falls it falls because it was not
pinning<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:04.130> now<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.450> think<00:02:06.450> pinning<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
pinning and now I think pinning and I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.160 
pinning and now I think pinning and I
change<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.660> group<00:02:09.989> name<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
change this group name to

that the jan-willem triangle it modifier
may<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:39.980> weird<00:03:41.540> points<00:03:42.540> we'll<00:03:42.810> edges

may do some weird points we'll edges
when<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.280> when<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.120> force<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.780> too<00:03:46.260> much<00:03:46.500> I

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
when it's when you force it too much I

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.570 
when it's when you force it too much I
want<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:49.200> force<00:03:49.890> this<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.670> bit<00:03:52.580> but

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
want this force this a bit but

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.729 
want this force this a bit but
you<00:03:53.820> may<00:03:54.000> see<00:03:54.269> some<00:03:54.470> sticks<00:03:55.470> going<00:03:56.340> around

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
you may see some sticks going around

it this is how you do one way to do a

it this is how you do one way to do a
