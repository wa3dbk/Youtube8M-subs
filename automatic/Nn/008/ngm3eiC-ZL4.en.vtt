00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.110 
from like one to ten and each number has
like<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.500> certain<00:05:08.890> ranking<00:05:09.520> of<00:05:09.670> like<00:05:09.850> what<00:05:10.090> I

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
like a certain ranking of like what I

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.430

believe<00:05:10.420> to<00:05:10.450> be<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.780> game<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.110> if<00:05:11.200> you<00:05:11.290> look

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
believe to be that game and if you look

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.110 
believe to be that game and if you look
at<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.590> ten<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.890> always<00:05:12.250> consider<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.670> time<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.000> be

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
at a ten I always consider a time to be

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.360 
at a ten I always consider a time to be
a<00:05:13.150> game<00:05:13.390> that<00:05:13.630> is<00:05:13.870> that<00:05:14.560> perfect<00:05:15.010> no<00:05:15.160> games

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
perfect attend does that mean the game

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.410 
perfect attend does that mean the game
is<00:05:17.650> perfect<00:05:18.010> but<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.130> ten<00:05:18.370> certainly<00:05:19.150> describes

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
is perfect but a ten certainly describes

shaped<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.300> games<00:05:37.510> industry<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:38.200> redefined

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
shaped the games industry and redefined

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.170 
shaped the games industry and redefined
certain<00:05:39.430> moments<00:05:39.760> in<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.880> games<00:05:40.060> industry

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
certain moments in the games industry

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.120 
certain moments in the games industry
and<00:05:40.750> really<00:05:40.960> made<00:05:41.110> a<00:05:41.140> name<00:05:41.200> for<00:05:41.380> itself<00:05:41.620> and

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
and really made a name for itself and

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.200 
and really made a name for itself and
it's<00:05:42.310> something<00:05:42.460> that<00:05:42.580> will<00:05:42.820> never<00:05:42.970> truly

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
it's something that will never truly

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.000 
it's something that will never truly
forget<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:44.290> I<00:05:44.410> think<00:05:44.620> there's<00:05:44.770> a<00:05:44.830> lot<00:05:44.950> of

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
forget and I think there's a lot of

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.350 
forget and I think there's a lot of
games<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.310> are<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:45.790> there's<00:05:46.150> a<00:05:46.210> lot<00:05:46.330> of

10 my 10 is it going to be somebody
else's<00:05:52.270> tend<00:05:52.570> my<00:05:53.020> idea<00:05:53.440> of<00:05:53.530> what<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.250> just<00:05:54.310> said

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
else's tend my idea of what I just said

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.190 
else's tend my idea of what I just said
is<00:05:54.790> not<00:05:54.820> going<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.120> be<00:05:55.240> somebody<00:05:55.540> else's<00:05:55.840> idea

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
is not going to be somebody else's idea

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.410 
is not going to be somebody else's idea
bad<00:05:57.030> everybody's<00:05:58.030> going<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.180> have<00:05:58.390> a

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
bad everybody's going to have a

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.150 
bad everybody's going to have a
different<00:05:58.480> idea<00:05:58.840> of<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.290> and<00:05:59.560> I<00:05:59.980> think

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
different idea of that and I think

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.230 
different idea of that and I think
that's<00:06:00.280> the<00:06:00.370> most<00:06:00.460> important<00:06:00.940> part<00:06:00.970> about

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
that's the most important part about

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.630 
that's the most important part about
games<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:01.840> games<00:06:01.990> discussion<00:06:02.290> is<00:06:02.710> that<00:06:02.890> you

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
games and games discussion is that you

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.340 
games and games discussion is that you
know<00:06:03.730> will<00:06:03.880> never<00:06:04.060> agree<00:06:04.570> on<00:06:04.660> something<00:06:05.170> but

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
know will never agree on something but

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.160 
know will never agree on something but
that's<00:06:05.860> what<00:06:06.070> keeps<00:06:06.250> the<00:06:06.400> conversation<00:06:06.730> going

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
that's what keeps the conversation going

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.560 
that's what keeps the conversation going
