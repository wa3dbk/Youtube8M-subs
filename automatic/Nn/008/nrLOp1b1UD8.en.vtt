fungus<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.299> deceiving<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.900> beads<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:36.280> terms

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
fungus is deceiving the beads in terms

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.940 
fungus is deceiving the beads in terms
of<00:02:36.760> tricking<00:02:37.120> them<00:02:37.440> making<00:02:38.440> them<00:02:38.620> think<00:02:38.650> that

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
of tricking them making them think that

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.890 
of tricking them making them think that
it's<00:02:39.100> another<00:02:39.310> flower<00:02:39.549> that<00:02:39.910> these<00:02:40.329> silvery

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it's another flower that these silvery

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.900 
it's another flower that these silvery
pieces<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.980> leaves<00:02:43.019> reflect<00:02:44.019> UV<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.500> and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
pieces on the leaves reflect UV like and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.580 
pieces on the leaves reflect UV like and
also<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.060> fungus<00:02:46.390> produced<00:02:46.690> sugar<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.410> bees

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
also the fungus produced sugar the bees

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.710 
also the fungus produced sugar the bees
are<00:02:47.620> attracted<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.760> UV<00:02:49.030> light<00:02:49.209> because<00:02:49.570> it

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
are attracted to the UV light because it

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.460 
are attracted to the UV light because it
mimics<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.380> flower<00:02:50.650> they<00:02:51.600> land<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.140> in

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
mimics the flower they land on it and in

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.069 
mimics the flower they land on it and in
so<00:02:53.890> doing<00:02:53.920> they<00:02:54.340> pick<00:02:54.519> up<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> spores<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
so doing they pick up the spores the

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.349 
so doing they pick up the spores the
idea<00:02:56.680> though<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.100> how<00:02:57.310> well<00:02:57.579> is<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.910> transfer

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
idea though is how well is this transfer

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.170 
idea though is how well is this transfer
really<00:02:58.630> occurring<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.400> our<00:03:00.400> bumblebees

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
really occurring and our bumblebees

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.819 
really occurring and our bumblebees
better<00:03:01.480> at<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.959> because<00:03:02.440> they're<00:03:02.680> better

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
better at it because they're better

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.449 
better at it because they're better
pollinators<00:03:03.340> then<00:03:03.970> honey<00:03:04.720> bees<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:06.190> there<00:03:06.430> a

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
pollinators then honey bees is there a

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.590 
pollinators then honey bees is there a
difference<00:03:06.790> between<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:07.090> two<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.269> them<00:03:07.480> and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
difference between the two of them and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.090 
difference between the two of them and
also<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.109> how<00:03:08.320> much<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:08.829> really

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
also just how much of this is really

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.000 
also just how much of this is really
happening

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.750 

yep<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.400> we<00:03:13.550> will<00:03:13.640> put<00:03:13.850> this<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.240> in<00:03:14.420> there

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
yep so we will put this one in there

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.500 
yep so we will put this one in there

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
burning was a practice that that was

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.949 
burning was a practice that that was
used<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.100> prune<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.730> bluray<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.690> wild

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
used to prune the bluray so the wild

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.809 
used to prune the bluray so the wild
blueberry<00:03:30.290> has<00:03:30.500> about<00:03:30.800> two-thirds<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.640> its
