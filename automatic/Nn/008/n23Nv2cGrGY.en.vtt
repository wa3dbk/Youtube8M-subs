00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
tiny piece there is also a spacer so you

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.580 
tiny piece there is also a spacer so you
decided<00:01:14.039> one<00:01:15.039> big<00:01:15.310> space<00:01:15.880> put<00:01:16.630> that<00:01:16.869> in<00:01:17.080> so<00:01:17.410> now

preferable to you so I'm going to roll
this<00:02:33.659> on<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:37.140> board<00:02:37.439> I<00:02:40.879> think<00:02:41.879> what<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.150> need

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
this on the board I think what you need

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.410 
this on the board I think what you need
to<00:02:42.569> do<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.230> make<00:02:43.439> sure<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:44.519> when<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.180> do

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
to do is to make sure that when you do

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.750 
to do is to make sure that when you do
roll<00:02:45.689> your<00:02:45.900> paste<00:02:46.200> each<00:02:46.769> time<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.489> roll<00:02:47.730> up

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
roll your paste each time we roll up

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.240 
roll your paste each time we roll up
recipes<00:02:48.269> it's<00:02:48.989> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.470> be<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.980> same

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
recipes it's going to be the same

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.270 
recipes it's going to be the same
thickness<00:02:50.609> so<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.900> quite<00:02:52.139> handy<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:52.829> have

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
thickness so it's quite handy to have

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.720 
thickness so it's quite handy to have
your<00:02:53.459> piece<00:02:53.669> on<00:02:53.849> here<00:02:54.409> and<00:02:55.409> then<00:02:56.159> do<00:02:56.340> your<00:02:56.519> next

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
your piece on here and then do your next

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:05.000 
your piece on here and then do your next
color<00:02:58.099> alongside<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:02.609> always<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.739> first

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
color alongside and always the first

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.949 
color alongside and always the first
piece<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.370> you've<00:03:05.700> rolled<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.659> keep<00:03:06.840> a

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
piece that you've rolled just keep a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.140 
piece that you've rolled just keep a
little<00:03:07.230> piece<00:03:07.409> on<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.769> side<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.669> make<00:03:08.879> sure

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
little piece on the side to make sure

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.520 
little piece on the side to make sure
that<00:03:09.750> they're<00:03:09.959> all<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.260> same<00:03:10.290> thickness<00:03:10.829> so

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that they're all the same thickness so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.300 
that they're all the same thickness so
you've<00:03:13.530> got<00:03:14.389> and<00:03:15.389> you<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.470> feel<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:16.949> as<00:03:17.159> you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
you've got and you can feel this as you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.610 
you've got and you can feel this as you
run<00:03:17.519> your<00:03:17.669> hand<00:03:17.879> over<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.049> we've<00:03:19.199> got<00:03:19.409> two

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
run your hand over so now we've got two

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.189 
run your hand over so now we've got two
pieces<00:03:19.889> you<00:03:20.129> put<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> pink<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.239> your<00:03:21.449> now<00:03:22.049> when

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
pieces you put a pink and your now when

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.189 
pieces you put a pink and your now when
I'm<00:03:22.349> using<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:23.239> rhythm<00:03:24.239> wheel<00:03:24.449> to<00:03:24.780> cut<00:03:24.989> my

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
I'm using this rhythm wheel to cut my

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.490 
I'm using this rhythm wheel to cut my
strength<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:26.159> actually<00:03:27.030> like<00:03:27.449> my<00:03:27.479> paste<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.349> be

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
strength I actually like my paste to be

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.979 
strength I actually like my paste to be
stuck<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.129> board<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.489> little<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.359> I'm<00:03:30.720> just

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
stuck to the board a little so I'm just

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.990 
stuck to the board a little so I'm just
making<00:03:31.229> sure<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.370> stuck<00:03:32.729> a<00:03:32.790> little

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
making sure that it's stuck a little

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.080 
making sure that it's stuck a little
like<00:03:33.590> but<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.739> run<00:03:34.919> this<00:03:35.159> I've<00:03:35.400> really<00:03:35.430> pressed

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
like but to run this I've really pressed

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.550 
like but to run this I've really pressed
down<00:03:36.479> hard<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.489> roll<00:03:38.840> I'm<00:03:39.840> going<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.109> put<00:03:40.290> this

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
down hard and roll I'm going to put this

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.939 
down hard and roll I'm going to put this
wheel<00:03:40.940> into<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:43.229> when<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.560> do<00:03:43.739> this

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
wheel into this and when you do this

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.339 
wheel into this and when you do this
what<00:03:44.669> you're<00:03:44.819> watching<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.479> not<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.959> actual

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
what you're watching is not the actual

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.530 
what you're watching is not the actual
wheel<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:47.129> you're<00:03:47.250> watching<00:03:47.609> this<00:03:47.819> line<00:03:48.150> here

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
wheel but you're watching this line here

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.530 
wheel but you're watching this line here
so<00:03:49.079> as<00:03:49.199> you<00:03:49.349> watch<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.859> line<00:03:50.129> your<00:03:50.879> wheel

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
so as you watch that line your wheel

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.710 
so as you watch that line your wheel
will<00:03:51.780> come<00:03:52.049> back<00:03:52.290> down<00:03:52.459> exactly<00:03:53.599> where<00:03:54.599> you

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
will come back down exactly where you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.099 
will come back down exactly where you
want<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.169> be<00:03:56.419> and<00:03:57.419> you<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.780> cut<00:03:57.959> your

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
want it to be and you can cut your

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.940 
want it to be and you can cut your
stripes<00:04:00.109> like<00:04:01.109> so

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
stripes like so

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:12.610 
stripes like so
and<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.310> same<00:04:02.580> read<00:04:03.330> every<00:04:03.690> strength<00:04:09.950> okay

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
and the same read every strength okay

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.920 
and the same read every strength okay
just<00:04:13.620> make<00:04:13.890> those<00:04:14.099> even<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.180> take<00:04:15.450> away<00:04:15.599> old

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
just make those even and take away old

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.960 
just make those even and take away old
bits<00:04:16.320> we<00:04:16.500> don't<00:04:16.709> need<00:04:20.780> never<00:04:21.780> presume<00:04:22.320> that

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
bits we don't need never presume that

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.740 
bits we don't need never presume that
you<00:04:23.970> won't<00:04:24.210> need<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:28.790> like<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.540> same

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
you won't need that like so and the same

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:46.309 
you won't need that like so and the same
on<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.200> other<00:04:31.230> side

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.820 

now<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:48.360> bring<00:04:48.569> this<00:04:48.779> to<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.199> cake

and then just follow on with your
strengths<00:05:47.050> like<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:48.320> as<00:05:48.560> easy<00:05:48.889> as<00:05:49.130> that

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
strengths like so as easy as that

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.110 
strengths like so as easy as that
not<00:05:51.440> panicking<00:05:52.039> too<00:05:52.280> much<00:05:52.520> about<00:05:52.880> getting

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
not panicking too much about getting

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.990 
not panicking too much about getting
everything<00:05:53.630> spot-on<00:05:54.530> even<00:05:55.190> at<00:05:55.430> around<00:05:55.789> the

everything spot-on even at around the
top<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:56.570> cake<00:05:56.810> because<00:05:57.770> you<00:05:58.039> can<00:05:58.250> always

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
top of the cake because you can always

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.990 
top of the cake because you can always
sort<00:06:00.289> better<00:06:00.590> when<00:06:01.100> you<00:06:01.220> finished<00:06:01.610> doing<00:06:01.910> your

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.800 
sort better when you finished doing your
cakes<00:06:02.360> your<00:06:03.139> strengths

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.719 

just<00:06:08.810> keep<00:06:09.050> that<00:06:09.259> tidy<00:06:09.620> on<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:09.949> bottom<00:06:10.280> I<00:06:10.430> like

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
just keep that tidy on the bottom I like

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.189 
just keep that tidy on the bottom I like
to<00:06:10.789> keep<00:06:11.000> it<00:06:11.150> tidy<00:06:11.360> on<00:06:11.479> the<00:06:11.750> bottom<00:06:12.080> because

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
to keep it tidy on the bottom because

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.560 
to keep it tidy on the bottom because
sometimes<00:06:12.800> I<00:06:13.039> like<00:06:13.580> to<00:06:13.729> cover<00:06:13.970> the<00:06:14.180> board<00:06:14.389> as

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
sometimes I like to cover the board as

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.150 
sometimes I like to cover the board as
well<00:06:16.690> now<00:06:17.690> it's<00:06:17.900> just<00:06:18.050> that<00:06:18.289> small<00:06:18.680> amount<00:06:19.070> of

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
well now it's just that small amount of

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.520 
well now it's just that small amount of
paste<00:06:19.699> that<00:06:20.240> you<00:06:20.389> saw<00:06:20.660> me<00:06:20.870> roll<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:22.250> can<00:06:22.490> see

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
paste that you saw me roll you can see

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.439 
paste that you saw me roll you can see
just<00:06:24.530> how<00:06:24.770> many<00:06:24.830> stripes<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:28.760> can<00:06:28.789> get<00:06:29.180> out<00:06:29.330> of

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
just how many stripes you can get out of

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:38.780 
just how many stripes you can get out of
each<00:06:29.630> one<00:06:31.120> tiny<00:06:32.120> tiny

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:49.460 

and<00:06:39.300> tidy<00:06:39.690> around<00:06:40.490> so<00:06:41.490> if<00:06:41.790> I<00:06:43.220> work<00:06:48.470> overhead

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
and tidy around so if I work overhead

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:57.080 
and tidy around so if I work overhead
like<00:06:49.710> so<00:06:54.890> and<00:06:55.890> I'll<00:06:56.070> just<00:06:56.280> put<00:06:56.490> the<00:06:56.610> last<00:06:56.790> few

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
like so and I'll just put the last few

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.260 
like so and I'll just put the last few
stripes<00:06:57.450> on<00:06:57.720> so<00:06:57.930> you<00:06:58.020> can<00:06:58.200> have<00:06:58.380> a<00:06:58.410> look<00:06:59.270> but

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
stripes on so you can have a look but

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.510 
stripes on so you can have a look but
for<00:07:00.300> me<00:07:00.720> it's<00:07:00.960> more<00:07:01.110> difficult<00:07:01.530> to<00:07:01.890> see<00:07:02.190> if

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
for me it's more difficult to see if

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:15.040 
for me it's more difficult to see if
it's<00:07:02.820> right<00:07:03.540> down<00:07:03.780> to<00:07:03.930> the<00:07:04.020> board

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:24.469 

and<00:07:15.230> another<00:07:16.220> pink<00:07:16.580> one

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:42.100 

and<00:07:25.020> support<00:07:28.550> and<00:07:29.550> another<00:07:29.909> goon

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.149 

that's<00:07:42.710> how<00:07:42.919> easy<00:07:43.509> it<00:07:44.509> is<00:07:44.539> to<00:07:45.409> use<00:07:45.590> your<00:07:45.770> ribbon

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 
that's how easy it is to use your ribbon

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:50.680 
that's how easy it is to use your ribbon
trim<00:07:46.810> to<00:07:47.810> make<00:07:47.840> your<00:07:48.110> cake
