00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.759
 and why do not you get to age 70? 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.410
 that way you have to start 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.389
 brush from as little as I said to 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.549

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.670

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.830
 Marina Araújo is going to show us 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.460
 teachers and here alone beautiful 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.039
 child's smile is the filipe's mouth and 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.960
 this is the examination that our mouth 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.269
 in a different way 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 but first let's go to Felipe's house. 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.540
 see how he treats his teeth 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.540
 He already knows very well after eating. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.860
 You have to brush your teeth this litany. 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.170
 Almost all children were 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.320
 on the foot send 10 and brush the tooth it 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.520
 You know you have to go but it's a few 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.440
 times he will prioritize the will is 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.550
 well only this time he was brushing 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.550
 so mother changes 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.450
 It was too fast there. 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.360
 is at peak rush was very 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.549
 quick forget to make a mouthful of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.950
 floss it goes sometimes but 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.430
 floss taste mask it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.229
 explains how he makes his and her 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 hiss on top 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.659
 the male and so on and so on 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.659
 memory 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.299
 now we have prepared a surprise or 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.700
 dental professional 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.759
 We brought our mother to the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.119
 dentist's office sérgio simões 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:49.119
 him to get tested and see if the teeth 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.119
 Philippe are clean or more or less 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.819
 the examination increases the size of our 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.170
 teeth up to 60 times the hurt anything but 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.159
 It bothers a little to stay with your mouth. 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.159
 open right 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.880
 Felipe holds him and most of them 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.849
 of patients are curious to see the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.670
 Close teeth in camera video 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.340
 allows you to have a view that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.379
 usually an illumination that you do not 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.930
 You have to this illumination that we are 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.690
 seeing back and forth is precisely 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.120
 thus arousing the curiosity that the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.970
 dentists convince the patient of the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.099
 importance of cleaning teeth thoroughly 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.010
 We will arrive florid what the 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.910
 brush could not wipe the secret is 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:39.680
 brush well at 10am and floss 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.230
 but after what you hear it 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.000
 It has not gone cold because passing night is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.000
 very common is the person who passes once 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.410
 by day is like but the ideal is to pass after 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.540
 the meals 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.959
 the examination is to identify problems 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.519
 in the very early stage because the naked eye 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.069
 I can not see 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.620
 thus begins the treatment and the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.959
 dentist to take several photos for 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.310
 patient to see the result in some 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.340
 felipe's teeth 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.669
 we saw a bacterial yellow plaque 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.910
 that every hour that the water of pavement 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:16.400
 who was trapped in other remains of 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.849
 food here you can see between the teeth 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.150
 a piece of white remnants of lunch 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.100
 an easy dental floss that has 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.830
 another picture 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.780
 which shows well the residues of 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.890
 food to see that around the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.870
 gum 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.790
 these times they can cause inflation 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.150
 of this edge of the gum 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.560
 besides dude he tata the dentist too 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.130
 found the expensive principle 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.530
 or the felipe needs to caprichar more 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.380
 in brushing you have to discover these 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.250
 three sides of the tooth first the side of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.010
 out 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.080
 then the biting side and then the side 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.349
 from within the certain we hold 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.540
 hold the school in that position because 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.610
 Then you can turn her around. 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.470
 here and now without calling me 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.030
 Holding on here is how difficult it is for me 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.370
 I have to do here in the arm practiced 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.890
 this area is parallel to my mouth 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.930
 Felipe follows the steps right and left. 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.680
 are tips that it will lead to the rest 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.680
 of life 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.720
 so we wait now will be that the 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:27.699
 brush makes a difference when it comes to brushing 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.930
 the teeth to help us figure out 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.389
 this mystery people will call that the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.129
 Rachel, I came here, Raquel, welcome. 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.199
 that student organization will 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.120
 participate in today 's essay is true 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.150
 Here I wanted it to be your challenge. 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.099
 next we have four brushes here 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.259
 I know how many times a day if the tooth prays 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.969
 so as I like I eat ten 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.699
 times I eat a lot I brush 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:52.270
 always but of course that brushing 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.099
 more time consuming with dental floss with 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.139
 Xavante is in the morning before leaving home 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:59.940
 At night, you can not stay the whole day. 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.940
 Doing it, do not give up.
