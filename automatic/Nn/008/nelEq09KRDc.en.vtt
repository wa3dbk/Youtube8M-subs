00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
period of about two months peregrine

falcons<00:00:22.770> are<00:00:22.890> very<00:00:23.370> pretty<00:00:23.640> birds<00:00:24.230> generally

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
falcons are very pretty birds generally

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.460 
falcons are very pretty birds generally
very<00:00:26.610> nice<00:00:26.820> disposition<00:00:27.320> they're<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
very nice disposition they're the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.080 
very nice disposition they're the
fastest<00:00:28.920> thing<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.280> ever<00:00:29.430> lived

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
fastest thing that ever lived

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
fastest thing that ever lived
they<00:00:30.270> descended<00:00:30.930> from<00:00:31.170> predatory<00:00:32.070> parrots

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
they descended from predatory parrots

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.190 
they descended from predatory parrots
that<00:00:32.910> were<00:00:33.239> around<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> Pleistocene

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that were around in the Pleistocene

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770 
that were around in the Pleistocene
which<00:00:35.010> evolved<00:00:35.550> into<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> peregrine<00:00:36.390> falcon

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
which evolved into the peregrine falcon

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.000 
which evolved into the peregrine falcon
so<00:00:36.990> they<00:00:37.140> had<00:00:37.260> come<00:00:37.470> from<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> completely

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
so they had come from a completely

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.150 
so they had come from a completely
different<00:00:38.340> lineage<00:00:39.060> than<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.380> Hawks<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
different lineage than the Hawks do and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.569 
different lineage than the Hawks do and
are<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.420> closely<00:00:42.870> related<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.680> like

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
are not really closely related and like

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
are not really closely related and like
I<00:00:44.700> say<00:00:44.880> they<00:00:45.060> can<00:00:45.240> they<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.900> fly<00:00:46.110> faster<00:00:46.380> than

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
I say they can they can fly faster than

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.729 
I say they can they can fly faster than
anything<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.640> run<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.840> 250<00:00:49.560> miles

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
anything can run they go about 250 miles

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
anything can run they go about 250 miles
an<00:00:49.920> hour<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.370> their<00:00:50.970> dives<00:00:51.239> when<00:00:51.720> they're

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
