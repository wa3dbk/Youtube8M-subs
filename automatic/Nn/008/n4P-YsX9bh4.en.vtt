00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello about video souza spectacular and 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.099
 I'm young, today I'll tell you guys. 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.440
 microphone type is me 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.170
 I have a microphone here that is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.660
 called a condenser microphone 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.850
 capacitive microphone each person calls 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.160
 in this way, the microphone of the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.670
 sony and non- directional is part of a 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 camera and the main feature of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 a condenser microphone is in fact 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 that it requires a power call 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.850
 the phantom paulo aquino case on the table 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.040
 Sound has this power supply that can be 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.489
 enabled or disabled 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.129
 here it generates a voltage of 48 volts that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 feeds that microphone and the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 then becomes the audio and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.219
 transfer to the sound table 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.300
 this other type of microphone, which I 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 I have it in his hands he is a microphone 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.980
 dynamic in that it means that it 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.109
 do not need this food you can 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.989
 connect to any line input of the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.470
 that table is automatically 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.049
 able to capture the audio is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.880
 Until this moment of the video I'm 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.100
 using the camera's own audio 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.570
 then the audio quality may not be 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.299
 very good and from now on I'll do 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.250
 I have here two channels I have already left are the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 xlr cables mounted xl this kind of car 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.220
 here are three pines 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.310
 I already left it was mounted and the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.619
 From this moment on, I 'll move on to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.140
 capture audio with editing software 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.630
 video to be able to show there 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.180
 difference then I'll call first here 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.380
 on channel 11 dynamic microphone that is 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.750
 here on this channel 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 I already left here state building at the table 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.240
 sound level in the middle of a little bit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.579
 of gain here that this same one has in 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.259
 phantom input gain control 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.180
 power is offline 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.369
 from that moment I will start the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.600
 recording video software I'm going 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.259
 put here only the headset 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.690
 have a return of I then speak in that 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.260
 moment is the audio you are listening to 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.330
 is being picked up by the microphone 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.440
 that is connected here on the table 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.730
 of sound 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.470
 you can notice any difference is this 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.660
 dynamic microphone it does not require 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.800
 phantom power so you can let 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.290
 the button is off 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.880
 if you turn the button on it does not 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.110
 has no problem if it does not 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.430
 Microphone is and now I'll show you 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.100
 that the condenser microphone that is this 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.100
 here when I call and speak at the 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.200
 microphone with phantom power off 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.250
 it will not pick up the sound and put that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.250
 first microphone here 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.099
 such is the continuation 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.720
 I keep recording here is with the 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.270
 audio software I'm talking about here 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.140
 in that first microphone the dynamic and 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.520
 I'll speak now on the capacitive microphone. 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.760
 you will see that the audio will not be 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.760
 captured 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.630
 from the moment I turn on the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.239
 phantom dick and then yes that mike goes 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.670
 start working 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.519
 At that moment I called phantom power and 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.980
 This capacitive microphone is what 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.080
 it's in my hand sony mike it 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.650
 He then went on to do the capture and I'm going 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.940
 until it will be that other first microphone 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.790
 just to show you the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.400
 difference then when I was with a 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.540
 phantom power off this microphone 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.430
 capacitive he could not grasp the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.230
 audio that came to him 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.049
 precisely because he needs this 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.660
 then people interested in this 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.390
 video was just to show the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.079
 difference between the dynamic microphone 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.910
 a capacitive microphone and show is the 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.829
 what is the phantom power a lot of people have 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.620
 this doubt the phantom power this 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.610
 power supply that arrives at the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.080
 microphone and allows you to use 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.289
 So this video was just for power. 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.570
 make this demonstration the capture of the 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.550
 audio on your computer is being made 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.979
 from that exit rc here that I called 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.539
 common microphone input because it was 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.180
 The only cable I had here to do. 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.190
 I'll make the connection better then 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.539
 in the next videos I'll show you 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.400
 for you 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.370
 other things you can do with the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.260
 your sound table so you can capture the 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.030
 audio quality on your computer 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.310
 so people this video was just for 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.919
 to show it to you that 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.050
 the condenser microphone it depends on 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.070
 phantom power that this 48 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.500
 volts 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.000
 the condenser microphones they have to 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.010
 audio quality that is usually 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.500
 the best are the specific microphones 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.729
 for locution for you is not the case said 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.130
 here I'm using is one more 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.919
 microphone called boom that is for 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.080
 Ambient sound capture is it's 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.849
 directional 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.380
 so this video was for this you have 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.720
 I'll ask you to click the 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.260
 I like to help spread the word if you 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.520
 can also subscribe to the channel is 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.320
 The videos I'm going to make will be 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.450
 showing some functions of this desk 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.220
 sound here so you can have a notion 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.420
 there you can make your 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.010
 own projects 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.990
 I thank you for watching the video. 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.950
 here thank you very much to have assisted 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.950
