are<00:06:28.150> ways<00:06:28.509> to<00:06:28.990> do<00:06:29.919> this<00:06:29.949> very<00:06:30.669> inexpensively

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
are ways to do this very inexpensively

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.810 
are ways to do this very inexpensively
and<00:06:31.660> it<00:06:31.780> starts<00:06:32.320> with<00:06:32.800> getting<00:06:32.979> tower<00:06:33.310> gardens

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
and it starts with getting tower gardens

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.719 
and it starts with getting tower gardens
and<00:06:34.199> then<00:06:35.199> getting<00:06:36.039> your<00:06:36.280> neighbors<00:06:36.580> together

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729

and cooperatively getting the fruits and

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.730 
and cooperatively getting the fruits and
really<00:06:42.220> it<00:06:42.460> takes<00:06:42.880> a<00:06:43.120> community<00:06:43.449> to<00:06:43.840> eat<00:06:44.530> like

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
really it takes a community to eat like

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.460 
really it takes a community to eat like
this<00:06:45.000> but<00:06:46.000> it<00:06:46.240> makes<00:06:46.449> such<00:06:46.870> a<00:06:46.900> difference<00:06:47.020> in

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470
