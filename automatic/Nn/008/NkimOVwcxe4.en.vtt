00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
it you can see here where that you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.160 
it you can see here where that you
started<00:00:41.059> rubbing<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.420> piece<00:00:41.660> of<00:00:41.809> silicone

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
it I don't know what they're trying to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.829 
it I don't know what they're trying to
do<00:00:44.870> their<00:00:45.019> dirty<00:00:45.949> old<00:00:46.250> silicone<00:00:46.519> the<00:00:47.510> guy<00:00:47.660> said

he<00:00:47.929> owned<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.230> for<00:00:48.260> over<00:00:48.559> 10<00:00:48.769> years<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:49.370> this

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
he owned it for over 10 years so this

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.360 
he owned it for over 10 years so this
case<00:00:50.000> is<00:00:50.149> pretty<00:00:50.269> much<00:00:50.449> garbage<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:52.039> engine

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
case is pretty much garbage the engine

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.739 
case is pretty much garbage the engine
the<00:00:52.670> only<00:00:52.820> thing<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.059> might<00:00:53.210> be<00:00:53.359> solved<00:00:53.660> that

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
the only thing that might be solved that

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.770 
the only thing that might be solved that
jabo<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.109> two<00:00:54.230> cases<00:00:54.710> maybe<00:00:55.100> they're<00:00:55.519> probably

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
jabo is two cases maybe they're probably

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.489 
jabo is two cases maybe they're probably
corroded<00:00:56.780> because<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.109> could<00:00:57.230> see<00:00:57.350> some

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
shaped his gas tanks in because mine

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.090 
shaped his gas tanks in because mine
actually<00:01:31.310> has<00:01:31.430> some<00:01:31.610> leaks<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.950> it's<00:01:33.950> been

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
actually has some leaks in it it's been

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.580 
actually has some leaks in it it's been
on<00:01:34.220> there<00:01:34.400> might<00:01:34.610> be<00:01:34.640> good<00:01:34.970> hard<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.480> say<00:01:35.660> so

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
on there might be good hard to say so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.210

that's<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.340> calm<00:01:37.700> their<00:01:37.880> side<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.150> shoals<00:01:39.220> so

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
that's to calm their side of shoals so

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.890 
that's to calm their side of shoals so
that's<00:01:40.520> about<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.940> same<00:01:41.300> actually<00:01:41.660> I<00:01:41.810> think

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
that's about the same actually I think

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.970 
that's about the same actually I think
mine<00:01:42.170> only<00:01:42.350> has<00:01:42.440> 1100<00:01:43.160> on<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:45.800> can't

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
mine only has 1100 on it so I can't

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.400 
mine only has 1100 on it so I can't
really<00:01:46.100> say<00:01:46.340> much<00:01:46.370> good<00:01:47.000> about<00:01:47.150> this<00:01:47.480> it<00:01:48.260> was

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
90 bucks 90 so he was asking 100 he

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.710 
90 bucks 90 so he was asking 100 he
didn't<00:01:51.740> want<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:51.950> really<00:01:52.070> go<00:01:52.250> down<00:01:52.400> much<00:01:52.760> so

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
didn't want to really go down much so

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.480 
didn't want to really go down much so
you<00:01:53.930> can<00:01:54.050> see<00:01:54.170> on<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.380> side<00:01:54.590> here<00:01:54.860> exhaust

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
you can see on this side here exhaust

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.190 
you can see on this side here exhaust
flywheel<00:01:56.500> so<00:01:58.510> it's<00:01:59.510> kind<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.720> weird<00:01:59.870> how<00:02:00.020> this

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
flywheel so it's kind of weird how this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.590 
flywheel so it's kind of weird how this
exhaust<00:02:00.590> has<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.860> big<00:02:01.430> panel<00:02:01.880> welded<00:02:02.240> on<00:02:02.360> top

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
exhaust has a big panel welded on top

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.120 
exhaust has a big panel welded on top
mine<00:02:02.990> doesn't<00:02:03.200> have<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.650> I'm<00:02:03.800> pretty<00:02:03.980> sure

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
mine doesn't have that I'm pretty sure

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.380 
mine doesn't have that I'm pretty sure
it<00:02:04.220> doesn't<00:02:04.550> anyway<00:02:05.050> so<00:02:07.030> kind<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.179> better

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
it doesn't anyway so kind of a better

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.589 
it doesn't anyway so kind of a better
shot<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.899> here

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
shot of it here

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.569 
shot of it here
so<00:02:11.200> what's<00:02:11.680> good<00:02:11.829> about<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.129> one<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.430> it

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
so what's good about this one is it

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.800 
so what's good about this one is it
looks<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:12.969> gas<00:02:13.120> tank<00:02:13.359> hasn't<00:02:13.689> been

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
looks like the gas tank hasn't been

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.649 
looks like the gas tank hasn't been
shaved<00:02:14.049> down<00:02:14.409> ever<00:02:14.920> before<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.359> might<00:02:16.480> be

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
shaved down ever before so it might be

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.179 
shaved down ever before so it might be
good<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> frame<00:02:17.260> looks<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.739> be<00:02:17.829> nice<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
good to frame looks to be nice and

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.729 
good to frame looks to be nice and
straight<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:18.760> I'm<00:02:19.719> sure<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.049> some<00:02:20.230> parts<00:02:20.499> I<00:02:20.590> can

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
straight so I'm sure to some parts I can

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.720 
straight so I'm sure to some parts I can
pull<00:02:21.159> off<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:22.469> I'll<00:02:23.469> start<00:02:23.829> again<00:02:23.920> pretty<00:02:24.579> much

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
pull off it I'll start again pretty much

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.220 
pull off it I'll start again pretty much
off<00:02:24.879> tour<00:02:25.090> I'll<00:02:25.420> start<00:02:25.659> the<00:02:25.749> video<00:02:25.930> once<00:02:26.139> I

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
off tour I'll start the video once I

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.509 
off tour I'll start the video once I
figure<00:02:26.469> out<00:02:26.499> what<00:02:26.799> I'm<00:02:26.889> going<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.129> do<00:02:27.219> with<00:02:27.340> it

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
figure out what I'm going to do with it

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.989 
figure out what I'm going to do with it
okay<00:02:28.389> that's<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.659> end<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.840> this
