00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.299 
need to work out on together i think
it's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.560> group<00:00:31.769> effort<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.250> know

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it's a it's a group effort you know

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.760 
it's a it's a group effort you know
where<00:00:32.630> it<00:00:33.630> comes<00:00:34.079> down<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> surgeon<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.710> i

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
where it comes down to surgeon so i

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.319 
where it comes down to surgeon so i
think<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.070> played<00:00:35.250> too<00:00:35.430> safe<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.120> take
