 and all the writing is inspired by 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:13.219
 god and useful to teach to come for 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.400
 correct to instruct injustice in order 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.020
 that the man of god is perfect 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.740
 entirely prepared for all good 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.440

 The universal epistle of Saint Judas 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.310
 Apostle Judas Servant of Jesus Christ and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 brother of jacobo to the calls 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.829
 certificates in god father and saved

 in Jesus Christ mercy and peace and love 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.100
 or have multiplied 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.960
 loved by the great desire I had of 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.960
 write about our common 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.540
 salvation it has been necessary for me to write 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.720
 I am exhorting you that you contain dais 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 ardently for the faith that has been a 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.750
 given to the saints because some 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.370
 men have covertly entered the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.670
 that had been destined before 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.699
 for this condemnation men and shipments 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.159
 that turn grace into licentiousness 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.350
 of our god and deny God the only 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.350
 sovereign and our lord jesus christ 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.900
 I want to remind you that once 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.180
 you have known that the lord having 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.320
 saved the people out of Egypt 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.150
 then he destroyed those who did not believe and 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.729
 to the angels who did not keep their 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.759
 dignity but they abandoned their own 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.399
 home has kept them under darkness in 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.140
 eternal prisons for the trial of the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.420
 great day 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 also sodoma and gomorra and cities 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.549
 neighbors which in the same way 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 that those having fornicated I have gone 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.440
 in pursuit of vices against nature 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.320
 were put for example suffering the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.080
 punishment of eternal fire 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.630
 however in the same way also 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.030
 these dreamers blemish the flesh 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.460
 reject the authority and the faith man of 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.610
 the higher powers but when the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.380
 arcÃ¡ngel miguel fought with the devil 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.479
 disputing him the body of bassinet is not 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.119
 he dared to pronounce curse judgment 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.270
 against him but said the Lord 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.760
 reprimand but these fear them of how many 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.459
 things they do not know and in which 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.850
 nature know they become corrupted like 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.370
 irrational animals 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.400
 there are of them because they have followed the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.860
 path of cain were launched for profit in 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.200
 the error of balaam and perished in the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.140
 contradiction of core 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.390
 these are spots of our Arabs that 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.660
 eating without shame with 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.600
 you be patient to yourselves clouds 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.810
 without water carried back and forth by 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.440
 the winds autumn trees without fruit 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.930
 twice dead and uprooted are 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.960
 wild beasts of the sea that foam in their 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.570
 own shame wandering stars for 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.340
 which is eternally reserved 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.040
 darkness of darkness 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.099
 these also prophesied in another seventh 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.470
 from adam saying here's the wine 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.599
 Lord with his saints tens of thousands 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.209
 to sue everyone and leave 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.890
 convicted to all the wicked of all 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.980
 his ungodly works that have done 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.110
 impiously and of all hard things 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.640
 that the ungodly sinners have spoken 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.030
 against him 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.430
 these are plaintive whispers that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.860
 they walk according to their own desires whose mouth 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.400
 he talks about inflated things flattering the 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.760
 people to take advantage 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.829
 but you loved have memory of 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.269
 the words that were previously said by 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.689
 the apostles of our Lord 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.879
 Jesus Christ they told you in the 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.209
 last time there will be mockers that 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.640
 they will walk according to their evil desires these 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.400
 are those that cause divisions live 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.329

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.939

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.959

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.479

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.880
