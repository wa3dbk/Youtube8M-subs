00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
all the way through the F blade is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
all the way through the F blade is
perfect<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.360> cutting<00:01:15.570> large<00:01:15.960> ropes<00:01:16.470> here's<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
perfect for cutting large ropes here's a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.390 
perfect for cutting large ropes here's a
5/8<00:01:17.790> inch<00:01:17.960> double<00:01:18.960> braid<00:01:19.229> nylon<00:01:19.770> rope<00:01:20.100> and

5/8 inch double braid nylon rope and
notice<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.060> cuts<00:01:21.360> right<00:01:21.630> through<00:01:21.960> without

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
notice it cuts right through without

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
notice it cuts right through without
having<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.710> move<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.920> blade<00:01:23.369> back<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> forth

having to move the blade back and forth

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.109 
having to move the blade back and forth
if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.110> need<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> cut<00:01:25.680> fabric<00:01:26.250> tape<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:26.850> 2

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
if you need to cut fabric tape that's 2

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.390 
if you need to cut fabric tape that's 2
inches<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.720> less<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.409> use<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> F<00:01:29.009> blade

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
inches or less you can use the F blade

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.020 
inches or less you can use the F blade
to<00:01:29.640> cut<00:01:30.030> through<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:31.020> swift<00:01:31.470> move<00:01:32.030> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
to cut through in one swift move and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
to cut through in one swift move and
it's<00:01:33.420> also<00:01:33.600> useful<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.320> cutting<00:01:34.680> fabric

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it's also useful for cutting fabric

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.429 
it's also useful for cutting fabric
though<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.939> designed<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.750> here

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
though it's not designed for that here

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.520 
though it's not designed for that here
we<00:01:37.560> cut<00:01:37.829> some<00:01:38.040> Brella<00:01:38.310> fabric<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:40.020> F<00:01:40.229> blade

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
we cut some Brella fabric the F blade

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
we cut some Brella fabric the F blade
was<00:01:40.799> designed<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.400> fit<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.820> sailrite<00:01:42.180> edge

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
was designed to fit in the sailrite edge

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
was designed to fit in the sailrite edge
hotknife<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> will<00:01:43.649> also<00:01:44.100> fit<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
hotknife but it will also fit in the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
hotknife but it will also fit in the
Engel<00:01:45.210> hot<00:01:45.420> knife<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.960> shown<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> will

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
Engel hot knife as shown here you will

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.130 
Engel hot knife as shown here you will
have<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.729> press<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.210> prongs<00:01:48.540> together

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
have to press the prongs together

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.569 
have to press the prongs together
because<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> fits<00:01:49.950> very<00:01:50.070> snugly<00:01:51.979> in<00:01:52.979> random
