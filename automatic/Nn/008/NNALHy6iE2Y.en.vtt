was too tired I had no energy left so I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.889 
was too tired I had no energy left so I
pretty<00:01:59.700> much<00:01:59.790> got<00:02:00.060> tackled<00:02:00.390> by<00:02:00.450> Brian<00:02:00.689> Cushing

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
I couldn't be more prepared as a

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.620 
I couldn't be more prepared as a
