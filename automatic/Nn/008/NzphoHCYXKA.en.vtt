00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to give it a couple of clamps and at

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.139 
to give it a couple of clamps and at
that<00:01:03.870> point<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.710> put<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.009> in<00:01:05.129> park<00:01:05.399> foot<00:01:06.030> off

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
that point I can put it in park foot off

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:12.170 
that point I can put it in park foot off

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.480 
have emotion to get it out of park bars
taking<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.440> off<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:12.860> obviously<00:02:13.370> pretty

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
taking it off it's obviously pretty

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.060 
taking it off it's obviously pretty
straightforward<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.450> clip<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.860> other

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
straightforward just clip the other

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.190 
straightforward just clip the other
option<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.120> way<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.270> originally<00:02:17.450> designed<00:02:17.870> it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
option the way I originally designed it

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.120 
option the way I originally designed it
was<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.280> went<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.920> kind

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
was so that it went on this and it kind

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.790 
was so that it went on this and it kind
of<00:02:22.160> went<00:02:22.280> up<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.520> here<00:02:22.730> at<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.120> angle<00:02:23.360> and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
of went up in here at this angle and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.780 
of went up in here at this angle and
then<00:02:24.800> when<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.220> pump<00:02:25.460> it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
then when you pump it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.420 
then when you pump it
there's<00:02:26.150> also<00:02:26.390> another<00:02:27.350> area<00:02:27.860> up<00:02:28.100> here<00:02:28.280> that's

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
there's also another area up here that's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.790 
there's also another area up here that's
flat<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.030> whatever<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.780> easiest<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.440> this

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
flat so whatever is easiest to you this

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.540 
flat so whatever is easiest to you this
way<00:02:31.070> it's<00:02:31.610> more<00:02:32.030> up<00:02:32.150> out<00:02:32.300> of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.510> way<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:34.430> know

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
way it's more up out of the way you know

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.090 
way it's more up out of the way you know
this<00:02:35.300> way<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:37.610> kind<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.060> quicker<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.920> put

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
this way it's kind of quicker to put

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.800 
this way it's kind of quicker to put
into<00:02:40.250> action<00:02:40.490> because<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.510> pushed

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
into action because it just pushed

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.040 
into action because it just pushed
forward<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.920> grip<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.520> or<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.570> know<00:02:44.660> how

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
forward and the grip is or you know how

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.199 
forward and the grip is or you know how
it<00:02:45.110> worked<00:02:45.290> for<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.800> pump<00:02:46.190> either<00:02:47.030> way

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
it worked for you to pump either way

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.030 
it worked for you to pump either way
looks<00:02:47.450> good<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.080> twenty<00:02:48.350> dollar<00:02:48.880> ebrake

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
looks good it's a twenty dollar ebrake

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.370 
looks good it's a twenty dollar ebrake
all<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.100> did<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:52.430> was<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.300> took<00:02:54.200> off<00:02:56.020> this<00:02:57.020> piece

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
all I did here was I took off this piece

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.670 
all I did here was I took off this piece
here<00:02:57.970> real<00:02:58.970> simple<00:02:59.390> they<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.230> slid<00:03:00.410> onto<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
here real simple they just slid onto the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.400 
here real simple they just slid onto the
in<00:03:00.770> here<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.160> took<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.520> piece<00:03:01.700> off<00:03:01.910> and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
in here so I took that piece off and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.780 
in here so I took that piece off and
then<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:04.310> end<00:03:04.520> over<00:03:04.880> here<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.330> cut<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.870> off

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
then on this end over here I cut it off

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.940 
then on this end over here I cut it off
I<00:03:07.850> think<00:03:08.239> about<00:03:08.390> two<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.720> half<00:03:08.750> inches<00:03:09.230> you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
I think about two and a half inches you

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.180 
I think about two and a half inches you
can<00:03:10.130> tell<00:03:10.430> because<00:03:11.000> otherwise<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.950> was

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
can tell because otherwise it was

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.270 
can tell because otherwise it was
hanging<00:03:13.910> up<00:03:14.030> on<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.450> dash<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:14.989> basically<00:03:15.950> with

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
hanging up on the dash so basically with

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.910 
hanging up on the dash so basically with
that<00:03:16.459> cut<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:16.940> right<00:03:17.150> length<00:03:17.799> you<00:03:18.799> know

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
that cut to that right length you know

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.380 
that cut to that right length you know
there's<00:03:19.310> no<00:03:19.459> hang<00:03:19.670> up<00:03:19.760> underneath<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.239> dash

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
there's no hang up underneath the dash

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.990 
there's no hang up underneath the dash
it's<00:03:20.840> just<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.080> matter<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.380> pumping<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.459> in<00:03:22.549> get

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
it's just a matter of pumping it in get

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.220 
it's just a matter of pumping it in get
it<00:03:23.090> into<00:03:23.769> another<00:03:24.769> position<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:29.110> hope<00:03:30.110> you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
it into another position so hope you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.680 
it into another position so hope you
guys<00:03:30.290> enjoy<00:03:30.650> it
