00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.650
 hang around in the woods and farm creeps on 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.540
 for 30 minutes 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.250

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.110
 war plunge into action from the first minutes 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.210
 cuts out the whole team of opponents alone 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.199
 or copy with your friends registration in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.760

 hello gangsters you panda today we 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 let's talk about the divorce which recently 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 appeared and a lot of people in my 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.250
 public spam message such 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.580
 character and is being recruited into the team 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.070
 need such a person most often just 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.410
 written is being set without a role which 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.570
 need this team supposedly someone playing 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 club or some organization but the most 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 strange that references to this organization 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.930
 No, and I usually keep this information on 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 it is quite difficult for her to write in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.079
 lichku with proposals to join the team 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.500
 I tried to do it myself 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.289
 answered de Odessa show steam show 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.539
 mmr there everything is so I threw account dude 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.550
 actor great mayor cool 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.739
 profile stimu but for me to answer something 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.480
 stopped so I was never what 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.220
 the essence of this divorce 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 however, my subscriber is good for him 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.409
 thank you threw me screenshots of communication with 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 razvodily who answered him and in general 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.880
 Now we look at it all and so he 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.409
 writes they say yes I want to team 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 let's change soon 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 the most interesting thing is that they don't throw it right away 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.100
 link to download someone for a long time to communicate 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.560
 with him, that is, everything would turn out well and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.670
 normal humanly humanly 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.100
 I would say so goes further correspondence in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.479
 the result of which he throws his steam 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.009
 profile but everything is ok nothing 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.020
 the terrible thing is that you give a link to 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.820
 steam profile of course not and then it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.579
 asked to come for an interview by downloading 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.890
 program from a very dubious site 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.299
 at hundred for very strange why 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.740
 cannot be interviewed in 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.780
 Skype that everyone has a need 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.000
 some kind of software there for this 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.280
 well and as you understand about you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.759
 here he writes about the problem with this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.310
 site 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.320
 man writes that thank God he has 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.280
 avast and respectively threw up to the pain 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.939
 this black list 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.939
 a curtain
