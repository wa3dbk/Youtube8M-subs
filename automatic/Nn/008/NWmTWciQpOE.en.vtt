00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
to insert them you gently twist the ear

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.689 
to insert them you gently twist the ear
pads<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:49.000> remove<00:00:49.030> them<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:50.470> it's<00:00:50.770> one<00:00:51.220> battery

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
pads to remove them and it's one battery

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.200 
pads to remove them and it's one battery
on<00:00:51.910> each<00:00:52.180> side

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
on each side

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.830 
on each side
plug<00:00:54.630> in<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> power<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.040> audio<00:00:56.340> cable

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
plug in the power and the audio cable

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.900 
plug in the power and the audio cable
now<00:00:57.840> let's<00:00:58.140> connect<00:00:58.560> to<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.830> TV

televisions connectivity panel could

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.020 
televisions connectivity panel could
look<00:01:04.989> like<00:01:05.050> this<00:01:05.620> all<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:07.710> obvious<00:01:09.030> pretty

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
look like this all this obvious pretty

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.300 
look like this all this obvious pretty
much<00:01:10.300> always<00:01:10.630> different<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.530> let's<00:01:11.860> take<00:01:12.160> a

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
much always different so let's take a

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.060 
much always different so let's take a
closer<00:01:12.670> look<00:01:12.820> in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:14.170> best<00:01:14.320> case<00:01:14.560> you'll<00:01:14.770> find

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
closer look in the best case you'll find

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.469 
closer look in the best case you'll find
a<00:01:15.190> headphone<00:01:15.670> output<00:01:15.850> like<00:01:16.690> this

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
it with an adapter this is what they

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.699 
it with an adapter this is what they
look<00:02:28.220> like

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
look like

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
it's an RCA to audio jack adapter and

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.610 
it's an RCA to audio jack adapter and
they<00:02:32.709> don't<00:02:32.920> cost<00:02:33.189> much<00:02:33.459> on<00:02:34.109> the<00:02:35.109> back<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.469> your
