00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780 
what it's called but the attack drone
that<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.960> black<00:01:31.500> ops<00:01:31.770> 2<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.670> see

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that we had in black ops 2 you can see

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550 
that we had in black ops 2 you can see
it<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.060> screen<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.479> again<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.900> thought<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> do

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it on screen now again I thought to do

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.390 
it on screen now again I thought to do
something<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
something like this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
something like this
online<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> believe<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.299> had<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.780> RC<00:01:37.259> plane

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
online I believe we had like an RC plane

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.530 
online I believe we had like an RC plane
on<00:01:37.740> Vice<00:01:37.950> City<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> didn't<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.390> any

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
on Vice City but that didn't have any

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.910 
on Vice City but that didn't have any
guns<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:39.869> anything<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> mini

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
guns or anything it was just like a mini

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
guns or anything it was just like a mini
game<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:41.880> fun<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> do

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
game but it was really really fun to do

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.050 
game but it was really really fun to do
so<00:01:43.110> I'd<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> see<00:01:43.710> some<00:01:43.920> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.250> RC<00:01:44.729> drone

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060

may be thinking online but it would be

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.190 
may be thinking online but it would be
pretty<00:02:02.729> easy<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.180> take<00:02:03.420> down<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.810> also<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.450 
parachutes we could have like a glider
so<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.050> pretended<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.620> fly<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.310> that'd<00:02:21.430> be

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
so I pretended to fly I think that'd be

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.150 
so I pretended to fly I think that'd be
awesome<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.030> superhero<00:02:22.570> DLC<00:02:23.290> not<00:02:23.830> saying<00:02:24.070> you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
have superpowers in online because that

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.540 
have superpowers in online because that
would<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.380> overpowered<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.130> they're

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
would be overpowered and they're

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.370 
would be overpowered and they're
probably<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.970> bit<00:02:28.120> stupid<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.720> well<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.960> think

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
probably a bit stupid as well I think

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.070 
probably a bit stupid as well I think
that'd<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.530> unrealistic<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:31.120> superhero

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080

look<00:02:54.070> like<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.550> I<00:02:54.610> think<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.030> would<00:02:55.180> be

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
look like that I think that would be

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.040 
look like that I think that would be
super<00:02:55.630> awesome

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
super awesome

30,000<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.320> thought<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.709> would<00:02:59.860> be<00:02:59.890> something

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
30,000 I thought this would be something

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.680 
30,000 I thought this would be something
they<00:03:00.400> would<00:03:00.520> have<00:03:00.610> already<00:03:00.880> put<00:03:01.240> into<00:03:01.600> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
they would have already put into the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.850 
they would have already put into the
game<00:03:01.840> because<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.140> would<00:03:02.320> be<00:03:02.470> really<00:03:02.680> really

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860

that<00:03:12.760> wouldn't<00:03:13.090> happen<00:03:13.270> anymore<00:03:13.600> which<00:03:13.840> would

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
that wouldn't happen anymore which would

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.540 
that wouldn't happen anymore which would
be<00:03:14.080> awesome<00:03:14.470> but<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:15.040> could<00:03:15.190> also<00:03:15.310> be

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
be awesome but this could also be

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.310 
be awesome but this could also be
overpowered<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.450> little<00:03:16.690> bit<00:03:16.810> if<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:16.959> can't

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
overpowered a little bit if you can't

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.690 
overpowered a little bit if you can't
get<00:03:17.500> killed<00:03:17.739> driving<00:03:17.980> around<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.370> your<00:03:18.489> car

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
get killed driving around in your car

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.160 
get killed driving around in your car
basically<00:03:19.000> you're<00:03:19.390> invincible

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
basically you're invincible

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.930 
basically you're invincible
and<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:20.980> wouldn't<00:03:21.370> make<00:03:21.459> your<00:03:21.640> car

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
and but that wouldn't make your car

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.850 
and but that wouldn't make your car
explosive<00:03:22.810> proof<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.290> could<00:03:23.500> still<00:03:23.739> get

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
explosive proof so you could still get

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.860 
explosive proof so you could still get
killed<00:03:24.160> with<00:03:24.370> explosives<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.330> but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
killed with explosives and but

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.420 
killed with explosives and but
bulletproof<00:03:26.290> windows<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.830> definitely<00:03:27.070> think

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
bulletproof windows I definitely think

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.550 
bulletproof windows I definitely think

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.120 
things that we could have from previous
GTA's<00:04:16.090> I'd<00:04:16.330> call<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.780> retro<00:04:17.169> GTA<00:04:17.560> park

know why this isn't in the
I<00:04:25.190> also<00:04:25.700> asked<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.120> same<00:04:26.270> question<00:04:26.660> for<00:04:26.870> the

I also asked the same question for the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.900 
I also asked the same question for the
Boeing<00:04:27.110> 747<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.250> believe<00:04:28.490> they<00:04:28.640> are<00:04:28.760> the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
Boeing 747 so I believe they are the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.730 
Boeing 747 so I believe they are the
other<00:04:29.030> jumbo<00:04:29.420> jet<00:04:29.660> planes<00:04:29.900> while<00:04:30.500> we<00:04:30.620> actually

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
other jumbo jet planes while we actually

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.230 
other jumbo jet planes while we actually
can't<00:04:31.130> use<00:04:31.310> them<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.670> on<00:04:31.790> line<00:04:31.970> because

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
can't use them in on line because

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.520 
can't use them in on line because
they're<00:04:32.450> already<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.080> line<00:04:33.230> we<00:04:33.380> can

they're already in on line we can

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.260 
they're already in on line we can
already<00:04:33.650> see<00:04:33.950> them<00:04:34.160> but<00:04:34.610> we<00:04:34.640> can't<00:04:34.880> fire<00:04:35.120> them

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270
