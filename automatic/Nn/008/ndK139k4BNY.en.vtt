00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 who is unlimited is what is the limit of the human being 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.310
 it is not known if the driver who would have caused through the passage 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.339
 we do not want to hit the key that time 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.230
 It will not be long until then totally renovated until December 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.050
 according to the prefecture of green field 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.510
 when it is said that celg d 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.100
 it's because you want something to imitate so in that you have no draw limit 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.350
 made in the patient 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.320
 until the japan for 15 to buy a lot was fine he is friend 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.160
 private and that it was also he was hospitalized in the holy house so the care 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.270
 of elderly people 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.620
 the technology used for the vacancy 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.510
 now 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 that's it 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 processor with 2 to 1 what I did and he who mocks another two cores of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.710
 four groups of cassation 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.480
 the hpi 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.160
 of 500 tinga there is plenty of disk space 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.160
 who stays 500 miles 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.350
 a lot of movie 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.329
 a lot of music 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.470
 lots of photo 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.470
 You have a budget of 500 if you can speak better. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.410
 I'm in 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.060
 It is now back up network 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.480
 the space is very small in isolation 500 today for example the chain of 580 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.670
 that's a lot of people 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.170
 art who is going to give speed case 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.700
 all people to all areas the race 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.310
 most of the people 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.540
 f 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.890
 the ex-team jail but I want is that it is possible to play with the brand be 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.400
 very fast 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.540
 that's true 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.750
 nati of the performance on the machine a good processor a good amount of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.510
 memory 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.550
 magali is nothing more than a device to dictate but I in mine as it is seen 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.170
 placing 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.920
 if you damage the material 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.630
 You will miss the states of CearÃ¡. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.020
 cork for one 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.369
 bangcoc are completely separated people's wagon it's a device 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.649
 as with fellini i may know you record and save the little to do with the sound 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.599
 similar will save the information only here 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.939
 unlike most CDs you can renew this information now vcs 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.779
 does not have this function 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.789
 in his last 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.199
 it was all right 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.559
 this had to be active it has 4 gb of memory 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:23.739
 and he does 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.229
 I know this entity eight digits 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.499
 but if I want to exhibit individually it has been great 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.299
 I'm going to lose tunnel exit until I have a good skin in the files. 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:36.539
 although everyone speaks in memory 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.499
 Who has memory that what they keep 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:43.839
 this is a type of memory stored at a lower level in four years 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:48.309
 My mother and the girl joked about whether the two of them were slow to 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:49.300
 the one who keeps 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.160
 the pomegranate 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.029
 is the one that has even traffic 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.369
 if I say computer and airbus device the agreement 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.089
 to gauge it begins to put into orbit then for example the function of the 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:03.019
 smaller 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.340
 that's why we know that part of the city because the function of memory 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.669
 and this 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.139
 her when you plug in your notebook 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.069
 is an area 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
 adopt the processor already with the processor 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.299
 rule the programs and play for the memory 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.609
 stored programs 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.389
 inside the senate 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.729
 so it is very important that more memory 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.079
 quickly and you have in the decree more performance and you have 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.819
 and in his day-to-day that today we have much program agent the processor him 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.849
 many programs that are loaded into memory 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.309
 of your notebook 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.309
 the latter also has an interesting hdmi output thing 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.240
 asked him if he was third. 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.240
 Jonathan did not tell me about it. 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.749
 in this perspective that has 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:58.749
 r 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:03.009
 The king came here to buy a notebook and this is our program and 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.009
 during the meeting 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.019
 this date 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.989
 so I'll talk about this right now 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.359
 only with the silver in the hdmi output an exit from that fight the edition edition 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.180
 of digital imaging 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.090
 so that you have the lcd plasma televisions with an hdmi output 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:23.919
 despite this comment 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.919
 use your notebook as a dvd player 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:32.649
 if we download vide the definition records a video definition process to map 

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:33.449
 an 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.360
 10 ar 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.740
 only 235 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.770
 Father's day is coming 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.270
 I think they are already with their friends then between the countries 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.819
 the man does not like technology 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.999
 difficult said today women are also there river 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.310
 everton floor nothing technology and also 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.229
 the chain the current city 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.169
 The second you end up liking because technology is a challenge. 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.109
 the project lasted one day every day in dubai 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.849
 little use 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.199
 after 30 years ago 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.930
 cutting-edge technology 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.129
 the independent-pa 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.819
 kakakakakakakakaka ae 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.900
 for example d 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.139
 d
