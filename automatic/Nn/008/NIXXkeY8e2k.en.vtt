00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.940
 great pilots with you marata slide from 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.710
 today in the game world of warplanes we 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.650
 let's talk about the plane and-16 late is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.580
 fourth gear fighter aircraft in 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.740
 Russian branch 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.380
 1 by the way the plane that is me 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.739
 really liked which on me 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.170
 really fun let's fly 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.280
 consider the same strengths of this 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.380
 plane well, not surely 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 arming him is very powerful it is two 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:50.320
 twenty millimeter machine gun shvak 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.800
 which cause mad damage as well as 277 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.070
 and 62 mm machine gun such guns 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.700
 allow you to endure a lot in this game too 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.059
 believe me 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.579
 there are also 6 rocket pieces here i see 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.369
 I didn't even buy them because I didn't even 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.439
 I know why they are needed 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.969
 also our fighters possesses quite 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.130
 impressive maneuverability 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.709
 which allows nick some time 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.829
 keep on your tail 

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:23.560
 several opponents speaking of the weak 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:29.229
 sides i want to mention 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.329
 the stock of hit points is about 80 it is very 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.700
 little compared to rivals on his 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.299
 same level also we do not possess 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.819
 almost armor 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.609
 so to speak flying but than maneuverable 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.279
 card speed is also not the best way 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:49.319
 German planes 4 levels can just 

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:52.509
 fly away from us including the afterburner 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:55.990
 balance weight of the plane everything is usually from 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.840
 2 to 6 level plus or minus 2-catching but 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.439
 most often throws kittens and of 5 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.829
 level will be aircraft 23 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:09.880
 as for pumping of course immediately 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.620
 need to build everything in top and babies 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.120
 haircuts and gun we won't just 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.130
 take precedence over 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.620
 classmates 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.080
 but about the missiles here you have to decide 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.780
 I personally did not put them if I honestly 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.230
 don't see any point in these rocket 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.510
 rocket fighter of course if 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.790
 you do not mind the silver you can put 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.750
 plus remember this extra weight 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.450
 it's less maneuverability 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:41.490
 here and in the building they are not so well endured 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.140
 they can endure well fighter 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.150
 heavy fighters who slowly 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.360
 flies in which it is easy to aim 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.350
 but the point is that there is no catch on it 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.420
 practically so slow heavy 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.090
 stormtroopers and bombers they already 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.940
 at higher levels and here on this 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.030
 caught all so maneuverable that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.900
 rockets by it appeared it is very difficult 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.410
 will be well let's start the fight and I will give you 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.930
 I will tell everything further 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.830
 what about maneuverability yes and here 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.110
 more than enough 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.250
 we are just made for every kind 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.050
 turns of the barrels of the floor and the dead loop if 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.960
 we see that we have no tail to try 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.390
 fly away or go up candle just 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.120
 start spinning and spinning but if 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.340
 nearby dog dump we fly there 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.440
 it's just paradise for us with ours something 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.930
 maneuverability we are ahead by the whole 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.660
 steps into opponents and just prune them 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.720
 hit point if we talk about armament 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.310
 planes now our guns carry everything 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.040
 to pieces 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.930
 the only negative thing about them is of course 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.920
 overheating 20 millimeters overheat over 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.490
 6.2 seconds well, 762 for 13 two-tenths 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.300
 seconds 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.230
 so scribble right and left 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.230
 target is more accurate 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.440
 by the way let's talk about the position 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.360
 aircraft in the game if we are in the top then this 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.790
 for us paradise here we can tear and 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.280
 throw in all directions everything and everyone here 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.810
 stop you from intercepting assault first 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.050
 or fly with fighters 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.240
 but the main thing we remember here is the main thing from us 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.910
 it all depends we drag the fight 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.620
 you can not stand aside if you 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.650
 hit a link in the top then try 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.870
 first destroy the stormtroopers and then you 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.500
 carry on focus in one plane 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.930
 opponent if you are at the bottom of the list here already 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.270
 do not climb forward otherwise we get on the cap 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.730
 either go with the group or spin on 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.730
 base we are waiting for the goal but again it is not worth it 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.620
 climb under the board-arrow at the sixth level 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:59.980
 he's good talk also about shooting at 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.440
 different types of aircraft attack aircraft here 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.230
 no particular problems we sit on the tail and 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.140
 release here overheating but there are two 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.110
 aspects namely the overheating of our guns and 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.990
 enemy side gunner after release 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.130
 of all the bullets we have two ways either 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.419
 fly away make a turn back and finish 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.419
 either sit further on the tail and 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.070
 quietly finish off the enemy of course 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.710
 better to make turns just go to 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.500
 target one more time but then anybody 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.300
 Comrades can pick up our goal and if 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.180
 stay on the tail then the enemy port 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.600
 side shooter will lead us tight 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.669
 the fire 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.400
 plus someone from opponents can help 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:44.830
 attack aircraft all on serv us on the tail 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:47.260
 here decide yourself heavy fighters here 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.660
 already on the situation if you come across German 2 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.850
 3 new we parse his two accounts if 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.070
 Well here who are bigger similar 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.040
 situation with attack aircraft release all 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.260
 queue and there we are already thinking what to do 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.840
 finally fighters with fighters 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.060
 the second fourth level is no problem we 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.669
 their maneuver can not turn go into 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.670
 fasting and watering but with a fighter 5 of 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:12.250
 6 levels we have to hard 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.630
 looking at the situation we try not 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:19.180
 stay one on one so conclusions 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.030
 the pros are great weapons two 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.330
 twenty millimeter and 27 sixty 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.490
 two millimeter machine gun and this is very 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.190
 powerfully at this level 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.590
 excellent maneuverability we are maneuverable 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:35.110
 all fellows at this level 3 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:39.310
 small building 4 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.640
 this is the presence of missiles but he can already here 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.170
 argue who is a plus and whom 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.730
 neutrality cons 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:52.720
 little hp little armor 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:55.660
 just a plane too important and fast 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.040
 overheating guns well on this story 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.450
 about a wonderful fourth fighter 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.260
 level in the game world of warplanes 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.660
