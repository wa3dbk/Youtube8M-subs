for<00:04:59.860> many<00:04:59.890> years<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.400> haven't<00:05:00.640> gone<00:05:00.700> to<00:05:00.850> the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
for many years I haven't gone to the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.940 
for many years I haven't gone to the
trouble<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.420> coming<00:05:01.900> up<00:05:02.080> with<00:05:02.140> some<00:05:02.620> things<00:05:02.830> I

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
trouble of coming up with some things I

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.040 
trouble of coming up with some things I
could<00:05:03.130> say<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.340> would<00:05:03.610> always<00:05:03.910> work<00:05:04.150> because

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
could say that would always work because

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.190 
could say that would always work because
every<00:05:05.290> situation<00:05:05.860> tends<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.340> be<00:05:06.430> different

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
every situation tends to be different

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.020 
every situation tends to be different
you<00:05:08.200> know<00:05:08.320> like<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.650> lot<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.920> times<00:05:09.130> if<00:05:09.670> somebody

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
you know like a lot of times if somebody

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.850 
you know like a lot of times if somebody
yells<00:05:10.060> out<00:05:10.360> it's<00:05:10.630> kind<00:05:10.930> of<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.080> positive<00:05:11.620> thing

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
yells out it's kind of a positive thing

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.160 
yells out it's kind of a positive thing
like<00:05:12.070> they're<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.370> trying<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.670> contribute

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
like they're just trying to contribute

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.620 
like they're just trying to contribute
you<00:05:14.170> know<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.670> so<00:05:15.670> it's<00:05:15.820> kind<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.030> hard<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.300> put

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
you know and so it's kind of hard to put

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.120 
you know and so it's kind of hard to put
them<00:05:16.720> in<00:05:16.810> their<00:05:16.930> place<00:05:17.170> but<00:05:17.560> at<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.740> same<00:05:17.920> time

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
them in their place but at the same time

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.550 
them in their place but at the same time
you<00:05:18.310> want<00:05:18.460> them<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.700> stop<00:05:18.940> because<00:05:19.560> you

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
you want them to stop because you

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.590 
you want them to stop because you
haven't<00:05:20.860> planned<00:05:21.100> your<00:05:21.790> act<00:05:22.000> doesn't<00:05:22.270> revolve

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
haven't planned your act doesn't revolve

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.420 
haven't planned your act doesn't revolve
around<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:23.080> stranger<00:05:23.500> yelling<00:05:23.890> something<00:05:24.190> that

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
around a stranger yelling something that

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.150 
around a stranger yelling something that
you<00:05:24.520> couldn't<00:05:24.880> possibly<00:05:24.970> have<00:05:25.390> predicted<00:05:26.160> so

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
you couldn't possibly have predicted so

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.850 
you couldn't possibly have predicted so
you<00:05:27.880> just<00:05:27.910> have<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.390> in<00:05:28.780> my<00:05:29.020> case<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.800> just

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
you just have to in my case I just

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.380 
you just have to in my case I just
always<00:05:30.160> try<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.490> go<00:05:30.670> with<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.030> deal<00:05:31.360> with
