00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
blood once you get it in your smell tree

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.369 
blood once you get it in your smell tree
well<00:02:06.970> one<00:02:07.299> thing<00:02:07.510> you<00:02:07.540> can<00:02:07.810> do<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.229> can

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
well one thing you can do is you can

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.790 
well one thing you can do is you can
pipe<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:08.920> out<00:02:09.039> into<00:02:09.310> seared<00:02:10.239> glass<00:02:10.450> or<00:02:11.379> some

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
pipe it out into seared glass or some

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.640 
pipe it out into seared glass or some
tanks<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.480> save<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.720> later<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.560> know

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
tanks and save it for later you know

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.290 
tanks and save it for later you know
it's<00:02:14.830> always<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.069> good<00:02:15.190> option

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
it's always a good option

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.240 
it's always a good option
in<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.690> case<00:02:16.870> I'm<00:02:17.020> using<00:02:17.050> thermal<00:02:17.710> expansion

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
in this case I'm using thermal expansion

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.580 
in this case I'm using thermal expansion
they're<00:02:18.460> fluid<00:02:18.850> ducts<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> great<00:02:20.410> mod

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
they're fluid ducts it's a great mod

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.090 
they're fluid ducts it's a great mod
worth<00:02:21.310> checking<00:02:21.640> out<00:02:21.870> however<00:02:22.870> if<00:02:23.710> you<00:02:23.920> don't

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
worth checking out however if you don't

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.350 
worth checking out however if you don't
have<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.400> installed<00:02:24.700> or<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.030> maybe<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
have that installed or you maybe you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.600 
have that installed or you maybe you
want<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.630> use<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.990> right<00:02:26.230> now<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:27.130> take<00:02:27.370> your

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
want to use it right now you take your

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.300 
want to use it right now you take your
blank<00:02:28.000> casting<00:02:28.540> table<00:02:28.720> put<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> faucet<00:02:30.250> over

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
blank casting table put a faucet over

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.610 
blank casting table put a faucet over
top<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.940> drain<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:32.080> just<00:02:32.290> dump

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
top of it in a drain and then just dump

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.110 
top of it in a drain and then just dump
your<00:02:32.710> blood<00:02:33.070> right<00:02:33.280> onto<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.580> casting<00:02:33.940> table

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
your blood right onto the casting table

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.450 
your blood right onto the casting table
and<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.840> will<00:02:34.960> make<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.430> coagulated<00:02:36.430> blood

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
and that will make you coagulated blood

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.080 
and that will make you coagulated blood
that<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.030> can<00:02:37.180> eat<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.410> use<00:02:38.680> again<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
that you can eat or you can use again to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.130 
that you can eat or you can use again to
craft<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.720> variety<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.410> things

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
craft a variety of things

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.860 
craft a variety of things
so<00:02:44.140> that's<00:02:44.440> blood<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:46.030> other<00:02:46.210> thing<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.600> you

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
so that's blood the other thing that you

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.410 
so that's blood the other thing that you
can<00:02:47.110> do<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.910> instead<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:48.970> putting<00:02:49.390> cows<00:02:50.200> in<00:02:51.420> you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
can do is instead of putting cows in you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.050 
can do is instead of putting cows in you
could<00:02:52.570> put<00:02:52.750> villagers<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:54.550> you'll<00:02:54.760> notice

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
could put villagers in now you'll notice

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060 
could put villagers in now you'll notice
there's<00:02:55.300> no<00:02:55.540> liquid<00:02:55.990> in<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.320> bottom<00:02:56.650> here<00:02:56.920> so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
there's no liquid in the bottom here so

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.190 
there's no liquid in the bottom here so
they<00:02:57.400> won't<00:02:57.550> actually<00:02:57.760> take<00:02:58.060> damage<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.720> need

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
they won't actually take damage I need

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.880 
they won't actually take damage I need
to<00:02:59.290> add<00:02:59.790> some<00:03:00.790> blood<00:03:01.090> or<00:03:01.300> iron<00:03:01.840> or<00:03:02.080> what<00:03:02.740> have

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
to add some blood or iron or what have

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.280 
to add some blood or iron or what have
you<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.430> you'll<00:03:04.300> notice<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.840> villagers

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
you and you'll notice that the villagers

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.350 
you and you'll notice that the villagers
instead<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.100> releasing<00:03:06.370> blood<00:03:06.910> they<00:03:07.120> release

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
instead of releasing blood they release

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.200 
instead of releasing blood they release
this<00:03:07.540> green<00:03:07.870> stuff<00:03:08.200> it's<00:03:09.160> actually<00:03:09.520> liquid

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
this green stuff it's actually liquid

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.500 
this green stuff it's actually liquid
emerald<00:03:11.160> liquefied<00:03:12.160> emerald<00:03:12.730> it's<00:03:13.120> right<00:03:13.330> on

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
emerald liquefied emerald it's right on

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.130 
emerald liquefied emerald it's right on
top<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.140> really<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:15.060> there<00:03:16.060> we<00:03:16.180> go

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
top but really is there we go

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.310 
top but really is there we go
and<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:19.120> actually<00:03:19.270> have<00:03:19.510> enough<00:03:19.870> for<00:03:20.110> an<00:03:20.170> entire

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
and I actually have enough for an entire

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.940 
and I actually have enough for an entire
emerald<00:03:20.980> which<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.220> pretty<00:03:21.400> cool<00:03:22.800> go<00:03:23.800> ahead

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
emerald which is pretty cool go ahead

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.300 
emerald which is pretty cool go ahead
and<00:03:24.070> filter<00:03:24.430> out<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:25.620> leather<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.890> beef<00:03:27.100> from

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
and filter out the leather and beef from

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.030 
and filter out the leather and beef from
the<00:03:27.370> cows<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:28.990> if<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.350> wanted<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.650> take<00:03:29.860> this

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
the cows so if you wanted to take this

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.740 
the cows so if you wanted to take this
liquefied<00:03:30.610> emerald<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.150> turn<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.420> into<00:03:31.540> an

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
liquefied emerald and turn it into an

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.900 
liquefied emerald and turn it into an
actual<00:03:32.140> emerald<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:33.010> would<00:03:33.220> need<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.610> make<00:03:33.760> a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
actual emerald you would need to make a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.840 
actual emerald you would need to make a
gem<00:03:34.210> cast<00:03:34.510> or<00:03:35.130> conversely<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:36.550> pour<00:03:36.820> it

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
gem cast or conversely you can pour it

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.900 
gem cast or conversely you can pour it
into<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.240> casting<00:03:37.780> basin<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.380> then<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.880> a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
into a casting basin and then get a

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.640 
into a casting basin and then get a
block<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.480> emerald<00:03:40.870> although<00:03:41.020> you<00:03:41.140> need<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.320> lot

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
block of emerald although you need a lot

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.570 
block of emerald although you need a lot
of<00:03:41.680> emeralds<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.460> that<00:03:42.610> remember<00:03:44.460> all<00:03:45.460> right

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
of emeralds for that remember all right

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.760 
of emeralds for that remember all right
so<00:03:46.590> blood<00:03:47.610> emeralds<00:03:48.610> let's<00:03:48.970> talk<00:03:49.120> about<00:03:49.240> glue

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
so blood emeralds let's talk about glue

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.310 
so blood emeralds let's talk about glue
glue<00:03:50.770> is<00:03:51.010> made<00:03:51.070> from<00:03:51.520> putting<00:03:52.360> horses<00:03:53.050> into

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
glue is made from putting horses into

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.200 
glue is made from putting horses into
your<00:03:54.010> smell<00:03:54.280> tree<00:03:54.460> you<00:03:54.610> can<00:03:54.760> see<00:03:54.910> I've<00:03:55.000> got<00:03:55.150> a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
your smell tree you can see I've got a

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.480 
your smell tree you can see I've got a
lot<00:03:55.390> of<00:03:55.510> glue<00:03:55.750> already<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.290> here<00:03:56.590> now<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.280> get

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
lot of glue already in here now to get

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.580 
lot of glue already in here now to get
all<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:57.760> glue<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.240> simply<00:03:59.170> set<00:03:59.350> up<00:03:59.470> a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
all this glue I simply set up a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.950 
all this glue I simply set up a
chronotype<00:03:59.950> er<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.700> sorts<00:04:01.090> babies<00:04:01.510> out<00:04:01.720> and

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
chronotype er that sorts babies out and
