gigahertz intel core duo and you know so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.980 
gigahertz intel core duo and you know so
it's<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.890> newest<00:01:17.600> computer<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it's not the newest computer this is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.890 
it's not the newest computer this is
like<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> 4-year<00:01:19.560> old<00:01:19.680> system<00:01:20.600> sound<00:01:21.600> works

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
like a 4-year old system sound works

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and pointing SiC do so that's pretty

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.360 
and pointing SiC do so that's pretty
good<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.080> speakers<00:01:28.500> work<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.100> probably

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
hacking sauce I paid 300 bucks for this

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
hacking sauce I paid 300 bucks for this
computer<00:01:48.450> off<00:01:48.570> eBay<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.860> spent<00:01:50.130> about

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
120 or 130 upgrading so you can see some

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.030 
120 or 130 upgrading so you can see some

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.530 

I<00:02:31.900> think<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.020> reason<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.350> may<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.590> took

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
I think the reason it may have took

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.480 
I think the reason it may have took
longer<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.810> turn<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.530> because<00:02:36.890> we're<00:02:37.220> using

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
longer to turn on it because we're using

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.680 
longer to turn on it because we're using
