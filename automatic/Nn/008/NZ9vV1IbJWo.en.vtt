00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
they've given a roundabout time frame

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.910 
they've given a roundabout time frame
for<00:00:19.689> its<00:00:20.050> release<00:00:20.320> they<00:00:20.500> already<00:00:20.619> talked

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
for its release they already talked

for its release they already talked
about<00:00:21.039> quarter<00:00:21.490> to<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.660> in<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:23.050> most<00:00:23.380> recent

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
about quarter to but in the most recent

about quarter to but in the most recent
bungie<00:00:24.789> weekly<00:00:24.820> update<00:00:25.529> deej<00:00:26.529> also<00:00:27.160> kind<00:00:27.970> of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
bungie weekly update deej also kind of

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.349 
bungie weekly update deej also kind of
gave<00:00:28.330> this<00:00:28.570> really<00:00:29.339> convoluted<00:00:30.359> metaphor

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
gave this really convoluted metaphor

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.959 
gave this really convoluted metaphor
about<00:00:31.630> planes<00:00:32.559> landing<00:00:33.100> actually<00:00:33.550> I<00:00:33.579> say<00:00:33.850> it's

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
about planes landing actually I say it's

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.340 
about planes landing actually I say it's
convoluted<00:00:34.239> it<00:00:34.600> was<00:00:34.750> straight<00:00:34.989> forward<00:00:35.020> a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
convoluted it was straight forward a

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.459 
convoluted it was straight forward a
fantastic<00:00:35.890> metaphor<00:00:36.280> showed<00:00:36.850> us<00:00:36.969> to<00:00:37.090> do<00:00:37.239> so<00:00:38.140> I

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
fantastic metaphor showed us to do so I

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.440 
fantastic metaphor showed us to do so I
like<00:00:38.950> that<00:00:39.219> but<00:00:39.460> basically<00:00:39.579> you<00:00:40.000> said<00:00:40.210> there's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
like that but basically you said there's

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.240 
like that but basically you said there's
going<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.660> be<00:00:40.719> one<00:00:41.020> more<00:00:41.289> title<00:00:41.559> update<00:00:41.860> which

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
going to be one more title update which

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.639 
going to be one more title update which
means<00:00:42.520> right<00:00:42.789> now<00:00:42.969> destiny<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.780> 1<00:00:44.110> point<00:00:44.350> 1

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
means right now destiny is 1 point 1

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.670 
means right now destiny is 1 point 1
point<00:00:44.680> 1<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.809> they'll<00:00:46.960> be<00:00:47.050> moving<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.440> one

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
point 1 so they'll be moving to one

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.100 
point 1 so they'll be moving to one
point<00:00:47.860> one<00:00:48.129> point<00:00:48.160> two<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.149> then<00:00:49.570> after<00:00:50.079> that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
point one point two and then after that

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.709 
point one point two and then after that
house<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:51.160> wolves<00:00:51.309> is<00:00:51.550> set<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.910> land<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:52.359> what

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
house of wolves is set to land so what

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.610 
house of wolves is set to land so what
is<00:00:52.809> this<00:00:52.899> going<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.140> tell<00:00:53.289> us<00:00:53.379> a<00:00:53.440> little<00:00:53.500> about

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
is this going to tell us a little about

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.860 
is this going to tell us a little about
house<00:00:53.859> of<00:00:54.010> wolves<00:00:54.129> well<00:00:54.430> they<00:00:55.239> prepped<00:00:55.600> one

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
house of wolves well they prepped one

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.410 
house of wolves well they prepped one
point<00:00:56.140> one<00:00:56.379> point<00:00:56.739> one<00:00:57.609> for<00:00:57.879> about<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.120> month

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
point one point one for about a month

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.139 
point one point one for about a month
and<00:00:58.719> if<00:00:59.199> one<00:00:59.379> point<00:00:59.620> one<00:00:59.890> point<00:00:59.920> two<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:00.670> just

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
and if one point one point two is just

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.090 
and if one point one point two is just
as<00:01:01.390> complex<00:01:01.989> we<00:01:02.260> could<00:01:02.410> expect<00:01:02.649> maybe<00:01:02.829> another

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
as complex we could expect maybe another

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.100 
as complex we could expect maybe another
month<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:03.550> then<00:01:04.180> depending<00:01:04.570> on<00:01:04.690> how<00:01:04.810> far

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
month and then depending on how far

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.720 
month and then depending on how far
along<00:01:05.230> house<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.740> Wilson's<00:01:06.070> development<00:01:06.610> you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
along house of Wilson's development you

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.250 
along house of Wilson's development you
could<00:01:06.880> probably<00:01:07.150> expect<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.720> month<00:01:07.960> or<00:01:08.110> less

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
could probably expect a month or less

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.830 
could probably expect a month or less
which<00:01:08.530> would<00:01:08.800> put<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.280> dropping<00:01:09.910> hang<00:01:10.180> on<00:01:10.450> I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
which would put it dropping hang on I

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.480 
which would put it dropping hang on I
should<00:01:11.500> have<00:01:11.620> figured<00:01:11.740> this<00:01:11.920> out<00:01:12.130> before<00:01:12.250> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
should have figured this out before the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.320 
should have figured this out before the
video<00:01:12.730> but<00:01:12.910> I'm<00:01:13.000> bringing<00:01:13.330> up<00:01:13.450> my<00:01:13.570> calendar

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
video but I'm bringing up my calendar

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.560 
video but I'm bringing up my calendar
middle<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.420> may<00:01:16.690> perhaps<00:01:17.170> early<00:01:17.950> May<00:01:18.570> who

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
middle of may perhaps early May who

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.260 
middle of may perhaps early May who
knows<00:01:19.870> or<00:01:20.680> if<00:01:21.190> it's<00:01:21.310> done<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.790> could<00:01:21.940> be<00:01:22.090> one

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
knows or if it's done it could be one

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.270 
knows or if it's done it could be one
point<00:01:22.510> one<00:01:22.660> point<00:01:22.690> two<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.380> then<00:01:23.560> BAM<00:01:23.890> house

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
point one point two and then BAM house

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.490 
point one point two and then BAM house
of<00:01:24.490> wolves<00:01:24.640> I'd<00:01:25.300> like<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.780> see<00:01:25.930> how<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.080> wolves

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
of wolves I'd like to see how the wolves

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.070 
of wolves I'd like to see how the wolves
in<00:01:26.590> April<00:01:26.950> that's<00:01:27.790> what<00:01:27.970> I'm<00:01:28.090> saying<00:01:28.450> but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
in April that's what I'm saying but

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.280 
in April that's what I'm saying but
basically<00:01:30.420> according<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.510> each<00:01:31.660> is<00:01:31.840> metaphor

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
basically according to each is metaphor

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.470 
basically according to each is metaphor
there's<00:01:32.560> not<00:01:32.800> a<00:01:32.830> lot<00:01:33.190> left<00:01:33.460> for<00:01:33.610> them<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.030> do<00:01:34.240> on

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
there's not a lot left for them to do on

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.530 
there's not a lot left for them to do on
the<00:01:34.570> engineering<00:01:35.020> side<00:01:35.580> before<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:37.090> house<00:01:37.330> of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
the engineering side before the house of

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.750 
the engineering side before the house of
wolves<00:01:37.630> releases<00:01:38.200> now<00:01:38.320> another<00:01:39.220> thing<00:01:39.310> we<00:01:39.610> can

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
wolves releases now another thing we can

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.850 
wolves releases now another thing we can
expect<00:01:40.090> from<00:01:40.180> one<00:01:40.600> point<00:01:40.780> one<00:01:41.020> point<00:01:41.050> two<00:01:41.500> or

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
expect from one point one point two or

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.860

the<00:01:42.010> next<00:01:42.160> title<00:01:42.430> update<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.970> probably<00:01:43.540> it's

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
the next title update is probably it's

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.140 
the next title update is probably it's
going<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.350> include<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:45.010> lot<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.520> data<00:01:45.760> that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
going to include a lot of the data that

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.930 
going to include a lot of the data that
will<00:01:46.900> be<00:01:47.140> in<00:01:47.350> house<00:01:47.980> of<00:01:48.220> wolves<00:01:48.430> just<00:01:48.820> like

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
will be in house of wolves just like

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.880 
will be in house of wolves just like
when<00:01:49.120> they<00:01:49.210> updated<00:01:49.510> for<00:01:49.780> crotas<00:01:50.080> end<00:01:50.290> there's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
when they updated for crotas end there's

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.970 
when they updated for crotas end there's
a<00:01:50.950> huge<00:01:51.520> title<00:01:52.180> update<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.630> was<00:01:52.720> fun<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.110> 2.4

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
while I don't like spoiling things like

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.600 
while I don't like spoiling things like
that<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.510> also<00:02:26.930> cannot<00:02:27.680> freaking<00:02:28.220> help<00:02:28.430> myself

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
that I also cannot freaking help myself

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.630 
that I also cannot freaking help myself
because<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.450> just<00:02:29.480> want<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> know<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:30.920> want

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
because I just want to know I just want

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.610 
because I just want to know I just want
to<00:02:32.480> know<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.450> go<00:02:35.480> guys<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:36.200> think<00:02:36.530> we

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
to know so there you go guys I think we

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.350 
to know so there you go guys I think we
can<00:02:36.770> be<00:02:36.890> probably<00:02:37.459> expecting<00:02:38.060> house<00:02:38.180> of

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
can be probably expecting house of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.990 
can be probably expecting house of
wolves<00:02:38.480> at<00:02:38.780> maximum<00:02:39.709> inside<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.370> two<00:02:40.520> months<00:02:40.790> I

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
wolves at maximum inside of two months I

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.610 
wolves at maximum inside of two months I
think<00:02:41.270> any<00:02:41.420> longer<00:02:41.750> than<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:41.930> doesn't<00:02:42.260> seem

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
think any longer than that doesn't seem

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.470 
think any longer than that doesn't seem
to<00:02:42.800> make<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.040> lot<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.310> business<00:02:43.730> sense<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.090> it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
to make a lot of business sense and it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.580 
to make a lot of business sense and it
doesn't<00:02:44.510> really<00:02:44.870> make<00:02:45.080> sense<00:02:45.140> with<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
doesn't really make sense with the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.380 
doesn't really make sense with the
development<00:02:46.190> cycle<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.700> update<00:02:47.120> cycle

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
development cycle on the update cycle

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.630 
development cycle on the update cycle
that<00:02:47.690> bungees<00:02:48.110> kind<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.470> held<00:02:49.040> pretty<00:02:49.340> close

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
that bungees kind of held pretty close

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.770 
that bungees kind of held pretty close
