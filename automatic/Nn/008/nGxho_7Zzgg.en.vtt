it's exciting times these days because

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
it's exciting times these days because

used to treat epilepsy it's exciting

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.799 
used to treat epilepsy it's exciting
because<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.519> are<00:00:59.579> about<00:00:59.760> 15<00:01:00.360> different

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
because there are about 15 different

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that not only will they have fewer

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
side-effects and fewer toxic effects but

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
side-effects and fewer toxic effects but
also<00:01:17.729> we'll<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.240> more<00:01:19.110> efficient<00:01:20.100> or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
also we'll be more efficient or

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.570 
also we'll be more efficient or
effective<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:21.800> preventing<00:01:22.800> seizures<00:01:23.340> or

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.240 

probably<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.600> next<00:01:31.930> few<00:01:32.170> years<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:33.100> will

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
probably in the next few years it will

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.860 
probably in the next few years it will
be<00:01:33.310> medications<00:01:34.270> that<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.570> fewer

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
be medications that have fewer

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.550 
be medications that have fewer
side-effects<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.710> less<00:01:36.280> toxicity<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.560> until

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
side-effects and less toxicity and until

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.280 
side-effects and less toxicity and until
they're<00:01:38.920> out<00:01:39.100> in<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.240> field<00:01:40.540> we<00:01:40.810> won't<00:01:41.140> know

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
they're out in the field we won't know

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.080 
they're out in the field we won't know
exactly<00:01:41.770> whether<00:01:42.040> they'll<00:01:42.580> have<00:01:42.610> better

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
exactly whether they'll have better

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.890 
exactly whether they'll have better
efficacy<00:01:43.780> but<00:01:44.680> obviously<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:46.330> hope<00:01:46.660> is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
efficacy but obviously the the hope is

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.190 
efficacy but obviously the the hope is
that<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.820> will<00:01:48.970> be<00:01:49.000> improvements<00:01:49.900> in<00:01:50.020> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
that there will be improvements in the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.219 
that there will be improvements in the
efficacy<00:01:50.470> because<00:01:51.460> at<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.240> moment<00:01:52.630> most<00:01:53.020> of

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
efficacy because at the moment most of

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.690 
efficacy because at the moment most of
the<00:01:53.290> medications<00:01:53.950> have<00:01:54.220> about<00:01:54.490> equal

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
the medications have about equal

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.950 
the medications have about equal
efficacy

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.560 

these<00:02:00.770> medications<00:02:01.310> are<00:02:01.729> targeting

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
these medications are targeting

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.469 
these medications are targeting
different<00:02:03.110> mechanisms<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.940> have<00:02:05.150> never

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
been targeted in the past so for example

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.320 
been targeted in the past so for example
some<00:02:08.240> medications<00:02:08.929> are<00:02:09.110> looking<00:02:09.470> at

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
some medications are looking at

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.820 
some medications are looking at

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.290 

yes<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:43.080> are<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.650> least<00:02:43.860> three<00:02:44.190> different

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
yes there are at least three different

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.600 
yes there are at least three different
approaches<00:02:45.300> using<00:02:46.130> devices<00:02:47.130> instead<00:02:47.460> of

approaches using devices instead of

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.140 
approaches using devices instead of
using<00:02:47.790> medications<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:49.560> basically<00:02:50.280> use<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
using medications that basically use the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.350 
using medications that basically use the
electrical<00:02:51.810> activity<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> brain<00:02:53.360> at

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
trying to control the epilepsy one of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.050 
trying to control the epilepsy one of
those<00:02:57.240> devices<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:59.070> similar<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.910> has

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
those devices is similar to what has

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.240 
those devices is similar to what has
been<00:03:00.180> used<00:03:00.360> for<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.230> treatment<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.650> Parkinson

anticipating when the seizure is going

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.040 
anticipating when the seizure is going
to<00:03:22.140> occur<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.610> can<00:03:23.820> deliver<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.330 
treatment before the actual seizure
occurs<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.990> try<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.290> prevent<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.070> development

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
occurs to try to prevent the development

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.420 
occurs to try to prevent the development
of<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.170> abnormal<00:03:31.170> electrical<00:03:31.290> activity<00:03:31.830> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
of the abnormal electrical activity and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.650 
of the abnormal electrical activity and
then<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.450> third<00:03:33.720> device<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.330> looking

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
then the third device that is looking

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.440 
then the third device that is looking
very<00:03:36.780> promising<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:38.610> device<00:03:39.180> where

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
very promising is a device where

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.450 
very promising is a device where
electrodes<00:03:39.990> are<00:03:40.170> placed<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:41.040> part<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.400> the

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
electrodes are placed in the part of the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.040 
electrodes are placed in the part of the
brain<00:03:41.640> where<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> seizures<00:03:42.000> come<00:03:42.600> from<00:03:42.840> and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
brain where the seizures come from and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.430 
brain where the seizures come from and
as<00:03:43.710> soon<00:03:43.950> as<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.670> device<00:03:45.030> recognizes<00:03:45.690> that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
as soon as the device recognizes that

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.590 
as soon as the device recognizes that
there's<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.709> change<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.600> electrical

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
there's a change in the electrical

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.570 
there's a change in the electrical
activity<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:49.230> signifies<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.340> there's

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
activity that signifies that there's

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.670 
activity that signifies that there's
going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.850> be<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:51.030> seizure<00:03:51.270> then<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:52.230> delivers

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
going to be a seizure then it delivers

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.040 
going to be a seizure then it delivers
the<00:03:53.010> therapy<00:03:53.520> in<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.120> way<00:03:54.240> of<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.570> electrical

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
the therapy in the way of the electrical

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.570 
the therapy in the way of the electrical
stimulation<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:57.620> when<00:03:58.620> given<00:03:58.920> at<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.370> right

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
stimulation and when given at the right

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.870 
stimulation and when given at the right
time<00:03:59.850> with<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.270> right<00:04:00.360> amount<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:02.160> stops<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
time with the right amount it stops the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.449 
time with the right amount it stops the
seizures<00:04:03.270> without<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.380> person<00:04:04.800> having<00:04:05.040> side

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
seizures without the person having side

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.530 
seizures without the person having side
effects

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.390 

so<00:04:11.540> these<00:04:11.660> patients<00:04:11.870> do<00:04:12.320> wear<00:04:12.620> these<00:04:12.860> devices

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
so these patients do wear these devices

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.880 
so these patients do wear these devices
and<00:04:13.760> they're<00:04:14.090> implanted<00:04:14.420> under<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.260> skin<00:04:15.380> so

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
and they're implanted under the skin so

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.610 
and they're implanted under the skin so
they're<00:04:16.640> not<00:04:16.790> visible<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.510> any<00:04:17.930> other<00:04:18.140> person

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
they're not visible to any other person

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.670 
they're not visible to any other person
and<00:04:19.660> they<00:04:20.660> don't<00:04:20.870> have<00:04:21.020> to<00:04:21.170> worry<00:04:21.410> about

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
and they don't have to worry about

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.800 
and they don't have to worry about
having<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.100> activate<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.850> device<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.780> device

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
having to activate the device the device

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.680 
having to activate the device the device
run<00:04:24.440> on<00:04:24.980> batteries<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.770> device<00:04:28.040> will

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
run on batteries and the device will

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.810 
run on batteries and the device will
keep<00:04:29.690> track<00:04:29.960> of<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.200> brainwave<00:04:31.040> activity<00:04:31.160> and

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
keep track of the brainwave activity and

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.650 
keep track of the brainwave activity and
deliver<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.600> therapy<00:04:33.790> based<00:04:34.790> on<00:04:35.000> what<00:04:35.540> the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
deliver the therapy based on what the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.029 
deliver the therapy based on what the
doctor<00:04:35.810> wants<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.470> do

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.309 

so<00:04:42.849> there<00:04:43.089> is<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.479> new<00:04:43.719> type<00:04:44.529> of<00:04:44.559> surgery<00:04:45.009> that

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
so there is a new type of surgery that

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.649 
so there is a new type of surgery that
doesn't<00:04:47.319> involve<00:04:47.669> opening<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:49.089> skin<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.569> the

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:49.659 
doesn't involve opening the skin and the

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.429 
doesn't involve opening the skin and the
bone<00:04:49.930> it's<00:04:50.830> basically<00:04:51.749> radiation<00:04:52.749> we're

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:53.439 
bone it's basically radiation we're

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.260 
bone it's basically radiation we're
seeing<00:04:53.680> very<00:04:53.979> intense<00:04:54.399> and<00:04:54.639> focused

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
seeing very intense and focused

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.779 
seeing very intense and focused
radiation<00:04:55.419> with<00:04:56.349> different<00:04:57.039> devices<00:04:57.369> called

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
radiation with different devices called

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:58.859 
radiation with different devices called
Gamma<00:04:58.089> Knife

00:04:58.859 --> 00:04:58.869 
Gamma Knife

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:02.639 
Gamma Knife
for<00:04:59.860> example<00:05:00.309> where<00:05:01.199> once<00:05:02.199> it's<00:05:02.439> been

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:02.649 
for example where once it's been

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:04.379 
for example where once it's been
identified<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:03.490> area<00:05:03.789> of<00:05:03.909> the<00:05:04.029> brain<00:05:04.180> where

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
identified the area of the brain where

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.049 
identified the area of the brain where
the<00:05:04.509> seizures<00:05:04.539> come<00:05:05.050> from<00:05:05.289> then<00:05:06.059> radiating

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:07.059 
the seizures come from then radiating

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:10.980 
the seizures come from then radiating
that<00:05:07.960> area<00:05:08.830> with<00:05:09.330> this<00:05:10.330> type<00:05:10.599> of<00:05:10.629> radiation

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
that area with this type of radiation

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.820 
that area with this type of radiation
that<00:05:11.379> basically<00:05:11.770> burns<00:05:12.430> off<00:05:12.699> the<00:05:13.029> cells<00:05:13.830> that

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
that basically burns off the cells that

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.360 
that basically burns off the cells that
are<00:05:14.979> abnormal<00:05:15.099> but<00:05:15.759> leaves<00:05:16.029> the<00:05:17.099> normal<00:05:18.099> cells

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
are abnormal but leaves the normal cells

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.779 
are abnormal but leaves the normal cells
intact<00:05:18.819> is<00:05:19.620> proving<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.770> be<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:21.399> good

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
intact is proving to be a good

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.049 
intact is proving to be a good
alternative<00:05:21.909> for<00:05:22.870> certain<00:05:23.319> types<00:05:23.589> of<00:05:24.059> surgery

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:25.059 
alternative for certain types of surgery

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:29.179 
alternative for certain types of surgery
where<00:05:26.219> the<00:05:27.219> actual<00:05:27.550> area<00:05:27.699> is<00:05:27.879> removed

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
where the actual area is removed

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.369 
where the actual area is removed
obviously<00:05:30.189> with<00:05:30.399> a<00:05:30.430> bigger<00:05:31.059> operation<00:05:31.749> so

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
obviously with a bigger operation so

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.439 
obviously with a bigger operation so
this<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.889> sort<00:05:33.099> of<00:05:33.189> a<00:05:33.339> non-invasive<00:05:33.909> way<00:05:33.939> of

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
this is sort of a non-invasive way of

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:41.930 
this is sort of a non-invasive way of
treating<00:05:34.959> epilepsy

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.339 

so<00:05:42.940> if<00:05:43.120> you<00:05:43.240> are<00:05:43.330> a<00:05:43.389> patient<00:05:43.629> and<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.169> would

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
so if you are a patient and you would

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.689 
so if you are a patient and you would
like<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.770> learn<00:05:44.889> more<00:05:45.160> about<00:05:45.220> these

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
like to learn more about these

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.480 
like to learn more about these
treatments<00:05:46.690> and<00:05:47.080> whether<00:05:47.379> you<00:05:47.560> would<00:05:48.220> qualify

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
treatments and whether you would qualify

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.540 
treatments and whether you would qualify
