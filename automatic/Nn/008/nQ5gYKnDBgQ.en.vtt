call the snake and we're going to be
putting<00:00:55.750> our<00:00:55.989> litter<00:00:56.350> our<00:00:56.890> coal<00:00:57.160> on<00:00:57.399> one<00:00:58.059> end

putting our litter our coal on one end

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.049 
putting our litter our coal on one end
so<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:58.899> it<00:00:59.199> burns<00:00:59.530> all<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.519> way<00:01:00.609> around<00:01:00.910> the

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
so that it burns all the way around the

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.569 
so that it burns all the way around the
circle<00:01:01.329> if<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.379> maintain<00:01:02.829> our<00:01:02.859> temperatures

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
circle if we maintain our temperatures

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.770 
circle if we maintain our temperatures
between<00:01:03.879> 235<00:01:04.840> to<00:01:05.590> 60<00:01:06.310> anywhere<00:01:07.240> in<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.390> range

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
between 235 to 60 anywhere in that range

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.590 
between 235 to 60 anywhere in that range
like<00:01:08.170> they<00:01:08.320> say<00:01:08.530> we<00:01:08.800> will<00:01:09.190> easily<00:01:09.550> get<00:01:10.000> six<00:01:10.360> six

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
like they say we will easily get six six

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.140 
like they say we will easily get six six
and<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.780> half<00:01:10.840> hours<00:01:11.350> out<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.980> this<00:01:12.310> burn<00:01:12.670> which

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
and a half hours out of this burn which

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.960 
and a half hours out of this burn which
is<00:01:13.300> plenty<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.690> time<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.290> cook<00:01:15.070> our<00:01:15.280> spareribs

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
is plenty of time to cook our spareribs

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.240 
is plenty of time to cook our spareribs
and<00:01:16.240> even<00:01:16.870> better<00:01:17.110> for<00:01:17.410> cooking<00:01:17.590> baby<00:01:17.890> backs

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
and even better for cooking baby backs

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.760 
and even better for cooking baby backs
which<00:01:18.940> take<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.210> little<00:01:19.480> bit<00:01:19.660> less<00:01:19.930> time<00:01:20.230> we've

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
which take a little bit less time we've

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.860 
which take a little bit less time we've
got<00:01:20.950> plenty<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.340> cook<00:01:21.580> time<00:01:21.820> very<00:01:22.360> efficient

got plenty of cook time very efficient
use<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.350> charcoal<00:01:23.830> now<00:01:24.580> I'm<00:01:24.670> going<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.880> be

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
use of the charcoal now I'm going to be

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.200 
use of the charcoal now I'm going to be
lighting<00:01:25.420> about<00:01:25.660> 15<00:01:26.230> to<00:01:26.410> 20<00:01:26.770> briquettes<00:01:27.250> using

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
lighting about 15 to 20 briquettes using

lighting about 15 to 20 briquettes using
the<00:01:28.570> Weber<00:01:28.990> paraffin<00:01:29.620> cubes<00:01:30.010> I<00:01:30.190> find<00:01:30.490> these

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
the Weber paraffin cubes I find these

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.060 
the Weber paraffin cubes I find these
the<00:01:31.300> simplest<00:01:31.870> easiest<00:01:32.050> way<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.560> get<00:01:32.890> my

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
the simplest easiest way to get my

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.350 
the simplest easiest way to get my
chimney<00:01:33.760> started<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.400> once<00:01:36.400> we<00:01:36.580> have<00:01:36.970> that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
chimney started and once we have that

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.600 
chimney started and once we have that
charcoal<00:01:37.930> good<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.290> hot<00:01:38.500> we're<00:01:39.400> going<00:01:39.430> to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
charcoal good and hot we're going to

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.310 
charcoal good and hot we're going to
dump<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.180> just<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:41.050> one<00:01:41.080> end<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.400> snake<00:01:42.700> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
dump it just on one end of the snake and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.750 
dump it just on one end of the snake and
obviously<00:01:44.320> I've<00:01:44.470> got<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:44.830> closest<00:01:45.370> to<00:01:45.550> my

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
obviously I've got it closest to my

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.280 
obviously I've got it closest to my
chunk<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.480> wood<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:46.660> we're<00:01:46.900> going<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.050> use

chunk of wood that we're going to use

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.800 
chunk of wood that we're going to use
for<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.590> smoke<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:48.160> this<00:01:48.790> cook<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.540> want<00:01:49.750> to

for a smoke on this cook and you want to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.140 
for a smoke on this cook and you want to
be<00:01:49.930> careful<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:51.340> you've<00:01:51.460> got<00:01:51.580> any<00:01:51.760> stray

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
briquettes that are hot make sure

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.640 
briquettes that are hot make sure
they're<00:01:54.310> not<00:01:54.490> on<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.030> end<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.080> snake<00:01:56.380> that

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.680 
they're not on the end of the snake that
you<00:01:56.710> don't<00:01:57.040> want<00:01:57.310> lit<00:01:57.580> now<00:01:58.030> once<00:01:58.240> your<00:01:58.390> smoker

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
you don't want lit now once your smoker

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.460 
three lower dampers about half way open
and<00:02:27.849> if<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.269> temperature<00:02:28.690> tends<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.170> rise<00:02:29.440> a

then I can start closing those down a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160 
then I can start closing those down a
little<00:02:36.459> bit<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.880> trying<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.510> stabilize<00:02:37.959> that

little bit and trying to stabilize that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.080 
little bit and trying to stabilize that
temp<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.709> had<00:02:38.800> no<00:02:38.950> problems<00:02:39.459> during<00:02:39.730> this
