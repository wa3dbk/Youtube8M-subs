back-and-forth slightly overlapping each

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.710 
back-and-forth slightly overlapping each
stroke<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:56.560> usually<00:02:56.769> do<00:02:57.099> my<00:02:57.310> own<00:02:57.720> I've

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
stroke so I just usually do my own I've

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.160 
stroke so I just usually do my own I've
painted<00:02:59.349> for<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.709> long<00:02:59.920> time<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.959> kind<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.019> got

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
painted for a long time so I kind of got

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
painted for a long time so I kind of got
my<00:03:02.319> own<00:03:02.440> little<00:03:02.620> technique

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.330 

I'm<00:03:25.670> laying<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.180> on<00:03:26.330> thick<00:03:26.390> because<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.440> want<00:03:28.310> to

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
I'm laying it on thick because I want to

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.280 
I'm laying it on thick because I want to
make<00:03:28.490> it<00:03:28.640> durable<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.690> it'll<00:03:29.990> be<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.110> lot

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
make it durable and it'll be a lot

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.140 
make it durable and it'll be a lot
easier<00:03:30.500> for<00:03:30.920> me<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.040> peel<00:03:31.310> off<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:31.820> I'm<00:03:31.970> doing

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
easier for me to peel off if I'm doing

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.120 
easier for me to peel off if I'm doing
it<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.420> little<00:03:32.510> bit<00:03:32.720> thicker<00:03:32.930> but<00:03:33.680> I'm<00:03:33.800> doing<00:03:33.980> it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
it a little bit thicker but I'm doing it

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.120 
it a little bit thicker but I'm doing it
thick<00:03:34.340> enough<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.640> where<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:38.720> won't<00:03:38.900> run<00:03:39.320> or<00:03:39.980> it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
thick enough to where it won't run or it

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.010 
thick enough to where it won't run or it
won't<00:03:40.310> look<00:03:40.960> really<00:03:41.960> bad<00:03:43.600> let<00:03:44.600> me<00:03:44.690> other<00:03:44.870> than
