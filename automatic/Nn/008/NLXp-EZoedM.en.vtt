00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.139
 4 guys today go up 2 or sunny tips is 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.429
 under fire types I have to recognize 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.380
 that fire types are not the most 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.639
 abound in the past since a hand 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.529
 it's dragon type earth type and that's why I 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 has called curiosity doing it before 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.670
 that others I chose 26 pokemon of the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
 fire type there are many more options like 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.990
 I always say I always give you a team 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.240
 base a starter team in which what 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 prove that they could prove it and 19 also 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.260
 works better team that we have better 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 that this what I will say no 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 it has to be the best two of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.750
 those six would work well I think that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 would work, I imposed a stat for their 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.149
 attacks and their functions for boys 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.770
 let's go with the first let's go with night els 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.750
 night that little bit older fire for me 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 the starter of this of this team 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.309
 logically because it has got the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.840
 drought skill that today is drought what 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 what it does is that it beats what kind 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.030
 of fire at 50% to cycles attack type 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 water drop to 50% lightning strike 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 solar and we do it in a turn in set 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 it is also enhanced and so on by 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.199
 many reasons this pokemon I think it is 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.519
 the starter and why he chose nine such and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.900
 not perform and why it is said day is 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.880
 more than takes or bonuses 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.070
 night else preselection at intervals 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.690
 guys it's very easy I would go out and put 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 drought protect the whole team thank you 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.710
 to his ability that we have to prostrate 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.930
 or with machination and then paste the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.120
 other solar networks and put a shine or 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.400
 we'll take it and put it on fire 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.660
 and how do we arrive or 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.520
 solar radio the confusion logo 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.490
 machination as you like may 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.660
 work in many ways 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.060
 guys, we're going with the psycho, he said 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.500
 the hits would be to the channel because first 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.790
 everything has a great attack 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.740
 physical has a lot of physical attack 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.119
 times skill intimidation protects a 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.110
 little bit to those physics at a stroke that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.900
 they can kill better at one stroke 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.850
 we would go down in the attack by 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.470
 1 firm nature to enhance the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.240
 maximum your attack object life sphere 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.850
 logically to make the attacks 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.010
 devastating physicists not to be spread over 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 pure and hard speed attack and the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.790
 attacks strong and devastating cuts 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.950
 as I said before envite and not 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.170
 extreme speed point-blank with my ray 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
 turned cruel depends if you like it already is 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.430
 very expensive so to speak with cruel vote 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.020
 and envien cnio or preferís like the ray 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.369
 save a little bit of lives before or 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 flyers and kill them equally not 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.360
 guys or by type water as you want 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.530
 come on now guys with the following 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 pokemon of this one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.910
 and I have chosen to be Turkish as 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.340
 let's say how to have a physics what 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.560
 which is nothing or bruce in is nothing 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.880
 It is not used but it is very good 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.410
 pokemon guys in explained this 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.300
 defense has a very great defense 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.130
 physical and it can be our physical equal 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.870
 it can be because mont that protects from 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.030
 these wii physics but those these 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.040
 wikis etc. is worth art guys 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.780
 natural ability carapace prevents the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.550
 critical hits so we're 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.920
 we take this tank and on top of it not 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.850
 they will learn from a critical hit never 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.400
 nature used to enhance even more 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.560
 his defense what s p's in life and in defense 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.760
 maximum potential what is a tank and 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.860
 it is especially if you stick attack 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 some hit no object rest for when 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.640
 we each turn and I have chosen is with 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.890
 via to see what you think we would come out 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.470
 we would burn the opponent then we have that 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.090
 protection so that the game increased a 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.920
 turn and the rest is done its effect another 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.810
 time and then we can turn fire and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.769
 catch that rival that each turn knew 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.330
 how much video will we do again 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.580
 protection that combined with willful fire 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.900
 and more water remains we have all the time and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.030
 To finish off we are going to make an art that 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.290
 as I suffocate an attack that receives is the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.519
 most powerful attack type fire not of 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.100
 the same special attack that goes down since 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.440
 we are winning with fire and fire turn 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.280
 fatuous or well valued for those types 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.410
 fairies 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.000
 and by plants apart and so on 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.100
 we cover both things with both bombs 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.660
 Mud what you like best boy and víctor 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.690
 I think I think it 's unite and gmb 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.700
 is the one that makes me more curious 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.780
 not all of all of these pokemon let's go 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.660
 to see guys with the room because 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.500
 models are items that are overturned 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.780
 logically volcano so it's a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.100
 little younger use has not seen it 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.080
 has seen more is a little more famous 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.690
 but we can not leave this pokemon out 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.250
 of a time it would be unfair because it is 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.590
 a pokémon that is fire bug already of by 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.510
 if the type fires is covered although it has been 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.310
 logically said the rock does it a lot 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.959
 damage but we do not care about the skill 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.940
 body calls when they hit a pokémon 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.560
 this pokemon is burned from just attack 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.760
 physical are reduced to half of 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.519
 all my goddess to maximize 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.410
 his speed the sixth 157 that special 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.420
 200 businesses at speed 6 in life and the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.980
 object band focus volcano has come out I think 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.390
 that has fake actions or is 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.890
 shows the special attack by one the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.989
 defense plate for one and speed 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.840
 for one with this they overturned it is very very 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.090
 dangerous of guys if the rival so 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.919
 that was surfing scene in 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.979
 rsc by giving anything a red one 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.330
 even an avalanche would not kill us not 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.430
 It would kill us because we have the band 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.030
 focus and then it's already trying to kill him from 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.830
 only one push 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.080
 with dance flame gale or buzz but 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.389
 at least we make sure that they overturned 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.570
 two shifts will last and strong blows 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.880
 is going to hit I know that yes guys this 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.240
 how I went as special uepe is for me 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.800
 the one of the uni team together with night els already 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.320
 we have the two special we lost 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.180
 from our team more guys we go with 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 the fifth pokemon that I feel because 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.080
 we have chosen it to be from the fox because of the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.880
 fox very well this pokemon we are going to 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.340
 do also like whippet fish but I 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.139
 I made it a weird set, so to speak 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.090
 a set that could surprise the opponent not 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:05.040
 you would expect us to do this not with 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.010
 of the fox but it is curious to imagine 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.320
 foc come out and the first thing he does is poke 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.630
 a light screen would improve all defense 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.040
 special to all the team and over 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.610
 then haunted flame still drops the 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.620
 Special attack by one to the rival always 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.690
 I know what and then it is to put in the shadow 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.160
 to cover types and premonition for 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.169
 the typical fight-type pokemon what 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.030
 whether it comes out I know that I have each each 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.729
 two shifts to the two shifts makes effects 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.919
 all of a sudden but yes and we are thankful 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.220
 to light screen etcetera we burst 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.470
 do not 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.680
 and to finish guys this unite and gmb 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.940
 I have chosen that hell is more or 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.210
 Verdú be that none of those who have 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.010
 said before together with the channel in would be 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.570
 our physics the wipers and 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.580
 logically with him and yellow more 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.800
 firm nature is in attack in 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.630
 speed and object hundred expert this 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.120
 we could go out and grope and the rival with 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.220
 and back we can burst a 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.140
 just hit with Indian and ultra fist 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.180
 also to top off an agents image 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.040
 a little hand is left a bit or half 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.050
 hit with a rag pam we will beat and 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.670
 we would receive priority and we can finish 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.680
 the rival and sharp rock to cover us 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.970
 flying that only from the movies 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.930
 danger that has internet but has 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.580
 much speed therefore rock 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.500
 sharp we could knock down the bird pass 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.110
 quickly guys of all options 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.140
 that we can put on the internet would be a 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.640
 late love and so fast the two 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.490
 they work very well too but guys 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.800
 I always give a base a starter for 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.630
 that you can try them and start not with 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.010
 those meetings burned a lot since 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.030
 I am confess that to me the guys 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.490
 fire 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.780
 I start to like a little more not 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.270
 I know why I'm going to like it a little 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.640
 more and I think that thanks to malva has 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.190
 made me start to look at the 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.650
 like fire type 11 and am I get turned on 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.700
 the flame never better said and I saw one 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.400
 that I liked and how could 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.930
 get along with my entourage and I have 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.520
 included is testing what is
