00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.179

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.849
 I was asked in the comments to the review 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 the question work and the games on it and how much 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.480

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.510
 multitouch read on 2 touch that a little 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.510
 I therefore I took his screen to the minuses 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 so I promised in the comments 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.200
 sanandres on the unforeseen 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.399
 circumstances gta sanandres not climbed 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.960
 me on a flash drive so i will make two videos 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.600
 respectively two games but I will not 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.600
 talk a lot run 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.670
 as you can see the game is loaded pretty 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.940

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.479
 More races did not take place on the asphalt 8 playing 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:33.009
 on my ipad so i basically 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:35.020
 no phone for games is needed now 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.580
 There is a map loading I will tell about 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.060
