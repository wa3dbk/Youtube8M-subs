00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 in our next heading we continue 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.089
 to crack granite billiard science after all 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.040
 the tune is great but without 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.990
 knowledge of the theory of billiard player practically 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.859
 depriving themselves of the opportunity to go on 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:18.210
 new skill levels hi with you 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.770
 novel kirichenko rubik secrets 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.020
 mastery in this edition we will 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.119
 disassemble logic and decision making in it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 open position such position may 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 get an empty km and 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.689
 huddled robbery on fairly accurate 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.790
 blow and the pyramid stood well either or 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.170
 rival with robbery did not score but at the same time 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.559
 only a few roll back from the pyramid 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.809
 balls 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.050
 let's break and see what will be 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.050
 to talk 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.730
 here we got an example with you 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.170
 undisclosed positions which are from the pyramid 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.470
 rolled back just a few balls 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.370
 this position we have a choice either 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.370
 recoup and give a closed position 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.930
 rival or try to uncover it and 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.610
 already in open position do big 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.440
 series will now be appropriate to hold 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.450
 analogy with chess in which mate can 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.910
 put one two inputs or several 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.510
 moves also may disclose in a position 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.890
 one turn 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.020
 dan do you need this more 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.020
 strikes the best punches 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.720
 for disclosing positions are strangers in 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.930
 thin fishing line that will save us a bunch of 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:33.070
 likes on whack feed ball worth 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:35.500
 near the load in some positions with us 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.920
 there is no light ball with the robbery of the pyramid but 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.810
 there is an easy step with the exit zone under the battlefield and 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.700
 ball on the game that we can do 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.700
 podboy is a good example 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.860
 illustrating 2 hodovka quiet brother-in-law 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.860
 the middle with the release of someone else's ball in the zone 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.200
 corner pockets and board we 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.200
 make a slaughter look 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.690
 so we came to position in 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:13.460
 which is an excellent chance for robbery 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:15.200
 grass until often after parsing the pyramid 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.500
 we have a couple who looks angular 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.750
 pocket and gives us the opportunity to play it with 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.450
 roll up the ball in order to either 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 continue to roll the balls into the corner either 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.190
 if we are not sure then on katya 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.190
 play undertook let's see 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.890
 so we got positions with the possibility 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.079
 further on the cat 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.659
 however, since the ball is small 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.069
 sidebar most likely after this blow u 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.599
 we will no longer be able to roll forward 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.599
 and we have to hammer pyramids 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.329
 Now we see that our mnogohodovka in 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:10.420
 eventually led us to the same ball 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:12.609
 calmed the pyramid actually in 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.129
 closed positions straight strangers here 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.000
 cost much less than strangers in 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.670
 small cut 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.620
 such strangers also give us the opportunity 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.870
 hammer a pyramid into this 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.120
 positions were 100 players will try 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.609
 play this stranger with a strong bottom 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.340
 Screws trying to stretch the pyramid 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.560
 but more often than not there is not enough delay 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.829
 to break the balls wide enough 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.609
 instead you can try to play it with 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.379
 top screw 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.469
 when we play such strangers with the top 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.930
 we often screw off our scarf with a screw 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.739
 from the balls and gets himself to the corner 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.889
 pockets or he incites part of the pyramid 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.889
 chipping off some balls in the same zone 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.889
 look 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.500
 so with one blow we got 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.500
 position as comfortable as cotton 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:24.229
 so for podboy caramel and here's another 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.090
 option is possible the development of events in this 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.229
 positions we have the lightest balls yes 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.110
 your account in the middle 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.729
 from here but after him we will have no 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.210
 very comfortable position because through 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.150
 of the ball 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.520
 it will be hard for us to play but instead 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.310
 to play as much as this ball we can 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.979
 play it with the 11th ball after which 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.979
 get a comfortable ball for the stock of the pyramid 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.809
 now we know exactly what to do 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.720
 so we have completed a big topic 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.360
 exit games and American tactics 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.639
 now it's up to you to train or not 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.090
 train with you was romance poke up 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.090
 new meetings
