00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.180
 What's going on this video? I'm going to 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 teach how to make a top and I call it 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:25.420
 basic this first thing we're going to do 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.340
 is we put ourselves with our feet together and 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.000
 knees a little bent we do not have 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.920
 to be very tense as well as relaxed 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.050
 it's all relaunches then first of 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.850
 all together by the feet and we put one 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.270
 forward we try to put the point 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.970
 of the foot 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.010
 then you back him up and the other a little bit in 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:49.750
 diagonal but neither is it about crossing 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:51.340
 all the foot but the next thing that 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:59.950
 we will do it with a jump and we play a 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:10.740
 well and here jumps a foot when we have 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:10.740
 all arms crossed 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.189
 some things to keep in mind when 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.719
 we have to try the knees 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.759
 be more or less points that do this 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.469
 top cross opening so it's a bit ugly 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.509
 we also have to try to support the 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:33.409
 weight in front at the beginning happens that everything 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.390
 world is supported after the support then 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.799
 when we already manage to coordinate all this 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.780
 do not worry it takes many days 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.549
 I'm the first one that tops me 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.039
 they cost a lot then the next 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.600
 of this step is to add a little step plus a 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.600
 foot and the other you jump behind 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.049
 when you have it well learned and 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.840
 you can go to your own totally 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.030
 move the arms as you want the body 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.230
 everything but for that it takes its time 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.579
 there are people who are better at doing 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.269
 tricks and there are people who are better 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.799
 dance 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.900
 then well then play with them 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.299
 this is the basic top 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.659
 with which you can then scroll through 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.659
 space 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.540
 I'm going to try to upload the videos that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.400
 you ask me also trying 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.409
 vary a bit between more complex steps 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.450
 how is the power steps easier how 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.040
 was bought with football so people 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.049
 so much that it is starting as already 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.549
 It may take a long time to appear like this 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.959
 that until the tutorial and see you in 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.959
 the next video to take care
