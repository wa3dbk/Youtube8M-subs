00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
question and the entire series of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.499 
question and the entire series of
Pokemon<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.229> could<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.829> sworn<00:01:38.369> Pikachu<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
Pokemon I could have sworn Pikachu was a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.380 
Pokemon I could have sworn Pikachu was a
girl<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.829> swarm<00:01:41.520> Pikachu<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> girl

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
girl like if swarm Pikachu was a girl

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
girl like if swarm Pikachu was a girl
but<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:43.619> um<00:01:44.720> snivy<00:01:45.720> used<00:01:45.990> attract<00:01:46.560> on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
but then um snivy used attract on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.350 
but then um snivy used attract on
Pikachu<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:50.299> iris<00:01:51.299> goes<00:01:51.509> oh<00:01:52.189> you<00:01:53.189> know

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
Pikachu and iris goes oh you know

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
Pikachu and iris goes oh you know
pikachu's<00:01:54.360> got<00:01:54.630> hit<00:01:55.380> by<00:01:55.560> snipers<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.399> tracks

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
pikachu's got hit by snipers at tracks

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
pikachu's got hit by snipers at tracks
so<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.299> means<00:01:57.630> snivy<00:01:58.320> must<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> female

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
so that means snivy must be a female

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.999 
so that means snivy must be a female
which<00:02:00.149> means<00:02:00.450> Pikachu<00:02:00.960> obviously<00:02:01.649> must<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
which means Pikachu obviously must be a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.490 
which means Pikachu obviously must be a
male<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> entire<00:02:03.540> series<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.079> pokemon<00:02:04.469> i

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
male but the entire series of pokemon i

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.819 
male but the entire series of pokemon i
could<00:02:04.860> sworn<00:02:05.549> Pikachu<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> female<00:02:06.770> but<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
could sworn Pikachu was a female but I

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.650 
could sworn Pikachu was a female but I
guess<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.250> doesn't<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.550> matter<00:02:08.879> what<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
guess it doesn't really matter what I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.580 
guess it doesn't really matter what I
mean<00:02:09.810> seriously

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
mean seriously

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.290
