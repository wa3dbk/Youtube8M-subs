00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.490 
me recently
that<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:15.720> definitely<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> one<00:02:16.260> I'm<00:02:16.380> going

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
that that's definitely the one I'm going

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.470 
that that's definitely the one I'm going
to<00:02:16.590> go<00:02:16.650> back<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.280> because<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> fact<00:02:18.360> of

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
to go back to is because of the fact of

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.850 
to go back to is because of the fact of
matter<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.750> when<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:18.990> was<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.200> vacation<00:02:19.260> I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
matter that when I was on vacation I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.440 
matter that when I was on vacation I
have<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> little<00:02:20.190> travel-size<00:02:20.760> one<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
have a little travel-size one of that

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.809 
have a little travel-size one of that
that<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.750> had<00:02:22.050> with<00:02:22.230> me<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.860> really<00:02:23.490> noticed

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
that I had with me and I really noticed

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.550 
that I had with me and I really noticed
the<00:02:24.180> difference<00:02:24.330> when<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.810> went<00:02:25.080> back<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> using

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the difference when I went back to using

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.800 
the difference when I went back to using
that<00:02:25.830> while<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> was<00:02:26.160> on<00:02:26.280> vacation<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:27.180> it's

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that while I was on vacation and it's

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.930 
that while I was on vacation and it's
really<00:02:28.230> impressive<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.490> makes<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.819> big

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
really impressive and it makes a big

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.729 
really impressive and it makes a big
difference<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.660> definitely<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.620> that

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
difference and I definitely think that

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.930 
difference and I definitely think that
that's<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.130> I'm<00:02:32.280> going<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.489> go<00:02:32.550> back<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.730> you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that's all I'm going to go back to you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.199 
that's all I'm going to go back to you
this<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:33.989> fairly<00:02:34.520> expensive<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.880> wasn't

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
this was fairly expensive it wasn't

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.880 
this was fairly expensive it wasn't
inexpensive<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.020> want<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.350> say<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> was<00:02:37.709> around

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
inexpensive I want to say it was around

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.620 
inexpensive I want to say it was around
like<00:02:38.100> forty<00:02:38.459> dollars<00:02:38.760> i<00:02:38.910> think<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.270> this<00:02:39.360> and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
like forty dollars i think for this and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.330 
like forty dollars i think for this and

don't get me wrong it has lasted me a

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.090 
don't get me wrong it has lasted me a
really<00:02:41.640> long<00:02:41.790> while<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.860> something
