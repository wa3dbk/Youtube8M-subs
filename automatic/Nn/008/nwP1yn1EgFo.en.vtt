00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.420
 salut madame and monsieur 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.130
 with you dominica is another podcast on 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.150
 toy wall of tanks 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.259
 I decided to do a little review on 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.800
 French light tank of the fifth level 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.609
 ILSI mx pereel as it is called 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.490
 look at some french frog 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:36.379
 small even in comparison with hellket 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.100
 hellcat seems like a huge tank this 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.080
 the tank actually causes many 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.479
 different feelings someone his really 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.049
 someone likes to endure very, very much 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:51.500
 can not and I just did apply to 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:54.760
 one and to the second first when here i 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.260
 I want to clarify, I want to generally branch of France and 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.549
 stumbled upon this tank from me at all 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.309
 annoyed but when opened it 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:07.490
 wonderful top gun which 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:11.090
 attention breaking through the light tank 170 on 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.320
 bb cumulative 248 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.930
 and this given the fact that we can throw 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.000
 to nines or and from maybe somewhere 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.370
 wrong maybe even tens us 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.610
 throws but nevertheless as it were with this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.880
 breaking even these mastodons we 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.530
 we can easily sew arifa we have 240 then 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.990
 there is very very tangible 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 accuracy is pretty good 038 but yourself 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000
 epic is the time of information and peak in the bad 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.260
 sense because we are reduced 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.780
 really very very long and still 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.760
 there is one nuance on the instrument that 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.550
 in fact we have the angles of rotation of the tower 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.520
 completely absent in my opinion there about 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.750
 10 degrees left and right that is, we 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.130
 actually pt 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.610
 and by the way this is this nuance 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.840
 can just give and diversify 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.720
 gameplay because we can be like 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.350
 active and passive light and when 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.800
 we passive light we can calmly 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.560
 amuse because I 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:28.080
 with such characteristics of the instrument that is 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.750
 we can grieve anyone from more precisely 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.320
 tank of absolutely any level we are capable 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.310
 grieve also gorgeous 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.020
 dynamics 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.120
 acceleration dynamics excellent speed and this 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.690
 of course irreplaceable facts 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.540
 Yes, we have to cheat with all this no 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.080
 we donâ€™t have any armor 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.780
 there are pretty funny nuances 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.100
 It happens here I have been several times 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.940
 I remember very neighing with one 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.300
 episode when code and two times me 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.490
 shot shot in the harp and without damage and then 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.910
 have you submit a copy that is not 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.850
 stock here are such nuances but 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.980
 often like any shot from 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.570
 the enemy knocks us that caterpillar and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.770
 if we were hit by a caterpillar, then in fact 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.820
 lifetime 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.610
 We can already be calculated are hundredths 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.700
 in fractions of a second that is killing us very 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.239
 quickly and therefore necessarily with you 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.050
 take a glass and then the crew 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.209
 pump repair further what from 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.320
 unpleasant 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:48.120
 almost every time we hit our tree 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.459
 not only does the caterpillar want us 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.850
 criticizes the engine that is just it 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:04:00.600
 disables and therefore also 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.120
 The nuance is so unpleasant in this but 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.330
 Now that's exactly the same for us on the setup 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.760
 threw maybe not the best 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.760
 the fight is just because we are here 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.160
 against the sixth levels and this is for the Christmas tree not 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.569
 very good because I like to play 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.840
 vs 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.389
 Mainly against the heaviest slope in this 8 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.050
 9 and twist the cartilage and here you see 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.710
 they are heap but nevertheless we are successful 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.190
 just all damashim somewhere even 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.080
 here is and plus you in these fights because 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.820
 that somewhere we can even barter 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.099
 on hp because right now ass t-14 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.190
 torture and like this before and they are very 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.710
 I understand what it is he has here I 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.860
 just the same 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.949
 forcing to leave and throw him in the side 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.960
 at the same time I deliberately accept 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.620
 some damage from him but nonetheless 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.740
 I get my great teammates 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.039
 I did not manage to perform another frag 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.490
 not so important and with all this by the way 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.919
 right now 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.130
 086 in our yard need Churchill still have 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:17.300
 I decided to back up and finally class 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.820
 frags bath sport 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:27.060
 here's another decided to prop up so here in the yard 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:28.259
 we have 086 coming soon 087 and in this 087 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.940
 we lose 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:36.210
 2 interesting tanks namely t-50 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:41.849
 I will understand it from him 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:45.270
 significantly kill the dynamics of the t-50 hyphen 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:50.190
 2 or t 52 which one calls it is 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.220
 altogether clean and introduce new networks 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.060
 which I already like on the test 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.990
 saw that he has lousy dynamics 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.710
 so actually this tanchik 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:07.380
 let's say this last cheerful firefly 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.190
 well maybe everything will change in 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.600
 any patches and mind 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.070
 be honored and by the way here there is one more 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.470
 drop dead plus here you now saw 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.900
 when I rubbed the rocks he could not me 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.480
 shoot because most here 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.450
 these here tyazhny regardless of level 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.440
 by the way here if the high 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.620
 any 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.720
 tanks they generally can not lower on 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.530
 you have a table that is to get it 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.960
 you can somehow get used to them 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.390
 without even being afraid if we take your barrel 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.960
 that is, they waited on the side 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.510
 etc. 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.510
 then you rushed abruptly to the side 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:51.070
 shot again priteril ie this 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:54.160
 can be used and with all of 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:57.060
 this i say that we can shine we 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.100
 we can damage and accordingly 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.470
 a combination of these 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.290
 properties gives us an excellent farm and I 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:08.320
 Naturally I play if someone watches mine 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:11.020
 the video is often I play without any prem 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.320
 account and thanks to this you can 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.290
 see results yes there experiences i got 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.910
 Nemer, because the action was but 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.790
 silver is just because 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:24.100
 how much damage and a deal hope you 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:28.110
 It was interesting to all thanks 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.110
 likes signed channel everyone happy
