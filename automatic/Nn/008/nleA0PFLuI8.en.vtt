 You will put everything else and then like 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.400
 I already have to select one I will choose 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.229
 that the songs you see here choose 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.520
 the songs you want, I just 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.930
 I'm selecting everyone here to give a 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.180
 example 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.510
 done that selected you trawlers 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:50.530
 They dragged all the songs here. 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.570
 here you want it if you read it so much 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.510
 music is going to depend on 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.720
 will depend on the size of the cd beauty 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.400
 people then done that dragged there already 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.540
 is on record you put on start the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.460
 recording 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.130
 In my case, I'll start recording. 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.630
 ask to insert the cd you will insert 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.670
 logically know why you want 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.050
 record only I will not insert a cd 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.260
 because I already had these songs everything 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.209
 but then it's feasible for me it 's more 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.250
 done this will open the lid here of your 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.900
 computer will open that there's kitty 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.480
 if it's a notebook this was a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.510
 computer you insert the cd 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.700
 at the time you close that belly that 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.450
 status it will start recording. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.000
 fill has a percentage to complete 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.640
 recording the cd so it will complete the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.100
 the drawer will reopen the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.410
 notebook that you will be able to use 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.120
 the cd you want 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.109
 will depend on the format in which you 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.690
