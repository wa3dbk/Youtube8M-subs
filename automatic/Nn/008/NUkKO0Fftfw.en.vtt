00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
typically it could be anything but let's

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.069 
typically it could be anything but let's
say<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:53.970> white<00:01:54.060> marine<00:01:54.360> pearl<00:01:54.570> wrap<00:01:54.810> and

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
darker color for the for the initial

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.979 
darker color for the for the initial
diamond<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.030> then<00:03:17.150> maybe<00:03:17.389> a<00:03:17.479> lighter<00:03:17.720> color

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
diamond and then maybe a lighter color

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.780 
diamond and then maybe a lighter color
on<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.229> inside<00:03:18.349> there<00:03:19.190> are<00:03:19.220> many<00:03:19.430> different
