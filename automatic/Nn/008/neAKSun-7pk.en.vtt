00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.420
 that companies seek benefits is 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.180
 well but that they change their ideas every bit 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.269
 time is not cool anymore so you know who wins 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.769
 with so much change it was a question but 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.110
 If you can not answer it either 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.969

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.939

 it comes but of course we could not 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.540
 resist to tell you the experience in 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.160
 first person is to say that we have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 had enough flight hours to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.020
 do a live review with our 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 consoles on real servers we have 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.280
 tested the target beta and I'll 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 We count everything in ig in Spain come to 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.960
 go through the web before entering 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 fight then and that is it or you are looking for games 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.420
 you and tell us how it is doing you a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.250
 year we saw devil 3 on consoles but 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.230
 there is still a long way to go 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.140
 we are to begin million 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.030
 win updates that throw blood 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.159
 to spill and that to kill the devil 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 it's never going to go out of style that's why we 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.530
 we have gone on tour and we tell you how it is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.900
 devil 3 mps 4 and xbox one that adds or 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.150
 remove respect to the PC versions and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.220
 previous generation consoles also 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.320
 if we like them more or less and what we can 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 wait for two months to follow your 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.909
 launch and said this now in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.420
 blizzard will have more time to devote 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.240
 and so good that they can subtract wow 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.579
 we do not know if it will be much 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.469
 yesterday we talked about the games and a 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.569
 person who can be considered the 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.850
 hype kings names that take away 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.100
 tons of expectation and then it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.049
 deflate badly because today 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.759
 my dear, we have an opposite case 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.189
 of projects that have not been raised 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.289
 Enough hobby those who enter 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.599
 kickstarter to find funds but you 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.670
 they stayed the same as they were ie in 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.259
 project and how the experience is what 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 better to learn in these cases 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.390
 hatch the report and so you dress 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.340
 frustration or having to return the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.009
 money that's not cool either, you have it in 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.600
 the web chooses in Spain of course 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.030
 I have told you 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.340
 the path of companies like microsoft 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.620
 google or apple goes through the market more 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.480
 professional one that some have taken care 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.830
 from always although the last years 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.590
 gave the impression that it was more 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.510
 important the final consumer we go the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.430
 that we buy consoles and mobiles and that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.980
 touch now you can recover the image 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.570
 of seriousness that guarantees contracts 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.910
 of government and makes companies 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.710
 spend millions on you to know what 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.140
 than to make phones and consoles 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.450
 cheap and there are others why he appeals 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.980
 searched for the ibm experience and no longer 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.530
 let's see their heads combs 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.570
 in front of the logo of the three letters and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.100
 this is not all in microsoft also it 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.900
 they put serious and they will throw by the 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.940
 most professional market 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.020
 let's hope that xbox is reinforced with 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.910
 this July 22 we will leave doubts 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.950
