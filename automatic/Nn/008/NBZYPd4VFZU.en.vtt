00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.400 
ycs Toronto is over but the celebration
has<00:00:10.730> just<00:00:10.880> begun<00:00:11.450> I<00:00:11.660> think<00:00:11.870> that<00:00:11.900> this<00:00:12.110> was<00:00:12.260> one

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
has just begun I think that this was one

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.680 
has just begun I think that this was one
of<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.590> coolest<00:00:13.160> events<00:00:13.700> that<00:00:13.850> we've<00:00:14.360> seen<00:00:14.660> in

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
of the coolest events that we've seen in

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.600 
of the coolest events that we've seen in
a<00:00:14.930> very<00:00:15.140> long<00:00:15.320> time<00:00:15.500> and<00:00:15.830> I<00:00:16.010> think<00:00:16.070> that<00:00:16.400> this

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
a very long time and I think that this

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.359 
a very long time and I think that this
proves<00:00:17.090> that<00:00:17.180> this<00:00:17.390> this<00:00:18.020> format<00:00:18.770> is<00:00:18.800> going<00:00:19.220> to

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
proves that this this format is going to

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:20.950 
proves that this this format is going to
have<00:00:19.520> a<00:00:19.550> good<00:00:19.910> amount<00:00:20.119> of<00:00:20.270> parodies<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:20.779> I

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
have a good amount of parodies and I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.300 
have a good amount of parodies and I
think<00:00:21.140> that's<00:00:21.290> something<00:00:21.529> that<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:21.950> lot<00:00:22.099> of

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
think that's something that a lot of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.400 
think that's something that a lot of
people<00:00:22.460> like<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.450> most<00:00:23.720> impressive<00:00:24.230> thing

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
and I don't even think it's close I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.040 
and I don't even think it's close I

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
dragon thing where your opponent is

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.340 
dragon thing where your opponent is
playing<00:03:26.880> three<00:03:27.420> msts<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.110> those<00:03:28.200> are

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
playing three msts and those are

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.930 
playing three msts and those are
probably<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.920> be<00:03:29.010> dead<00:03:29.190> cards<00:03:29.550> so<00:03:29.730> that

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
probably going to be dead cards so that

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.850 
probably going to be dead cards so that
makes<00:03:30.480> sense<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.959> he<00:03:31.080> would<00:03:31.110> run<00:03:31.380> double

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
makes sense that he would run double

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.060 
makes sense that he would run double
track<00:03:32.070> odia<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.880> he<00:03:33.000> would<00:03:33.120> also<00:03:33.240> run<00:03:33.510> gorse

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070
