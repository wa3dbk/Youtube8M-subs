the<00:02:30.380> spoiler<00:02:30.680> here<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.400> whole<00:02:31.550> thing

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
the spoiler here is that the whole thing

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.150 
the spoiler here is that the whole thing
is<00:02:31.850> bottlenecked<00:02:32.480> by<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> slow<00:02:33.050> 1.2<00:02:33.830> gigahertz

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
processor and 512 megabytes of RAM so it

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.030 
processor and 512 megabytes of RAM so it
might<00:02:37.820> be<00:02:37.880> 4G<00:02:38.480> coming<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.020> phone<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
might be 4G coming to the phone but the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.610 
might be 4G coming to the phone but the
overall<00:02:40.370> speed<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.970> still<00:02:41.180> stuck<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.600> 2010<00:02:42.380> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
overall speed is still stuck in 2010 and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650 
overall speed is still stuck in 2010 and
