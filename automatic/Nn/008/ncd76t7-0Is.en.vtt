00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
in the mesh um the first thing I noticed

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.880 
in the mesh um the first thing I noticed
when<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.780> pulled<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> package<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
when I pulled it out of the package is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.819 
when I pulled it out of the package is
that<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.280> lot<00:00:44.670> drier<00:00:45.420> than<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> regular

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that it's a lot drier than a regular

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.029 
that it's a lot drier than a regular
East<00:00:47.160> Coast<00:00:47.370> mesh<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.289> also<00:00:49.710> notice<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
East Coast mesh and I also notice that

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
East Coast mesh and I also notice that
it's<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.640> similar<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.239> thrown<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.780> string

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
it's really similar to thrown up string

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's really similar to thrown up string
mesh<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:53.430> throne<00:00:53.760> mesh<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.500> in<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
mesh your throne mesh as in that it's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
mesh your throne mesh as in that it's
super<00:00:56.430> dry<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:59.300> obviously<00:01:00.300> not<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.629> tacky

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
super dry and obviously not that tacky

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
super dry and obviously not that tacky
and<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.340> still<00:01:02.520> easy<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> pull

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and it's but it's still easy to pull

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
and it's but it's still easy to pull
apart<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.260> anything<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> hard

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
apart like it's not anything like a hard

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
apart like it's not anything like a hard
master<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:06.000> gym<00:01:06.540> lack<00:01:06.750> semi<00:01:07.049> yard<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
master like a gym lack semi yard if you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.100 
master like a gym lack semi yard if you
know<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:08.130> you've<00:01:08.340> ever<00:01:08.580> had<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.939> before<00:01:09.110> it's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
know if you've ever had that before it's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
know if you've ever had that before it's
a<00:01:10.350> definitely<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.040> pliable<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.299> tacky

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a definitely so pliable but not as tacky

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.109 
a definitely so pliable but not as tacky
as<00:01:12.840> regular<00:01:13.290> DCM<00:01:13.770> which<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.670> something<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
as regular DCM which is something I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
as regular DCM which is something I
prefer<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> doesn't

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
prefer more of just because it doesn't

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.560 
prefer more of just because it doesn't
get<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:16.979> dirty<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.549> fast<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.180> I've<00:01:18.390> seen

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

em it's like brown dab aged white fade
and<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:24.689> weird<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.770> gets<00:01:25.920> dirty

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and it just was weird like it gets dirty

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.140 
and it just was weird like it gets dirty
super<00:01:26.759> fast<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.280> far<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> hasn't<00:01:29.850> i

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
super fast and this so far it hasn't i

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
super fast and this so far it hasn't i
plated<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> week<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
plated this for like a week now and it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.390 
plated this for like a week now and it
still<00:01:32.310> looks<00:01:32.340> fresh<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.619> hardly<00:01:34.619> any<00:01:34.950> dirt

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
still looks fresh like hardly any dirt

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.649 
still looks fresh like hardly any dirt
gotten<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.180> we've<00:01:36.299> been<00:01:36.420> playing

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
gotten in there and we've been playing

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
gotten in there and we've been playing
in<00:01:36.780> mud<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.250> turf<00:01:38.430> whilst

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
in mud just a little bit of turf whilst

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.490 
in mud just a little bit of turf whilst
way<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> game<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.439> cool

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
way in the game with this is pretty cool

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.670 
way in the game with this is pretty cool
and<00:01:41.210> thought<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.329> well<00:01:42.540> obviously<00:01:42.899> no<00:01:43.229> bagging

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and thought up well obviously no bagging

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.109 
and thought up well obviously no bagging
that's<00:01:43.890> partly<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.369> i<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> fatty

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
that's partly because i have a fatty

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.929 
that's partly because i have a fatty
bottom<00:01:45.540> string<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.490> that's<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.759> pretty

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
bottom string and that's not it's pretty

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.080 
bottom string and that's not it's pretty
