00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.740
 the staff was a book number 14 and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.280
 we'll talk a little bit today 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.160
 about tire tires how long do they last? 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.890
 no pressure to calibrate can 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.699
 retread a bricklayer Thursday in the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.699
 globe reporter 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.930
 formerly had a session on the blog of 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.750
 music called anita cab questions 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.930
 wife were basic questions like that. 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.180
 that one of them was that the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.030
 Rita would do it for me. 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.339
 while the airplane tire is calibrated and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.699
 now youtube have new questions 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.519
 thus appearing with the same content 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.500
 even had someone there asked if 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.720
 passes by the black woman after stealing a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.820
 airplane 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.280
 if it were a practical wing then dinha 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 go there right here because the landing gear 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.149
 it is stored throughout during the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.840
 flight will then go through the black 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.100
 there 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.289
 in the opinion of plane has a technology 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.380
 that you can not even imagine 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:18.020
 face a cart panel for example 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.140
 it is built to handle loads 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.869
 huge nÃ© huge weights but a cart 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.910
 never exceeds 120 miles per hour 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.250
 it means that the crazy ones there but anyway 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.030
 it's not meant for that in a car 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.550
 formula 1 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.759
 on the contrary it reaches very high 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.200
 speeds however is super light it does not have 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.720
 carries no load 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.790
 since the plane tires it they have to 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.159
 be made to support weight 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.280
 higher than one 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.439
 and high speeds as well. 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.890
 It is larger than a car formula 1 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.390
 Moreover right needs to support variations 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.890
 of temperatures in fractions of a second 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.229
 He comes in the belly. 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.149
 of the airplane in the record dinho 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.689
 time he touches the runway 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.649
 it goes from zero to 260 kilometers 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.579
 per hour 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.650
 so it is worse the temperature goes in 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.320
 seconds in fraction of seconds for more 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.450
 100 degrees and as if they were not enough 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.820
 these extreme operations do not 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.120
 the aircraft designers they still want 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.480
 these tires are small for hair 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.459
 accommodation there mano technology has to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.019
 being small has to be light has to 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.120
 to withstand high speed has to 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.370
 hold weight just looks fucking the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.709
 requirements of losing the nautical 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.670
 the most common manufacturers so 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.060
 aeronautical tires 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 The most I see is the day and Michelin are 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.780
 the main 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.290
 we see close to and these tires 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.290
 how are 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.670
 I've learned good 177 site to talk about 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.830
 tires 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.910
 For those who did not get close, this is 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.010
 an airplane corridor is quite large 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.290
 It weighs a lot since we're going to talk 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.930
 to lose nothing better than to talk 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.980
 filming his favorite site is 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.420
 futile the nipple 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.170
 because he has three kisses around the 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.170
 main landing gear 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.890
 only the pdt and cissokho serve 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.940
 I got into the water the question was how much 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.560
 the average duration of the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.560
 airplane tire 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.550
 special poison stage for 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.630
 see if they are discussing ortis 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.620
 fashion screw did not break it every 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.199
 landing efe 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.079
 and we monitor tire wear 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.690
 as much as this whole rubber 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.910
 wears up to the bone by staying up to 15 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.710
 disappear stay connected with the housing 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.390
 will start to appear on the spit that the 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.660
 White tire 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.840
 and there is the arm exchange limit 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.020
 Wendel can be retreaded since the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.990
 airlines they 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.710
 can already be consulted in some 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.930
 some times before and changed port 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.380
 obviously in an equal retread of 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.380
 car 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.130
 the pressure 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:02.650
 to calibrate the peak yard where there is 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.340
 enough and lost only stocked with 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.889
 hydrogen 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.180
 the pressure leaves here for example between 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.729
 220 and 225 pesce 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.979
 comparing it with your car of over 40 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:21.710
 the 3525 to price then you have a 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.330
 difference in nitrogen because of 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.319
 hydrogen 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.159
 the pressure does not vary much 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:32.779
 temperature as far as the 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.550
 air if the temperature is too high 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:38.319
 to expand increases the pressure 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.319
 if the temperature is too cold 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.420
 gentle beach 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:50.480
 what a tragedy of unitel people feel good 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.110
 with city 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:58.430
 the tire of this one is obviously to put up with 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.100
 his ability differs based on usage 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.169
 according to the weight according to the type of track 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.240
 that she is confused 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.190
 but there average sold of 7,700 lasts three 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.620
 months 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:17.389
 three to four months, the maximum is 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:21.530
 one or the curiosity because they had 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:26.510
 Big one has a cluck dependent on the 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:29.210
 small yesterday that the mass of the plane weight 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.970
 it needs to be distributed across 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.310
 points for the airport runway she 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.760
 do not split for example if you concentrate 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:41.120
 if the full weight of an a380 or a site 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.330
 47 and only three points as is the majority 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.770
 of small airplanes and to have so much weight in 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.169
 each leg of the train 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.360
 the asphalt below and then stand 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.389
 distribute this weight at various points or 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.639
 several trains after several tires is 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.060
 to save the airport runway, right? 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:02.000
 It was cool and I think I 'm thinking of 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.389
 open a rubber shop and almost 380 goes 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.199
 Give money, man, I'm going to pass. 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:11.120
 I tire my little black cat, right? 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:15.760
 That's it folks I hope this time 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.760
 kito and it 's the next ticket
