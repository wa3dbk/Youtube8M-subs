00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
werewolf form which is actually good for

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.180

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.050 
recovery and the fact that there's lots
of<00:03:32.810> amazing<00:03:33.080> storytelling<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.280> plot<00:03:34.850> details

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
of amazing storytelling and plot details

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.640 
of amazing storytelling and plot details

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
werewolf I think the the storytelling as

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.380 
werewolf I think the the storytelling as
one<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.010> role<00:03:40.190> playing<00:03:40.459> is<00:03:40.610> fantastic

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
one and the role playing is fantastic

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.120
