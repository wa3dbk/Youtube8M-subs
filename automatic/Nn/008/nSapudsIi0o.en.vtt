00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
seemed to be perfect and then I'm not

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.510 
seemed to be perfect and then I'm not
sure<00:01:39.240> exactly<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:40.070> which<00:01:41.070> animator

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
sure exactly which which animator

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.609 
sure exactly which which animator
designed<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.930> car<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.320> one<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.470> our

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
designed the car but one of our

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
designed the car but one of our
