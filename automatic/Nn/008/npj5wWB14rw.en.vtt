00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.840
The Ahurea Tino Rangatiratanga
will be held tomorrow

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.560
at Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.960
The haka competition began there
and now returns there

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.360
for it's 15th birthday.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.720
Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae
welcome Auckland schools

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.840
to Te Ahurea Tino Rangatiratanga
as it celebrates 15 years.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.440
We welcome you to Nga Tapuwae.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.960
The first Ahurea was held here
in 1996, now it returns.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.960
It is a special occasion

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.480
as Nga Tapuwae has just been
recognised as an independent school.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.200
When the minister agreed for
the school to become independent,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.600
it was agreed for the competition
to be held here this year.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.000
Nine Auckland schools will
compete with the aim

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.400
of making the National secondary
school haka competition next year.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.680
For the past five years,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.160
Te Kura Maori o Nga Tapuwae
has won the competition.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.000
And they're ready for tomorrow.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.640
We're ready.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.120
We've been practicing hard

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.800
and we can't wait
to take the stage tomorrow.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.760
Te Keepa says the competition has
achieved what it was set up to do.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.960
The schools that take part

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.360
are schools that foster
the Maori language.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.360
The beauty of the language
is expressed on stage.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.560
It's a joy to hear.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.640
The competition will begin
at 9am this morning,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.200
Te Kura o Te Kotuku
are the ice breakers.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.040
Rapaera Tawhai, Te Karere.
