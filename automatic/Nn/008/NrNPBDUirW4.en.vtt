00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
cut up and we're going to try some

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.420 
cut up and we're going to try some
different<00:00:32.419> techniques<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.350> i'll<00:00:34.160> be<00:00:34.280> showing

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
different techniques and i'll be showing

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.600 
different techniques and i'll be showing
you<00:00:34.610> a<00:00:34.699> few<00:00:34.970> videos<00:00:35.120> on<00:00:35.540> on<00:00:35.809> how<00:00:36.620> to<00:00:36.680> do<00:00:37.070> that<00:00:37.250> so

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
you a few videos on on how to do that so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.630 
you a few videos on on how to do that so
I've<00:00:38.089> got<00:00:38.780> some<00:00:40.690> shimmers<00:00:41.690> pearls<00:00:42.680> in<00:00:43.100> carrot

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
I've got some shimmers pearls in carrot

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.160 
I've got some shimmers pearls in carrot
top<00:00:43.820> and<00:00:44.830> I've<00:00:45.830> got<00:00:46.129> some<00:00:46.540> shimmers<00:00:47.540> into<00:00:48.049> you

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
top and I've got some shimmers into you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.910 
top and I've got some shimmers into you
so<00:00:49.180> we're<00:00:50.180> going<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.629> just<00:00:50.989> have<00:00:51.229> a<00:00:51.440> check<00:00:51.739> of

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
so we're going to just have a check of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.140 
so we're going to just have a check of
that<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.339> see<00:00:52.610> what<00:00:53.260> this<00:00:54.430> works<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:55.790> so

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
that and see what this works like so

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.649 
that and see what this works like so
I've<00:00:56.900> just<00:00:57.140> popped<00:00:57.409> it<00:00:57.680> on<00:00:57.799> the<00:00:58.190> plate<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.879> I'm

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
I've just popped it on the plate and I'm

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.670 
I've just popped it on the plate and I'm
just<00:00:59.930> going<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:02.500> run<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.619> over<00:01:05.439> might<00:01:06.439> add<00:01:06.650> a

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
just going to run it over might add a

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.140 
just going to run it over might add a
little<00:01:06.950> bit<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.189> water

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630 

now<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.440> is<00:01:13.500> water<00:01:13.830> basis<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.460> going

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
now because this is water basis is going

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
now because this is water basis is going
to<00:01:14.730> respond<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.300> differently<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.350> how

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
to respond a little differently to how

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.510 
to respond a little differently to how
you<00:01:17.190> see<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:18.000> other<00:01:18.360> videos<00:01:18.980> so<00:01:19.980> I'm<00:01:20.280> just

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you see on other videos so I'm just

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.400 
you see on other videos so I'm just
going<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:21.560> put<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.620> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.190> how<00:01:27.410> that

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
going to put my so you can see how that

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.620 
going to put my so you can see how that
reacts<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:30.510> is<00:01:30.720> gorgeous

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
reacts there and that is gorgeous

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
reacts there and that is gorgeous
impressive<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.760> be<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
impressive so you just have to be a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.870 
impressive so you just have to be a
little<00:01:36.090> bit<00:01:36.240> careful<00:01:36.660> about<00:01:38.660> about<00:01:39.660> how<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
little bit careful about about how you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.640 
little bit careful about about how you
treat<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:46.110> could<00:01:46.320> end<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.590> with

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
treat this in that you could end up with

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.790 
treat this in that you could end up with
your<00:01:46.979> colors<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:47.940> muddy<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
your colors and a little bit muddy be

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.480 
your colors and a little bit muddy be
with<00:01:49.800> them<00:01:50.160> not<00:01:50.550> too<00:01:50.760> much<00:01:51.950> they<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.010> milled

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
with them not too much they do milled

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
with them not too much they do milled
quite<00:01:53.820> easily<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.810> one's<00:02:00.960> different

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
quite easily so that one's different

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.609 
quite easily so that one's different
again<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.140> i<00:02:04.170> mean<00:02:04.380> by

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
again and you can see what i mean by

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
again and you can see what i mean by
melding<00:02:05.040> colors<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.700> can't<00:02:05.970> really<00:02:06.330> see<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
melding colors you can't really see the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:16.180 
melding colors you can't really see the
orange<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.560> teal<00:02:08.149> separately<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.850> we<00:02:12.390> can

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.380 

squeal<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.340> again<00:02:18.260> furthermore<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:21.209> is

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
squeal it again furthermore this is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.790 
squeal it again furthermore this is
going<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.720> muddy<00:02:21.930> up<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.200> colors<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> little

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
going to muddy up the colors a little

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.130 
going to muddy up the colors a little
bit<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.489> going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.690> little<00:02:25.019> bit

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
bit so this is going to be a little bit

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.870 
bit so this is going to be a little bit
of<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> brown<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.400> shimmer<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
of a brown but because of the shimmer in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.290 
of a brown but because of the shimmer in
the<00:02:29.940> orange<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.010> teal<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.250> sort<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.580> makes

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
the orange and the teal it sort of makes

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.680 
the orange and the teal it sort of makes
a<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.810> bit<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.110> gold<00:02:35.060> sort<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.150> sparkle

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
a little bit of a gold sort of sparkle

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.040 
a little bit of a gold sort of sparkle
in<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> air<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:39.050> second

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
in the air so that's the second

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
in the air so that's the second
generation<00:02:40.170> print<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:42.560> I'll<00:02:43.560> try<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:43.860> again

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
generation print and I'll try that again

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.900 
generation print and I'll try that again
on<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.519> side<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.950> time<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.280> might<00:02:47.610> just

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
on this side so this time I might just

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.800 
on this side so this time I might just
to<00:02:48.650> pick<00:02:49.650> up<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.950> leftover<00:02:50.430> paint

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.170 

by<00:02:53.440> melding<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.340> together<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:54.970> gets

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
by melding it together and this gets

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.589 
by melding it together and this gets
more<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.690> am<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.910> print<00:02:57.910> like<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.420> just

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
more of am a print like if you just

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.760 
more of am a print like if you just
spray<00:02:59.020> on<00:02:59.319> your<00:02:59.530> work<00:02:59.680> surface<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.900> I'm<00:03:02.410> just

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
spray on your work surface so I'm just

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.839 
spray on your work surface so I'm just
saturating<00:03:03.489> here<00:03:03.700> getting<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.209> leftover

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
saturating here getting the leftover

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.170
