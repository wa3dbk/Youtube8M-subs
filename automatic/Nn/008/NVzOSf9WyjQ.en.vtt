describe the shootouts well the first

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
describe the shootouts well the first
one<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.570> didn't<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.230> too<00:00:40.679> much<00:00:40.859> of<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
one I really I didn't have too much of a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.709 
one I really I didn't have too much of a
plan<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.429> kind<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.909> had<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.179> in<00:00:42.300> my<00:00:42.420> head<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
plan I kind of had it in my head that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.599 
plan I kind of had it in my head that
that<00:00:42.780> might<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> good<00:00:43.440> move<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.039> try<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
that might be a good move to try in the

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.849 
that might be a good move to try in the
goalie<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.839> I<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.109> coming<00:00:46.289> down<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.769> it

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
goalie and so I was coming down and it

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.889 
goalie and so I was coming down and it
just<00:00:46.890> kind<00:00:47.609> of<00:00:47.699> seemed<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.059> happen<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
just kind of seemed to happen and and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.439 
just kind of seemed to happen and and
then<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.399> always<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.909> a<00:00:51.030> scary<00:00:51.239> one

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
then it's always kind of a scary one

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.610 
then it's always kind of a scary one
because<00:00:51.659> you<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> turn<00:00:52.079> your<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
because you have to turn your back to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.989 
because you have to turn your back to
the<00:00:52.710> goalie<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.069> you're<00:00:53.219> spinning<00:00:53.789> around

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
the goalie when you're spinning around

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.259 
the goalie when you're spinning around
and<00:00:54.479> so<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.409> wasn't<00:00:56.370> sure<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
and so I wasn't sure if it was going in

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.880 
and so I wasn't sure if it was going in
or<00:00:57.359> not<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.659> tapped<00:00:57.929> it<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.199> unfortunately

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
or not and I tapped it in unfortunately

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.079 
or not and I tapped it in unfortunately
and<00:00:59.010> went<00:00:59.129> into<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> net<00:00:59.519> so<00:00:59.729> I<00:00:59.760> was<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.059> oh

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
and went into the net so I was like oh

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.629 
and went into the net so I was like oh
thank<00:01:00.719> god<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.319> got<00:01:02.069> back<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> bench

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639

made a great play and it felt good

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.599

and their fans were great really loud
and<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.520> had<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> great<00:02:02.939> section<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.079> think

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and we had a great section of I think

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.039 
and we had a great section of I think
the<00:02:04.829> old-timer<00:02:05.310> Hall<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.240> fence<00:02:06.539> I<00:02:06.780> think

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
the old-timer Hall of a fence I think

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.600 
the old-timer Hall of a fence I think
that's<00:02:07.229> what<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> heard<00:02:07.649> they<00:02:08.190> were<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
that's what I heard they were all in the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.919 
that's what I heard they were all in the
corner<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.660> were<00:02:09.720> trying

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
corner there so I think they were trying

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.229 
corner there so I think they were trying
to<00:02:10.140> give<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.530> Freeland<00:02:11.459> fans<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.970> run<00:02:12.120> for
