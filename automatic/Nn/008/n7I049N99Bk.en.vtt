00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.580
 and with you sl and today you are watching 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.700
 German Medium Tank Guide 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.460
 T25 is a fifth level premium haircut 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.590
 as for almost all other cars of the fifth 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.350
 they ask for the level for one and a half thousand 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.210
 gold in this guide we will try 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.550
 tell you whether to spend money 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.859
 on this car or not worth the most 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.710
 outstanding in this car of course 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.500
 her appearance and everything because it's there 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.170
 not really German ocher and 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.720
 just just grab the zero van 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.320
 after capturing whose main advantages are not 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:48.550
 the machine is good asks for 610 units and 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.739
 communication range of 710 meters by the way one 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.250
 Of the rare advantages of the car is good 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.730
 Mr. 10 degrees down and 20 degrees 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.850
 up everything else is not so fun 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.430
 for example, booking is very very weak 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.560
 the thickest place is vld which 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.180
 neutral 50 millimeters but alive 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.970
 tilt is about 76 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.100
 reduced armor is obtained forehead 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.780
 towers 60 millimeters with very funny 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.910
 slope of the order of one or two 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.619
 degrees so the same 60 millimeters and 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.000
 that's all that 's left 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.340
 say about the reservation because 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.250
 bead is generally 45 millimeters per 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.009
 enclosure sixty tyr most on the tower then 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.819
 there is making it to the fifth level by all and 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.770
 all me 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.720
 and if any machine gunner to him under 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.880
 sat down gives you a form then his perfectly 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.580
 quietly with their Komi machine gun 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.909
 even on pieces of paper punches you perfectly 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.270
 calm that is from this point 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.280
 not everything is bad now about the gun 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.450
 armored penetration boredom 116 millimeters 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.240
 Gold 167 damage 110 units but paste 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.729
 before the accuracy of 041 is not obtained, therefore 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.579
 the range of information is very large and the distance 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.740
 300 meters taken very, very bad 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.670
 shells fly protection all of a sudden 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.069
 T25 throws in 5 7 level battles that is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.289
 you meet with fives and sevens 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.200
 and there and there you frankly not 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.569
 just breaking through more or less is for 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.150
 level five for the seventh level we have 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.099
 there is gold but we lack accuracy 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.890
 Yes, and the time of sight two and a half 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.840
 seconds work in the style of st on this 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.879
 the car is not very good yes there is 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.290
 good maximum is good 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.480
 engine that allows this 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.910
 maximum speed in principle but dial 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.950
 chassis turning speed 30 degrees in 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.019
 second i have it like on big 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.700
 trolley ride which turns 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.950
 very reluctant or not even on 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.980
 trolley bus and tram and speed 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.549
 turning the tower is very bad 22 degrees in 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.799
 give me a sec 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.739
 Summarizing, we can say that German 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.840
 medium tank t 25 is not very easy to 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.170
 mastering the machine gay is very difficult 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.480
 lives in a random realia 90 and farther to 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.340
 and during its initial exit 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.579
 this car was far from the best 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.069
 from variable tanks until at that moment 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.739
 she had the best break through right now 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.169
 we have a nastier car su-85 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.269
 and yes and others i like american 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.349
 machines are not far behind in penetration am 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.329
 yes accept smart cars 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.430
 if we talk about and the linear machine 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.970
 of course there are a lot of tanks in general 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.799
 which are much better than t25 t25 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.470
 I was the second to fail, and which I 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.870
 bought in the game and frankly i'm on 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.169
 his gait regretted no less if 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.950
 no more than buying a tank t 14 and this 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.660
 there were times 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.640
 when goldust led real money and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.690
 thousand frankly not enough 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.819
 breakout on bb 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.890
 yes and now actually t25 remains 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.410
 I have no chance at all 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.019
 play a very, very difficult fan on it 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.060
 It does not work and even fill a lot of damage 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.769
 it means that to task 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.150
 nontriviality here on this 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.280
 cheerful note will end 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.840
