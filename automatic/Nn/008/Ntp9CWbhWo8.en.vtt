00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so far because i've actually got to play

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
so far because i've actually got to play
it<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:38.940> about<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it so they get to know a bit about the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
it so they get to know a bit about the
game<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:40.050> probably<00:00:40.379> haven't<00:00:40.770> seen

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
game which we probably haven't seen

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
game which we probably haven't seen
already<00:00:41.329> first<00:00:42.329> off<00:00:42.570> i<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.960> talk<00:00:43.110> about

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
already first off i want to talk about

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.740 
already first off i want to talk about
the<00:00:43.829> career<00:00:44.190> most<00:00:44.460> or<00:00:44.730> being<00:00:44.969> scrapped<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the career most or being scrapped in a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
the career most or being scrapped in a
way<00:00:45.899> i<00:00:45.930> think<00:00:46.260> being<00:00:46.410> replaced<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.980> pro

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
way i think being replaced by a pro

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.150 
way i think being replaced by a pro
season<00:00:48.149> mode<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.750> basically<00:00:49.710> instead<00:00:49.950> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
season mode so basically instead of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.709 
season mode so basically instead of
being<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.670> own<00:00:50.850> drive<00:00:51.180> you're<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> be

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
being your own drive you're going to be

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630 
being your own drive you're going to be
replacing<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> current<00:00:53.010> drivers<00:00:53.460> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
replacing one of the current drivers so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.180 
replacing one of the current drivers so
you<00:00:54.090> can't<00:00:54.329> make<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.840> driver<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.590> own<00:00:55.800> name

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you can't make your driver your own name

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.400 
you can't make your driver your own name
you<00:00:56.670> sort<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> replace<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.690> example<00:00:58.079> Lewis

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you sort of replace for example Lewis

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.860 
you sort of replace for example Lewis
Hamilton<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.579> Daniel<00:00:59.969> record<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.539> replace

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
Hamilton or Daniel record you replace

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
Hamilton or Daniel record you replace
them<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> season<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> that's<00:01:02.489> how<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
them in a season and that's how the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.690 
them in a season and that's how the
career<00:01:03.120> mode<00:01:03.270> works<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.430> might

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
career mode works so I know this might

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
career mode works so I know this might
sound<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.060> stupid<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.740> actually<00:01:07.740> quite

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
sound a bit stupid but actually quite

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.980 
sound a bit stupid but actually quite
like<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.640> crazy<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.210> own<00:01:09.330> character<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
like you know crazy my own character and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
like you know crazy my own character and
then<00:01:10.650> creating<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.400> choosing<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.090> own

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
then creating more choosing my own

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.149 
then creating more choosing my own
helmet<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.290> feels<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
helmet just actually feels like I'm the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.940 
helmet just actually feels like I'm the
person<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> wants<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> driver<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
person that wants to be the driver and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
person that wants to be the driver and
if<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.369> players<00:01:17.610> Lewis<00:01:17.970> Hamilton<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
if it just players Lewis Hamilton well I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.850 
if it just players Lewis Hamilton well I
could<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.320> quick<00:01:19.530> race

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
could just do that in a quick race

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
could just do that in a quick race
that's<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> only<00:01:20.850> sort<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> problem<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> have

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that's the only sort of problem I have

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
that's the only sort of problem I have
with<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.770> whole<00:01:23.070> thing<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.369> think<00:01:23.610> being<00:01:24.420> able

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
with this whole thing I think being able

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
with this whole thing I think being able
to<00:01:24.689> choose<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.110> own<00:01:25.140> driver<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.920> maybe

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
to choose your own driver and maybe

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
to choose your own driver and maybe
having<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.850> possibility<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.659> maybe<00:01:27.930> Eddie

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
having that possibility to maybe Eddie

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.569 
having that possibility to maybe Eddie
your<00:01:28.380> own<00:01:28.500> helmet<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.130> something<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
your own helmet you know something that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
your own helmet you know something that
could<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.790> done<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.150> next<00:01:30.299> gen<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
could have done in next gen it's just a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
could have done in next gen it's just a
bit<00:01:32.100> disappointed<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.820> can't<00:01:33.060> still<00:01:33.299> do

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
bit disappointed that you can't still do

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.819 
bit disappointed that you can't still do
that<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:33.869> anyway<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.650> hard

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that but anyway that's what it is hard

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.280 
that but anyway that's what it is hard
to<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.280> every<00:01:35.460> 1<00:01:35.549> 2015<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.840> away<00:01:36.930> from<00:01:37.229> the

which<00:03:04.910> is<00:03:05.060> kind<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.540> disappointing<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.470> ps4

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
which is kind of disappointing and ps4

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.820
