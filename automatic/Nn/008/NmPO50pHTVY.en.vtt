00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
that it actually it actually started to

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.830 
that it actually it actually started to
melt<00:01:37.969> the<00:01:38.149> plastic<00:01:38.359> and<00:01:40.299> you<00:01:41.299> know<00:01:41.389> I<00:01:41.450> don't

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
know if maybe I wasn't using it right or

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.419 
know if maybe I wasn't using it right or
maybe<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.479> just<00:01:44.509> got<00:01:44.659> overused<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:45.469> what<00:01:46.399> I

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
size and it's supposed to be universal

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.959 
size and it's supposed to be universal
and<00:02:00.469> I<00:02:00.590> have<00:02:00.739> tested<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.189> with<00:02:01.340> my<00:02:01.459> router<00:02:01.669> just

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
and I have tested it with my router just

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.449 
and I have tested it with my router just
to<00:02:02.029> make<00:02:02.179> sure<00:02:02.299> that<00:02:02.389> it<00:02:02.509> worked<00:02:02.779> and<00:02:03.279> it<00:02:04.279> does

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
to make sure that it worked and it does

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:05.889 
to make sure that it worked and it does
you<00:02:04.639> know<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.849> sits<00:02:05.060> right<00:02:05.179> in<00:02:05.299> there<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.719> then

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
you know it sits right in there and then

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.989 
you know it sits right in there and then
you<00:02:06.679> know<00:02:06.770> once<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.039> get<00:02:07.159> your<00:02:07.310> letters<00:02:07.819> down

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
you know once you get your letters down

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.880 
you know once you get your letters down
you<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.959> sort<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.259> follow<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.979> template<00:02:10.310> and

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
you just sort of follow the template and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.110 
you just sort of follow the template and
hopefully<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.010> works<00:02:12.129> pretty<00:02:12.370> well<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.849> know<00:02:12.909> on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
hopefully it works pretty well I know on

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.880 
hopefully it works pretty well I know on
the<00:02:13.209> on<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.720> other<00:02:13.870> letter<00:02:14.140> kit<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.650> had

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the on the other letter kit that I had

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.210 
the on the other letter kit that I had
uh<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.989> know<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> whole<00:02:17.590> thing<00:02:17.799> on<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.040> was

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
uh you know the whole thing on that was

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.600 
uh you know the whole thing on that was
a<00:02:18.250> nightmare<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:19.000> whole<00:02:19.150> set<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.659> the<00:02:20.610> piece

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
a nightmare the whole set up the piece

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.339 
a nightmare the whole set up the piece
is<00:02:21.790> working<00:02:22.209> just<00:02:22.989> kind<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.200> getting

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
is working just kind of getting

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.780 
is working just kind of getting
everything<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.739> work<00:02:23.799> it<00:02:24.159> works<00:02:24.400> all<00:02:24.549> this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
everything to work it works all this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.460 
everything to work it works all this
time<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.239> really<00:02:25.629> have<00:02:25.750> high<00:02:25.930> hopes<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.230> this

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
time I really have high hopes that this

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.920 
time I really have high hopes that this
one's<00:02:26.650> going<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:26.950> great<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:28.299> we'll

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
one's going to be great and that we'll

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.899 
one's going to be great and that we'll
be<00:02:28.959> able<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.290> lay<00:02:29.560> down<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.860> see<00:02:30.700> how<00:02:30.819> it

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
be able to just lay down and see how it

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.300 
be able to just lay down and see how it
works

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
works

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.410 
works
all<00:02:33.310> right<00:02:33.430> well<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.730> start<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.030> wanted<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.329> go

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
all right well to start I wanted to go

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.220 
all right well to start I wanted to go
ahead<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.659> make<00:02:35.170> sure<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.920> get<00:02:36.640> my<00:02:37.000> guide<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:37.900> my

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
ahead and make sure I get my guide on my

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.949 
ahead and make sure I get my guide on my
router<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:40.239> actually<00:02:40.390> sits<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.870> there

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
router and it it actually sits in there

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:41.819 
router and it it actually sits in there
just<00:02:41.110> perfect

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
just perfect

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.619 
just perfect
I<00:02:41.860> think<00:02:42.730> there<00:02:42.849> are<00:02:42.910> base<00:02:43.120> plates<00:02:43.359> you<00:02:43.480> can

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
I think there are base plates you can

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.050 
I think there are base plates you can
buy<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:44.230> fit<00:02:44.859> on<00:02:44.950> most<00:02:45.099> routers<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.790> make<00:02:45.910> it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
buy that fit on most routers to make it

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.970 
buy that fit on most routers to make it
you<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.209> more<00:02:46.450> Universal<00:02:47.019> this<00:02:47.680> one<00:02:47.829> works

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you know more Universal this one works

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.740 
you know more Universal this one works
pretty<00:02:48.010> well<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.430> recessed<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.480> just

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
pretty well it's recessed in and it just

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.360 
pretty well it's recessed in and it just
kind<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> sits<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.590> there<00:02:50.769> nice<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.010> snug<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
kind of sits in there nice and snug and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.470 
kind of sits in there nice and snug and
want<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.489> tighten<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:54.849> up<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.090> little<00:02:55.299> bit

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
want to tighten this up a little bit

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.059 
want to tighten this up a little bit
whether<00:02:56.440> we<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:58.230> well<00:02:59.230> go<00:02:59.440> ahead<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.950> I

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
whether we have that well go ahead and I

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.580 
whether we have that well go ahead and I
got<00:03:00.670> my<00:03:00.790> letters<00:03:01.150> laid<00:03:01.420> out<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:02.290> what<00:03:02.560> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
got my letters laid out and what I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.080 
got my letters laid out and what I
decided<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.099> would<00:03:03.250> do<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.459> actually<00:03:03.609> just<00:03:03.940> make

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
decided I would do is actually just make

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.599 
decided I would do is actually just make
a<00:03:04.120> sign<00:03:04.829> farmer<00:03:05.829> wet<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.340> my<00:03:06.430> website<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:08.609> and

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
a sign farmer wet for my website and and

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.830 
a sign farmer wet for my website and and
then<00:03:09.700> try<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.090> pull<00:03:10.299> out<00:03:10.329> as<00:03:10.480> many<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.780> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
then try to pull out as many of the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.000 
then try to pull out as many of the
letters<00:03:10.989> as<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.319> could<00:03:11.530> not<00:03:11.680> some<00:03:11.859> of<00:03:11.950> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
letters as I could not some of the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.699 
letters as I could not some of the
letters<00:03:12.159> I'm<00:03:12.730> going<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.030> need<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:14.409> use<00:03:14.530> over

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
letters I'm going to need to use over

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.520 
letters I'm going to need to use over
and<00:03:14.859> over<00:03:14.919> again<00:03:15.160> like<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.910> letter<00:03:16.090> O<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
and over again like the letter O and the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.780 
and over again like the letter O and the
kit<00:03:17.709> does<00:03:17.919> come<00:03:18.010> with<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.280> couple<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.609> those

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
kit does come with a couple of those

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.390 
kit does come with a couple of those
which<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.239> great<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.650> can't<00:03:20.980> lay<00:03:21.130> out<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
which is great but I can't lay out the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.990 
which is great but I can't lay out the
entire<00:03:21.790> pattern<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.930> one<00:03:23.889> piece<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:24.790> I'm<00:03:24.880> going

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
entire pattern in one piece so I'm going

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.220 
entire pattern in one piece so I'm going
to<00:03:25.030> have<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.239> actually<00:03:27.090> pull<00:03:28.090> up<00:03:28.120> our<00:03:28.569> route

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
to have to actually pull up our route

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.920 
to have to actually pull up our route
part<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.739> sign<00:03:29.980> take<00:03:30.940> up<00:03:31.090> some<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.900> my

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
part of the sign take up some of my

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.280 
part of the sign take up some of my
letters<00:03:32.349> and<00:03:32.530> then<00:03:32.620> lay<00:03:32.769> them<00:03:32.919> back<00:03:33.099> down<00:03:34.290> so

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
letters and then lay them back down so

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.839 
letters and then lay them back down so
after<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.799> get<00:03:35.889> all<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.069> letters<00:03:36.220> laid<00:03:36.639> down

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
after you get all the letters laid down

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.110 
after you get all the letters laid down
then<00:03:37.150> really<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.599> next<00:03:38.049> step<00:03:38.169> is<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:39.120> use

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
then really the next step is to just use

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.789 
then really the next step is to just use
some<00:03:40.150> painters<00:03:40.599> tape<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.930> just<00:03:41.349> hold<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.709> in

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
some painters tape to just hold it in

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.580 
some painters tape to just hold it in
place<00:03:42.129> so<00:03:42.579> that<00:03:43.569> when<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.900> route<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.290> things

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
place so that when you route it things

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.400 
place so that when you route it things
are<00:03:44.829> not<00:03:45.069> moving<00:03:45.280> around<00:03:45.579> on<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:49.169> just<00:03:50.169> need

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
are not moving around on you I just need

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.330 
are not moving around on you I just need
to<00:03:50.500> grab<00:03:50.680> my<00:03:50.739> router<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:51.569> go<00:03:52.569> out<00:03:53.129> so<00:03:54.129> when<00:03:54.250> it

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
to grab my router and go out so when it

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.180 
to grab my router and go out so when it
came<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:55.060> routing<00:03:55.449> the<00:03:55.540> sign<00:03:56.069> really<00:03:57.069> I

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
came to just routing the sign really I

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.830 
came to just routing the sign really I
think<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.579> secret<00:03:57.940> here<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.209> just<00:03:58.359> sort<00:03:58.720> of

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
think the secret here is to just sort of

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.069 
think the secret here is to just sort of
take<00:03:59.049> your<00:03:59.230> time<00:03:59.500> and<00:04:00.120> make<00:04:01.120> sure<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:01.930> you're

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
take your time and make sure that you're

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.520 
take your time and make sure that you're
really<00:04:02.760> looking<00:04:03.760> at<00:04:04.060> each<00:04:04.599> letter<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.319> know

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
really looking at each letter you know

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.949 
really looking at each letter you know
as<00:04:05.650> close<00:04:05.769> as<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.129> can<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:07.540> last<00:04:07.629> thing<00:04:07.870> you

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
as close as you can the last thing you

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.259 
as close as you can the last thing you
want<00:04:08.139> to<00:04:08.169> do<00:04:08.319> is<00:04:08.560> sort<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.919> push<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.060> on<00:04:10.239> a

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
want to do is sort of push that on a

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.210 
want to do is sort of push that on a
pawned<00:04:10.569> router<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.349> maybe<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:11.709> go<00:04:11.889> all<00:04:12.069> the

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
pawned router and maybe not go all the

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.720 
pawned router and maybe not go all the
way<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.989> ruin<00:04:13.989> one<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.560> your<00:04:14.680> templates<00:04:15.099> or

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
way and ruin one of your templates or

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.490 
way and ruin one of your templates or
possibly<00:04:16.419> even<00:04:16.510> your<00:04:16.780> bed<00:04:16.989> if<00:04:17.229> you're<00:04:17.349> not

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
possibly even your bed if you're not

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.990 
possibly even your bed if you're not
down<00:04:17.680> far<00:04:18.130> enough

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
down far enough

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.930 
down far enough
so<00:04:20.570> after<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:20.989> finished<00:04:21.340> running<00:04:22.340> up<00:04:22.580> letters

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
so after I finished running up letters

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.730 
so after I finished running up letters
on<00:04:23.060> my<00:04:23.180> sign<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.480> decided<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.200> want<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.560> to

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
on my sign I decided that I want it to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.120 
on my sign I decided that I want it to
round<00:04:25.610> over<00:04:25.820> all<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.420> edges<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.140> there's<00:04:28.070> a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
round over all the edges and there's a

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.500 
round over all the edges and there's a
lot<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.400> options<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.880> can<00:04:29.000> do<00:04:29.120> on<00:04:29.300> how<00:04:29.450> you

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
lot of options you can do on how you

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.900 
lot of options you can do on how you
want<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.170> look<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:31.310> chose<00:04:31.640> just<00:04:31.790> a

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
want that to look and I chose just a

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.690 
want that to look and I chose just a
simple<00:04:32.270> round<00:04:32.390> over<00:04:32.720> for<00:04:32.930> mine<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:37.280> after

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
simple round over for mine so after

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.540 
simple round over for mine so after
getting<00:04:38.060> everything<00:04:38.300> done<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.920> did<00:04:39.920> a<00:04:39.950> just<00:04:40.430> a

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
getting everything done I did a just a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.810 
getting everything done I did a just a
pretty<00:04:40.910> standard<00:04:41.420> sanding<00:04:41.930> across<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.820> the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
pretty standard sanding across the the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.060 
pretty standard sanding across the the
front<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> sign<00:04:45.230> as<00:04:45.470> well<00:04:45.620> as<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.860> back

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
front of the sign as well as the back

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.090 
front of the sign as well as the back
and<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:47.540> you<00:04:48.020> know<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.140> only<00:04:48.320> did<00:04:48.560> two<00:04:48.590> grit<00:04:48.980> to

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
and I you know I only did two grit to

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.940 
and I you know I only did two grit to
paper<00:04:49.310> on<00:04:49.520> this<00:04:49.640> one<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:50.240> almost<00:04:51.110> always<00:04:51.560> do

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
paper on this one I almost always do

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.800 
paper on this one I almost always do
three<00:04:52.310> if<00:04:52.580> it's<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:53.240> know<00:04:53.360> an<00:04:53.480> heirloom

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
three if it's you know an heirloom

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.910 
three if it's you know an heirloom
project<00:04:54.850> this<00:04:55.850> one<00:04:56.060> yeah<00:04:56.480> I<00:04:56.530> maybe<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.620> took<00:04:57.710> a

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
project this one yeah I maybe I took a

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.040 
project this one yeah I maybe I took a
short<00:04:58.130> step<00:04:58.430> there<00:04:58.700> but<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.000> think<00:04:59.420> you<00:04:59.570> can<00:04:59.720> get

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
short step there but I think you can get

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.240 
short step there but I think you can get
away<00:05:00.140> with<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:01.780> it's<00:05:02.780> done<00:05:03.080> just<00:05:03.980> going<00:05:04.190> to

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
away with that it's done just going to

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.970 
away with that it's done just going to
paint<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.730> but<00:05:05.450> uh<00:05:05.590> also<00:05:06.590> going<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.740> come<00:05:06.860> in

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
paint it but uh also going to come in

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.250 
paint it but uh also going to come in
and<00:05:07.070> drill<00:05:07.430> some<00:05:07.820> holes<00:05:08.270> in<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.780> back<00:05:08.960> so<00:05:09.200> that

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
and drill some holes in the back so that

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.350 
and drill some holes in the back so that
they<00:05:09.500> can<00:05:09.650> hang<00:05:09.950> and<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:10.940> have<00:05:11.120> am<00:05:11.570> oh<00:05:12.070> I<00:05:13.360> have

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
they can hang and I have am oh I have

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.610 
they can hang and I have am oh I have
this<00:05:14.450> little<00:05:14.750> template<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.140> I<00:05:15.260> bought<00:05:15.500> from

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
this little template that I bought from

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.940 
this little template that I bought from
rock<00:05:15.860> but<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:16.130> really<00:05:16.340> don't<00:05:16.520> need<00:05:16.669> this<00:05:16.940> but

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
rock but you really don't need this but

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.130 
rock but you really don't need this but
I<00:05:18.950> kind<00:05:19.580> of<00:05:19.610> have<00:05:19.760> maybe<00:05:20.150> suckered<00:05:20.600> into<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:21.050> I

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
I kind of have maybe suckered into it I

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.990 
I kind of have maybe suckered into it I
it<00:05:21.350> just<00:05:21.380> looked<00:05:21.680> like<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.830> good<00:05:21.980> idea<00:05:22.130> and<00:05:22.610> it

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
it just looked like a good idea and it

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.840 
it just looked like a good idea and it
does<00:05:23.150> work<00:05:23.360> pretty<00:05:23.600> well<00:05:24.280> it's<00:05:25.280> nice<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.580> you

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
does work pretty well it's nice that you

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.850 
does work pretty well it's nice that you
can<00:05:25.880> just<00:05:26.120> kind<00:05:26.300> of<00:05:26.360> line<00:05:26.540> it<00:05:26.690> up<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.260> guess

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
can just kind of line it up and I guess

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.659 
can just kind of line it up and I guess
you<00:05:27.950> don't<00:05:28.010> have<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.250> mess<00:05:28.430> with<00:05:28.460> the

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
you don't have to mess with the

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.270 
you don't have to mess with the
attaching<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.480> board<00:05:29.720> to<00:05:29.930> use<00:05:30.050> as<00:05:30.200> a<00:05:30.230> guide<00:05:30.610> and

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
attaching a board to use as a guide and

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.110 
attaching a board to use as a guide and
it's<00:05:34.280> quick<00:05:34.550> too

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
it's quick too

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.690 
it's quick too
it<00:05:35.840> comes<00:05:36.020> with<00:05:36.169> two<00:05:36.350> different<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.830> slot<00:05:37.400> so

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
it comes with two different a slot so

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.280 
it comes with two different a slot so
that<00:05:37.850> you<00:05:38.000> have<00:05:38.090> two<00:05:38.270> there<00:05:38.450> right<00:05:38.630> by<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.050> or

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
that you have two there right by and or

paint it black and I actually decided to

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.830

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
which I had always kind of thought you

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.510 
which I had always kind of thought you
you<00:06:39.330> just<00:06:39.540> don't<00:06:39.720> do<00:06:39.870> that<00:06:39.900> and<00:06:40.440> I<00:06:41.190> found<00:06:41.430> a

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
you just don't do that and I found a

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.250 
you just don't do that and I found a
website<00:06:41.940> that<00:06:42.090> actually<00:06:42.480> recommended<00:06:43.140> that

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
website that actually recommended that

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.190 
website that actually recommended that
you<00:06:43.550> apply<00:06:44.550> a<00:06:44.580> coat<00:06:44.910> of<00:06:44.940> lacquer<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.750> single

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
you apply a coat of lacquer a single

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.130 
you apply a coat of lacquer a single
coat<00:06:46.380> a<00:06:46.410> light<00:06:46.770> coat<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:48.090> then<00:06:48.720> you<00:06:48.870> go<00:06:48.990> back

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
coat a light coat and then you go back

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.400 
coat a light coat and then you go back
and<00:06:49.290> you<00:06:49.380> paint<00:06:49.680> right<00:06:50.040> on<00:06:50.220> top<00:06:50.520> of<00:06:50.550> that<00:06:51.410> you

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
and you paint right on top of that you

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.020 
and you paint right on top of that you
let<00:06:52.620> it<00:06:52.740> sit<00:06:53.040> and<00:06:53.340> then<00:06:53.460> you<00:06:53.490> apply<00:06:53.790> another

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
let it sit and then you apply another

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.470 
let it sit and then you apply another
coat<00:06:54.390> of<00:06:54.510> lacquer<00:06:54.690> on<00:06:54.990> top<00:06:55.260> of<00:06:55.470> that<00:06:56.270> so<00:06:57.270> I've

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480 
coat of lacquer on top of that so I've

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.810 
coat of lacquer on top of that so I've
tried<00:06:58.020> that<00:06:58.140> once<00:06:58.380> before<00:06:58.590> on<00:06:58.830> it<00:06:59.310> on<00:06:59.460> another

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
tried that once before on it on another

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.000 
tried that once before on it on another
thing<00:07:00.060> and<00:07:00.480> it<00:07:00.630> actually<00:07:01.260> at<00:07:01.380> work<00:07:01.590> I<00:07:01.890> mean

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
thing and it actually at work I mean

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.580 
thing and it actually at work I mean
everything<00:07:02.280> looked<00:07:02.460> fine<00:07:02.960> it<00:07:03.960> wasn't<00:07:04.290> a<00:07:04.320> sign

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
everything looked fine it wasn't a sign

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.750 
everything looked fine it wasn't a sign
that<00:07:04.650> I<00:07:04.950> was<00:07:05.160> doing<00:07:05.960> but<00:07:06.960> it<00:07:07.080> held<00:07:07.230> together

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
that I was doing but it held together

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.400 
that I was doing but it held together
for<00:07:08.760> this<00:07:08.910> one<00:07:09.120> I<00:07:09.330> honestly<00:07:10.050> I<00:07:10.140> don't<00:07:10.200> think

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
for this one I honestly I don't think

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.270 
for this one I honestly I don't think
I'm<00:07:10.470> going<00:07:10.590> to<00:07:10.680> put<00:07:10.800> another<00:07:10.890> layer<00:07:11.220> of

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
I'm going to put another layer of

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.400 
I'm going to put another layer of
lacquer<00:07:11.550> on<00:07:11.880> top<00:07:12.120> of<00:07:12.330> it<00:07:12.450> because<00:07:12.750> it's<00:07:13.170> going

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
lacquer on top of it because it's going

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.990 
lacquer on top of it because it's going
to<00:07:13.470> stay<00:07:13.620> on<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:13.890> inside<00:07:14.040> I'm<00:07:14.670> not<00:07:14.700> going<00:07:14.940> to

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
to stay on the inside I'm not going to

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.770 
to stay on the inside I'm not going to
have<00:07:15.120> it<00:07:16.040> the<00:07:17.040> outdoors<00:07:17.520> so<00:07:17.970> I<00:07:18.000> think<00:07:18.540> it'll<00:07:18.660> be

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
have it the outdoors so I think it'll be

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.240 
have it the outdoors so I think it'll be
pretty<00:07:18.930> well<00:07:19.140> protected<00:07:21.770> alright<00:07:22.770> guys<00:07:22.950> well

pretty good and you know I really can't

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.240 
pretty good and you know I really can't
say<00:07:29.550> that's<00:07:29.790> about<00:07:30.030> via<00:07:30.360> the<00:07:31.320> rock<00:07:31.740> or<00:07:31.980> sign

say that's about via the rock or sign

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.430 
say that's about via the rock or sign
maker<00:07:32.490> kit<00:07:32.790> it's<00:07:33.090> you<00:07:33.780> know<00:07:33.870> it<00:07:33.960> really<00:07:34.110> was

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
maker kit it's you know it really was

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.120 
maker kit it's you know it really was
easy<00:07:34.770> and<00:07:35.040> and<00:07:35.370> compared<00:07:36.000> to<00:07:36.180> the<00:07:36.560> the<00:07:37.560> other

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.130 
easy and and compared to the the other

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.800 
easy and and compared to the the other
side<00:07:38.250> making<00:07:38.640> kit<00:07:38.910> that<00:07:39.060> I<00:07:39.150> that<00:07:39.480> I've<00:07:39.570> used

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810 
side making kit that I that I've used

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.110 
side making kit that I that I've used
before<00:07:40.020> in<00:07:40.200> the<00:07:40.260> past<00:07:40.470> now<00:07:41.340> this<00:07:41.520> one<00:07:41.700> this<00:07:41.910> one

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 
before in the past now this one this one

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.740 
before in the past now this one this one
really<00:07:42.510> was<00:07:42.720> simple<00:07:43.170> so<00:07:43.470> I<00:07:44.090> recommend<00:07:45.090> it<00:07:45.240> and

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.750 
really was simple so I recommend it and

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.470 
really was simple so I recommend it and
I<00:07:46.650> think<00:07:46.890> my<00:07:47.010> only<00:07:47.220> criticism<00:07:47.580> really<00:07:48.090> is<00:07:48.300> just

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:48.480 
I think my only criticism really is just

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.210 
I think my only criticism really is just
that<00:07:48.600> the<00:07:48.720> the<00:07:48.750> guide<00:07:49.290> bushing<00:07:49.590> that

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220 
that the the guide bushing that

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.550 
that the the guide bushing that
with<00:07:50.370> it<00:07:50.610> it's<00:07:51.330> a<00:07:51.450> plastic<00:07:51.690> one<00:07:52.110> and<00:07:52.320> so<00:07:52.530> I

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 
with it it's a plastic one and so I

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.650 
with it it's a plastic one and so I
would<00:07:52.920> definitely<00:07:53.280> look<00:07:53.850> into<00:07:54.030> buying

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 
would definitely look into buying

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.890
