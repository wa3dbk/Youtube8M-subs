 Y 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.930
 egg custard 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.650
 the ingredients are vanilla milk 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 sugar and eggs to prepare the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 liquid candy we put to heat the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 sugar in a saucepan as the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 candy is melting let's go 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 moving the bucket it is important that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 let's use any utensil to move the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.210
 sugar once all the sugar has been 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 we melted the candy 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 resulting in the bottom of the molds 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.100
 for the custards we split half a sheet of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.100
 vanilla and cut it lengthwise 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.330
 in a saucepan we put the milk to heat 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.640
 vanilla and sugar 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.910
 stir for the sugar to fall apart 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.920
 and we bring the milk to a boil when 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.950
 break to boil away from the saucepan 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.690
 fire and we reserve warm abundant 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.930
 water in a pot to have it prepared 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.460
 for the water bath we put the eggs in 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.460
 a bowl and we beat them 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.320
 then we throw the little milk to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.560
 little in the bowl by passing it to 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.229
 through a colander 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.939
 as we pour milk we beat for 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.939
 that it is incorporated into the eggs 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.650
 once we have incorporated all the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.330
 milk we distribute the mixture between 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:57.630
 molds for puddings left in fill 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.090
 approximately one centimeter of the mold 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.509
 we cover each mold with a piece of paper 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.509
 of aluminum 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 We put the molds in the fountain for 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.240
 oven we add the water that we put to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.300
 heat up to cover half of the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.940
 molds we take the source to the oven and 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.340
 we bake for 30 minutes at 180 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.590
 degrees 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.330
 we remove the molds from the oven and 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.590
 we check with a knife if the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.590
 flans are set 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.050
 Once ready, we take out the custards from the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.270
 source and let cool 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.130
 once cold we put them in the fridge 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.820
 where we will let them rest for 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.820
 several hours 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.560
 we can already unmold and enjoy 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.560
 our homemade custards 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.489
 We hope that this recipe has 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.970
