00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.950 
technology for many areas of science
there<00:00:28.699> are<00:00:28.730> two<00:00:28.970> really<00:00:29.300> good<00:00:29.480> reasons<00:00:29.810> why<00:00:29.869> we

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
there are two really good reasons why we

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.589 
there are two really good reasons why we
wish<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.320> culture<00:00:30.650> cells<00:00:30.859> in<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:31.070> lab<00:00:31.220> like<00:00:31.250> this

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
wish to culture cells in a lab like this

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.630 
wish to culture cells in a lab like this
firstly<00:00:32.599> we<00:00:33.440> want<00:00:33.560> to<00:00:33.710> culture<00:00:34.130> cells<00:00:34.160> on

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
firstly we want to culture cells on

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.640 
firstly we want to culture cells on
materials<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.540> predict<00:00:35.840> how<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.110> living<00:00:36.350> body

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
materials to predict how the living body

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.860 
materials to predict how the living body
would<00:00:37.250> respond<00:00:37.700> to<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:37.940> material<00:00:38.510> this

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
would respond to that material this

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.570 
would respond to that material this
often<00:00:39.170> cuts<00:00:39.620> out<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.890> use<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.130> animals<00:00:40.460> in

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
often cuts out the use of animals in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.670 
often cuts out the use of animals in
research<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:41.270> if<00:00:41.750> we're<00:00:41.870> using<00:00:41.960> human<00:00:42.440> cells

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
research and if we're using human cells

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.250 
research and if we're using human cells
there's<00:00:43.370> a<00:00:43.400> much<00:00:43.700> clearer<00:00:44.060> idea<00:00:44.270> about<00:00:45.020> how

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
there's a much clearer idea about how

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.930 
there's a much clearer idea about how
the<00:00:45.320> body's<00:00:45.740> going<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:46.010> respond<00:00:46.400> to<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.760> new

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
the body's going to respond to a new

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.210 
the body's going to respond to a new
material<00:00:47.620> secondly<00:00:48.620> of<00:00:48.710> course<00:00:48.950> I<00:00:49.070> mentioned

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
material secondly of course I mentioned

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.250 
material secondly of course I mentioned
earlier<00:00:49.670> there's<00:00:50.150> this<00:00:50.270> fantastic<00:00:50.630> new<00:00:51.050> field

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
earlier there's this fantastic new field

therapy that can be used to address when
the<00:01:14.149> body<00:01:14.299> goes<00:01:14.659> wrong<00:01:14.990> we<00:01:15.679> do<00:01:15.829> work<00:01:16.070> with

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the body goes wrong we do work with

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.219 
the body goes wrong we do work with
industries<00:01:16.820> as<00:01:17.000> well<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.630> good<00:01:17.750> example

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
industries as well and so a good example

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.770 
industries as well and so a good example
is<00:01:18.649> in<00:01:18.950> their<00:01:19.280> own<00:01:19.460> research<00:01:19.909> for<00:01:20.270> nerve

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
guides to repair injury and so we have

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.260 
guides to repair injury and so we have

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
challenges in tissue engineering of skin

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.349 
challenges in tissue engineering of skin
are<00:01:37.039> actually<00:01:37.399> very<00:01:37.549> interesting<00:01:38.149> people

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
are actually very interesting people

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.419 
are actually very interesting people
have<00:01:38.569> been<00:01:38.749> culturing<00:01:39.259> skin<00:01:39.560> cells<00:01:39.950> since<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
have been culturing skin cells since the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.880 
have been culturing skin cells since the
early<00:01:40.700> 80s<00:01:40.999> so<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.719> question<00:01:42.140> isn't<00:01:42.289> can<00:01:42.590> you

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
early 80s so the question isn't can you

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.069 
early 80s so the question isn't can you
do<00:01:43.069> it<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:43.460> will<00:01:43.789> they<00:01:43.909> work<00:01:44.149> but<00:01:44.509> how<00:01:44.749> can<00:01:44.810> you

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
do it and will they work but how can you

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.330 
do it and will they work but how can you
make<00:01:45.289> it<00:01:45.469> convenient<00:01:46.039> for<00:01:46.069> patients

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
make it convenient for patients

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.669 
make it convenient for patients
convenient<00:01:47.270> for<00:01:47.420> surgeons<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.109> affordable

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
convenient for surgeons and affordable

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:49.569 
convenient for surgeons and affordable
and<00:01:48.799> that's<00:01:48.979> actually<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:49.399> biggest

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
and that's actually the biggest

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.249 
and that's actually the biggest
challenge<00:01:50.030> as<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:50.179> might<00:01:50.389> imagine<00:01:50.539> we've

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
challenge as you might imagine we've

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.139 
challenge as you might imagine we've
been<00:01:51.439> working<00:01:51.829> with<00:01:51.859> the<00:01:52.039> burn<00:01:52.189> surgeons<00:01:52.819> in

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
been working with the burn surgeons in

what they've done traditionally is make
synthetic<00:02:14.360> ligaments<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.350> they've<00:02:15.440> been

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
synthetic ligaments and they've been

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.900 
synthetic ligaments and they've been
very<00:02:15.620> very<00:02:16.130> successful

actually make nerve guy it's a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.070 
actually make nerve guy it's a
completely<00:02:27.980> different<00:02:28.190> area<00:02:28.550> for<00:02:29.000> them<00:02:29.210> but

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
completely different area for them but

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.300 
completely different area for them but
something<00:02:30.350> with<00:02:30.650> which<00:02:30.860> we've<00:02:31.070> got<00:02:31.280> a

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
something with which we've got a

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.880 
something with which we've got a
multitude<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.880> expertise<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.690> our<00:02:33.320> group<00:02:33.680> has

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
multitude of expertise in our group has

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.680 
multitude of expertise in our group has
a<00:02:33.950> long<00:02:34.250> experience<00:02:34.700> working<00:02:35.030> with<00:02:35.210> industry

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
a long experience working with industry

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.960 
a long experience working with industry
this<00:02:35.960> is<00:02:36.020> still<00:02:36.350> very<00:02:36.380> much<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:37.220> cutting<00:02:37.820> edge

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
this is still very much the cutting edge

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.850 
this is still very much the cutting edge
where<00:02:38.210> industry<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:38.720> engaged<00:02:39.080> because<00:02:39.560> it's

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
where industry is engaged because it's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.610 
where industry is engaged because it's
this<00:02:40.340> device<00:02:40.640> industry<00:02:41.270> that's<00:02:41.720> involved<00:02:42.470> in

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
this device industry that's involved in

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.440 
this device industry that's involved in
treating<00:02:43.400> millions<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.880> patients<00:02:44.030> worldwide

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
treating millions of patients worldwide

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.570 
treating millions of patients worldwide
and<00:02:45.080> often<00:02:45.470> working<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:45.860> small<00:02:46.130> companies

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
and often working with small companies

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.370 
and often working with small companies
this<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.270> really<00:02:47.540> good<00:02:47.660> example<00:02:48.110> of<00:02:48.170> how<00:02:48.320> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
this is a really good example of how the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.290 
this is a really good example of how the
university<00:02:48.860> can<00:02:49.190> offer<00:02:49.310> tremendous<00:02:49.610> benefit

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
university can offer tremendous benefit

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.300 
university can offer tremendous benefit
because<00:02:50.900> small<00:02:51.110> companies<00:02:51.560> don't

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
because small companies don't

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.220 
because small companies don't
necessarily<00:02:53.000> have<00:02:53.150> large<00:02:53.450> facilities<00:02:54.020> on

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
necessarily have large facilities on

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.810 
necessarily have large facilities on
their<00:02:54.380> back<00:02:54.530> door<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.980> we're<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.550> chef<00:02:55.730> at

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
their back door so we're a chef at

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.450 
their back door so we're a chef at
University<00:02:56.450> has<00:02:56.870> every<00:02:57.710> kind<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.190> research

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
here we have cell culture for the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.910 
here we have cell culture for the
evaluation<00:03:02.120> device<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.870> bad<00:03:02.960> ability<00:03:03.350> but<00:03:03.800> we

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
evaluation device and bad ability but we

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.950 
evaluation device and bad ability but we
have<00:03:04.090> laboratories<00:03:05.090> for<00:03:05.240> material<00:03:05.570> science

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
and ultimately we can even go through

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.430 
and ultimately we can even go through
the<00:03:10.550> clinical<00:03:10.880> evaluation<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.990> hospital

principal investigators of which I am

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.800 
principal investigators of which I am
one<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.280> have<00:03:37.550> main<00:03:37.730> research<00:03:38.090> group<00:03:38.420> which<00:03:38.660> is

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
one I have main research group which is

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.010 
one I have main research group which is
about<00:03:39.020> 15<00:03:39.500> people<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:41.060> effectively<00:03:41.900> the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
about 15 people and so effectively the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.750 
about 15 people and so effectively the
way<00:03:42.140> in<00:03:42.290> which<00:03:42.440> laboratory<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.010> organized<00:03:43.490> is

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
way in which laboratory is organized is

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.550 
way in which laboratory is organized is
according<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.690> techniques<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.200> people

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
according to the techniques that people

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.330 
according to the techniques that people
need<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.920> do

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
need to do

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.830 
need to do
what<00:03:46.520> do<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.640> see<00:03:46.790> behind<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.300> is<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> suite<00:03:47.810> of

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
what do you see behind you is a suite of

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.860 
what do you see behind you is a suite of
clean<00:03:48.200> rooms<00:03:48.440> now<00:03:49.220> these<00:03:49.459> as<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.970> dials<00:03:50.420> imply

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
clean rooms now these as the dials imply

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.560 
clean rooms now these as the dials imply
I've<00:03:51.140> got<00:03:51.350> complex<00:03:51.920> air<00:03:52.190> flows<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.790> they're

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
I've got complex air flows and they're

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.330 
I've got complex air flows and they're
designed<00:03:54.020> so<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.410> you<00:03:54.590> can<00:03:54.860> culture

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
designed so that you can culture

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.340 
designed so that you can culture
patients<00:03:55.880> skin<00:03:56.120> cells<00:03:56.480> under<00:03:56.989> very<00:03:57.260> very

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
patients skin cells under very very

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.560 
patients skin cells under very very
clean<00:03:57.860> conditions<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.970> would<00:03:59.090> allow<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.420> to

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
clean conditions that would allow you to

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.449 
clean conditions that would allow you to
get<00:03:59.780> accreditation<00:04:00.620> by<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.860> Department<00:04:01.400> of

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
get accreditation by the Department of

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.820 
get accreditation by the Department of
Health<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.510> cells<00:04:02.750> are<00:04:02.989> fit<00:04:03.230> for<00:04:03.260> use<00:04:03.620> on

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
Health so the cells are fit for use on

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.890 
Health so the cells are fit for use on
patients<00:04:04.010> but<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:04.910> think<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.239> key<00:04:05.450> strengths

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
patients but I think the key strengths

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.420 
patients but I think the key strengths
of<00:04:06.020> our<00:04:06.140> research<00:04:06.440> group<00:04:06.680> are<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.190> we<00:04:07.310> are

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
of our research group are that we are

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.030 
of our research group are that we are
interdisciplinary<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.989> at<00:04:09.140> one<00:04:09.350> end<00:04:09.380> we<00:04:09.739> start

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
interdisciplinary so at one end we start

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.770 
interdisciplinary so at one end we start
off<00:04:10.250> with<00:04:10.459> working<00:04:11.000> with<00:04:11.120> clinicians<00:04:11.450> to

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
off with working with clinicians to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.690 
off with working with clinicians to
define<00:04:12.140> what<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.440> problem<00:04:12.800> is<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.550> actually

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
define what the problem is and actually

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.340 
define what the problem is and actually
this<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.209> hardest<00:04:14.450> bit<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:15.050> thing<00:04:15.230> that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
this is the hardest bit the thing that

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.510 
this is the hardest bit the thing that
you<00:04:15.410> think<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.800> problem<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.190> not<00:04:16.310> often

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
you think is the problem is not often

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.180 
you think is the problem is not often
the<00:04:16.640> problem

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
the problem

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.370 
the problem
and<00:04:17.280> then<00:04:17.790> we<00:04:17.940> have<00:04:18.120> cell<00:04:18.390> biologists<00:04:19.110> tissue

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
and then we have cell biologists tissue

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.650 
and then we have cell biologists tissue

to actually tackle some of these
pharmaceutical<00:05:24.480> challenges<00:05:25.050> it<00:05:25.350> also<00:05:25.500> gave

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
view of a problem and therefore using

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.680 
view of a problem and therefore using

together to tackle the challenges and
now<00:05:38.220> it's<00:05:38.460> not<00:05:38.669> just<00:05:39.030> allows<00:05:39.930> us<00:05:40.230> to<00:05:40.470> other

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
now it's not just allows us to other

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.280 
now it's not just allows us to other
four<00:05:41.430> times<00:05:41.700> more<00:05:41.880> resources<00:05:42.390> at<00:05:42.540> like<00:05:42.840> 40

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
four times more resources at like 40

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.659 
four times more resources at like 40
times<00:05:43.470> more<00:05:43.620> resources<00:05:44.070> because<00:05:44.340> they

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
times more resources because they

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.970 
times more resources because they
combine<00:05:45.090> effective<00:05:45.930> at<00:05:46.080> 310<00:05:46.470> times<00:05:46.740> better

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
combine effective at 310 times better

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.940 
combine effective at 310 times better
than<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.900> University<00:05:49.470> is<00:05:49.530> a<00:05:49.590> very<00:05:49.620> good

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
than the University is a very good

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.320 
than the University is a very good
environment<00:05:50.250> in<00:05:50.640> which<00:05:50.730> to<00:05:50.940> do<00:05:51.090> that

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
environment in which to do that

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.320 
environment in which to do that

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
because it has invested in for example

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.780 
because it has invested in for example
just<00:05:54.960> building<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.890> suite<00:05:56.190> of<00:05:56.310> clean<00:05:56.550> rooms
