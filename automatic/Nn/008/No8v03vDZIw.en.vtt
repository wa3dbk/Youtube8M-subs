00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
I've got so I am really going to pin

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.530 
I've got so I am really going to pin
this<00:02:54.000> down<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.720> am<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.590> loading<00:02:56.370> look<00:02:57.210> at<00:02:57.360> how

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
this down I am just loading look at how

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.380 
this down I am just loading look at how
thin<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.100> question<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.180> hard

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
thin this is question I think it's hard

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.580 
thin this is question I think it's hard
to<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:01.490> wave<00:03:02.490> eat<00:03:02.850> more<00:03:03.180> water<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.840> want<00:03:04.290> as

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
to see wave eat more water I want as

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.320 
to see wave eat more water I want as
little<00:03:04.860> pain<00:03:05.730> as<00:03:05.790> possible<00:03:06.260> for<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> I'm

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
little pain as possible for this so I'm

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.440 
little pain as possible for this so I'm
going<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.690> begin<00:03:09.870> by<00:03:10.760> stroking<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.910> over<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
going to begin by stroking it over the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.630 
going to begin by stroking it over the
piece<00:03:12.860> getting<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.100> into<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:15.030> corners

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640

it's<00:03:20.640> best<00:03:20.940> thing<00:03:21.180> around<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.600> lettering

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.010 

because<00:03:27.590> that's<00:03:27.890> what<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.310> want<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:29.060> bring

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.900 
forth a little bit of this race finish
planning<00:06:23.450> so<00:06:24.320> I'm<00:06:24.530> going<00:06:24.860> to<00:06:25.010> come<00:06:25.250> and<00:06:25.610> lock

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
planning so I'm going to come and lock

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:35.020 
planning so I'm going to come and lock
my<00:06:26.510> stencil<00:06:27.820> back<00:06:28.820> in<00:06:29.090> place<00:06:33.070> over<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:34.250> race

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
my stencil back in place over the race

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.540 
my stencil back in place over the race
stenciling<00:06:35.870> and<00:06:36.729> I'm<00:06:37.729> just<00:06:37.970> going<00:06:38.150> to<00:06:38.270> go<00:06:38.419> into

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.490 

this<00:06:44.020> little<00:06:45.020> bit<00:06:45.380> of<00:06:46.630> wash<00:06:47.630> to<00:06:47.930> paint<00:06:48.260> I've

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
this little bit of wash to paint I've

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.850 
this little bit of wash to paint I've
got<00:06:48.800> and<00:06:50.950> just<00:06:51.950> lightly<00:06:52.310> skim<00:06:52.970> over<00:06:53.860> the

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
got and just lightly skim over the

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.100 
got and just lightly skim over the
stencil<00:06:55.220> and<00:06:56.180> let<00:06:56.539> that<00:06:56.780> just<00:06:56.840> bring<00:06:57.560> forth

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
stencil and let that just bring forth

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.409 
stencil and let that just bring forth
the<00:07:00.110> stencil<00:07:00.650> just<00:07:01.130> a<00:07:01.340> tad<00:07:01.669> more<00:07:04.300> we<00:07:05.300> don't

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
the stencil just a tad more we don't

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.700 
the stencil just a tad more we don't
want<00:07:05.660> much

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.159 

now<00:07:09.280> this<00:07:09.580> would<00:07:09.820> be<00:07:11.639> an<00:07:12.639> easy<00:07:13.060> process<00:07:13.449> if

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
now this would be an easy process if

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.070 
now this would be an easy process if
you're<00:07:14.320> doing<00:07:14.770> just<00:07:15.220> some<00:07:15.550> tiny<00:07:15.970> detail<00:07:16.750> work

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
you're doing just some tiny detail work

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.610 
you're doing just some tiny detail work
on<00:07:17.350> maybe<00:07:18.310> the<00:07:18.580> side<00:07:18.880> or<00:07:19.330> the<00:07:19.660> front<00:07:19.840> of<00:07:20.199> a<00:07:20.289> deer

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
on maybe the side or the front of a deer

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.290 
on maybe the side or the front of a deer
or<00:07:20.860> on<00:07:21.370> furniture<00:07:23.220> but<00:07:24.220> I<00:07:24.280> think<00:07:24.639> this<00:07:24.850> would

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300 
or on furniture but I think this would

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.939 
or on furniture but I think this would
work<00:07:25.509> best<00:07:25.960> as<00:07:26.229> a<00:07:26.259> decorative<00:07:26.949> type<00:07:27.910> look

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:28.949 
work best as a decorative type look

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.409 
work best as a decorative type look
rather<00:07:29.949> than<00:07:30.250> trying<00:07:30.550> to<00:07:30.669> do<00:07:30.850> a<00:07:30.880> large<00:07:31.180> piece

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.419 
rather than trying to do a large piece

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:35.790 
rather than trying to do a large piece
of<00:07:31.449> furniture<00:07:31.630> this<00:07:32.350> way<00:07:32.620> there<00:07:33.100> we<00:07:33.430> go<00:07:34.800> see

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
of furniture this way there we go see

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.010 
of furniture this way there we go see
how<00:07:35.979> that<00:07:36.039> just<00:07:36.220> brought<00:07:36.639> it<00:07:36.820> forth<00:07:37.150> just<00:07:37.750> a

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
how that just brought it forth just a

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.159 
how that just brought it forth just a
little<00:07:38.590> bit<00:07:38.770> more<00:07:40.050> that<00:07:41.050> is<00:07:41.289> huge<00:07:41.740> just<00:07:42.130> I<00:07:42.280> mean

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:43.169 
little bit more that is huge just I mean

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:47.159 
little bit more that is huge just I mean
really<00:07:44.169> almost<00:07:44.560> no<00:07:45.220> paint<00:07:46.180> in<00:07:46.539> the<00:07:46.660> brush<00:07:46.930> at

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:47.169 
really almost no paint in the brush at

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.220 
really almost no paint in the brush at
all<00:07:47.410> yeah<00:07:47.770> I<00:07:47.830> like<00:07:48.190> that
