unboxing<00:00:03.510> video<00:00:04.230> on<00:00:05.190> my<00:00:05.520> vortec<00:00:06.000> mp10<00:00:07.130> w<00:00:08.130> es

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
unboxing video on my vortec mp10 w es

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.629 
unboxing video on my vortec mp10 w es
there<00:00:10.019> are<00:00:10.110> two<00:00:10.349> different<00:00:10.650> models<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.219> was

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
there are two different models I was

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.589 
there are two different models I was
just<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.000> regular<00:00:12.179> es<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.990> then<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> w<00:00:13.620> es

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
just a regular es and then the w es

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.390 
just a regular es and then the w es
difference<00:00:15.599> between<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.800> W<00:00:17.130> is

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
difference between the two is the W is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.730 
difference between the two is the W is
the<00:00:17.640> wireless<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:19.020> if<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.470> more<00:00:19.680> than

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the wireless so if you have more than

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.500 
the wireless so if you have more than
one<00:00:19.859> pump<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:20.880> communicate<00:00:21.029> with<00:00:21.480> each

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
one pump they can communicate with each

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.380 
one pump they can communicate with each
other<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.189> if<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.699> Radeon

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
other and if you have the Radeon

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.210 
other and if you have the Radeon
fixtures<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.230> also<00:00:25.380> communicate<00:00:25.800> with

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
fixtures it can also communicate with

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.910 
fixtures it can also communicate with
the<00:00:26.310> light<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.900> actually<00:00:28.349> put<00:00:28.769> your

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the light and you can actually put your

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.980 
the light and you can actually put your
pumps<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.400> feed<00:00:29.640> mode<00:00:29.849> via<00:00:30.150> your<00:00:30.480> radeon

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
pumps and feed mode via your radeon

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.819 
pumps and feed mode via your radeon
fixture<00:00:32.420> what's<00:00:33.420> nice<00:00:33.630> about<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.200> your

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
fixture what's nice about it if your

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.220 
fixture what's nice about it if your
radeon<00:00:35.280> light<00:00:35.489> goes<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:36.000> storm<00:00:36.270> mode<00:00:36.480> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
radeon light goes into storm mode it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
radeon light goes into storm mode it
will<00:00:37.260> communicate<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> pump<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.610> put

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
will communicate with the pump and put

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.959 
will communicate with the pump and put
the<00:00:39.300> tank<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.690> store<00:00:39.960> mode<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.850> pretty

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the tank in store mode so it's pretty

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.920 
the tank in store mode so it's pretty
nice<00:00:42.149> option<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
nice option to have also if you have a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.279 
nice option to have also if you have a
Neptune<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> wireless<00:00:47.460> controller<00:00:48.289> for

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
Neptune with a wireless controller for

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.420 
Neptune with a wireless controller for
the<00:00:49.320> vortex<00:00:50.059> you<00:00:51.059> need<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.050> w's<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the vortex you need the w's and not the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.479 
the vortex you need the w's and not the
regular<00:00:53.579> ones<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:55.100> just<00:00:56.100> show<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
regular ones so just show you what it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
regular ones so just show you what it
looks<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.789> when<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.059> open<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.379> get<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> pump

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
looks like when you open it get the pump

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.270 
looks like when you open it get the pump
sitting<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.460> top<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> inside<00:01:07.280> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
sitting up on top and on the inside you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.690 
sitting up on top and on the inside you
have<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.270> controller<00:01:14.720> now<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.869> pump<00:01:16.200> comes

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
have the controller now this pump comes

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.929 
have the controller now this pump comes
with<00:01:17.700> an<00:01:17.850> extra<00:01:18.000> rubber<00:01:18.570> piece<00:01:19.369> if<00:01:20.369> your<00:01:20.610> tank

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
with an extra rubber piece if your tank

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.969 
with an extra rubber piece if your tank
glass<00:01:21.409> is<00:01:22.409> thinner<00:01:24.530> then<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:25.799> sizes<00:01:26.070> here

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
glass is thinner then these sizes here

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
glass is thinner then these sizes here

this rubber spacer between says to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.550 
this rubber spacer between says to
protect<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> motor<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:36.170> will<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
protect the motor and will be here you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:48.310 
protect the motor and will be here you
have<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> controller

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320

whichever<00:02:19.680> layout<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.459> have<00:02:20.670> put<00:02:21.090> your<00:02:21.240> tank

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
whichever layout you have put your tank

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.840 
whichever layout you have put your tank
what<00:02:24.240> else<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.570> have<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.280> AC<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.790> DC

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
what else do we have with the AC to DC

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.330 
what else do we have with the AC to DC
adapter<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:34.050> plug<00:02:34.440> for<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.890> AC<00:02:35.100> adapter

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
adapter and the plug for the AC adapter

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.270 
adapter and the plug for the AC adapter
this<00:02:36.270> goes<00:02:36.510> into<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.110> adapter<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:38.070> goes

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
this goes into the adapter and just goes

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.110 
this goes into the adapter and just goes
into<00:02:38.520> your<00:02:38.550> outlet<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:41.760> has<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
into your outlet and this has a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.580 
into your outlet and this has a
connection<00:02:43.130> for<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.280> controller<00:02:45.320> which<00:02:46.320> goes

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
connection for the controller which goes

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.320 
connection for the controller which goes
under<00:02:46.950> there<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.310> what<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.610> get<00:02:50.760> when

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
under there so this is what you get when

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.860 
under there so this is what you get when
