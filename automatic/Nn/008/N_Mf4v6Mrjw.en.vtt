 chinnici who has a question about dressage 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.780
 the junior portela writes us of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.730
 Arapongas not in Parana 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 He says he has a horse with the habit. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 raise your head whenever 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.149

 barbosa who is coach what the junior 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.430
 can do to correct that horse 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.860
 Junior first I start 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 work from below with frei de correcção 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.640
 a bit analyze 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.399
 but if you start working with the bridle 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.250
 pushing the reins against the chest 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.320
 objective is to make the horse retreat 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.489
 relatively normal at all steps 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 for the potato beers bento for another 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.049
 alternative is to cross the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.070
 neck to teach the horse to access the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.290
 nape 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.830
 thanks, just, do not push it, it can not be 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.869
 donated take out and neither pulled strong 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.759
 we just have to rein himself 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.490
 same goes back with the head in place 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.340
 it is important to emphasize the rein as soon as 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 the horse responds when he is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.490
 held down with his head well 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 positioned 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.890
 It's time to ride, I'm told. 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.810
 hage will work the head i will drop 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.060
 then it will start to pick up trust 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.090
 on the brake in your hand the more you lifted 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 more leads to the mouth changing the next step 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.670
 is to work with the reins open using 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.320
 both hands above the movie verity 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 network facing the top of the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.270
 truthfulness is nothing more that I touch 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.729
 my two legs without the use of the export 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.369
 easy to stop the leg work and it goes 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.500
 Think back with your head in place. 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.170
 it is worth remembering that the correction must be 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.640
 done first is the stride only when 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.130
 the animal does not react 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.420
 one must go to the trot 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 and finally to the gallotti
