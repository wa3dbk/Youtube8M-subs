trying to draw the player very much into

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.900 
trying to draw the player very much into
the<00:00:52.829> game<00:00:52.949> by<00:00:53.070> creating<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.610> call<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the game by creating what we call this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
the game by creating what we call this
first-person<00:00:54.239> racing<00:00:54.780> experience<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.469> I'm

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
first-person racing experience and I'm

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.439 
first-person racing experience and I'm
dropping<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> cockpit<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> car

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
dropping you in the cockpit of the car

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
dropping you in the cockpit of the car
itself<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.469> we've<00:00:58.620> done<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> we've<00:00:59.010> modeled

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
itself what we've done is we've modeled

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
itself what we've done is we've modeled
a<00:00:59.399> highly<00:00:59.640> detailed<00:01:00.020> character<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> car

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
a highly detailed character in the car

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.319 
a highly detailed character in the car
and<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:01.890> basically<00:01:02.280> his<00:01:02.670> viewpoint<00:01:03.059> become

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
and then basically his viewpoint become

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.630 
and then basically his viewpoint become
yours<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.890> having<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> camera<00:01:05.159> attached<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
yours and having a camera attached to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
yours and having a camera attached to
his<00:01:05.760> head<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.330> he<00:01:06.510> moves<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.200> in

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
his head so the way he moves going in

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
his head so the way he moves going in
little<00:01:07.619> bumps<00:01:07.920> accelerating<00:01:08.580> braking

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
little bumps accelerating braking

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.640 
little bumps accelerating braking
shaking<00:01:09.479> through<00:01:09.659> turns<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
shaking through turns all of that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
shaking through turns all of that
becomes<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.010> viewpoint<00:01:11.600> you'll<00:01:12.600> find

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
becomes your viewpoint you'll find

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.060 
becomes your viewpoint you'll find
effects<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.530> example<00:01:13.619> when<00:01:13.950> you're

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
effects like for example when you're

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.670 
effects like for example when you're
going<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.369> fast<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:14.909> point<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> view

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
going really fast your point of view

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.719 
going really fast your point of view
focusing<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> road<00:01:16.950> ahead<00:01:17.100> you'll<00:01:17.580> get

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
focusing on the road ahead you'll get

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.850 
focusing on the road ahead you'll get
like<00:01:17.880> tunnel<00:01:18.210> vision<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:19.290> graphics<00:01:19.500> new<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
like tunnel vision the graphics new you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.249 
like tunnel vision the graphics new you
will<00:01:19.979> start<00:01:20.189> blurring<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
will start blurring and all that and

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.870 
will start blurring and all that and
yeah<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.409> when<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.680> crash<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.610> sort<00:01:23.790> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
yeah and when you crash it's sort of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
yeah and when you crash it's sort of
like<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.270> intense<00:01:24.960> experience<00:01:25.439> with

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
like a really intense experience with

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.320 
like a really intense experience with
lots<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.920> shaking<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.580> blurring<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
lots of shaking going on blurring and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
lots of shaking going on blurring and
you'll<00:01:28.290> hear<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> guys<00:01:28.740> heartbeat

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
you'll hear the guys heartbeat

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100 
you'll hear the guys heartbeat
eventually<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> very<00:01:30.540> enough<00:01:30.720> impact

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
eventually if it's a very enough impact

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
eventually if it's a very enough impact
so<00:01:31.619> very<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:32.009> creating<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.610> intense

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so very much creating this intense

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.230 
so very much creating this intense
first-person<00:01:34.189> recreation<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.340> being<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.090> race

driving<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.460> real<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.600> example<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.079> we

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
driving a real for example when we

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
driving a real for example when we
when<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.680> created<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> course<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.610> work<00:01:50.729> very

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
when we created the course we work very

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.539 
when we created the course we work very
closely<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> manufacturers<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.549> our

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
closely with the manufacturers and our

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.190 
closely with the manufacturers and our
whole<00:01:53.850> goal<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:54.750> create<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.020> car

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
whole goal was not to just create a car

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.139 
whole goal was not to just create a car
that<00:01:55.350> looks<00:01:55.560> good<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.369> had<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.670> sound<00:01:56.969> like

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that looks good but it had to sound like

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.550 
that looks good but it had to sound like
the<00:01:57.329> real<00:01:57.479> thing<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.930> had<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.140> handle<00:01:58.409> like

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the real thing and I had to handle like

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.319 
the real thing and I had to handle like
the<00:01:58.680> real<00:01:58.829> thing<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> only<00:02:00.240> way

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the real thing and that's the only way

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.580 
the real thing and that's the only way
that<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:00.810> pull<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> player<00:02:01.320> into

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that you can really pull a player into

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.550 
that you can really pull a player into
this<00:02:01.710> full<00:02:02.009> immersive<00:02:02.579> experience<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
this full immersive experience and and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.480 
this full immersive experience and and
create<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.680> level<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
create that level of you know that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459 
create that level of you know that
suspends<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.939> disbelief<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.170> game<00:02:07.290> comes

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
suspends of disbelief so the game comes

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
suspends of disbelief so the game comes
