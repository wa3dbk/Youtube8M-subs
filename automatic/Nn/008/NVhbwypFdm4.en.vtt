did<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.670> game<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.809> when<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> control<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
did in the game like when I control the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.240 
did in the game like when I control the
ball<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.610> I'm<00:01:05.820> shooting<00:01:06.240> towards<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> goal

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250

think that people don't have to compare
me<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.909> much<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.450> DD<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> he
