 he a music link connection to the 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.650
 sit front because you are different 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.629
 equipment on the which can connect standard 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.780
 connections at the back 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.389
 the power connection than the colors that

 one the speakers which front right

 left for and as a center speaker so me 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.290
 can go completely wrong then nothing here 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.480
 for connecting the back of the 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.880
 speakers to get the wireless that you want 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.430
 need extra accessory for then 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.970
 a few more audio inputs than him 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.590
 a digital coaxial or even upside-down 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.049
 and we also just have an analogue 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.609
 input such as a recognizing syria 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.010
 sound white and red 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.560

 docking station for the ipod or iphone 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.359
 which is simply included and we have 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.769
 the antenna connection for the radio 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.590
 so that you also through this home cinema 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.599
 set can then listen to one another 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.359
 audio input 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.209

 you want it directly on your internet 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.020
 to connect 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.170
 pieces the familiar cable but it has 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.550

 not to forget so you can do it too 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.310
 just 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.840

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.980
 So you also have a connection to it 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.330

 with the home network 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.100
 the DNA and the choice of all peripherals 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.650

 and of course sbs6 by a beautiful 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.970
 Smart TV's feature is the app 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.860
 from pathÃ© and the video land because there is no need 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.320
 namely no longer looking forward to the 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.330
 video library to natures a nice movie 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.190

 through credit cards or other 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.230
 payment options own the same 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.230
 like you do in a hotel 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.909
 95% of complaints with us 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.249
 they just come in to resolve by 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.080
 the use of new cables 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.809
 you have two types of cables one 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.300
 is to get the signal inside and 2 is 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:14.129
 to connect your peripherals 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.139
 you can have the most expensive equipment 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.029
 moment that both sources go wrong and have 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.339
 of course you don't care about it 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.379
 we advise the hirschmann cables and 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.930
 of course know a reason because they have 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.249
 namely the cable label and that 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.159
 This means that you are guaranteed 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.569
 good image and sound 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.009
 yes we naturally have all the parts 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.990
 to help you get started 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.039
 the socket the splitter the 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.839
 connectors 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.849
 and then of course the cables in all 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.080
 lengths and of course the 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.879
 signal amplifier 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.589
 and this signal amplifier is also one 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.569
 splitter which gives you multiple televisions 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:47.699
 can connect for example to the 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.439
 children's room or the bedroom or 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.879
 maybe the kitchen and then 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.439
 naturally very important 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.360
 are also the cables for connecting 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:56.309
 of the peripherals 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.449
 we use the cables from 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.729
 vivanco 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:01.439
 simply because they are the best on the 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.180
 televisions of today 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:05.909
 of course much more than just 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.949
 watch television as internet 3d call 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.719
 it actually all but up 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.789
 and to ensure that you can do these functions 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:14.129
 you have to make sure you use it 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.300
 HDMI cables are up to date 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:16.889
 that, of course, also applies to the scart 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.529
 cable and of course also applies to the 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.969
 DVI cable to connect your laptop to 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:22.080
 the goal for the sound of the home 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.849
 cinema set 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.589
 col scarf for the sound to be home 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.930
 cinema set or blu-ray player 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:29.610
 and of course the component cable and pressure 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.800
 not to forget to use the internet 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.360
 close the LAN cable 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.180
 so you buy a new blu-ray player 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.369
 home cinema set or TV old cables 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.830
 nice along yes guys where the country 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:43.459
 indeed breaks that chain at the 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.459
 weakest link
