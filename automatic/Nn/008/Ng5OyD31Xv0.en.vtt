silver chest I have three keys so that's

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.260 
silver chest I have three keys so that's
perfect<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:12.340> can<00:02:12.459> open<00:02:12.550> all<00:02:12.730> three<00:02:12.940> ah<00:02:15.270> ok

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.600 
perfect so we can open all three ah ok
so<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.290> don't<00:02:17.740> know<00:02:17.890> what<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.160> do<00:02:18.310> with<00:02:18.459> these

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so I don't know what to do with these

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.880 
so I don't know what to do with these
rooms<00:02:19.090> yet<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.200> might<00:02:20.410> actually<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.860> a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
rooms yet so that might actually be a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.260 
rooms yet so that might actually be a
good<00:02:21.100> thing<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.550> fact<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:22.000> green

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
good thing but the fact that it's green

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.050 
good thing but the fact that it's green
is<00:02:22.450> telling<00:02:22.720> me<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.050> not<00:02:23.200> super<00:02:23.680> great

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
is telling me that it's not super great

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.449 
is telling me that it's not super great
and<00:02:25.060> these<00:02:25.360> are<00:02:25.420> good<00:02:25.930> small<00:02:26.500> fortitude<00:02:27.160> pills

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
and these are good small fortitude pills

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.760 
and these are good small fortitude pills
those<00:02:28.209> are<00:02:28.390> basically<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:29.260> there's<00:02:29.500> two

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
those are basically like there's two

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.280 
those are basically like there's two
separate<00:02:30.190> energy<00:02:30.610> systems<00:02:31.150> there<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.110> an

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
separate energy systems there is an

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.210 
separate energy systems there is an
energy<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:34.350> playing<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.650> missions<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
energy for playing like missions and

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.800 
energy for playing like missions and
energy<00:02:36.520> for<00:02:36.790> doing<00:02:36.970> like<00:02:37.030> arena<00:02:37.480> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
energy for doing like arena and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.300 
energy for doing like arena and
fortitude<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.380> for<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.950> get<00:02:39.190> like

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
fortitude is for that so you get like

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.580 
fortitude is for that so you get like
refills<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.060> that's<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.750> purple<00:02:41.080> piece<00:02:41.260> purple

let's<00:02:47.709> see<00:02:47.890> what's<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.250> gold<00:02:50.489> we<00:02:51.489> gotta<00:02:51.760> go

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
let's see what's in the gold we gotta go

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.440 
let's see what's in the gold we gotta go
I<00:02:52.660> don't<00:02:52.930> know<00:02:53.019> how<00:02:53.380> much<00:02:53.590> food<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.860> we<00:02:54.100> get

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
I don't know how much food that we get

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.780 
I don't know how much food that we get
25,000<00:02:55.450> gold<00:02:55.630> that's<00:02:55.810> pretty<00:02:56.049> nice<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.500> was

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
25,000 gold that's pretty nice I was

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.890 
25,000 gold that's pretty nice I was
expecting<00:02:57.790> something<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.420> little<00:02:58.570> bit<00:02:58.780> better

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
expecting something a little bit better

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.539 
expecting something a little bit better
from<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.230> but<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.709> still<00:02:59.950> pretty<00:03:00.160> cool

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
from that but that's still pretty cool

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.750 
from that but that's still pretty cool
so<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.209> go<00:03:01.299> ahead<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.570> sort<00:03:01.930> things<00:03:02.140> out<00:03:02.760> let's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
so we go ahead and sort things out let's

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
so we go ahead and sort things out let's
look<00:03:03.910> at<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.209> weapon<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:06.130> mite<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:07.000> 13<00:03:07.540> 18

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
look at this weapon it's a mite is 13 18

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.140 
look at this weapon it's a mite is 13 18
damage<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.739> 358<00:03:10.769> my<00:03:11.769> yeah<00:03:12.100> but<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.760> know<00:03:12.880> maybe

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
damage is 358 my yeah but you know maybe

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.910 
damage is 358 my yeah but you know maybe
I<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.450> work<00:03:13.600> on<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.260> I'll<00:03:14.620> probably

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
I can work on this and I'll probably

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.910 
I can work on this and I'll probably
look<00:03:15.430> at<00:03:15.700> compared<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.299> two<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.110> see<00:03:17.739> which

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
look at compared to two and see which

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.190 
look at compared to two and see which
one<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> better<00:03:18.549> fit<00:03:18.820> because<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:20.049> is

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
one is a better fit because that is

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.500 
one is a better fit because that is
going<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.790> video<00:03:22.000> like<00:03:22.390> I
