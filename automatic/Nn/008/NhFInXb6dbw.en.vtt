00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 welcome everyone on trains theory like 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.029
 every timid some news on the world of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
 video making and I make you an act where that 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.309
 of the most beautiful videos I've seen on 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.309
 youtube initials 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.340
 the road known manufacturer of 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.250
 microphones in particular for the video 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.520
 making a dedicated microphone release 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.770
 exclusively to the iphone or all ipad that 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.710
 it is called icsim and a very microphone 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.300
 small with the note mount for iphone 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 which has been incredibly successful 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.650
 in the states mainly due to the fact 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.390
 that everyone has an iphone there 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.190
 stereo microphone to the possibility of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.850
 record the web format audio file 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.000
 up to 24 bit depth with 96,000 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.440
 kilohertz of frequency the excellent thing of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.690
 this microphone besides the fact 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.060
 stereo and that connecting it to the iphone 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.590
 you can monitor by connecting 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.660
 iPhone headphones 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.070
 the volume and the audio that goes into the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.720
 your microphone so one thing 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.480
 normally you can't do for example 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.710
 with a robin and mick other peculiarities of 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.840
 this microphone and the fact that it is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.759
 really small and easily portable 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.380
 supports already exist for 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.040
 iphone to be mounted on the sled 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 of the reflex and I think it is because of 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.540
 these reasons that in America is the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.370
 presale has already had a 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.320
 sold out 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.060
 for those interested in the price of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.600
 launch was about $ 200 then 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.250
 I guess it's about 160 70 euros for the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.900
 moment just as said in sold out 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.760
 so you can register at the site that you 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.610
 I leave in the description that when there is 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.470
 will be new will send you unime 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 alerting you the next time already 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.909
 as he finds us in new york maybe he brings 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.330
 a and does a test looks cool down 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.490
 kramer famous for being the mind of 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.370
 video copilot will release a few days 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.040
 a new 3d pack called metropolitan 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.130
 which basically consists of a city 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.790
 whole more than 100 building models with 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.240
 texture and reflection so it will be a 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.640
 big a big pac the president did not 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.030
 will be $ 99 as are all 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.799
 other baches for while of but andrew 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.349
 kramer said it will cost a little more 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.760
 without losing the price, however, a 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.530
 unlike the others it seems 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.819
 will be just structured a different way 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.650
 will have many more 3D elements 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.080
 and this according to him will justify the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.370
 highest price 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.830
 we'll see I 'm curious to see 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.830
 type hundred palaces in 3d to be able 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.540
 place here and there I want to thank 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.120

 I always want to invite you to report me 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.200
 news you can send me a message on 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.930
 youtube or on the facebook page 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.070

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.070
 so thanks giulia 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.569
 for we open the so public this 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.489
 week we talk about two Italians 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.370
 connected 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.930
 the first and nemesis I want to talk about 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.510
 web series of the fancazzisti series 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.700
 anonymous is once I recommend you 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.870
 see pinar there is the pilot more 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.450
 two episodes 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.670
 the fundamental peculiarity of this 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.100
 series is the fact that we say half is 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.519
 normally turned half is done at 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.099
 Japanese style cartoon la 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.739
 part of animation and already realized 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.390
 father of drawing and made with elbows 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.620
 en angela that you should already know for 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.100
 I know your jobs 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.360
 do it is a very special series 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.239
 probably but they know it 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.000
 surely the fate is negative 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.430
 of the series their acting that not 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.739
 They are actors and they seem to audition 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.700
 remember it every moment but part 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.470
 I suggest you take a look 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.600
 if you have a moment of free time 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.130
 the second person is marco instead 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.950
 quintavalle with the fifth essence canal 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.700
 channel and director of this series 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.459
 nemesis 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.910
 he has a channel where he occasionally 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.010
 too little often unfortunately 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.640
 upload videos that can be both 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.280
 animation of him from what I have 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.370
 understand it makes a lot of vector 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.500
 illustrator and then the soul but found 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.239
 even short films little ideas 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.480
 very cool like that of thought is 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.390
 he really won everything with that video 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.829
 and he is precisely the director of nemesis e 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.540
 so this week I wanted to 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.400
 introduce them also because 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.260
 however the second episode of 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.940
 nemesis and a mini course and came out on 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.000
 then quintessence chalmer cat 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.830
 it is however a theme and I take advantage of it for 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.470
 tell you this to let you know that tomorrow 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.229
 at 9pm there will be a live technique on mine 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.330
 channel but this time will be dedicated 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.919
 exclusively to the jobs of and 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.169
 quintessence therefore channel of marco 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.430
 fifth director of nemesis then vi 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.870
 I recommend taking a look at his 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.200
 work in order to maybe prepare you a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.200
 little questions 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.020
 and technique and massacre it tomorrow at 9 pm 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.520
 on this live channel 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.770
 I'm trying to do techniques a 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.540
 little more theme because I noticed that if 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.240
 someone misses the live 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.400
 then it is still to look after it is one 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.100
 bulk of questions sometimes always 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.360
 themselves so it can be a bit difficult 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.950
 follow him however make sense of the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.450
 live are an hour of questions of which 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.310
 model 90 percent 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.650
 one knows the answer and can understand 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.900
 which will therefore not be worth the idea of 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.580
 do live themed techniques or talking about 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.650
 a person or a major topic 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.260
 novelty that is flashing me will wear a 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.390
 let's see how it goes so be prepared a 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.070
 lots of questions for marco quintavalle 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.810
 we'll see you tomorrow technical corollaries 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.530
 and then for the whole week 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.530
 Hello
