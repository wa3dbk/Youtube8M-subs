 one day house 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.810
 know gta online was a great idea 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.430
 It was slimy fans of the series 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.869
 multiplayer fights exactly should 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.210
 it was to be very at very cool so 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.619
 it went wrong in theory everything is fine you 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.939
 can buy a car to rob 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.070
 shopping with friends go 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.960
 strip club to change his character well 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.560

 the simpleton gets sick and even 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 if you run and arrange disassembly with 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.970
 groupings to complete different tasks 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.510
 can for this and made gta however 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.850
