00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
paper so Gold's been a great asset class

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
paper so Gold's been a great asset class
for<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> last<00:01:03.239> 10<00:01:03.510> years<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:04.409> hasn't<00:01:04.830> been

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
for the last 10 years it hasn't been

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.210 
for the last 10 years it hasn't been
part<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> modern<00:01:05.580> portfolio<00:01:06.060> theory<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
part of the modern portfolio theory and

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.859 
part of the modern portfolio theory and
that<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:09.030> why<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.750> most

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that that's why it's not in most

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.870 
that that's why it's not in most
portfolios<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:10.830> people<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.159> saying<00:01:11.369> okay

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
portfolios but people are saying okay

it's outperformed every other asset

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.149 
it's outperformed every other asset
class<00:01:14.040> by<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.580> than<00:01:14.610> two<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.570> four<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> one

why<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.119> portfolio<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
why don't I have it in my portfolio and

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.670 
why don't I have it in my portfolio and
that's<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.729> drawing<00:01:21.119> people<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.020> for

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that's just drawing people in and for

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.539 
that's just drawing people in and for
silver<00:01:23.270> silver<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.659> could<00:01:24.960> run<00:01:25.549> it'll

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
silver silver I think could run it'll

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.950 
silver silver I think could run it'll
follow<00:01:26.790> gold<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.840> could

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
follow gold but I think it could

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
follow gold but I think it could
outperform<00:01:28.350> gold<00:01:28.920> by<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> factor<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> two<00:01:30.060> or

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
outperform gold by a factor of two or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
outperform gold by a factor of two or
three<00:01:30.270> two<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.070> goes<00:01:32.250> back

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
three two one right now if it goes back

other parts of the world but North
for<00:03:06.970> whatever<00:03:07.180> reason<00:03:07.810> hasn't<00:03:08.710> seen<00:03:08.890> mining

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
for whatever reason hasn't seen mining

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.610 
for whatever reason hasn't seen mining
is<00:03:09.610> something<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.150> should<00:03:10.330> invest<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.080> our

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
is something I should invest in and our

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.320 
is something I should invest in and our
politicians<00:03:12.160> have<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.700> wake<00:03:12.850> up<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.300> fact

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
politicians have to wake up to the fact

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.410 
politicians have to wake up to the fact
that<00:03:13.950> every<00:03:14.950> dollar<00:03:15.220> invested<00:03:15.490> in<00:03:15.970> mining

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
that every dollar invested in mining

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.050 
that every dollar invested in mining
creates<00:03:17.050> two<00:03:17.319> dollars<00:03:17.709> in<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.890> economy<00:03:18.520> and

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
creates two dollars in the economy and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.500 
creates two dollars in the economy and
so<00:03:19.720> there's<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.020> huge<00:03:20.470> multiplier<00:03:21.040> effect<00:03:21.910> that

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
so there's a huge multiplier effect that

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.400 
so there's a huge multiplier effect that
hasn't<00:03:23.140> dawned<00:03:24.070> on<00:03:24.459> da<00:03:24.670> matta<00:03:25.260> something<00:03:26.260> else

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
hasn't dawned on da matta something else

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.570 
hasn't dawned on da matta something else
I've<00:03:26.560> been<00:03:26.709> hearing<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.250> amount<00:03:27.430> of

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
I've been hearing is the amount of

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.130 
I've been hearing is the amount of
investment<00:03:27.850> demand<00:03:28.270> flowing<00:03:28.870> into<00:03:29.020> the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
investment demand flowing into the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.890 
investment demand flowing into the
junior<00:03:29.560> mining<00:03:29.830> sector<00:03:30.790> some<00:03:31.540> people<00:03:31.840> were

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
97 that'd be fair the junior mining

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.290 
97 that'd be fair the junior mining
sector<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.250> growth<00:03:39.489> area<00:03:39.910> that's<00:03:40.090> where

sector is the growth area that's where

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.540 
sector is the growth area that's where
the<00:03:40.420> discoveries<00:03:41.110> are<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:42.070> seniors

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
the discoveries are and the seniors

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.280 
the discoveries are and the seniors
coming<00:03:43.510> out<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.290> trough<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.980> 2008<00:03:46.290> had

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
coming out of the the trough of 2008 had

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.770 
coming out of the the trough of 2008 had
an<00:03:47.440> advantage<00:03:47.769> they<00:03:48.700> were<00:03:48.760> in<00:03:49.000> production<00:03:49.630> and

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
an advantage they were in production and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.990 
an advantage they were in production and
the<00:03:49.870> prices<00:03:50.860> were<00:03:50.950> going<00:03:51.010> up<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.850> their

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
the prices were going up so their

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.229 
the prices were going up so their

they<00:04:01.390> were<00:04:01.450> exploring<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.470> now<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.220> seniors

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
they were exploring and now the seniors

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.699 
they were exploring and now the seniors
