00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.470
 of simple water saving for 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 who lives in the apartment and does it rain 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.689

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.210
 electric you can not go downstairs 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.820
 immediately after opening the valve. 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.099
 why it takes a while, even though 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.770

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.440
 thinking of this the saving of water that the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.149
 people did what they would not 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.680

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.120
 people used to leave things hanging 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.320

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.439
 We shower in this day. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.740

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.869
 You do to avoid also to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.460
 laziness right? 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.640
 we close the valve the registration and the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 pet bottles and with an ice cream pot of 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.579

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.939
 Restroom 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.320
 then the pet bottle will serve for what 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:54.930
 will serve to fill the reservoir of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:59.159
 water when it is empty in cases where 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.979
