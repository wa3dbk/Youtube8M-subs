I'm<00:00:03.290> going<00:00:03.500> to<00:00:03.590> demonstrate<00:00:03.739> how<00:00:04.430> to<00:00:04.490> achieve

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
I'm going to demonstrate how to achieve

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.389 
I'm going to demonstrate how to achieve
an<00:00:05.029> aged<00:00:05.270> copper<00:00:05.840> look<00:00:06.019> two<00:00:06.590> plastic<00:00:06.800> piping

an aged copper look two plastic piping
step<00:00:07.970> one<00:00:08.240> is<00:00:08.570> to<00:00:08.780> spray<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:09.349> pipe<00:00:09.559> with

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
step one is to spray the pipe with

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.919 
step one is to spray the pipe with
plastic<00:00:10.340> primer<00:00:13.240> for<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:14.299> next<00:00:14.539> step<00:00:14.719> I'm

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
plastic primer for the next step I'm

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.480 
plastic primer for the next step I'm
going<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.200> spray<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:15.499> pipe<00:00:15.709> with<00:00:16.129> a<00:00:16.160> coarse

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490

going to spray the pipe with a coarse
texture<00:00:17.030> paint<00:00:17.270> this<00:00:17.840> will<00:00:18.050> roughen<00:00:18.410> the

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
texture paint this will roughen the

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.500 
texture paint this will roughen the
surface<00:00:18.560> of<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.099> plastic<00:00:19.279> I'm<00:00:20.090> going<00:00:20.269> to<00:00:20.390> use

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
surface of the plastic I'm going to use

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.720 
surface of the plastic I'm going to use
a<00:00:20.539> piece<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.960> card<00:00:21.230> to<00:00:21.710> protect<00:00:21.830> certain<00:00:22.429> areas

a piece of card to protect certain areas

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:38.709 
a piece of card to protect certain areas
which<00:00:22.910> I<00:00:23.060> want<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.539> remain<00:00:23.810> smooth<00:00:37.570> I'm<00:00:38.570> now

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
which I want to remain smooth I'm now

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.689 
which I want to remain smooth I'm now
going<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:38.989> spray<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.590> layer<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:40.070> fine<00:00:40.280> texture

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
going to spray a layer of fine texture

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.170 

the<00:00:57.350> purpose<00:00:57.710> of<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.039> first<00:00:58.250> few<00:00:58.430> coats<00:00:58.730> is

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
the purpose of the first few coats is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.509 
the purpose of the first few coats is
purely<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.719> add<00:00:59.960> texture<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.829> plastic<00:01:01.309> I'm

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
purely to add texture to the plastic I'm

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.310 
purely to add texture to the plastic I'm
now<00:01:01.910> going<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.120> cover<00:01:02.300> all<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.719> this<00:01:02.870> with<00:01:03.289> a

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
now going to cover all of this with a

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.470 
now going to cover all of this with a
copper<00:01:03.679> spray

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.540 

the<00:01:12.480> copper<00:01:12.810> spray<00:01:13.140> produces<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> really<00:01:14.310> nice

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
the copper spray produces a really nice

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.780 
the copper spray produces a really nice
shiny<00:01:15.150> coat<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.230> looks<00:01:16.500> too<00:01:17.130> new<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
shiny coat but this looks too new and a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
shiny coat but this looks too new and a
little<00:01:18.000> bit<00:01:18.150> artificial<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.810> me<00:01:18.870> what<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> want

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
little bit artificial to me what I want

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
little bit artificial to me what I want
to<00:01:19.800> do<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.160> apply<00:01:20.430> some<00:01:20.790> techniques<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to do now is apply some techniques to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.630 
to do now is apply some techniques to
aged<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.050> copper<00:01:22.410> I'm<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> cover<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
aged the copper I'm going to cover the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.050 
aged the copper I'm going to cover the
piece<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.300> brown<00:01:24.690> stain<00:01:25.440> this<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.670> darken

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
piece in a brown stain this will darken

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.270 
piece in a brown stain this will darken
up<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> whole<00:01:27.510> piece<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.260> also<00:01:28.410> accumulate

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
up the whole piece and also accumulate

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
up the whole piece and also accumulate
along<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> edges<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> joints<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.810> make

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
along the edges of the joints to make

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:52.370 
along the edges of the joints to make
them<00:01:31.080> stand<00:01:31.320> out<00:01:31.530> all

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a lot of the coppers shine is still

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
a lot of the coppers shine is still
coming<00:01:54.720> through<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> wash<00:01:55.200> even<00:01:56.070> though<00:01:56.159> I've

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
coming through the wash even though I've

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.950 
coming through the wash even though I've
done<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.700> layers<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.870> do<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
done two layers so now going to do a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.350 
done two layers so now going to do a

joints and low points on the piece to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.150 
joints and low points on the piece to
make<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.989> look<00:02:28.110> as<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.350> it's<00:02:28.500> been<00:02:28.650> oxidized
