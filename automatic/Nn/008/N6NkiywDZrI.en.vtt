00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.750
 well that's it everyone knows that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 can ensure this item coliseum 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.130
 weird quite special since for the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.210
 little story actually I filmed 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.440
 because I saw that I was going to succeed 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.150
 to put lay up in the trap network 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.260
 but otherwise it was a little dead for me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 because I was alone against 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.259
 three guys who were crazy about speed 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.070
 was a team in front and I got 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.660
 found alone because in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.669
 normative you saw on the right 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 someone gave up and then hop with 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.980
 I too have a little suicide 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.200
 and look down on the left in the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.579
 chats wii begins to get upset he says 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.020
 I do not know I did not see you like 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.590
 no one to suicide you hautemaniÃ¨re it is 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.039
 dead but no it's never dead with a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.690
 tram 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.039
 because there I was against a good team 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.809
 then there are some bugs go for a moment 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.949
 he missed in two rounds with his 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.719
 characters and down and the few 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.550
 bugs otherwise they are replaying everything from 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.149
 following he just missed the iops tournament 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.199
 What bah and suddenly there I can put it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.219
 in the trap network lay it up 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.160
 it was pretty cool 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.539
 and in addition I'm lucky that there 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.000
 with the form in choice of films for 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.920
 really fit in forgiveness and that's it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 low altitude shot a big of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.480
 fishing recovers about 3500 enough 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.710
 beautiful bah of the shot just elsewhere already 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.079
 they were level-5 and we were already angry 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 said I'm sauce label 164 in 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.180
 face it's a team it's the same guy 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.630
 who plays he has a fairy cat an elder is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.250
 united to pet the lay up was 199 lenny 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.689
 196 and the fairy 451 tourcoing I tell him 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 I will film since in addition to the guy 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.280
 provokes with me I was pissed off 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 what do you imagine the guy who says 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.520
 yeah you're bad and you're not good at anything 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 then suicide you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.950
 no I did my shot and others 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.399
 traps think they did not know 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 trap networks of the shot so here is 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.380
 do not worry I'm making cuts 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.680
 to members because it's going to be pretty 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.509
 long 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.979
 this fight there you doubt that it has 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.909
 it's long it's a game thought 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.610
 invest in the coliseum 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.590
 I had 4 in preparation we will say that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.750
 I was a little bit helped since the up 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.940
 with me 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.560
 a little bit typed but hey it was all 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.980
 sonia dia he did it was really 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.950
 that slab 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.060
 it was suffering action so here I have 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.770
 still makes a seamstress down to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.630

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.270
 that I play like that because you want 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.590
 so we'll see if you have any 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.580
 patience something like that I do not see 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.890
 well in the heap from where you will see it 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.180
 well you can laugh like that yeah 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.830
 well I have the water at the bottom I will wait 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.850
 I will wait because anyway 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.250
 I put two people myself I am 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.300
 quiet and not me I'm it's 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.100
 gift for me because suddenly I 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.630
 still time to put my traps and 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.020
 prepare my small networks judged a 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.190
 network at the top left of near 1 on the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.390
 right who are prepared in addition he can 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.070
 not hit me from afar the map 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.720
 yes that I will speak the perfect language 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.860
 for the tram is the best maps 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.640
 for them will be in another room jal 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.280
 is huge 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.750
 you can hide from everywhere there is 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.310
 a lot of space to make traps 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.959
 well as it should be and then the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.970
 put it in us easily 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.170
 well helped and frankly I was all 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.489
 only the three guys were crowd vita 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.230
 there is still a fairy 4 so the effect 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.050
 4 it's complicated what we know 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.100
 put a guy to solve trap when 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.840
 he does not have the armor it's still 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.030
 hot enough you still had enough 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.650
 played tactically but the mom gave me 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.000
 really helped and I think it was 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.250
 devest three co leaders in red was 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.350
 with the map the map more mons ram against 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.049
 the three guys there it's just that in 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.370
 true so there yes I was invisible to the 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.170
 little girl was right next to me no 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.400
 did not see me by the way you noticed me 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.070
 still not lost his rejection vitality 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.810
 July ultra safe but look she has 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.250
 tried to find me and not find me and 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.060
 so we're all back you saw 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.519
 there is still a lot as long as it is 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.880
 past and here I can kill it 4 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.350
 so here is necessarily telling you fucking 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.940
 so here I already tried everything 59 lala 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.890
 does 4 one shot also so his 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.000
 second to the cat with the other traps 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.430
 you 've seen me still have a network of traps 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.070
 downstairs and so wash will play safe 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.910
 still not lost vitality I confess I 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.420
 will not you hide it the guy I'm going 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.850
 very bad 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.650
 he made molds hurtful words 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.549
 of silence no matter where they 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.780
 did not stop advancing in my 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.120
 would dive more so that they were playing 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.170
 really not tactical actually 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.640
 so it helped but a vaccine 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.410
 against the flu that's all you well 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.700
 the who will win all our matches that 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.890
 I could not show you all 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.970
 sell whole because at first it was 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.160
 really shit what I had a 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.819
 team kiev the guys gave up because 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.870
 that they saw that it was not 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.210
 balanced where you will see in the end that 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.850
 it was not really balanced 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.200
 a yacht rent me a panda rent me the 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.140
 panda by the way abandoned immediately 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.420
 it was still average but the team in 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.860
 face and nerim it makes that elop 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.930
 it was really three classes that are 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.430
 feasible network of cages and had on 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.080
 a magic map like that there was 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.520
 really gift is suddenly spent a 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.840
 little invested 3 more are the guys 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.210
 were you getting up more than me 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.560
 frankly pity actually i have not 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.630
 miner I commented a little live 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.520
 but in fact I was too much shit I 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.860
 was not 2g time your big rage 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.210
 actually because the guy had me and 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.500
 had provoked he had said yes you are 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.510
 zero suddenly I kept insulting 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.270
 cold I told myself we will not put that 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.470
 otherwise people will not be happy 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.360
 but we will put a little comment there 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.540
 ask like that we take a small 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.830
 video we'll say bonus see finally 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.400
 frankly I was really great 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.210
 happy this really huge fight it's 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.740
 the first time I do something 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.450
 as good I think it's in the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.840
 top 3 best fight of my life 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.100
 frankly in pvp and sees him on 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.930
 second best fight with the tram 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.780
 with behind the fight against the 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.280
 gran server 9 that I had posted that him 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.510
 also see both times actually it's me 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.930
 motivated because the guys did not care 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.940
 my mouth 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.650
 the sacrier you may have seen the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.060
 video for some were saying yes any 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.740
 how you are bad and where I'm not going 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.000
 lose my time with me the free kick 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.430
 that it will motivate for a good pulse of 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.930
 this was the same suicide you babe I 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.000
 believe it's motivation for 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.680
 I told myself we'll show them a 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.180
 little bit what I have in my stomach and 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.340
 there we can do anything 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.900
 how 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.370
 and he's front in line with the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.020
 deluxe peaches was pretty long I 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.790
 cut the moments but not worth it 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.230
 has made itself a 30 laps I had 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.210
 play tactically at times and 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.790
 here is the victory frankly for me 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.990
 it was an investor or a 5 vs 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.380
 Because we count the tablecloth 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.390
 really helped my magic frankly I 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.630
 noted the huge this map we will do 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.920
 a little trick on the scoreboard 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.880
 so 7 32 minutes it was very slow 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.470
 as you needed a lot of 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.640
 time prepare that jo look at them the 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.500
 Belgian was quite straightforward 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.270
 look at the panda see level 156 a 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.870
 abandoned her I tell her the arrival the 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.360
 good attitude 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.190
 the yo by the eye to the past nothing actually 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.160
 I have nothing against him but in panoplie 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.390
 rent me lilly he did 200 kind of damage 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.340
 all the characters after the one made 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.780
 shot by the trouble is required is very 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.040
 wrong 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.480
 - meanwhile you say well 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.620
 how I managed to hold down I stayed 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.360
 basically makes you prepared my traps 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.710
 this pity I have no movie is 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.480
 I'm really disappointed but good luck 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.130
 you could see three one shot in the 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.540
 same fight we invest 3 against a 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.190
 team frankly I'm really I 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.260
 am really proud good I'm boasting a 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.760
 little but I believe there is really enough 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.860
 the grafted for what really eats 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.930
 glad to have done this fight so 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.760
 I hope you will like and like 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.260
 said video were they say stop doing 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.360
 last when one is a fairy tale 3 but no 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.919
 and not to listen to my friends sram 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.480
 if you are alone against three guys 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.919
 did not give up where we never know 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.030
 that can happen well there are certain 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.770
 classes you can give up because 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.850
 it's dead but lets ram it's 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.890
 really a class we can turn 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.210
 the situations there I hesitate is really 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.950
 a good and type 1 and 3 but who are going 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.020
 hen but no I did well to keep 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.970
 because the guys I 'm going very badly and 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.960
 I could enjoy it more with 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.610
 my trap networks that have well 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.110
 market so if you play will be ready and 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.780
 other traps do not give up your parcels 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.340
 always believe in it and so a feast of 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.630
 story is your kif it's okay 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.310
 you have won a candidate but with this 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.440
 that it is cool so here we go 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.580
 really super happy this fight damage 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.750
 that it's not live I'll try to 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.150
 to make people fight live a 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.320
 maybe a king parceleum jacket where I 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.000
 from the beginning because there is a plan 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.490
 invest blizzard had at the beginning the mac 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.450

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.820
 weird at last short it's a small 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.720
 video like that I really hope that 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.640

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.240
 super happy and feel free to leave 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.830
