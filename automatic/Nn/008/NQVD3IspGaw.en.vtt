with I think it every single person in
the<00:00:57.989> world<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:58.500> had<00:00:58.770> Tetris<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.489> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the world probably had Tetris at that

point<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.230> also<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.820> weird

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
point and then there was also that weird

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.010 
point and then there was also that weird
Super<00:01:03.480> Mario<00:01:03.750> game<00:01:04.369> that<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:06.090> fun<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

Super Mario game that was fun but a
little<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.369> seemed<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> little<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:08.850> odd

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
little bit just seemed a little bit odd

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.840 
little bit just seemed a little bit odd
from<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> rest<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> them<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> yeah<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.700> we're

long<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.750> thing<00:01:24.930> stuck<00:01:25.170> around<00:01:25.350> for

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
long that thing stuck around for

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.170 
long that thing stuck around for
production<00:01:27.030> didn't<00:01:27.540> stop<00:01:27.840> till<00:01:28.140> 1995<00:01:29.030> which<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
production didn't stop till 1995 which I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.030 
production didn't stop till 1995 which I
I'm<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.110> sure<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> haven't<00:01:31.590> look<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> other

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
I'm not sure I haven't look at the other

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
I'm not sure I haven't look at the other
consoles<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.790> feel<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:34.049> 12

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
consoles but I feel like you know 12

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
consoles but I feel like you know 12
years<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.460> production<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.479> single

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
years of production on this single

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.340 
years of production on this single
console<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.890> would<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:39.110> don't<00:01:40.110> know

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
console it would be I don't know

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.520 
console it would be I don't know
probably<00:01:40.590> pretty<00:01:40.979> unheard<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.520> now<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.530> guess

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
probably pretty unheard of now I guess

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.620 
probably pretty unheard of now I guess
maybe<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.950> Playstations<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:45.329> kicked

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
maybe the Playstations they kicked

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.260 
maybe the Playstations they kicked
around<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.380> long<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.460> feel

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
around for a really long time but I feel

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
around for a really long time but I feel
like<00:01:48.509> other<00:01:48.659> consoles<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.860> sort

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
like other consoles don't have that sort

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.020 
like other consoles don't have that sort
of<00:01:50.220> life<00:01:50.399> anymore

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
of life anymore

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.999 
of life anymore
so<00:01:51.750> every<00:01:52.350> animal<00:01:52.829> everyone<00:01:53.220> knows<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.000> NES

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
so every animal everyone knows the NES

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.179 
so every animal everyone knows the NES
and<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> pretty<00:01:56.670> good<00:01:56.790> job<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.719> of

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
and they do a pretty good job here of

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.840 
and they do a pretty good job here of
reproducing

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
reproducing

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.960 
reproducing
the<00:02:00.390> colors<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.140> sort<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.470> feels<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.220> me<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
the colors this sort of feels to me a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.110 
the colors this sort of feels to me a
little<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.540> Megaman<00:02:04.520> Megaman<00:02:05.520> style

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
little bit like a Megaman Megaman style

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.600 
little bit like a Megaman Megaman style
I<00:02:06.540> guess<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:08.700> audio<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.509> sure<00:02:10.310> has<00:02:11.310> that

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
I guess and the audio for sure has that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.450 
I guess and the audio for sure has that
sort<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.970> similar<00:02:12.410> similar<00:02:13.410> sound<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:14.400> is

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
sort of similar similar sound this is

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.490 
sort of similar similar sound this is
the<00:02:14.610> first<00:02:14.910> level<00:02:15.090> where<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.630> saw<00:02:16.230> these

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the first level where I saw these

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.760 
the first level where I saw these
objects<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> spring<00:02:19.050> objects<00:02:19.560> and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
objects like the spring objects and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.320 
objects like the spring objects and
stuff<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.100> could<00:02:20.190> push<00:02:20.400> around<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.150> made

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
stuff you could push around so it made

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.400 
stuff you could push around so it made
the<00:02:21.450> gameplay<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.900> little<00:02:22.140> bit<00:02:22.260> more

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
the gameplay a little bit more

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.250 
the gameplay a little bit more
interesting<00:02:22.980> also<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.300> these<00:02:24.450> levels<00:02:24.810> you'll

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
interesting also on these levels you'll

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.100 
interesting also on these levels you'll
see<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> bottom<00:02:25.770> left<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.550> says<00:02:27.110> 10

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
see in the bottom left there it says 10

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.330 
see in the bottom left there it says 10
of<00:02:28.610> 23<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.890> these<00:02:31.890> are<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> lot<00:02:32.640> longer<00:02:32.970> than<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
of 23 so these are a lot longer than the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.610 
of 23 so these are a lot longer than the
earlier<00:02:35.340> consoles<00:02:35.970> which<00:02:36.270> only<00:02:37.110> had<00:02:37.440> about

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
earlier consoles which only had about

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.250 
earlier consoles which only had about
eight<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.370> those<00:02:38.660> little<00:02:39.660> diamonds<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.170> had

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
eight of those little diamonds you had

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.490 
eight of those little diamonds you had
to<00:02:40.350> pick<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> still<00:02:42.480> only<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:43.050> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
to pick up but you still only have I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.449 
to pick up but you still only have I
think<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.830> two<00:02:44.010> lives<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:47.340> know

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
think the two lives so it's you know

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.040 
think the two lives so it's you know
definitely<00:02:47.790> quite<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> bit<00:02:48.450> harder<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.780> guess

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
definitely quite a bit harder I guess

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.320 
definitely quite a bit harder I guess
just<00:02:49.320> do<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:50.459> know<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.760> length<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.239> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
just do the you know the length of a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.240 
just do the you know the length of a
level<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.959> number<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.590> times<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.130> can

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
level and a number of times that you can

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.150 
level and a number of times that you can
actually<00:02:53.340> mess<00:02:53.700> up<00:02:54.320> so<00:02:55.320> one<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:55.860> took

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
actually mess up so one thing that took

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.460 
actually mess up so one thing that took
me<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.670> bit<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.180> figure<00:02:57.480> out<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.959> think

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
me a little bit to figure out I think

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.460 
me a little bit to figure out I think
the<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.459> helper<00:02:59.670> guy<00:03:00.030> tells<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.750> but

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the the little helper guy tells you but

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.960 
the the little helper guy tells you but
I<00:03:01.500> wasn't<00:03:01.739> paying<00:03:02.070> attention<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.730> him<00:03:02.820> that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
I wasn't paying attention to him that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.600 
I wasn't paying attention to him that
much<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.170> kind<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.470> hit<00:03:04.590> down<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
much so you can kind of hit down and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.420 
much so you can kind of hit down and
move<00:03:06.420> your<00:03:06.630> screen<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.260> around<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.890> little<00:03:08.010> bit

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
move your screen and around a little bit

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.009 
move your screen and around a little bit
I'm<00:03:08.790> not<00:03:09.060> even<00:03:09.269> sure<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:09.660> doing<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
I'm not even sure if I'm doing it

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.540 
I'm not even sure if I'm doing it
properly<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.650> might<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:10.980> able<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.340> look

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
properly so you might be able to look

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.750 
properly so you might be able to look
over<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.850> whole<00:03:12.000> level<00:03:12.290> I'm<00:03:13.290> not<00:03:13.590> sure<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:14.250> it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
over the whole level I'm not sure but it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.479 
over the whole level I'm not sure but it
helps<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.570> look<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:16.080> for<00:03:16.230> traps<00:03:16.500> all<00:03:17.280> right

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
helps you look out for traps all right

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.820 
helps you look out for traps all right
SNES<00:03:18.150> ass<00:03:19.140> nests<00:03:20.120> launched<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.209> 1990<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.260> think

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
SNES ass nests launched in 1990 I think

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.140 
SNES ass nests launched in 1990 I think
they<00:03:23.100> used<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.370> call<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.820> think<00:03:24.000> was<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
they used to call it I think was the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.560 
they used to call it I think was the
Famicom<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:25.080> Japan<00:03:25.459> when<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.549> came<00:03:26.730> out<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
Famicom in Japan when it came out the

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.800 
Famicom in Japan when it came out the
forest<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.110> Zelda<00:03:28.680> Zelda<00:03:29.480> what<00:03:30.480> does<00:03:30.780> that

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
forest of Zelda Zelda what does that

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.220 
forest of Zelda Zelda what does that
sound<00:03:31.350> like<00:03:31.940> yeah<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> great<00:03:33.780> console

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
sound like yeah this is a great console

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.330 
sound like yeah this is a great console
I<00:03:34.530> was<00:03:34.860> not<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> Nintendo<00:03:36.060> person<00:03:36.570> though

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
I was not a Nintendo person though

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.170 
I was not a Nintendo person though

other stream of consoles I guess my

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.390

wasn't<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.600> very<00:03:56.630> popular<00:03:57.260> console<00:03:57.680> though<00:03:57.920> so

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
wasn't a very popular console though so

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.820 
wasn't a very popular console though so
it<00:03:58.340> didn't<00:03:58.670> get<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.820> whole<00:03:59.120> lot<00:03:59.330> of<00:03:59.390> play<00:04:00.290> but<00:04:00.650> it

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
it didn't get a whole lot of play but it

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.920 
it didn't get a whole lot of play but it
came<00:04:00.980> out<00:04:01.190> when<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.400> NES<00:04:01.790> came<00:04:02.030> out<00:04:02.240> and<00:04:02.540> it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
came out when the NES came out and it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.050 
came out when the NES came out and it
was<00:04:02.990> 16-bit<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.250> was<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.460> little<00:04:04.850> bit

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
was 16-bit so it was a little bit

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.310 
was 16-bit so it was a little bit
advanced<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.940> then<00:04:08.180> when<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.510> SNES<00:04:08.930> came

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
advanced the and then when the SNES came

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.660 
advanced the and then when the SNES came
out<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.890> had<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:10.550> Sega<00:04:10.970> Genesis<00:04:11.770> so<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.130> never

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
out I had a Sega Genesis so I never

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.449 
out I had a Sega Genesis so I never
really<00:04:14.390> got<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.720> experience<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:15.530> until<00:04:16.100> much

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
really got to experience this until much

but great system amazing platformers

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.720 
but great system amazing platformers
obviously<00:04:29.260> they<00:04:30.260> got<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.530> graphics<00:04:30.950> down<00:04:31.190> and

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
obviously they got the graphics down and

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.760 
obviously they got the graphics down and
now<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.180> controls<00:04:32.810> in<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.020> game<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.680> know

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
now the controls in the game you know

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.430 
now the controls in the game you know
actually<00:04:34.340> feel<00:04:34.700> I<00:04:35.060> think<00:04:35.600> they<00:04:35.840> actually<00:04:35.960> feel

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
actually feel I think they actually feel

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.870 
actually feel I think they actually feel
probably<00:04:36.800> pretty<00:04:37.160> close<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.970> what<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.840> SNES

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
probably pretty close to what the SNES

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.620 
probably pretty close to what the SNES
feeling<00:04:40.880> would<00:04:41.150> be<00:04:41.270> like<00:04:42.490> all<00:04:43.490> right<00:04:43.550> on<00:04:44.150> to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
feeling would be like all right on to

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.600 
feeling would be like all right on to
the<00:04:45.200> final<00:04:45.980> console<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:47.750> game<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.800> amiga

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
the final console of the game the amiga

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.280 
the final console of the game the amiga
amiga<00:04:50.210> 500<00:04:51.280> so<00:04:52.510> 1987<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.660> feel<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.110> one's

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
amiga 500 so 1987 I feel like this one's

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.180 
amiga 500 so 1987 I feel like this one's
out<00:04:54.500> of<00:04:54.590> order

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
out of order

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.770 
out of order
I<00:04:55.220> think<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.640> should<00:04:55.820> feel<00:04:56.330> like<00:04:56.390> it<00:04:56.540> should<00:04:56.690> go

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
I think it should feel like it should go

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.680 
I think it should feel like it should go
before<00:04:57.250> before<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.490> SNES<00:04:58.850> I'm<00:04:59.270> not<00:04:59.450> sure<00:04:59.570> why

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
before before the SNES I'm not sure why

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.719 
before before the SNES I'm not sure why
they<00:04:59.810> put<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.050> here<00:05:00.940> anyways<00:05:01.940> yeah<00:05:02.240> it's

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
they put it here anyways yeah it's

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.110 
they put it here anyways yeah it's
interesting

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
interesting

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.360 
interesting
paranoid<00:05:06.040> 19<00:05:07.750> paranoid<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:09.070> think<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.220> was<00:05:10.340> a

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
paranoid 19 paranoid I think that was a

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
paranoid 19 paranoid I think that was a
game<00:05:10.700> known<00:05:11.419> for<00:05:11.990> what<00:05:12.979> they<00:05:13.130> call<00:05:13.390> bass

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
game known for what they call bass

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.750 
game known for what they call bass
relief<00:05:15.080> I'm<00:05:15.650> probably<00:05:15.890> saying<00:05:16.130> it<00:05:16.280> wrong<00:05:16.370> bass

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
relief I'm probably saying it wrong bass

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.000 
relief I'm probably saying it wrong bass
relief<00:05:17.120> Beth's<00:05:17.390> relief<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.930> it's<00:05:18.770> where<00:05:18.979> you

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
relief Beth's relief and it's where you

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.100 
relief Beth's relief and it's where you
used<00:05:19.490> three<00:05:19.729> different<00:05:19.820> colors<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.810> simulate

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
used three different colors to simulate

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.900 
used three different colors to simulate
a<00:05:22.780> like<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:23.810> 3d<00:05:24.350> texture<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.550> looks<00:05:25.820> like

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
a like a 3d texture so it looks like

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.840 
a like a 3d texture so it looks like
there's<00:05:26.210> death<00:05:26.560> but<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:28.400> know<00:05:28.520> it's

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
there's death but you know it's

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.110 
there's death but you know it's
obviously<00:05:29.360> it's<00:05:29.570> just<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.870> 2d<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:31.100> 2d<00:05:31.430> game<00:05:31.669> so

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
obviously it's just a 2d the 2d game so

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.050 
obviously it's just a 2d the 2d game so
I<00:05:32.360> mean<00:05:33.169> games<00:05:33.410> really<00:05:33.710> you<00:05:34.280> know<00:05:34.400> really<00:05:34.729> ran

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
I mean games really you know really ran

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.270 
I mean games really you know really ran
with<00:05:35.090> this<00:05:35.390> style<00:05:35.600> later<00:05:35.900> on<00:05:36.140> especially<00:05:36.919> on

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
with this style later on especially on

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.719 
with this style later on especially on
Sega<00:05:37.610> but<00:05:38.510> it's<00:05:39.410> kind<00:05:39.620> of<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.800> kind<00:05:40.340> of<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.460> cool

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
Sega but it's kind of a kind of a cool

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.360 
Sega but it's kind of a kind of a cool
school<00:05:41.300> style<00:05:41.540> and<00:05:42.010> definitely<00:05:43.010> like<00:05:43.220> yeah

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
school style and definitely like yeah

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.140 
school style and definitely like yeah
the<00:05:43.580> artwork<00:05:43.940> in<00:05:44.120> here<00:05:45.370> definitely<00:05:46.370> feels<00:05:46.760> to

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
the artwork in here definitely feels to

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.370 
the artwork in here definitely feels to
me<00:05:47.180> this<00:05:47.479> feels<00:05:47.540> a<00:05:47.780> little<00:05:47.870> bit<00:05:48.050> more<00:05:48.229> like

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
me this feels a little bit more like

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.490 
me this feels a little bit more like
Sega<00:05:48.860> Sega<00:05:49.340> style<00:05:49.760> this<00:05:50.510> level<00:05:50.810> was<00:05:51.050> another

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
Sega Sega style this level was another

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.610 
Sega Sega style this level was another
really<00:05:51.860> tricky<00:05:52.280> one<00:05:52.600> 39<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:54.140> those<00:05:54.290> little

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
really tricky one 39 of those little

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.659 
really tricky one 39 of those little
diamonds<00:05:55.660> so<00:05:56.660> it<00:05:57.080> was<00:05:57.260> yeah<00:05:57.620> really<00:05:58.010> hard<00:05:58.340> the

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
diamonds so it was yeah really hard the

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.730 
diamonds so it was yeah really hard the
jump<00:05:59.000> started<00:05:59.479> getting<00:05:59.720> tricky<00:06:00.140> the

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
jump started getting tricky the

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.310 
jump started getting tricky the
Ninian<00:06:01.190> starts<00:06:01.640> shooting<00:06:02.120> at<00:06:02.210> me<00:06:02.450> and<00:06:03.140> this

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
Ninian starts shooting at me and this

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.380 
Ninian starts shooting at me and this
was<00:06:03.530> the<00:06:03.680> first<00:06:04.040> you<00:06:04.460> know<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.610> first<00:06:04.730> level

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
was the first you know the first level

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.950 
was the first you know the first level
of<00:06:05.540> the<00:06:06.110> Amiga<00:06:06.890> so<00:06:07.190> presumably<00:06:07.780> they<00:06:08.780> get<00:06:08.930> a

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
of the Amiga so presumably they get a

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.210 
of the Amiga so presumably they get a
lot<00:06:09.110> harder<00:06:09.350> as<00:06:09.680> well<00:06:09.890> so<00:06:10.670> it's<00:06:10.880> pretty<00:06:12.220> yeah

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
lot harder as well so it's pretty yeah

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.880 
lot harder as well so it's pretty yeah
it's<00:06:13.580> it<00:06:13.880> was<00:06:14.000> definitely<00:06:14.450> challenging

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
it's it was definitely challenging

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.150 
it's it was definitely challenging
I<00:06:15.920> prefer<00:06:16.760> sort<00:06:17.090> of<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.630> shorter<00:06:18.050> levels<00:06:18.380> but

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
I prefer sort of the shorter levels but

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.340 
I prefer sort of the shorter levels but
I<00:06:19.520> think<00:06:19.910> you<00:06:20.330> know<00:06:20.450> you<00:06:20.510> definitely<00:06:20.990> kind<00:06:21.320> of

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
I think you know you definitely kind of

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.620 
I think you know you definitely kind of
work<00:06:21.560> your<00:06:21.740> way<00:06:21.770> up<00:06:22.190> to<00:06:22.550> this<00:06:22.700> length<00:06:23.150> of<00:06:23.450> a

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
work your way up to this length of a

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.520 
work your way up to this length of a
level<00:06:24.280> and<00:06:25.570> you<00:06:26.570> know<00:06:26.660> it'd<00:06:26.780> be<00:06:26.900> harder<00:06:27.290> to<00:06:27.410> do

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
level and you know it'd be harder to do

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.790 
level and you know it'd be harder to do
speedruns<00:06:28.100> on<00:06:28.310> these<00:06:28.520> ones<00:06:28.730> but<00:06:29.800> probably

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
speedruns on these ones but probably

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.370 
speedruns on these ones but probably
more<00:06:31.100> rewarding<00:06:32.090> I<00:06:32.330> think<00:06:32.810> due<00:06:33.110> to<00:06:33.230> the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
more rewarding I think due to the

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.220 
more rewarding I think due to the
difficulty<00:06:33.980> of<00:06:34.010> it<00:06:34.390> you<00:06:35.390> know<00:06:35.510> the<00:06:35.810> five

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
difficulty of it you know the five

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.550 
difficulty of it you know the five
second<00:06:36.830> level<00:06:37.160> at<00:06:37.430> the<00:06:37.580> beginning<00:06:37.700> there

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
second level at the beginning there

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.110 
second level at the beginning there
probably<00:06:39.560> gets<00:06:39.800> a<00:06:40.010> little<00:06:40.190> pretty<00:06:40.520> pretty

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
probably gets a little pretty pretty

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.480 
probably gets a little pretty pretty
quick<00:06:41.510> that<00:06:42.500> one<00:06:42.740> I<00:06:42.890> thought<00:06:43.190> I'd<00:06:43.310> kind<00:06:43.460> of

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
quick that one I thought I'd kind of

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.850 
quick that one I thought I'd kind of
secret<00:06:43.940> up<00:06:44.060> at<00:06:44.420> the<00:06:44.660> top<00:06:44.870> there<00:06:45.110> here's

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
secret up at the top there here's

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.310 
secret up at the top there here's
another<00:06:46.100> example<00:06:46.760> of<00:06:47.240> being<00:06:47.840> able<00:06:47.930> to<00:06:48.020> push

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
another example of being able to push

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.640 
another example of being able to push
you<00:06:48.860> know<00:06:48.950> push<00:06:49.220> objects<00:06:49.670> around<00:06:50.380> you'll<00:06:51.380> see

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
you know push objects around you'll see

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.550 
you know push objects around you'll see
them<00:06:51.830> a<00:06:52.010> lot<00:06:52.430> of<00:06:52.520> the<00:06:52.610> minions<00:06:53.060> I<00:06:53.390> I<00:06:53.930> think<00:06:54.350> this

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
them a lot of the minions I I think this

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.180 
them a lot of the minions I I think this
is<00:06:54.740> you<00:06:55.430> know<00:06:55.580> it<00:06:56.450> is<00:06:56.660> true<00:06:57.080> to<00:06:57.500> the<00:06:57.530> era<00:06:57.860> of<00:06:58.040> the

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
is you know it is true to the era of the

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.510 
is you know it is true to the era of the
game<00:06:58.520> but<00:06:59.150> the<00:06:59.300> minions<00:06:59.690> don't<00:07:00.080> have<00:07:00.860> a<00:07:00.890> lot<00:07:01.250> of

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
game but the minions don't have a lot of

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.860 
game but the minions don't have a lot of
intelligence

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
intelligence

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.600 
intelligence
I<00:07:02.900> guess<00:07:03.320> I'd<00:07:03.470> say<00:07:03.650> they're<00:07:03.950> stupid<00:07:04.190> the

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
I guess I'd say they're stupid the

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.910 
I guess I'd say they're stupid the
minions<00:07:04.970> are<00:07:05.120> kind<00:07:05.270> of<00:07:05.300> dumb<00:07:05.500> they<00:07:06.500> they

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
minions are kind of dumb they they

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.390 
minions are kind of dumb they they
follow<00:07:07.280> very<00:07:07.460> linear<00:07:08.210> paths<00:07:08.540> and<00:07:09.020> you<00:07:09.560> can

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
follow very linear paths and you can

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.800 
follow very linear paths and you can
just<00:07:10.580> tell<00:07:10.730> where<00:07:10.910> they're<00:07:11.060> going<00:07:11.330> except<00:07:11.780> for

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
just tell where they're going except for

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.230 
just tell where they're going except for
the<00:07:12.170> few<00:07:12.560> that<00:07:12.590> shoot<00:07:12.950> you<00:07:13.130> those<00:07:13.760> are<00:07:13.970> more

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
the few that shoot you those are more

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.200 
the few that shoot you those are more
unpredictable<00:07:14.690> and<00:07:15.170> some<00:07:16.130> I<00:07:16.340> think<00:07:16.400> follow

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
unpredictable and some I think follow

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.580 
unpredictable and some I think follow
you<00:07:17.360> a<00:07:17.390> little<00:07:17.690> bit<00:07:17.840> but<00:07:18.050> you<00:07:18.260> know<00:07:18.320> see<00:07:18.560> that

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
you a little bit but you know see that

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.340 
you a little bit but you know see that
guy<00:07:18.950> just<00:07:19.310> back<00:07:19.490> and<00:07:19.670> forth<00:07:19.760> back<00:07:20.300> and<00:07:20.540> forth

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
guy just back and forth back and forth

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.160 
guy just back and forth back and forth
so<00:07:22.250> yeah<00:07:22.730> you<00:07:22.790> kind<00:07:23.090> of<00:07:23.210> you<00:07:23.480> know<00:07:23.720> where<00:07:23.960> that

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.170 
so yeah you kind of you know where that

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.220 
so yeah you kind of you know where that
you<00:07:24.650> know<00:07:24.770> where<00:07:24.920> he's<00:07:25.100> going<00:07:25.600> so<00:07:26.600> hopefully

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
you know where he's going so hopefully

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.380 
you know where he's going so hopefully
they'll<00:07:27.440> I<00:07:27.860> mean<00:07:28.460> I<00:07:28.550> know<00:07:28.820> they<00:07:29.030> want<00:07:29.180> to<00:07:29.240> stay

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
they'll I mean I know they want to stay

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.680 
they'll I mean I know they want to stay
true<00:07:29.780> to<00:07:29.810> the<00:07:30.140> system<00:07:31.070> so<00:07:31.400> but<00:07:32.150> I<00:07:32.180> think<00:07:32.510> maybe

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
true to the system so but I think maybe

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.970 
true to the system so but I think maybe
that's<00:07:32.870> one<00:07:33.110> thing<00:07:33.260> they<00:07:33.410> can<00:07:33.560> kind<00:07:33.770> of<00:07:33.830> play

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:33.980 
that's one thing they can kind of play

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.610 
that's one thing they can kind of play
around<00:07:34.100> with<00:07:34.690> but<00:07:35.690> if<00:07:36.350> you're<00:07:36.530> doing

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:36.620 
around with but if you're doing

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.350 
around with but if you're doing
speedruns<00:07:37.250> it<00:07:37.460> definitely<00:07:37.790> helps<00:07:38.060> that<00:07:38.210> they

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 
speedruns it definitely helps that they

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.330 
speedruns it definitely helps that they
they<00:07:38.900> don't<00:07:39.020> chase<00:07:39.410> you<00:07:39.590> or<00:07:39.740> anything<00:07:39.920> so

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
they don't chase you or anything so

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.370 
they don't chase you or anything so
that's<00:07:41.300> probably<00:07:41.720> good<00:07:41.930> for<00:07:42.110> now

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 
that's probably good for now

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.280 
that's probably good for now
those<00:07:42.500> spikes<00:07:43.040> oh<00:07:43.400> those<00:07:44.360> would<00:07:44.720> kill<00:07:45.050> me<00:07:45.260> so

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.290 
those spikes oh those would kill me so

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.680 
those spikes oh those would kill me so
many<00:07:45.620> times<00:07:45.950> I<00:07:46.310> chopped<00:07:46.940> out<00:07:47.120> all<00:07:47.300> my<00:07:47.450> deaths

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:47.690 
many times I chopped out all my deaths

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.480 
many times I chopped out all my deaths
but<00:07:47.990> you<00:07:48.110> can<00:07:48.260> kind<00:07:48.470> of<00:07:48.530> get<00:07:48.680> an<00:07:48.800> idea<00:07:48.890> of<00:07:49.250> how

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.490 
but you can kind of get an idea of how

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.030 
but you can kind of get an idea of how
long<00:07:49.790> I've<00:07:50.750> been<00:07:50.810> playing<00:07:51.260> for<00:07:51.530> I<00:07:51.590> think<00:07:51.740> it

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.040 
long I've been playing for I think it

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.850 
long I've been playing for I think it
gives<00:07:52.340> you<00:07:52.490> a<00:07:52.520> total<00:07:53.000> time<00:07:53.210> maybe<00:07:53.540> on<00:07:53.960> the<00:07:54.230> ends

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:54.860 
gives you a total time maybe on the ends

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.540 
gives you a total time maybe on the ends
grants<00:07:55.540> but<00:07:56.540> this<00:07:56.990> level<00:07:57.320> definitely<00:07:57.800> took<00:07:58.160> a

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:58.550 
grants but this level definitely took a

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.330 
grants but this level definitely took a
number<00:07:59.300> of<00:07:59.420> tries<00:07:59.660> for<00:07:59.930> sure<00:08:00.140> and<00:08:00.650> I<00:08:01.130> think

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:01.340 
number of tries for sure and I think

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.820 
number of tries for sure and I think
some<00:08:01.550> earlier<00:08:01.880> levels<00:08:02.300> took<00:08:02.510> took<00:08:02.990> a<00:08:03.050> lot<00:08:03.320> so

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:03.830 
some earlier levels took took a lot so

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.590 
some earlier levels took took a lot so
yeah<00:08:03.980> check<00:08:04.010> this<00:08:04.370> out<00:08:04.550> on<00:08:04.700> Steam<00:08:04.970> getting
