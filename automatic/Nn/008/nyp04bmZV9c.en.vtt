you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.650> that's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can down the way that all that's

you can down the way that all that's
natural<00:01:11.370> flow<00:01:11.520> down<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.720> want<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
natural flow down there but we want to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.590 
natural flow down there but we want to
develop<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.560> area<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.280> climb<00:01:14.850> every

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
develop an area that we can climb every

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.260

year<00:01:15.780> not<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.590> good<00:01:16.770> idea<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.850> more<00:01:18.030> ice

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
year not just the good idea the more ice
there<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.260> thicker<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> builds<00:01:20.070> up

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
you know this is our first year doing it

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.460 
you know this is our first year doing it
we<00:03:25.360> never<00:03:25.510> dreamed<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.020> we<00:03:26.200> were<00:03:26.290> going<00:03:26.380> to

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
we never dreamed that we were going to

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.630 
we never dreamed that we were going to
have<00:03:26.680> such<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.270> solid<00:03:28.680> coverage<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.860> ice<00:03:30.400> we

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
have such a solid coverage of ice we

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.730 
have such a solid coverage of ice we
think<00:03:30.970> we're<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.540> gonna<00:03:31.660> have<00:03:31.780> like<00:03:32.020> pillars

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
think we're just gonna have like pillars

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.980 
think we're just gonna have like pillars
here<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.220> here<00:03:33.459> so<00:03:33.910> now<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.360> where<00:03:34.690> the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
here and here so now this is where the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.900 
here and here so now this is where the
main<00:03:35.200> water<00:03:35.590> flows<00:03:36.070> down<00:03:36.400> into<00:03:36.820> the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
main water flows down into the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.180 
main water flows down into the
infrastructure<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.870> can<00:03:38.740> see<00:03:38.920> we<00:03:39.040> can

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
infrastructure you can see we can

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.670 
infrastructure you can see we can
isolate<00:03:39.370> both<00:03:40.000> sides<00:03:40.420> both<00:03:40.780> trunks<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.440> call

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
isolate both sides both trunks I call

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.070 
isolate both sides both trunks I call
them<00:03:41.860> we<00:03:42.790> can<00:03:42.940> turn<00:03:43.150> them<00:03:43.300> on<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.600> off<00:03:43.690> with

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
them we can turn them on and off with

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.040 
them we can turn them on and off with
just<00:03:44.470> these<00:03:44.620> there's<00:03:45.610> sliding<00:03:46.330> valves<00:03:46.720> and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
just these there's sliding valves and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.410 
just these there's sliding valves and
the<00:03:47.590> water<00:03:47.830> source<00:03:48.220> it's<00:03:48.670> about<00:03:48.790> 600<00:03:49.180> feet

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
the water source it's about 600 feet

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.080 
the water source it's about 600 feet
from<00:03:49.780> here<00:03:50.140> we<00:03:50.500> go<00:03:50.650> from<00:03:50.890> one<00:03:51.100> inch<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.400> an<00:03:51.970> inch

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
from here we go from one inch to an inch

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.699 
from here we go from one inch to an inch
and<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.300> half<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.690> then<00:03:52.810> this<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.140> two<00:03:53.320> inch<00:03:53.530> so

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
and a half and then this is two inch so

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.229 
and a half and then this is two inch so
we<00:03:53.739> kind<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.040> step<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.430> up<00:03:54.520> as<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.820> gets<00:03:54.970> closer

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
we kind of step it up as it gets closer

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.420 
we kind of step it up as it gets closer
to<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.540> clip<00:03:55.750> wow<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.860> long<00:03:57.160> way<00:03:57.400> to

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
to the clip wow that is a long way to

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.760 
to the clip wow that is a long way to
run<00:03:57.700> water<00:03:57.910> in<00:03:58.209> exposed<00:03:58.660> lines<00:03:58.989> during<00:03:59.320> winter

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
run water in exposed lines during winter

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.699 
run water in exposed lines during winter
but<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.610> works<00:04:00.820> they<00:04:01.690> keep<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.050> flowing<00:04:02.320> and

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
but it works they keep it flowing and

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.410 
but it works they keep it flowing and
drain<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.190> after<00:04:03.489> they're<00:04:03.640> done<00:04:03.790> farming<00:04:04.270> nice

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
drain it after they're done farming nice

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.410 
drain it after they're done farming nice
it<00:04:04.780> was<00:04:04.930> hugely<00:04:05.830> successful<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.850> mean<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.180> three

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
it was hugely successful I mean in three

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.510 
it was hugely successful I mean in three
days<00:04:07.570> we<00:04:07.840> made<00:04:08.020> more<00:04:08.230> ice<00:04:08.440> than<00:04:08.470> was<00:04:09.100> there<00:04:09.310> all

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
days we made more ice than was there all

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.350 
days we made more ice than was there all
last<00:04:09.790> year

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
last year

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.780 
last year
and<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.080> think<00:04:11.140> over<00:04:11.680> time<00:04:11.709> people<00:04:12.280> are<00:04:12.670> gonna

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
and I think over time people are gonna

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.040 
and I think over time people are gonna
recognize<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:13.840> they're<00:04:13.930> gonna

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
recognize that and they're gonna

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.930 
recognize that and they're gonna
recognize<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.770> there<00:04:14.980> instead<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.459> this<00:04:15.670> one

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
recognize that there instead of this one

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.539 
recognize that there instead of this one
small<00:04:16.780> flow<00:04:17.140> edge<00:04:17.290> there's<00:04:17.829> gonna<00:04:17.980> be<00:04:18.250> a

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
small flow edge there's gonna be a

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.750 
small flow edge there's gonna be a
hundred<00:04:19.299> feet<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:20.109> big<00:04:20.709> thick<00:04:21.010> ice<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.519> climb

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
hundred feet of a big thick ice to climb

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.450 
hundred feet of a big thick ice to climb
we<00:04:22.720> can<00:04:22.870> have<00:04:23.050> 10<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.500> 30<00:04:23.770> climbers<00:04:24.280> on<00:04:24.430> a

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
we can have 10 to 30 climbers on a

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.830 
we can have 10 to 30 climbers on a
weekend<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.270> think<00:04:25.510> with<00:04:26.550> now<00:04:27.550> having<00:04:28.000> an<00:04:28.600> ice

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
weekend I think with now having an ice

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.719 
weekend I think with now having an ice
bar<00:04:29.169> cat<00:04:29.350> farming<00:04:29.830> ice<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.340> having<00:04:30.700> a

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
consistency where people know that if

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.550 
consistency where people know that if
the<00:04:33.880> drives<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.330> sandstone<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.050> there<00:04:35.380> will

the drives to sandstone that there will

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.420 
the drives to sandstone that there will
be<00:04:35.590> ice<00:04:35.890> here

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
be ice here
