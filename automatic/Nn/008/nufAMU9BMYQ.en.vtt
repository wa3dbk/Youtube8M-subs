00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.100
 but 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.820
 good afternoon friends in this green not every 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.600
 work on machine tools with numeric 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.270
 programmed someone beautifully 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.559
 lays brick walls carpenter thread 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.540
 tight cheat works as a blacksmith 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.980
 someone very expertly cuts 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.700
 packed snow shovel every 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 doing some work in this life 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.630
 but this work is work only then 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 brings full satisfaction when he 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.400
 you like 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.500
 when you do court with him guest 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 this is the biggest motivation for this 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.329
 your you now many millions of rivers 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.840
 stuck if that tell on the Internet 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.729
 they communicate in social networks 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.240
 get acquainted just spending time someone 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.240
 makes appointments and quite a few of them 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.350
 separates from the moment from creation 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.190
 own site when it them 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.210
 pleasure would coincide with earnings 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.360
 real day 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.560
 There are a lot of video tutorials on the Internet. 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.200
 building your own cms sites 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.940
 Joomla system sometimes even wonder 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.580
 advertisement 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.640
 who are implementing a similar video course 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 Some authors guarantee that buying 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.630
 by buying and seeing her man 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.240
 do not understand anything in site building 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.420
 never seen in the eyes this is the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.080
 system not understanding and structure and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.489
 functions and directories will be able to do 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.190
 professional site populated numbers 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.790
 some even promise three hours 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.620
 some even for 10 and sometimes 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 the duration of the training video itself 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.410
 exceeds the declared for construction 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.970
 say that time is about the same several times 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.360
 the same as the person who 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.880
 interpreted how they sound promised that he 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.730
 very soon will be able to write war and peace 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.320
 but all this is far from true if this is all 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.799
 it was so easy to throw up difficulties and 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.930
 jula developers they are constantly 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.360
 update versions 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.920
 only people got used to the version 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.299
 joblo one you look already new joblo 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.630
 Jumla and a half 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.670
 significantly changed the code and did 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.060
 Jumlu 1 of 6 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.269
 then one and seven reached for Joomla two 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.690
 and a half which is now 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.860
 main 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.940
 but also the support will be finished until 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.910
 the end of next year 2014 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.110
 which means to build a site on Joomla two with 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.870
 half already practically 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.880
 unpromising therefore the course of their 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.550
 lessons, I have a different new 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.300
 jun 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.410
 lit-re I think that if you arrange a site 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.970
 that should have been a site for the future though 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:55.320
 would be two three four years of difficulty 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.330
 current in what is not yet degree 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.340
 joe extensions 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.530
 which complement the main system 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.410
 ready for version 3 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.020
 so about comparing with angle two with 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.640
 half functionally say that with a knife 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.410
 for three there will be some time a little 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.160
 limited but i think already to 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:24.530
 the middle of next year will appear full 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.460
 a set of all extensions that are needed 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.230
 will be the site 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:36.540
 builders in parallel with the publication 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:41.070
 of my lessons on my website 3w. 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:44.750
 Joomla is simple . ru these lessons are 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.390

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.790
 lessons 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:01.530
 on the above site under each 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:04.020
 the lesson will be a file with materials or file 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.919
 for a few lessons 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:12.960
 Immediately those who acquire commercial 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:15.900
 version of these lessons will immediately get daddy 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.169
 have all the materials 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.330
 one file 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:26.840
 the goal of our course is to build 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:32.090
 Here is such a site what you saw on 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.050
 the screen here is such a beautiful site here all 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.560
 in Russian 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.090
 but this is a site we will get you 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.779
 Only at the end of our course here such 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:49.810
 hare modules inside and tough love menu with 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:54.379
 carousel and much more there is in this 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:06:00.199
 the site let's change the color of the template 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:06:03.469
 without entering files through daytime design on 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.669
 place and so here is such a site we have to 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:08.360
 will get 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:12.680
 home page cat other pages 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:17.629
 of this site like this 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:21.259
 will you can instead of these articles 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:25.699
 then install your articles your modules 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:28.279
 and adapt it to the topic that you 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:32.180
 going to consequences and do but 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:36.740
 while you must repeat after me mine 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:41.750
 lessons and build a site like this 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:46.149
 me a sample or reference of this site 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:49.659
 is this site an exact copy 

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:51.800
 the site that we have to do 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:55.639
 given feet 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.009
 ice te studio and the truth released 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.939
 specially 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:04.869
 from the plague 3 here is such a wonderful template 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:08.949
 and learn how they called themselves with icy 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:12.520
 the future is so cold that he 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:16.960
 we really liked and we will build 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:21.240

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:36.599
 one archive therefore this site we can 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.229
