00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and hi to all gamers and art who 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.259
 want heels we end up 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.840
 today for the third part of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.170
 exo gameplay are bi d they know 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.540
 on call of duty advanced warfare we 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.170
 we are already the fly 10 we continue to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.330
 turn around 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.800
 still nothing exciting we have 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.760
 still not enough money to get 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.670
 pay a good weapon 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.039
 we are still at the class 45 tears of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.260
 base is good kill zombies 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.539
 what more can we say we kill zombies we have 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 opened the door to access 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.590
 the 3d printer what is the equivalent 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.309
 from the mystery box I remind you 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 in the old opus so we get 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.280
 finally a few investigating points and in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.739
 firing on zombies in order to get 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.539
 new weapons and move forward in the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 sleeves 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.809
 so I still do not have enough money 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.899
 as you can see we come 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.510
 to get a security asset that allows 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.430
 to the doors in fact to close on 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.579
 the zombies it's really very close 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 very practical it can eliminate a number 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.340
 considerable zombies per minute 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's pretty cool 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.020
 so I do not know much to say in 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.170
 on this gameplay because to advance 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.570
 quite slowly frankly and in 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.300
 general we will not hold a lot of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.220
 branches dance gameplay nke 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.700
 did have a house guy is all 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.320
 just the infected enemy are not going 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.900
 delay to arrive we have already met 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.160
 some electric zombies a drop 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.780
 refueling has just been resumed 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.640
 the paths of the mystery box 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.830
 I got a gun finally I 'm going 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.040
 enough money 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:49.090
 so we got an ace 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.690
 m in I believe in my screen for 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.840
 comment to those little names that I you 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.220
 will say that in the teeth the description 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.600
 of the video because I'm not sure 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.370
 joy joy is fine but I believe that his 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.710
 soldiers and his hands on Saturday some 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.010
 thing so here we advance in the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.610
 pieces there we will soon arrive in the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.290
 piece of exoskeletons there we come to 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.490
 an important point of the secret of 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.380
 the explosion be so after having 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.660
 put the box we harvested on the to 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.810
 episode 1 on a desk 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.590
 there we just went with the big one 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 large platform will have to recover 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.090
 the crush exo that's in the room 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.670
 where we are and dash is safe 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.209
 on this platform in order to make it 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.670
 go down after having shot after 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.970
 multiple times on a piston so 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.720
 that it loose and the card arrives and we 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.310
 will have to collect four cards and once 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.680
 once it will be done a great 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.870
 series of zombie killings finally at home 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.269
 explains it's pretty bad to see them and 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.110
 videos 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:01.239
 explanatory of warteck for example and 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.569
 the people explains us years ago 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.769
 far better than me and water for for 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.870
 this secret of the exo zobi it really needs 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.700
 to many it's really extremely 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.400
 more complicated I want to do everything 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.560
 only after must be funny very strong 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.650
 in zombie mode to accomplish it all 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.269
 alone because in fact an offer of 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.519
 advantages and disadvantages since 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.140
 in simple mode the goals for the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.200
 cards will be simpler to accomplish 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.879
 however you will have a lot more 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.810
 evil to eliminate the zombies you 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.030
 you will survive month sleeve while in 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.799
 Multiplayer mans will emerge over 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.230
 sleeves against the cards will be 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.410
 much harder to get 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.879
 there we just got the crossbow that that 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.609
 will really help us it's a but 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.069
 it's a lady who preferred mode 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.420
 exerbeat this opus is really nice 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.670
 to have an agreement to be comfortable 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.859
 because it avoids grenades 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.680
 it's really nice, you'll see that 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.079
 we're going to use it a lot in 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.079
 the next episode and even a little towards the 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.349
 end and that's it we activated the current of 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:14.139
 the room o2 is exoskeleton and so 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.870
 we just collected 1 and finally we 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:19.720
 can a little flat is finally not hovering 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.979
 but we can we can not want 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.710
 go down pretty cool 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.020
 here we can and we can dodge 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.880
 the zombies a lot easier 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.250
 access to bridges with really 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.930
 really simplicity simplicity 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.970
 increased thanks to this exoskeleton 1 so 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.430
 we move into multiple rooms you 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.540
 can see the atmosphere of this exo 1000 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.890
 frankly I like that side 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.210
 laboratory to the sellers in it in 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.610
 the company within the company 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.060
 atlas I find it really well 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.710
 modeled good in the meantime I'm telling you to 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.240
 tomorrow for the next episode of 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.240
 the exome says ciao the gamer
