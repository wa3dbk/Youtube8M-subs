there<00:03:51.130> were<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.280> couple<00:03:51.340> things<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.970> did<00:03:52.150> not

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
there were a couple things I did not

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.120 
there were a couple things I did not
like<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:53.019> main<00:03:53.170> one<00:03:53.350> being<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.890> court

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
like the main one being that the court

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.069 
like the main one being that the court
is<00:03:54.220> not<00:03:54.370> detachable<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.510> beach<00:03:55.690> which

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
is not detachable like the beach which

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.990 
is not detachable like the beach which
is<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.320> concern<00:03:56.769> because<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.310> know<00:03:57.459> if<00:03:57.579> a<00:03:57.670> chord

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
is a concern because you know if a chord

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.940 
is a concern because you know if a chord
were<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.420> break<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:58.870> would<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.470> dump<00:03:59.739> the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
were to break I would have to dump the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.430 
were to break I would have to dump the
whole<00:03:59.980> head<00:04:00.340> spin<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.780> other<00:04:01.930> thing<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.260> did

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
whole head spin the other thing I did

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.350 
whole head spin the other thing I did
not<00:04:02.560> like<00:04:02.769> was<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.010> they<00:04:03.579> did<00:04:03.790> fold<00:04:04.150> as

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
not like was that they did fold as

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.479 
not like was that they did fold as
compact<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.320> beats<00:04:05.500> did<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
compact as the beats did and the

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.250 
compact as the beats did and the
carrying<00:04:06.910> case<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.630> came<00:04:07.810> with<00:04:07.840> his<00:04:08.110> very

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
carrying case that it came with his very

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.630 
carrying case that it came with his very
underwhelming<00:04:08.829> as<00:04:08.950> well<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.190> mean<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.519> was<00:04:09.610> just

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
underwhelming as well I mean it was just

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.420 
underwhelming as well I mean it was just
a<00:04:09.880> pouch<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.600> it's<00:04:11.440> like<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> pouch<00:04:11.980> will<00:04:12.280> not

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
a pouch and it's like a pouch will not

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.300 
a pouch and it's like a pouch will not
protect<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:13.000> from<00:04:13.269> damage<00:04:13.540> but<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:14.829> know<00:04:14.950> the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
protect it from damage but you know the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.550 
protect it from damage but you know the
headphones<00:04:15.700> were<00:04:16.060> built<00:04:16.299> pretty<00:04:16.780> sturdy<00:04:17.200> so

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
headphones were built pretty sturdy so

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.640 
headphones were built pretty sturdy so
maybe<00:04:17.739> that's<00:04:17.950> where<00:04:18.130> they<00:04:18.220> made<00:04:18.400> up

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
maybe that's where they made up

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.890 
maybe that's where they made up
for<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.889> but<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.000> one<00:04:20.120> thing<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:20.389> made<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
for it but the one thing that made the

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.600 
for it but the one thing that made the
decision<00:04:21.350> easier<00:04:21.709> between<00:04:21.889> choosing<00:04:22.340> the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
decision easier between choosing the

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.370

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
the price the audio técnicas were

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.909 
the price the audio técnicas were
cheaper<00:04:26.840> than<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.020> beats<00:04:27.320> for<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.680> quality

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
cheaper than the beats for the quality

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.640 
cheaper than the beats for the quality
