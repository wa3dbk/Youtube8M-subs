00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
slightly more professional in these

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.400

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
the screen shield which is really really

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.920 
the screen shield which is really really
nice<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.880> think<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.120> great<00:02:50.300> when<00:02:50.540> companies

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
nice I think it's great when companies

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.720 
nice I think it's great when companies

front<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.910> can<00:02:56.060> see<00:02:56.269> how<00:02:56.450> reflected<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:57.560> is

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
front you can see how reflected this is

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.470 
front you can see how reflected this is
compared<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> matte<00:02:58.400> screen<00:02:58.580> shot<00:02:58.880> on<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
compared to the matte screen shot on the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.210 
compared to the matte screen shot on the
front<00:02:59.720> this<00:02:59.870> really<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.470> fitted<00:03:00.769> on<00:03:00.860> really

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
front this really just fitted on really

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.280 
front this really just fitted on really
easily<00:03:01.459> on<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.970> easy<00:03:02.450> skims<00:03:02.780> one<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.140> was<00:03:03.260> a

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
easily on the easy skims one it was a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.449 
easily on the easy skims one it was a
little<00:03:03.500> bit<00:03:03.620> more<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:03.860> shuffle<00:03:04.069> I<00:03:04.280> mean<00:03:04.400> I

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
little bit more of a shuffle I mean I

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.580 
little bit more of a shuffle I mean I
think<00:03:04.519> he<00:03:04.760> looks<00:03:04.940> pretty<00:03:05.000> much<00:03:05.360> as<00:03:05.540> good<00:03:05.600> but

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
think he looks pretty much as good but

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.870 
think he looks pretty much as good but
it<00:03:06.680> was<00:03:06.769> a<00:03:06.800> lot<00:03:06.980> more<00:03:07.010> faffing<00:03:07.459> around<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.850> I

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
it was a lot more faffing around and I

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.220 
it was a lot more faffing around and I
just<00:03:08.030> said<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> bit<00:03:08.690> more<00:03:08.810> malleable

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
just said this is a bit more malleable

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.080 
just said this is a bit more malleable
so<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.739> flap<00:03:10.010> around<00:03:10.130> with<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.519> but<00:03:11.000> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
so you can flap around with it but it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.210 
so you can flap around with it but it
doesn't<00:03:11.239> seem<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.569> lay<00:03:11.720> quite<00:03:12.140> as<00:03:12.290> exactly<00:03:12.739> on

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
doesn't seem to lay quite as exactly on

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.860 
doesn't seem to lay quite as exactly on
the<00:03:13.310> first<00:03:13.550> go<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.360> other<00:03:14.480> things<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
the first go the other things on the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.660 
the first go the other things on the
front<00:03:15.080> if<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.260> can<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.739> easy<00:03:16.040> skins<00:03:16.400> hole

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
front if you can see the easy skins hole

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.210 
front if you can see the easy skins hole
is<00:03:16.970> slightly<00:03:17.269> bigger<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.380> snick<00:03:19.010> wraps

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
is slightly bigger and the snick wraps

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.680 
is slightly bigger and the snick wraps
on<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.459> slightly<00:03:19.700> smaller<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.450> everything

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
on is slightly smaller so everything

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.729 
on is slightly smaller so everything
about<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.900> snick<00:03:21.110> wraps<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.440> just<00:03:21.560> slightly

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
about the snick wraps is just slightly

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.150 
about the snick wraps is just slightly
more<00:03:21.950> precise<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.630> again<00:03:24.560> at<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.709> top<00:03:24.920> you've

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
more precise and again at the top you've

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.650 
more precise and again at the top you've
got<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.340> two<00:03:25.489> holes<00:03:25.790> on<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.180> snick<00:03:26.420> wraps

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
got the two holes on the snick wraps

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.590 
got the two holes on the snick wraps
compared<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.410> gap<00:03:27.799> on<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.040> ez<00:03:28.280> skins<00:03:28.600> the

compared to the gap on the ez skins the

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.880 
compared to the gap on the ez skins the
other<00:03:29.750> difference<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.170> fans<00:03:30.440> can<00:03:30.650> be<00:03:30.739> kind

other difference that fans can be kind

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.410 
other difference that fans can be kind
of<00:03:30.950> hard<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.130> see<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:31.910> mentioned<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.299> my

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
of hard to see but I mentioned in my

haven't<00:03:54.530> had<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.709> issue<00:03:54.890> at<00:03:55.070> all<00:03:55.220> with<00:03:55.430> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
haven't had this issue at all with the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.090 
haven't had this issue at all with the
slick<00:03:56.390> wraps<00:03:56.630> but<00:03:56.810> also<00:03:56.989> I<00:03:57.410> haven't<00:03:57.920> had<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
slick wraps but also I haven't had the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.199 
slick wraps but also I haven't had the
issue<00:03:58.220> with<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.489> easy<00:03:58.640> Guinness<00:03:58.970> for<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.120> while

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
issue with the easy Guinness for a while

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.430 
issue with the easy Guinness for a while
so<00:03:59.390> maybe<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.750> was<00:03:59.840> just<00:03:59.870> getting<00:04:00.200> rid<00:04:00.380> of

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
so maybe that was just getting rid of

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.410 
so maybe that was just getting rid of
that<00:04:01.160> initial<00:04:01.519> bit<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.700> stick<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.299> can

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420

that initial bit of stick and you can
also<00:04:02.540> see<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.049> think<00:04:03.140> I've<00:04:03.350> got<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.530> focus

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709
