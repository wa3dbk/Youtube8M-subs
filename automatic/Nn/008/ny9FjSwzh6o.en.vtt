00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.050
 to our sector 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.050
 and to the field 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.549
 inside the country 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.689
 also aragon 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.449
 Monsignor Romero will finally be in something that are pending seeing the 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.119
 boys who were now promoting 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.910
 He also stressed how this is just the slab 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.020
 the album came out in the newspaper this week we are going to donate that 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.789
 in union radio or percent here in El Salvador 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.359
 as you know this project called pre-salt 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.640
 we may have forgotten 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.250
 the last century is good 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.060
 p we have started we started being music practically the table and now 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.020
 we are making music a little more critical and that between enough in what 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.310
 is the mind of the young in savior sociologist that you take micro frob 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.300
 palm the men my name is louis louis and the bullfighter we are afraid that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.629
 I go to the pope jajaj in this tournament the pescozada group tell me what his rap 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.180
 I understand that he asks to think positive 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.100
 it has nothing to do with de gea that the myth that rap music is about 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.430
 black music that seeks violence and what was his rap is positive music 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.480
 what happens is that we try to capture the culture the common one has 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.290
 what to express 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.790
 like any ethnic group 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480
 that really represents the culture explained 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.490
 we want to prove it so that it can be called positive because 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.810
 positive way or if you can love him in the right way as well we 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.270
 we close we try to make music that sticks to our reality 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.770
 in the reality of any Salvadoran then what under that index marked 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.689
 We are making the music that supports the lyrics of a group of 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:39.830
 you are music 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.799
 but the punch and music 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.399
 percent with synthesizers and all the pressure but what do the 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.250
 police pensions most of the disk that we are preparing that follow maría 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.820
 suescún 2000 neighborhood 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380
 yes on the subject of the debate the licit teachers' album 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.340
 for us for a hundred and project and all the development of the group 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.530
 been common darkness or against for us for a hundred and project and all the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.290
 development of the group 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.099
 been common darkness where you find yourself in a lot much in me 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.989
 certainly there was enough help to make it a 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.539
 a bomb 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:19.029
 but it really is a woman that unique and what we are expressed by us 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.869
 and it is that this effort our experiences 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.099
 stories of people can not tell the one who wanted to do it 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.840
 and good for that title and their own neighborhoods because we have different 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.149
 the church letters 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.429
 páez and his first album dark days of the neighborhood the song that is sounding 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.789
 strong on the radio as it is called is called coloring and if on the one hand 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:38.620
 is a 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.359
 each production 100% to three things we create everything 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.129
 he has also financed politically for a rap group 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.389
 as duck as blockages must be produced by the for the monetary aspect 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.189
 yes 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.290
 it is quite difficult 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.360
 also that everything about the needs of whoever is doing the music and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 all that then everything we do underground is 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.409
 by the way we follow phyllis that are independent 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.269
 i know they refer to their texier terrarium 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.899
 the opposite to a whole 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.099
 for a hundred then at low belt costs doing you got the surprise 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.800
 low budget your by your own means 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.239
 the trying to do things 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.390
 but watching the series, that's what's important, it's like that because that's 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.160
 important because there are rap groups 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.299
 they have the means they do not want to do 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.169
 and you are that they have that the desire to do it 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.589
 and that's good because they are promoting themselves come from chalatenango 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:30.840
 salvador house 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.500
 to be promoted that we listen to several radios 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.910
 I heard them is a useful material or newspapers and how poor the music 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.280
 Salvadoran and sometimes throw something to capel and sharp certification 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.140
 so that they go tonight to see them at their live presentation 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.550
 because therefore something 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.339
 of them something cyclical message for youth 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:51.699
 that we have times udis 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.660
 the message to melinda haag 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.749
 since its creation, the one that is providing the president of the colony 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:01.669
 We're going - they were beautiful being a classic Guadalajara el Corito 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.540
 the route 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.219
 the specialists of the elected fet 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.219

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.959
 athletics and up 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.259

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.660
 I do not retire I did not stop being active member cost was a mere positive 0 + 0 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.449
 what I want is first to get money to live very hard work but 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.159

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.120
 both sides 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.730
 chanting the completed result whips them to two because I have no reason to
