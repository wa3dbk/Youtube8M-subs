00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:18.660
 I once said to myself a big part in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 getting rid of social phobia occupy 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.949
 inner beliefs and attitudes many 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.230
 one's life attitudes are not 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.449
 aware he is used to them you can 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
 trace my thoughts in my head but most 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.289
 sustainable installation due to which we 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.780
 we act in one way or another is somewhere 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 deeper our consciousness is like a prison to us 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.250
 difficult to go beyond it is difficult for us 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 understand that our view of the world is not 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 there is the world itself a social phobia thinks very 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.210
 limited his mind is extremely narrowed he 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.700
 feels like a small part 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.340
 huge aggressive world and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.739
 what is the saddest about his habits he 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.440
 aggravates this position being in 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.270
 apartment in a closed space 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.430
 contribute to the deterioration of this situation 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.899
 even a mentally healthy person if 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.640
 long will be in a closed 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 space will feel 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 uncomfortable with time one must understand for 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.119
 yourself if you want to get rid of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.130
 social phobia need to go to a new 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 level of thinking and give up 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.869
 old thinking the question is how 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.880
 do it and think like mentally 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.759
 healthy man for me in my time 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.710
 There was a whole problem to understand how to think 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.409
 what it feels and how it relates to the world 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.570
 mentally healthy person for a start I 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.579
 defined myself the concept of mentally 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.979
 healthy person make it turned out 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.320
 not so easy as in the surrounding us 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.020
 the world is completely mentally healthy people 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.210
 No, but for myself I still determined how 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 should such a person look like 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.070
 the criterion for me was this harmony with 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.229
 myself and a constant feeling of happiness I 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.420
 presented himself as such a person 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.729
 I presented myself as happy 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.150
 man this image has become my guiding 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.980
 the star next question was 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.650
 then a happy person thinks and feels 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.420
 that is, my image and I began to define 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.970
 my new life attitudes 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.070
 my new relationship to the world which 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.410
 makes me happy I began to write 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.690
 these settings from time to time they 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.150
 changed as they became part of me 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.550
 and I moved on these settings are not 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.210
 self-suggestion is just my new look 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.070
 on the world 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.260
 someone looks at the world and thinks that everything 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.660
 awful someone just watching and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.210
 rejoices that lives the choice is yours 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
 so here I made my choice I decided 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.530
 completely abandon the old mindset 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.870
 for a new happy life and it turned out 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.910
 totally right to be 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.280
 happy in this life is necessary 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.920
 love this very life and yourself 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.260
 as part of the world it is an urgent fact as 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.510
 I can't do it seriously 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.220
 Fully convey how I did 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.860
 but I can say for sure it was 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.090
 lengthy persuasion process 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.730
 observing stepping over their 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.220
 past representations love life this 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.590
 probably the most difficult task in the world 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.170
 can not also love life and loving 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.390
 yourself every social phobia doesn't love itself or 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.910
 loves some kind of perverted love we 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.010
 love to take root their convictions 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.200
 and never want to change them 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.000
 just think, what if 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.030
 all is not so suddenly in the world everything happens 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.519
 very differently I had a clear goal 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.830
 I am a happy person therefore I knew where 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.870
 I go for myself I determined that I 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.100
 must think when happy and that to me 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.930
 prevents to be happy 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.300
 can not be happy if you feel 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.370
 negative to the people around you we live 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.260
 in the world of people therefore it is necessary to change to them 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.720
 my attitude so here is my main 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.360
 the challenge was to change attitudes towards people 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.580
 every social phobia and not only social phobia 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.560
 thinks that most people are evil 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.420
 think only bad about him 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.459
 can you do the following simple 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.650
 exercise take a piece of paper and 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.110
 write what are the surrounding 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.030
 you people what they are now brave it 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.950
 you can apply to yourself this is such 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.150
 funny joke as a projection we 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.250
 we project on people 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.500
 its bad sides that we don't want 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.630
 recognize in yourself so here's your task for 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.000
 start identifying with your 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.700
 projections if you think surround 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.800
 look evil people mean evil you this fact 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.970
 very difficult to make but 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.060
 vital necessary 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.070
 walk and collect yourself your projections when 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.790
 you realize this fact you open your eyes 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.790
 on the world
