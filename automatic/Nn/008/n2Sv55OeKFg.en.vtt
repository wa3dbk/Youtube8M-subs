a little bit of a stay at the beginning

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.539 
a little bit of a stay at the beginning
of<00:01:17.909> black<00:01:18.090> ops<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.530> all<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.130> season

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
tear and peers are new players for us so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.539 
tear and peers are new players for us so
we've<00:01:24.180> been<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.330> team<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:25.340> four<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.369> five

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
we've been a team for about four or five

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.149 
we've been a team for about four or five
days<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:29.579> far<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.000> good<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.240> guess<00:01:30.420> we've

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
days and so far so good I guess we've

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.289 
days and so far so good I guess we've
had<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> couple<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.549> rough<00:01:32.670> points<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
had a couple of rough points on the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.020 
had a couple of rough points on the
qualifying<00:01:33.750> matches<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:35.520> in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
qualifying matches but I think in

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420 
qualifying matches but I think in
qualifying<00:01:36.570> matches<00:01:36.810> overall<00:01:37.770> we're<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.070> 13

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
qualifying matches overall we're like 13

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
qualifying matches overall we're like 13
and<00:01:38.610> four<00:01:38.820> total<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:41.450> we're<00:01:42.450> starting<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and four total and we're starting to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.889 
and four total and we're starting to
merge<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.280> bit<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> team<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.280> think

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
merge a little bit as a team so I think

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.940 
merge a little bit as a team so I think
we're<00:01:48.899> gonna<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.170> probably<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> promising

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
we're gonna have probably a promising

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.210 
we're gonna have probably a promising
finish<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.340> Dallas<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.909> don't<00:01:51.840> know<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:53.100> one

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
finish in Dallas I don't know it's one

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.020
