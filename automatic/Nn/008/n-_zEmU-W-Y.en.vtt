this is the JSP model P think the gap

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.580 
this is the JSP model P think the gap
there<00:04:30.020> is<00:04:30.139> 39<00:04:30.800> thousands<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:32.470> works<00:04:33.470> just

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
there is 39 thousands and works just

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.640 
fine we get about 80 to 95 percent
efficiency<00:04:37.659> and<00:04:38.659> then<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> back<00:04:39.259> we<00:04:39.440> get<00:04:39.590> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
efficiency and then the back we get the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:49.120 
efficiency and then the back we get the
patch<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.610> green<00:04:41.360> coming<00:04:41.659> out<00:04:45.849> that's<00:04:46.849> it
