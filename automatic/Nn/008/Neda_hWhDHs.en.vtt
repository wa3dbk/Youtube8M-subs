spinning what's spinning in what's been
spinning<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> figured<00:00:40.290> why<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.530> show<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.160> is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
spinning so I figured why not show it is

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.330 
spinning so I figured why not show it is
the<00:00:41.790> doors<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.600> soft<00:00:42.870> parade<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the doors to soft parade this is the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.600 
the doors to soft parade this is the
doors<00:00:44.610> fourth<00:00:45.390> studio<00:00:46.260> album<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:47.039> from<00:00:47.840> 1969

doors fourth studio album it's from 1969

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.920 
doors fourth studio album it's from 1969
so<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> thought<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> might<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.690> bit<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so I thought it might be a little bit of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.750 
so I thought it might be a little bit of
fun<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> talk<00:00:52.530> about<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.980> album<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> came

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
fun to talk about the album when it came

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
fun to talk about the album when it came
into<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.210> life<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.320> thoughts<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.980> and
