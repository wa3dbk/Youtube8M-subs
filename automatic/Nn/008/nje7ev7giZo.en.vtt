00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.660
 today we make ice cream cake 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.790
 which will consist of two varieties 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.840
 ice cream fruit and ice cream 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:28.920
 for this we need the following 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:31.580
 products take three eggs and separate the proteins 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.580
 from yolks 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:58.430
 yolks poured into a separate container 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.430
 add 50 grams of powdered sugar and 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.440
 stir well with a whisk 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.920
 then add 50 grams 10 percent 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.920
 cream 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.859
 and continue to whisk 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.380
 cream helps to dissolve better 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:38.770
 powdered sugar in another dish heated 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.990
 and bring to a boil the remaining 150 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.289
 milliliters 10 percent cream 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.509
 turn down the fire and pour in a thin stream 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.240
 yolks 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.829
 constantly while stirring the cream 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.209
 the temperature of the mixture is trying to bring to 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.670
 80 90 degrees but not boiling 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.079
 constantly while stirring the mixture 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 constant stirring ensures that 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.030
 we will not form pieces 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:25.260
 after the mixture has heated to 80 or 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.390
 90 degrees put it in this dish in 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 dishes larger filled 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.240
 cold water and keep stirring 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.610
 mixture until it is completely cooled 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.130
 as a result you will get strong 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.520
 cream with a homogeneous structure 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.910
 this cream is called charlotte and it can 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.960
 use to make cakes 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.560
 including cake napoleon 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.560
 for dessert casseroles, well we will continue 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.360
 making ice cream for what 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.460
 separate dishes pour 300 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.760
 milliliters of heavy cream 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:06.110
 add 50 grams of powdered sugar well 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.110
 then mix the vanilla salt 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.170
 and a thickener bag for cream to 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.320
 cream whipped for sure 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.940
 and carefully beat it all up 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.940
 get creamy mass 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.190
 then add cream to whipped cream 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.710
 charlotte which we made before 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.710
 while continuously mixing the mixture 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.400
 Well, the mixture became homogeneous 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.030
 and we essentially made ice cream by 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.080
 the taste of very close ice creams which 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.769
 was made in Soviet times 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.410
 to the guest 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.660
 all we need to do to 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.730
 use this ice cream you need 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.620
 put the mixture in a separate container 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.860
 put it in the freezer for a few 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.250
 hours and then decomposed into creamers we 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.739
 get ready portions of ice cream 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.400
 but we keep making our cake out 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.610
 ice cream 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.610
 for this blender grind strawberries 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:53.850
 add the remaining 50 grams 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.850
 powdered sugar and mix again 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.849
 then take the right shape for 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.169
 baking 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.169
 we set her glass in the center 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.000
 and half fill it crushed 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.000
 strawberries 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.210
 then top add our mix 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.090
 which is essentially an ice cream 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.910
 ice cream then to appear on the cake 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.370
 white and red stripes plug in 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:48.310
 several places around the perimeter of the form 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.310
 gently mix the white and red layers 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:25.810
 after which we put the form in the freezer on 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.560
 a few hours after ice cream 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:33.960
 we freeze the mold from the freezer 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.960
 gently separate the form from the ice cream 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.280
 you can hold on to it for convenience 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.280
 glass 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:06.400
 and take our frozen cake out of shape 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.980
 Well, we have turned out very beautiful and 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.810
 delicious cake consisting of two 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:16.780
