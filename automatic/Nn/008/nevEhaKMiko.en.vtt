00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
this to like xbox live marketplace is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.319 
this to like xbox live marketplace is
something<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.180> could<00:01:42.299> be

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
something like that or it could be

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
something like that or it could be
online<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.560> people<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
online with other people because that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.300 
online with other people because that
would<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.329> awesome<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.560> thing<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> but

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
would be just awesome this thing is but

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.740 
would be just awesome this thing is but
that<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.450> probably<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:50.540> how<00:01:51.540> many

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that it was probably just would how many

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.420 
that it was probably just would how many
people<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.140> probably<00:01:52.320> play<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.220> so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
people would probably play it and so

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980 
people would probably play it and so
that's<00:01:53.549> probably<00:01:53.880> why<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.360> didn't<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's probably why they didn't do that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.950 
that's probably why they didn't do that
but<00:01:55.649> um

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.260 

its<00:01:58.960> overall<00:01:59.230> great<00:01:59.620> game<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.250> say<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:01.120> is<00:02:01.240> a

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
its overall great game I say this is a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.240 
its overall great game I say this is a
10<00:02:01.600> out<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.780> 10<00:02:01.870> you<00:02:02.740> should<00:02:03.010> buy<00:02:03.190> this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
10 out of 10 you should buy this

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.170 
10 out of 10 you should buy this
definitely<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:05.860> all<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.070> have<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.490> say<00:02:06.520> it's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
definitely that's all I have to say it's

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.619 
definitely that's all I have to say it's
great<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.750> good<00:02:08.380> deal
