00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
using the glass here as a line up tool I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.419 
using the glass here as a line up tool I

forget if I actually get this last kill
I<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.819> do

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
I think I do

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.220 
I think I do
I<00:02:09.440> think<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:11.039> yeah<00:02:11.489> boom<00:02:11.989> there's<00:02:12.989> Zach

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I think kind of yeah boom there's Zach

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.009 
I think kind of yeah boom there's Zach
over<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:15.450> thing<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.750> don't<00:02:15.810> like

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
over there and one thing I don't like

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.080 
over there and one thing I don't like
about<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.459> guess<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.910> good<00:02:18.030> thing

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
about this and I guess it's a good thing

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.699 
about this and I guess it's a good thing
because<00:02:18.450> there's<00:02:18.630> no<00:02:18.810> weapons<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.380> pick<00:02:19.560> up

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
because there's no weapons to pick up

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.680 
because there's no weapons to pick up
here<00:02:19.860> when<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.099> have<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> DMR<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.450> an<00:02:21.569> AR

here when you have the DMR this is an AR

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.330 
here when you have the DMR this is an AR
map<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.260> could<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.590> go<00:02:22.709> switch<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.099> sniper

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340

out<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.790> DMR<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> DMR

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

respawn<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.860> think<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> sniper<00:02:38.190> responds

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700

boom<00:04:09.500> one<00:04:10.630> two<00:04:13.660> this<00:04:14.660> is<00:04:15.020> pretty<00:04:15.170> much<00:04:15.230> how<00:04:15.410> I

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
boom one two this is pretty much how I

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.310 
boom one two this is pretty much how I
like<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.160> play<00:04:16.400> pentacle<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.230> generally<00:04:18.230> if

the right of the Banshee there where you

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.530 
the right of the Banshee there where you
see<00:04:33.830> them<00:04:33.980> spawning<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.490> now<00:04:34.640> that's<00:04:35.390> why<00:04:35.510> I

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
see them spawning it now that's why I

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.280 
see them spawning it now that's why I
continually<00:04:36.200> keep<00:04:36.440> looking<00:04:36.800> over<00:04:36.950> there<00:04:37.220> and

as I play Halo the more I started to

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.850 
as I play Halo the more I started to
understand<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.630> spawn<00:04:41.930> system<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.590> better<00:04:42.740> I

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
understand the spawn system the better I

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.390 
understand the spawn system the better I
do<00:04:42.980> on<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.700> game<00:04:43.880> myself<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.740> lot<00:04:45.740> of<00:04:45.860> my<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:46.160> lot

of my really really bad games was me

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.540 
of my really really bad games was me
just<00:04:48.169> getting<00:04:48.380> frustrated<00:04:48.980> not<00:04:49.130> knowing<00:04:49.160> the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
just getting frustrated not knowing the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.640 
just getting frustrated not knowing the
spawn<00:04:49.790> system<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.660> maps<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.110> used<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.470> hate

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
spawn system and maps I used to hate

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.070 
spawn system and maps I used to hate
such<00:04:51.980> as<00:04:52.160> reflection<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.300> like<00:04:53.660> this<00:04:53.810> one<00:04:53.960> for

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
such as reflection and like this one for

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.530 
such as reflection and like this one for
example<00:04:54.140> pinnacle<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.669> doesn't<00:04:55.970> bother<00:04:56.120> me<00:04:56.330> as

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
example pinnacle it doesn't bother me as

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.080 
example pinnacle it doesn't bother me as
much<00:04:56.570> anymore<00:04:56.990> because<00:04:57.980> one<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.700> know<00:04:58.760> what<00:04:59.000> I'm

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
much anymore because one I know what I'm

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
much anymore because one I know what I'm
doing<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.810> in<00:05:00.169> two<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:02.330> generally<00:05:02.960> have<00:05:03.080> a

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
doing and in two I generally have a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.050 
doing and in two I generally have a
better<00:05:03.350> greater<00:05:03.680> grasp<00:05:04.250> on<00:05:04.460> how<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.669> use<00:05:04.910> the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
better greater grasp on how to use the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.750 
better greater grasp on how to use the
weapons<00:05:05.390> properly<00:05:06.280> grenades<00:05:07.280> are<00:05:07.520> still<00:05:07.730> a

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
weapons properly grenades are still a

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.720 
weapons properly grenades are still a
big<00:05:08.120> part<00:05:08.330> about<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.750> part<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.560> my<00:05:09.740> problem

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
big part about the part of my problem

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.850 
big part about the part of my problem
like<00:05:10.910> like<00:05:11.660> say<00:05:11.900> example<00:05:12.380> I'm<00:05:12.470> playing<00:05:12.680> on

you it pretty much matches you up with
the<00:06:40.050> equal<00:06:41.240> right<00:06:42.240> here<00:06:42.419> Blaine<00:06:43.759> see<00:06:44.759> right

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
the equal right here Blaine see right

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.189 
the equal right here Blaine see right
there<00:06:45.119> why<00:06:45.270> didn't<00:06:45.449> that<00:06:45.509> grenade<00:06:45.809> take<00:06:46.050> his

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:47.369 
shield down so I thought thought the

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:48.499 
shield down so I thought thought the
grenade<00:06:47.610> would<00:06:47.729> take<00:06:47.849> his<00:06:47.969> shield<00:06:48.149> down<00:06:48.330> in<00:06:48.479> a

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
grenade would take his shield down in a

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.809
