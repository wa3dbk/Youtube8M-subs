 install it but I could not do 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 this procedure and in the end always 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 end up giving up 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.050

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.740
 tone 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.290
 although the cultural part is as I say I will 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.220
 teaches you how to download a avatar 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.520

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.079
 guys also the app that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.329
 can control your memory card 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.380
 low in 17 ceb because it can 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:42.180
 debut 15 zip zip rar format 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.149

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:51.090
 download play in goal for this android 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:54.420
 market but the point 1 and has no place in the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.689
 time for example expects routed power 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.000
 to be able to do this 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.619

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.320
 common release the street install an ex e 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.319
 covers the most is for those who have a xperia 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.780
 x8 can be sure that the game needs 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.980
 they will be able to install if they can see 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.400
 on here 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.409
 avatar only there you are here there after 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.530
 extract and greater presence goes here 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.120
 Useful avatar apply but game date 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.690
 called to vote 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.330
 Then you have to move the avatar folder. 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.430
 to the folder called gameloft takasu 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.310
 you do not have from 1950 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.430
 memory, believe it's there inside it 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.769
 I wanted a folder called games also in 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.640
 new the avatar folder here you can 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.760
 see here it is now just make the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.349
 application install here from avatar 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:56.400
 and ready, I'm just here, ready, he said after 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.370
 install does not leave all the connections 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.730
 our xperia x8 history off 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:11.670
 then enter airplane mode to deactivate 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:17.000
 wifi and if you know the game recommends that 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:21.060
 who leaves weak 18 is watch a video of 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.220
 ram memory and go to those who also have a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.760
 memory card with plenty of memory 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.489
 space here in the neighborhood 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.859
 an application called swap and that in a 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.209
 file 1 to 1 but the son of 460 that the 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:41.459
 and serves to increase memory 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:45.060
 ram of our xperia x8 a size of evil 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.269
 an ap file of 460 after that 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.650
 procedure already starts your art 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.590
 but I'll make a video still talking 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.269
 About me I'm telling you this. 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.060
 You played too much desing I'm going to make a 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.560
 pause on video pause I will not cut 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.879
 the video because the game took a while 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.200
 for the race 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.510
 so it's only a month from now 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.319
 Okay, so people can see you carry the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.319
 game menu 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.570
 As John Rutter said, it does not take a 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.780
 little to load but what the network only 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.660
 for deivid that just to show you 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.430
 that the game is working - then more 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.670
 A cut for you to see after the game. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.250
 It was actually but not the team. 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.010
 good people how can you see the game 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.530
 It's running smoothly here. 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.090
 leds on but do not understand that the game 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.670

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.330

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.600

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.340

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.630

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.970
 in a xperia x8 and there is one more thing that 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.710
