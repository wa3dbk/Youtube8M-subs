 I heard this news. It's a bad thing to say about environmental hormones. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.489
 It's not the same. 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.180

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:53.070
 It's like this. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.370
 Yes . The environmental hormone is a question. Like this, it's really bad. 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.260
 Mostly environmental hormones are so badly perceived by us. 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.550
 Yes. Yes. Yes . There was also this program of environmental hormones. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 Maybe you know a lot about hormones that have bad effects on our bodies . 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.100
 The same 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 Especially , the parents of the ducks' children were detected in the environment. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 When it comes out, you have to worry about it. 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.950
 So let's review each one. What is the environmental hormone ? 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.420
 For Priority No. 2 nasijyo rumors over what the public hangeo So our sexuality 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.560
 I have to say that and put it into sexuality because of growing up . 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.090
 I do. 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.850
 Now, our bodies require sleep or when certain reproductive Ambassador to the Holy Land without trees 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.289
 What you need with a variety of activities when this happens, when one hwaryu happy with emotion 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.219
 Hormones are secreted. 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:48.780
 I have this hormone in some organs before . 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:50.789
 This does become a problem'm also secrete too much gotta go catch that even its more 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.630
 You do not have to be less. 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:59.460
 Too much or too little will result in physical anomalies or biological anomalies 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.159
 Throughout the years, Adele is deadly and works, but environmental hormones 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 I'll do secreted somewhere 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.020
 But these environmental hormones are not made from our bodies. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:15.330
 There are also things I need for industry and life. 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:19.920
 There's a lot of stuff like that. It's made up of foreign objects and gifts. 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.730
 Then you will come into your body. Then, like hormones, 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.260
 This is an environmental hormone, a hormone made in our body. 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.489
 Not the hormone of our body coming in from outside and the side effects are hidden in the puzzle 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:37.110
 I'm pretty much a no yes yes many professors think to hide 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:42.120
 There are dozens of hormones in the body of the head . 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.739
 More than 100 species have been discovered . 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.019
 I'm endocrine role obstruct normal activities, so this is the human body 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.010
 It also inhibits the action of hormones. 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:58.079
 So, how do you do it? 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.829
 Well, now that we're called obstacles , we have a good environmental hormone. 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:05.700
 Whether this had been a bad environment yireonge is a bad thing 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:10.500
 It's just that after the fact environment, 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:15.599
 Does this mean a substance that makes the environment smoother , 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:19.980
 It's a two-week deal that turned out to be a fragrant substance that was abused by hormonal functions . 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.329
 Well if I was in front followed by a very positive meaning very ttajimyeon 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.799
 It's negative. 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:29.519
 But environmental hormones means we know the side affects your body 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:34.319
 How did those people write what they say to the environment . 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.780
 This has to do with Japan. In this environment, what do you mean by Japanese Taoist residents? 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.680
 It was first discovered. 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.370
 The Tokyo people have found a lot of anomalies in Judah's hormones. 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.170
 That's it. 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:51.840
 So I looked investigate those people drinking five radeunga doing this sort of thing through the air 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:55.799
 Confirmed that the body was contaminated with various contaminated bad substances coming into the body 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:01.530
 Or the scholars were on the air and explained it. 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:07.139
 As the chemicals released into the environment enter the organism and become like hormones 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:11.190
 This is how I talked about this . 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:15.359
 So what do you give a substance that causes the failure of these people heard not recognize eocho 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:20.180
 Simply Hwang Kyung Ho Rumor 6 Days Roadside Why I have a lot 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:24.660
 That'll make that little good to say this is the original Japanese people exactly four 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:30.090
 I mean, you can tell me something about the human disturbance hormone. 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:32.190
 Another environmental ecology also crazy how you just the bad effects of endocrine disruptors do sseuneunge 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.060
 I could see it more right. 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:41.130
 I found more than 100 species first in the environment . 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:45.930
 You know what a typical single mother is. 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:50.190
 We'll see weigh a substance suspected itgoyo the Seine various industrial chemicals 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:55.500
 Also included are six agricultural pesticides doegoyo double metals 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.699
 Dioxins and synthetic estrogens used as medicines u Measure these things 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.210
 In translation 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:05.070
 And you've probably listened to a lot of dioxin in the double. 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:07.409
 Occurs when burning material containing wires or paint ingredients in an incinerator. 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.120
 A typical environmental hormone. 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:17.909
 Another thing that has been attracting attention recently is phenol . 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:20.250
 What detergent radeunga plastic rubber products also products for cleaning or pesticide FIG Yoon 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:24.930
 Itjyo Yang Yoon dyed hair 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.700
 Also it has used these substances for hair care products Oh, this hair Nadu 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.080
 But I'm dyeing and geureosi 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:35.460
 4 So anyway, writing a low-speed exploit envelope will cause environmental hormones 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:39.569
 Separately or mixed yireongeo material so that'll be a completely separate collection that 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.169
 We need to know how to use these environmental hormones in our lives. 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:47.940
 I 'll have a couple of words. 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:52.650
 Old inconvenient to keep food, especially highly acidic food in the house yo 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:57.449
 Plastic containers . I do not have a lot of stuff these days. I have a lot of storage containers. 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:01.800
 When you put hot food into the container rather than the glass as possible 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:05.639
 It is better to use the Atonement except ceramics . 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.599
 And be careful that our kids do not put plastic toys in their mouths. 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.550
 Give you 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:16.919
 There were between ten Kenneth Green products also must be careful that we people 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:20.849
 Woven throughout a little over a week after moving into the same four 3 Maybe this focus 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.349
 Yirang the pitcher because everywhere in the environment from home doing this topic 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.500
 I'm leaving. 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:30.870
 A total of three little attention to management and do a few while I get yiraeya highs 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:34.889
 I have to go through it and pour it over and over again. 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:38.490
 This is also the press 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:43.440
 If you have any questions or questions like 2 minutes, how do you do that? 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.159
 Internet bulletin board and yo mbc mini mobile phone letter Sha 800 days you can send 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.030
 It's possible 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:51.870
 The problem is that the short fee is 50 won. 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:56.490
 Your Wonder Let us all be together Laos as a foundation Nowadays fans too 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:59.759
 I heard a lot of it because it looks like a radio . 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:03.050
 He went out . He did not like how he did it. 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.050
 It looks like 4
