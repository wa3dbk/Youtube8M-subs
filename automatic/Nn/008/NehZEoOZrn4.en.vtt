water<00:00:29.380> stays<00:00:29.740> in<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.010> engine<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.520> warms<00:00:30.820> up

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
water stays in the engine and warms up

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.770 
water stays in the engine and warms up
faster<00:00:31.680> then<00:00:32.680> once<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.100> engine<00:00:33.370> heats<00:00:33.550> up<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
faster then once the engine heats up the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.500 
faster then once the engine heats up the
spring<00:00:35.080> heats<00:00:35.320> up<00:00:35.559> it<00:00:36.190> opens<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.730> valve<00:00:37.000> and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
spring heats up it opens the valve and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.180 
spring heats up it opens the valve and
lets<00:00:37.690> water<00:00:37.930> go<00:00:38.200> into<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.530> radiator<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:39.040> cool

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190

get the assembly out of the way and

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.510 
get the assembly out of the way and
there<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.689> here's<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.469> thermostat<00:01:42.070> it's

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
there it is here's the thermostat it's

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520 
there it is here's the thermostat it's
broken<00:01:42.820> into<00:01:43.119> two<00:01:43.299> pieces<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:44.140> other<00:01:44.170> piece

broken into two pieces the other piece

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.289 
broken into two pieces the other piece
we<00:01:44.710> got<00:01:44.859> to<00:01:44.950> pull<00:01:45.130> off<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.430> inside<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.030> we<00:01:46.149> know

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
we got to pull off the inside so we know

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.569 
we got to pull off the inside so we know
it<00:01:46.390> was<00:01:46.509> stock<00:01:46.750> wide<00:01:47.020> open<00:01:47.500> now<00:01:48.250> even<00:01:48.429> though

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
it was stock wide open now even though

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.399 
it was stock wide open now even though
third<00:01:48.850> set<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.149> simple<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.719> can<00:01:49.929> put<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.289> in

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
third set is simple you can put it in

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.800 
third set is simple you can put it in
backwards<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:51.429> way<00:01:51.579> you<00:01:51.640> put<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:51.909> in<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
backwards the way you put it in is the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.440 
backwards the way you put it in is the
short<00:01:53.140> end<00:01:53.380> goes<00:01:53.979> towards<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.579> hose<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.240> the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
short end goes towards the hose and the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.359 
short end goes towards the hose and the
deep<00:01:55.630> end<00:01:55.869> goes<00:01:56.079> towards<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.560> engine<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.130> you

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
deep end goes towards the engine if you

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.099 
deep end goes towards the engine if you
put<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.880> other<00:01:58.060> way<00:01:58.270> that's<00:01:58.719> backwards

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
put it in the other way that's backwards

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.569 
put it in the other way that's backwards
you<00:01:59.439> want<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.679> make<00:01:59.799> sure<00:01:59.829> you<00:02:00.100> have<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.369> in<00:02:00.490> the

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
you want to make sure you have it in the

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.609 
you want to make sure you have it in the
correct<00:02:00.729> direction<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:02.259> if<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.439> look

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
correct direction and if you look

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.899 
correct direction and if you look
closely<00:02:02.829> this<00:02:03.189> one<00:02:03.369> you<00:02:03.490> see<00:02:03.640> there's<00:02:03.820> a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
closely this one you see there's a

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.090 
closely this one you see there's a
little<00:02:04.060> toggle<00:02:04.600> switch<00:02:04.810> here<00:02:05.079> that's<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.920> let

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
little toggle switch here that's to let

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.190 
little toggle switch here that's to let
air<00:02:06.429> go<00:02:06.700> through<00:02:06.999> the<00:02:07.090> system<00:02:07.299> so<00:02:07.929> you<00:02:07.990> make

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
air go through the system so you make

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.779 
air go through the system so you make
sure<00:02:08.350> that<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.649> toggle<00:02:09.039> switch<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.399> pointed

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
sure that the toggle switch is pointed

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.760 
sure that the toggle switch is pointed
straight<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.570> top<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.050> engine<00:02:11.200> so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
straight up to the top of the engine so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.250 
straight up to the top of the engine so
the<00:02:11.920> air<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.310> get<00:02:12.520> out<00:02:12.640> faster<00:02:13.150> on<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.020> trail

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
the air can get out faster on this trail

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.410 
the air can get out faster on this trail
the<00:02:14.500> first<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.860> put<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.040> thermostat<00:02:15.670> into

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
