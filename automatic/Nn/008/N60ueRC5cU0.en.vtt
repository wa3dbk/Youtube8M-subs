00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
your power by over tightening mainly the

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.029 
your power by over tightening mainly the
top<00:00:59.789> screw<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.410> hear<00:01:01.769> things

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
little extra things like that to help

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.640 
little extra things like that to help
break<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.550> blade<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:11.050> cuts<00:03:11.350> better

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
break the blade in and it cuts better

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.390 
break the blade in and it cuts better
over<00:03:12.160> time<00:03:12.870> there's<00:03:13.870> also<00:03:14.290> other<00:03:14.769> things<00:03:14.920> you

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
over time there's also other things you

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.720

can do to later get your blade to get a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.930 
can do to later get your blade to get a
little<00:03:19.090> bit<00:03:19.239> harder<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:21.360> example<00:03:23.610> there<00:03:24.610> are

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
little bit harder for example there are

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.349 
little bit harder for example there are
a<00:03:25.450> couple<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.290> different<00:03:26.860> options

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.349 

maybe<00:03:32.579> today<00:03:34.109> we<00:03:35.109> hit<00:03:35.409> a<00:03:35.620> little<00:03:35.799> bit<00:03:36.040> harder

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
maybe today we hit a little bit harder

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.119 
maybe today we hit a little bit harder
I'm<00:03:37.359> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.689> show<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:37.959> one<00:03:38.319> okay<00:03:38.739> there<00:03:39.010> are

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
I'm going to show you one okay there are

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.130 
I'm going to show you one okay there are
other<00:03:39.310> companies<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.150> make<00:03:40.420> blades<00:03:40.780> that

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
other companies that make blades that

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.000 
other companies that make blades that
fit<00:03:41.439> on<00:03:41.709> Andy's<00:03:42.340> trimmers<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.930> think<00:03:44.890> the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
fit on Andy's trimmers I think the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.339 
fit on Andy's trimmers I think the
design<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.849> some<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.329> blades<00:03:46.599> are<00:03:46.900> great

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
design of some of the blades are great

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.740 
design of some of the blades are great
but<00:03:48.129> I<00:03:48.159> don't<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.579> none<00:03:48.879> of<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.150> blades<00:03:49.420> are

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
but I don't think none of the blades are

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.819 
but I don't think none of the blades are
actually<00:03:50.099> quality<00:03:51.099> like<00:03:51.730> Andy's<00:03:52.829> probate

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
actually quality like Andy's probate

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.410 
actually quality like Andy's probate
makes<00:03:54.159> a<00:03:54.459> deeper<00:03:54.879> teeth<00:03:55.120> version<00:03:56.939> you<00:03:57.939> know<00:03:58.120> of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
makes a deeper teeth version you know of

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.429 
makes a deeper teeth version you know of
the<00:03:58.719> Andes

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
the Andes

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.179 
the Andes
now<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:01.060> deep<00:04:01.329> teeth<00:04:01.659> on<00:04:01.959> this<00:04:02.319> blade<00:04:02.829> is

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
now the deep teeth on this blade is

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.369 
now the deep teeth on this blade is
great<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.489> don't<00:04:06.609> like<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.510> moving<00:04:08.079> blade

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
great but I don't like the moving blade

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:14.309 
great but I don't like the moving blade
that's<00:04:09.220> on<00:04:09.549> there<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:11.489> basically<00:04:12.599> if<00:04:13.599> I<00:04:13.840> wanted

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
that's on there so basically if I wanted

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.580 
that's on there so basically if I wanted
to<00:04:14.530> do<00:04:15.400> an<00:04:15.549> experiment<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.509> get<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.229> trimmer

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
to do an experiment and get this trimmer

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.240 
to do an experiment and get this trimmer

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
results from doing that as opposed to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.310 
results from doing that as opposed to

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
and never really lasted long but I did

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.240 
and never really lasted long but I did
modifications<00:04:53.949> to<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:56.050> know<00:04:56.199> swap<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:57.010> out
