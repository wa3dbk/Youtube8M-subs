00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.140
 hello friends of lives in network and of nomad 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:08.500
 digital here you have the screen of the 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.710
 nexus 4 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.219
 I'm sorry to tell you that the launcher that 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.590
 I have is the smell with h recommended by 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.849
 my twitter friends so the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.290
 experience then surely change 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:26.949
 a lot I have an interface to a 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:30.039
 greater number of rows to fit 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.950
 more icons and this is the interface that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.010
 I have 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.630
 with 1000 or lunch and the truth that goes very 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
 very good 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.330
 superfluous system and name 2 gigas of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.340
 ram four bestial nuclei a super 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.350
 gpu that for 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 and a tactile response by very very 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 interesting whatever it is that you open 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.899
 it loads very well it looks very good 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.710
 with his mini pinchi pinchi out 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.900
 multitasking as a thing of things 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.900
 interesting that they have 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.700
 with android nexus and then not because 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.700
 is the subject of 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 of saturation and look at one thing that 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.810
 like it a lot, this is the screen 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.960
 lock does not lock screen you 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.060
 gives the option of being blocked 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.720
 configure accesses here I have a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.370
 access 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.250
 to the calendar to the mail and to another access 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.030
 more than is configurable is not to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.800
 whatsapp which is a roi of this 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.690
 access that you see here on the right is a 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.080
 access to the camera to make photos 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.080
 Photos 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.390
 and then you have the option d 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.390
 Google 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.390
 which is quite interesting tell us 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.190
 that in English there are many more options 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.940
 moment is fine I hope you continue 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.060
 growing in 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.569
 in Spanish to access you can also 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.349
 to access 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 Google 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.230
 and things that I miss I miss 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.430
 the radio fm and radio fm and it's something that I 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.860
 yes I use a lot if I use a radio but I do not 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.790
 it's the same as a radio fm look at what 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.790
 nice transition 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.020
 it is true 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.360
 and what I really want is to edit 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.120
 video with movie studio that is a 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.690
 free application for android is not 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.750
 as cool as there are mobile but it 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.190
 it's quite good one thing that has 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.800
 given a bit of a roll is that the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.620
 application to read books in a plus 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.930
 I have a payment reader 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.100
 paid forgiveness removed by I do not know what 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.900
 rolls of the pei store with which 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.850
 I can not arrange to her I have to 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.260
 access it py toy and this is the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.900
 version that you can download from the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.480
 web page of the reader world but in the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.260
 version with advertising which are a 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.450
 amazing roll on the subject of 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.030
 geopositioning is great because the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.160
 speed is amazing you do not see how well and 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.050
 how fast it's going good, they make you 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.660
 some impressions you have also my 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.220
 podcast where I'm already counting some 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.410
 things and envies in dotcom network where 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.410
 I have made a short summary of 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.750
 of the gossip itself and comment some 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:44.180
 thing more when I saw the nexus 4 I did not 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.280
 He liked too by the look 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.319
 they had did not look very nice with this 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.220
 grainy like this with this crystal here 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.080
 well then 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.110
 just like a bad thing I say one thing 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.230
 good in your hand is one of the phones 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.670
 that I'm really impressed that 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.390
 have the power off button here those of 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.610
 volume here 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.080
 because it is much more accessible better than 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.060
 in the alcatel that of alcatel had it 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.280
 here that is not bad but much more 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.130
 comfortable here the finish of the quality and 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.780
 the materials is first class and it feels 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.680
 in your hand super good is a phone that 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.430
 you like to have it in your hand 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.260
 continually yes and that he holds on very 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.750
 well to handle it with one hand it 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.510
 can hold very very well with one hand 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.690
 so I think the design has been a 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.240
 right guess well now everything else 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.450
 mastercard a greeting friends and up 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.450
 soon
