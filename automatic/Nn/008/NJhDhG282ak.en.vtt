was<00:00:20.279> effort<00:00:20.609> related<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.600> Brooklyn

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
was effort related and that Brooklyn

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.109

deserved<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.470> win<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.980> thought<00:00:23.519> Brooklyn

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
deserved this win I thought Brooklyn

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.089 
deserved this win I thought Brooklyn
took<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> game<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.890> had

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
took the game I don't think it had

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.849 
took the game I don't think it had
anything<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.029> bad<00:00:27.210> breaks<00:00:27.859> with

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
anything to do with the bad breaks with

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
anything to do with the bad breaks with
Wilcox<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.849> random<00:00:30.210> getting<00:00:30.420> thrown<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.660> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
Wilcox with random getting thrown out I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.680 
Wilcox with random getting thrown out I
thought<00:00:31.650> Brooklyn<00:00:32.160> took<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> game<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.510> us

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
thought Brooklyn took the game from us

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.350 
thought Brooklyn took the game from us
so<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.620> want<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> make<00:00:34.890> an<00:00:35.040> excuse<00:00:35.520> they

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
way we can stop that if I playing with

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.300 
way we can stop that if I playing with
more<00:01:15.689> force<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> group<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.920> not<00:01:17.130> one

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
more force as a group and it's not one

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
more force as a group and it's not one
guy<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> entire<00:01:18.720> team<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> come<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
guy it's the entire team up to come to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.670 
guy it's the entire team up to come to
plate<00:01:19.740> together<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.340> feel<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:22.229> came

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
plate together I feel like they came

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.710 
plate together I feel like they came
into<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.100> game<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.610> approached<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.150> it's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
into this game and approached it as it's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
into this game and approached it as it's
a<00:01:24.810> big<00:01:24.990> game<00:01:25.200> playing<00:01:25.799> against<00:01:26.130> us<00:01:26.280> today<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
a big game playing against us today and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.789 
a big game playing against us today and
we<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.140> approached<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.770> was

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
we kind of approached it like it was

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.289 
we kind of approached it like it was
just<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.130> regular<00:01:29.310> game<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.119> see

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just a regular game and you can see

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350 
just a regular game and you can see
that's<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.170> game<00:01:31.320> started<00:01:31.710> off<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that's how the game started off and so I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
that's how the game started off and so I
think<00:01:34.079> everybody's<00:01:34.530> gonna<00:01:34.710> remember<00:01:35.040> this

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
think everybody's gonna remember this

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950 
think everybody's gonna remember this
game<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.759> only<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> altercation<00:01:36.750> but

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
game not only for the altercation but

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.830 
game not only for the altercation but
just<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:38.130> got<00:01:38.280> down<00:01:38.490> big<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.180> we're

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
just for how we got down big and we're

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
just for how we got down big and we're
just<00:01:39.960> playing<00:01:40.170> crawl<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.369> couldn't

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
just playing crawl back and we couldn't

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.399 
just playing crawl back and we couldn't
get<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> lead<00:01:42.329> under<00:01:42.570> nine<00:01:42.750> second<00:01:43.290> half

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
get get to lead under nine second half

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.719 
get get to lead under nine second half
so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.680> we're<00:01:43.950> gonna<00:01:44.040> remember<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.399> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so I think we're gonna remember this I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
so I think we're gonna remember this I
thought<00:01:45.630> they'd<00:01:45.810> brought<00:01:45.960> parts<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
thought they'd brought parts where the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.560 
thought they'd brought parts where the
physicality<00:01:47.549> probably<00:01:48.090> point<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
physicality probably point in that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.130 
physicality probably point in that
direction<00:01:49.729> your<00:01:50.729> rate<00:01:50.880> effort<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.479> know<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:52.079> a

direction your rate effort you know as a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.340
