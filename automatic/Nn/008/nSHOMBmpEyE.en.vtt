there<00:00:00.750> are<00:00:00.900> two<00:00:01.110> primary<00:00:01.380> types<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.280> dye<00:00:02.490> head

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
there are two primary types of dye head

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.070 
there are two primary types of dye head
designs<00:00:03.210> here<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.200> radial<00:00:04.740> flow<00:00:04.950> dye<00:00:05.339> head

designs here is a radial flow dye head
plastic<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.470> extruder<00:00:08.040> flows<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.639> the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
plastic from the extruder flows to the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.780 
plastic from the extruder flows to the
dye<00:00:08.940> head<00:00:09.240> then<00:00:09.780> makes<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.290> 90-degree<00:00:11.160> turn<00:00:11.190> as

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
dye head then makes a 90-degree turn as

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.730 
dye head then makes a 90-degree turn as
it<00:00:12.269> splits<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.990> flows<00:00:13.440> around<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.460> mandrel

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
it splits and flows around the mandrel

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.279 
it splits and flows around the mandrel
then<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.949> two<00:00:17.130> plastic<00:00:17.699> flow<00:00:17.940> fronts<00:00:18.449> rejoin

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
then the two plastic flow fronts rejoin

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.580 
then the two plastic flow fronts rejoin
on<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.830> other<00:00:19.980> side<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:21.510> plastic<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.230> flows

on the other side the plastic that flows

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.279 
on the other side the plastic that flows
around<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.220> mandrel<00:00:23.570> travels<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.750> longer

around the mandrel travels a longer

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.730 
around the mandrel travels a longer
distance<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.820> loses<00:00:27.090> pressure<00:00:27.740> this

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
