know basically I was using a mod on the
first<00:01:06.990> clip<00:01:07.350> i<00:01:07.760> was<00:01:08.760> using<00:01:09.030> UHC<00:01:09.750> essentials

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
first clip i was using UHC essentials

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.370 
first clip i was using UHC essentials
and<00:01:11.000> apparently<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.450> bannable<00:01:12.750> mod<00:01:13.020> i

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and apparently that's a bannable mod i

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
and apparently that's a bannable mod i
say<00:01:13.619> apparently<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.880> quite

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
say apparently because I I quite

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
say apparently because I I quite
honestly<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.080> had<00:01:16.290> no<00:01:16.320> idea<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.100> was

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
honestly I had no idea that it was

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.630 
honestly I had no idea that it was
banned<00:01:17.490> ball<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.840> knew<00:01:19.049> why<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:20.610> i

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
banned ball like if I knew why would i

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940 
banned ball like if I knew why would i
have<00:01:20.909> uploaded<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.750> video<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> bannable

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
have uploaded a video with a bannable

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440 
have uploaded a video with a bannable
mud<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.150> doesn't<00:01:24.299> make

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
mud like that that just doesn't make

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690 
mud like that that just doesn't make
sense<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.590> common<00:01:26.070> sense<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.549> if

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
sense is it's just common sense if if

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.399 
sense is it's just common sense if if
you<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.210> something's<00:01:27.630> bannable<00:01:27.990> what's<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you know something's bannable what's the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.069 
you know something's bannable what's the
point<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.710> uploading<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.700> moreover<00:01:30.570> I'm

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
point of uploading it like moreover I'm

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.580 
point of uploading it like moreover I'm
I<00:01:31.380> quite<00:01:31.770> honestly<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.810> banning<00:01:33.810> over

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I quite honestly think that banning over

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.460 
I quite honestly think that banning over
UHC<00:01:35.369> essentials<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.049> filed

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
UHC essentials is just I filed

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.859 
UHC essentials is just I filed
in<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> band<00:01:38.009> dispute<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.360> literally

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
in a band dispute and I literally

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.280 
in a band dispute and I literally
wrecked<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> MCS<00:01:41.280> g<00:01:41.490> staff<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.329> basically

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
wrecked the MCS g staff on it basically

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.050 
wrecked the MCS g staff on it basically
I<00:01:43.320> explain<00:01:43.829> how<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:44.850> even

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
I explain how I don't I don't even

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330 
I explain how I don't I don't even
believe<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.649> central<00:01:47.070> should<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
believe that you see central should be a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
believe that you see central should be a
bannable<00:01:47.640> mod<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.240> did<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.659> research<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:49.170> this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
bannable mod I did my research on this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.780 
bannable mod I did my research on this
guy's<00:01:49.560> alright<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.670> I'm

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
guy's alright so I know what I'm

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
guy's alright so I know what I'm
basically<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.479> explained<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> only

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
basically I explained how the only

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.830 
basically I explained how the only
reason<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.850> UHC<00:01:54.329> essentials

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
reason that I think that UHC essentials

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.319 
reason that I think that UHC essentials
is<00:01:55.020> available<00:01:55.770> mod<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.280> because<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> arrow

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
is available mod is because of the arrow

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
is available mod is because of the arrow
counter<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:59.070> decided<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> go

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
counter right then I decided to go

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.929 
counter right then I decided to go
through<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.020> mods<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.649> they<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:01.979> allow<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
through the mods that they do allow and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.469 
through the mods that they do allow and

than 0 and the biome and my FPS but like
seriously<00:02:39.700> i<00:02:40.150> could<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.569> could<00:02:40.900> always<00:02:41.170> see

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
seriously i could I could always see

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.530 
seriously i could I could always see
that<00:02:41.830> if<00:02:42.010> i<00:02:42.130> press<00:02:42.370> f3<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.180> what's<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
that if i press f3 so what's the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.699 
that if i press f3 so what's the
difference<00:02:43.750> between<00:02:44.260> having<00:02:45.010> f3<00:02:45.880> open<00:02:46.300> and

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
difference between having f3 open and

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.650 
difference between having f3 open and
the<00:02:47.709> mod<00:02:48.070> itself<00:02:48.250> quite<00:02:49.000> honestly<00:02:49.420> it's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the mod itself quite honestly it's

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.170 
the mod itself quite honestly it's
really<00:02:50.230> dumb<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.680> they<00:02:50.709> uh<00:02:50.890> they<00:02:51.610> had<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.970> ban

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
really dumb that they uh they had to ban

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.090 
really dumb that they uh they had to ban
me<00:02:52.360> for<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.080> mean<00:02:53.380> if<00:02:53.500> they<00:02:53.590> even<00:02:53.709> watch

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
me for that I mean if they even watch

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.130 
me for that I mean if they even watch
the<00:02:54.340> video<00:02:54.580> i<00:02:54.640> didn't<00:02:54.880> even<00:02:54.970> use<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.630> mod<00:02:55.840> as

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the video i didn't even use the mod as

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.729 
the video i didn't even use the mod as
my<00:02:56.500> advantage<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.489> i<00:02:57.540> think<00:02:58.540> these<00:02:58.739> seven

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
my advantage but i think these seven

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.560 
my advantage but i think these seven
point<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.700> mean<00:03:01.560> 66.1<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.310> 6.1<00:03:03.970> days<00:03:04.239> left

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
point I mean 66.1 was it 6.1 days left
