00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.210 
done especially if it's the destroys for
mines<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> kind<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> go

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
mines then you can go out and kind of go

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
mines then you can go out and kind of go
close<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.820> door<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.270> run<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
close to the door and run around a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.569 
close to the door and run around a
little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> eventually<00:01:29.189> once<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> run

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
little bit and eventually once you run

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
little bit and eventually once you run
around<00:01:29.729> they'll<00:01:30.240> finally<00:01:30.570> spawn<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.829> here's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
around they'll finally spawn but here's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.039 
around they'll finally spawn but here's
the<00:01:32.280> fun<00:01:32.579> thing<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.060> once<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.659> spawn

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the fun thing about it once they spawn

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
the fun thing about it once they spawn
and<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.759> on

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and you get this one and go back on

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850 
and you get this one and go back on
those<00:01:36.240> boxes<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.020> can't<00:01:37.380> figure<00:01:37.680> out

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
those boxes and they can't figure out

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
those boxes and they can't figure out
where<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.930> as<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.380> already

where you are as you can see we already

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.499 
where you are as you can see we already
got<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> objective<00:01:41.340> done<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.820> they're<00:01:42.270> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
