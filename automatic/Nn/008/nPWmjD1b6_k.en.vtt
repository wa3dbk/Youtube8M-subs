00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.340
 Now I'm talking about an extremely 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.029
 important game that many players 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.279
 to ignore is to think in the short term 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.560
 people are talking game working on 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.230
 top of the game that everything year long term 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.750
 so small bugs small attitudes 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.480
 which may seem insignificant today 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.329
 tomorrow it can have a very large weight per 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.430
 example is a preparation for one before 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.400
 even if you start thinking about playing 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.900
 You have to organize everything around 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.780
 you, for example, something that has 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.390
 that being a sinned to ceresp 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 your machine your computer it perfect 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.500
 conditions is necessary is to lock 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 in the middle of a hand the situation that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.119
 there is a situation that annoys me 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.229
 either the difficulty of the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.280
 game is add agent to these details 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 that will hurt will disrupt too much 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.320
 they will fulfill psychological chests precisely 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.679
 because the conditions are already difficult 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
 perfect imagine the computer locking 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.450
 I say even over the internet. 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.329
 I say even in your armchair your culture is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.460
 essential your comfort is that you will 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.670
 playing at least 12 hours understood the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.319
 From the fifth sixth hour is if you 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.409
 does not have a comfortable chair is already going 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.749
 start the illness back only column and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.600
 you will already begin to distract you 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.280
 already going with you will start to lose 100 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 percent of your brain capacity 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.460
 100% of the use of your brain you 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.740
 you'll be missing out on details that 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.889
 sometimes they look small only they are 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.969
 very large for example never plays with 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:06.479
 sick ill sleep with hangover is 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:11.569
 all the situations that the cars caused 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:14.880
 malaise are causing us malaise even 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.340
 because they are small situations 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.930
 details that bother us and we are 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.800
 thinking about this little detail that is 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.810
 bothering people we are not seeing 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.610
 How does the guy play that can be a move? 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.570
 that you will engage him in the straight 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.730
 final may be decisive the tournament is 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.130
 playing drunk obviously does not 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.230
 There is and today I will not lie to 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.520
 You obvious that sometimes we end up 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.500
 catching us so moment that people 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.360
 is having fun with friends there 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.350
 Let's play a little bit, of course. 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.180
 amuse 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.620
 There is no problem, but from the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.910
 when it starts to hit your 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:57.190
 well that roh starts to spend a lot of time 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.520
 playing in situations like this with 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.920
 certainty will hinder the development 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.360
 you will put yourself in situations like 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.650
 I said that but it does not give a dream and 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.900
 licenses like that understood that they are 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.240
 very important details and sometimes the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.960
 people overlook why I come back to 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.120
 talk you always have to prepare 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.040
 everything in your life everything in your life 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.780
 of your professional life if you 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.870
 you are not a professional player already 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.209
 and you do not live exclusively on little 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.220
 You have to solve all this before 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.560
 starting and trying to work does not exist 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.610
 people sit to play the phone 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.920
 started to play the tv on it all alone 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.739
 things that wake us that divert us 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.170
 our attention and we can not let 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.770
 give no detail to this preparation 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.500
 it is also fundamental to exercise 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.709
 physically is extremely important is 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.720
 we will not be able to handle 12 15 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.270
 hours playing being that we are not 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.870
 physically prepared is that it can 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.330
 seem silly but the musicians of the 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.820
 abdomen for example give you a posture to 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.430
 You stand straight in the chair he held 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.350
 here is your breastplate 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.230
 I do not know exactly, but certainly 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.169
 they give you this basis of your ability to 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.660
 keep the session upright 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.710
 whole body not causing back pain like 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.990
 I had talked and exercise 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.210
 also very important in the issue of 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.460
 self esteem I've been through a time that I 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.800
 I started to play a lot and stopped 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.790
 I started the exercises with my 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.690
 belly grow 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.640
 This makes me very upset because the self 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.180
 I always did sport, it was always a person. 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.300
 very healthy and this starts to 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.250
 mess up you play a lot you're 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.140
 these situations the extreme depression 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.530
 time and you have the self-esteem 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.750
 low and you get to stay is to avoid 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.760
 disappointed with himself for you 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.030
 is not in good health for you 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.770
 Is not your body the way it is? 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.930
 You're used to understanding at least 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.410
 me and this is something that bothers me 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.510
 I let a lot of exercise I 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.310
 climb on the scale I put on a pair of shorts 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.480
 a pair of jeans simply will not fit 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.790
 because I'm giving up doing 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.140
 exercise and what I 'm playing and this 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.870
 yes, it's already an addiction, and you? 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.300
 stop doing the basic things because 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.820
 You 're playing this for me it's a 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.160
 uncontrollable then it 's just the part 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.910
 I learned a lot is you do 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.760
 exercises you help a lot to control 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.890
 the mental part you're doing well 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.620
 prepared physically you can handle 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.330
 more time of selection with lucidity 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.820
 Good, I'm going to talk a part. 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.460
 extremely important is that I see 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.140
 that is even very professional understood 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.700
 that falls in that part which is the 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.700
 his multi organization 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.590
