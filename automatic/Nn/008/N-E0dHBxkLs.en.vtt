in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> second<00:00:19.560> segment<00:00:19.650> we're<00:00:19.949> going<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
in the second segment we're going to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
in the second segment we're going to
continue<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.789> our<00:00:20.850> use<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> major<00:00:21.570> thirds<00:00:22.050> in

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
continue with our use of major thirds in

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.200 
continue with our use of major thirds in
the<00:00:22.560> blue<00:00:22.710> scale<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> should<00:00:23.430> mention<00:00:23.970> that

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the blue scale and I should mention that

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.960 
the blue scale and I should mention that
this<00:00:24.359> works<00:00:24.779> well<00:00:25.199> over<00:00:25.710> dominant<00:00:26.160> seven<00:00:26.490> type

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
this works well over dominant seven type

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.250 
this works well over dominant seven type
of<00:00:27.119> blues<00:00:27.330> applications<00:00:28.019> where<00:00:28.170> you're

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
of blues applications where you're

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.630 
of blues applications where you're
playing<00:00:28.439> over<00:00:28.650> seventh<00:00:28.980> chords<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.460> nine

chords or 13 chords where this doesn't

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
chords or 13 chords where this doesn't
work<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:32.579> you're<00:00:32.700> playing<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:33.149> minor

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
work is when you're playing over minor

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.270 
work is when you're playing over minor
seven<00:00:33.899> chords<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.380> minor<00:00:34.620> chords<00:00:35.070> because

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
seven chords or minor chords because

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.090 
seven chords or minor chords because
that<00:00:35.550> major<00:00:35.790> third<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.050> minor<00:00:37.829> chord

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that major third is not in a minor chord

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.880 
that major third is not in a minor chord
so<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.460> won't<00:00:38.579> sound<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> good<00:00:39.590> when<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.680> want

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so it won't sound that good when we want

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.240 
so it won't sound that good when we want
to<00:00:40.980> use<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.450> concept<00:00:42.450> for<00:00:42.870> bending<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
to use this concept for bending it's a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.680 
to use this concept for bending it's a
little<00:00:44.489> bit<00:00:44.610> different<00:00:44.910> than<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
little bit different than just going to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.850 
little bit different than just going to
that<00:00:45.809> major<00:00:46.020> 3rd<00:00:46.350> note<00:00:46.559> we're<00:00:46.739> actually

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that major 3rd note we're actually

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
that major 3rd note we're actually
trying<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> bend<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.700> between<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> notes<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
trying to bend in between the notes and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.029 
trying to bend in between the notes and
you'll<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.230> tab<00:00:49.590> where<00:00:49.829> its<00:00:49.920> marked

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you'll see this in tab where its marked

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
you'll see this in tab where its marked
as<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> quarter<00:00:50.730> step<00:00:50.940> Bend<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.899> hear<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.170> all

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
as a quarter step Bend you hear this all

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.410 
as a quarter step Bend you hear this all
the<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:53.370> rather<00:00:53.579> than<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:54.000> or

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
the time we're rather than going or

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
the time we're rather than going or
you'll<00:00:57.420> hear<00:00:57.629> something<00:00:57.840> like<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you'll hear something like it's kind of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.189 
you'll hear something like it's kind of
a<00:01:02.129> choked<00:01:02.489> Bend<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.719> used<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
a choked Bend and this is used all the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.160 
a choked Bend and this is used all the
time<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> ends<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> phrases<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.960> any

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
time at the ends of phrases and so any

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
time at the ends of phrases and so any
of<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> sort<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> Bend<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
of these I can sort of Bend up in the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.280 
of these I can sort of Bend up in the
second<00:01:12.479> segment<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> continue

with our use of major foods screen

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
with our use of major foods screen
should<00:01:16.320> mention<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.250> works<00:01:17.670> well

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
should mention that this works well

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
different than just going to that major

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.280 
different than just going to that major
I<00:01:39.340> actually<00:01:39.790> trying<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.180> bend<00:01:40.420> in<00:01:40.630> between<00:01:41.170> the

I actually trying to bend in between the
notes<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.710> you'll<00:01:41.830> see<00:01:41.980> this<00:01:42.070> in<00:01:42.130> tab<00:01:42.520> where

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.790 
notes and you'll see this in tab where
its<00:01:42.850> marked<00:01:42.970> as<00:01:43.180> a<00:01:43.210> quarter<00:01:43.630> step<00:01:43.870> Bend<00:01:44.110> you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
its marked as a quarter step Bend you

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.710 
its marked as a quarter step Bend you
hear<00:01:44.980> this<00:01:45.100> all<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.310> time<00:01:45.430> we're<00:01:46.270> rather<00:01:46.480> than

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
hear this all the time we're rather than

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.040 
hear this all the time we're rather than
going<00:01:46.900> or<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.700> kind<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:55.030> choked<00:01:55.390> Bend<00:01:55.780> and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
going or it's kind of a choked Bend and

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.530 
going or it's kind of a choked Bend and
this<00:01:56.530> is<00:01:56.650> used<00:01:56.830> all<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.100> time<00:01:57.310> at<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.119> ends<00:01:58.450> of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
this is used all the time at the ends of

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.810 
this is used all the time at the ends of
phrases<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.890> any<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.190> these<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.520> can<00:02:00.670> sort

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
phrases and so any of these I can sort

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.280 
phrases and so any of these I can sort
of<00:02:00.910> Bend<00:02:01.150> up<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:03.690> do<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.810> same<00:02:04.960> thing<00:02:05.170> so

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
of Bend up and do the same thing so

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.390 
of Bend up and do the same thing so
going<00:02:05.530> on<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.710> scale<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:05.979> way<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.310> would

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
going on the scale that way it would

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.630 
going on the scale that way it would
look<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.860> yes<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.370> bending

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
look like this so yes I'm just bending

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.580 
look like this so yes I'm just bending
in<00:02:12.850> between<00:02:13.209> these<00:02:13.360> weeks<00:02:13.660> another<00:02:14.410> thing

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
in between these weeks another thing

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.140 
in between these weeks another thing
that's<00:02:14.739> kind<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.950> important<00:02:15.489> phrasing<00:02:16.000> wise

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
that's kind of important phrasing wise

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
that's kind of important phrasing wise
is<00:02:16.450> not<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.840> release<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.530> band<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.890> actually

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
is not to release that band you actually

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.560 
is not to release that band you actually
want<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.489> bend<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.090> between<00:02:19.360> those

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
want to bend it up just between those

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.850 
want to bend it up just between those
notes<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:19.900> not<00:02:20.020> bending<00:02:20.230> all<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> way<00:02:20.739> up

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
notes so I'm not bending all the way up

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.800 
notes so I'm not bending all the way up
to<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:21.010> major<00:02:21.280> 3rd<00:02:22.380> I'm<00:02:23.380> actually<00:02:24.540> bending<00:02:25.540> just

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
to a major 3rd I'm actually bending just

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.530 
to a major 3rd I'm actually bending just
shy<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:27.520> I'm<00:02:27.640> not<00:02:27.820> releasing<00:02:28.150> it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
shy of that but I'm not releasing it

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.470 
shy of that but I'm not releasing it
notice<00:02:28.810> if<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.050> do<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.310> big<00:02:34.270> side

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
notice if you do that it's a big side

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.090 
notice if you do that it's a big side
it's<00:02:34.900> much<00:02:35.140> clearer<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.560> take<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.010> up

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
it's much clearer if you take it up

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.860 
it's much clearer if you take it up
choke<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.940> then<00:02:37.180> go<00:02:37.330> back<00:02:37.480> down<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.750> the

choke it and then go back down to the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.360 
choke it and then go back down to the
next<00:02:38.050> note<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.530> sounds<00:02:38.770> like<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.280> you

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
