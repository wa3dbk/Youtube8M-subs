00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
during that turn I'll explain a little

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
bit more about strength and armor in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.530 
bit more about strength and armor in
just<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> second<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.220> finally<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> Raider<00:02:57.299> is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
just a second and finally the Raider is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.390 
just a second and finally the Raider is
a<00:02:57.569> happy<00:02:58.049> medium<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.560> seems<00:02:58.799> between<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
a happy medium it seems between the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.430 
a happy medium it seems between the
shield<00:02:59.670> banger<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.269> warrior<00:03:00.630> they've<00:03:01.260> got

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
shield banger in the warrior they've got

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.080 
shield banger in the warrior they've got
a<00:03:01.470> pretty<00:03:01.799> good<00:03:02.010> range<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.489> movement<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
a pretty good range on movement and a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.030 
a pretty good range on movement and a
passive<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.690> boosts<00:03:04.079> others<00:03:04.470> defense<00:03:04.859> as

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
passive that boosts others defense as

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.680 
passive that boosts others defense as
well<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.310> their<00:03:05.430> own<00:03:05.639> now<00:03:06.209> each<00:03:06.359> one<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.630> these

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
well as their own now each one of these

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.210 
well as their own now each one of these
classes<00:03:06.930> can<00:03:07.290> specialize<00:03:07.859> when<00:03:08.100> they're

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
classes can specialize when they're

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.039 
classes can specialize when they're
promoted<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.940> then<00:03:09.060> they<00:03:09.150> support<00:03:09.630> slightly

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
promoted and then they support slightly

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.809 
promoted and then they support slightly
different<00:03:10.410> roles<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.829> battlefield<00:03:11.340> but

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
different roles in the battlefield but

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.099 
different roles in the battlefield but
that<00:03:11.940> doesn't<00:03:12.239> actually<00:03:12.329> come<00:03:12.630> until<00:03:12.900> later

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
that doesn't actually come until later

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.670 
that doesn't actually come until later
on<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:15.660> these<00:03:15.810> are<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> six<00:03:16.260> characters

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
on and so these are the six characters

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.559 
on and so these are the six characters
in<00:03:16.829> my<00:03:16.920> war<00:03:17.130> ban<00:03:17.340> one<00:03:17.639> shield<00:03:17.940> banger<00:03:18.299> one

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
in my war ban one shield banger one

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.379 
in my war ban one shield banger one
warrior<00:03:18.959> two<00:03:19.260> archers<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.950> two<00:03:20.160> Raiders<00:03:20.609> one

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
warrior two archers and two Raiders one

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.910 
warrior two archers and two Raiders one
of<00:03:21.510> which<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.780> promoted<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.319> Thrasher

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
of which is promoted to a Thrasher

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.800 
of which is promoted to a Thrasher
giving<00:03:23.220> him<00:03:23.310> increased<00:03:23.700> stats<00:03:23.910> primarily<00:03:24.540> in

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
giving him increased stats primarily in

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.620 
giving him increased stats primarily in
offense<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.680> special<00:03:26.220> ability<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:27.239> gameplay

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
offense and special ability the gameplay

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.390 
offense and special ability the gameplay
itself<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.079> actually<00:03:28.530> very<00:03:28.709> simple<00:03:29.100> but<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
itself is actually very simple but the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.890 
itself is actually very simple but the
trick<00:03:29.609> is<00:03:29.639> is<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.239> hard<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> master

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
trick is is that it's hard to master

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.990 
trick is is that it's hard to master
each<00:03:31.530> player<00:03:31.829> has<00:03:32.010> six<00:03:32.250> characters<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.700> their

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
each player has six characters in their

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.340 
each player has six characters in their
outfit<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.510> was<00:03:33.630> saying<00:03:33.840> before<00:03:33.900> and

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
outfit like I was saying before and

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.020 
outfit like I was saying before and
these<00:03:34.440> characters<00:03:34.920> act<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.370> order<00:03:35.579> from<00:03:35.760> left

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
these characters act in order from left

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000 
these characters act in order from left
to<00:03:36.090> right<00:03:36.359> like<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:36.840> here<00:03:37.200> alternating

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
to right like you see here alternating

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.210 
to right like you see here alternating
turns<00:03:38.280> blue<00:03:38.880> indicating<00:03:39.569> me<00:03:39.720> red<00:03:40.410> my<00:03:40.650> opponent

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
turns blue indicating me red my opponent

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.009 
turns blue indicating me red my opponent
even<00:03:42.209> if<00:03:42.299> you're<00:03:42.420> outnumbered<00:03:42.540> on<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
even if you're outnumbered on the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.509 
even if you're outnumbered on the
battlefield<00:03:43.470> later<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.859> in<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.069> match<00:03:44.220> it

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
battlefield later on in the match it

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.430 
battlefield later on in the match it
will<00:03:44.730> still<00:03:45.060> alternate<00:03:45.569> in<00:03:45.720> order<00:03:46.079> all<00:03:46.290> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
will still alternate in order all the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.710 
will still alternate in order all the
way<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.769> point<00:03:47.010> until<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:48.329> or<00:03:48.540> your

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
way up to the point until you or your

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.839 
way up to the point until you or your
enemy<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.200> down<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.560> one<00:03:49.709> character<00:03:49.980> at<00:03:50.579> that

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
enemy is down to one character at that

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:51.620 
enemy is down to one character at that
point<00:03:51.239> they

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
point they

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.030 
point they
going<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.960> pillage<00:03:52.230> mode<00:03:52.530> it's<00:03:52.800> actually

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
going to pillage mode it's actually

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.380 
going to pillage mode it's actually
pretty<00:03:53.160> funny<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.550> their<00:03:53.760> entire<00:03:54.090> team

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
pretty funny because their entire team

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.910 
pretty funny because their entire team
gets<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.750> whack<00:03:54.930> at<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.200> before<00:03:55.350> your<00:03:55.590> turn<00:03:55.770> is

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
gets a whack at you before your turn is

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:07.190 
gets a whack at you before your turn is
actually<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:56.340> again<00:04:05.390> okay<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.750> stats<00:04:07.020> that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
actually up again okay so the stats that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.570 
actually up again okay so the stats that
you<00:04:07.260> see<00:04:07.470> here<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:07.830> bottom<00:04:07.950> left<00:04:08.130> corner

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580

but can be broken down by a break attack
see<00:04:20.040> when<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.250> actually<00:04:20.550> decide<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.970> attack

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
see when you actually decide to attack

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.880

an<00:04:21.420> enemy<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.840> choose<00:04:22.080> whether<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.440> attack

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
an enemy you choose whether to attack

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.650 
an enemy you choose whether to attack
using<00:04:23.340> a<00:04:23.400> strength<00:04:23.730> attack<00:04:24.060> or<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> break

using a strength attack or a break

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.660 
using a strength attack or a break
attack<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.620> numbers<00:04:25.980> above<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.310> symbols

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
attack the numbers above the symbols

attack the numbers above the symbols
show<00:04:26.910> how<00:04:27.150> much<00:04:27.330> damage<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.900> will<00:04:27.990> actually<00:04:28.140> do

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
show how much damage it will actually do

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.830 
show how much damage it will actually do
which<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.250> choose<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.790> suppose<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.450> based<00:04:30.660> on

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
which you choose I suppose this based on

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.450 
which you choose I suppose this based on
which<00:04:31.080> class<00:04:31.380> you're<00:04:31.560> attacking<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.250> which

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
which class you're attacking and which

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.820 
which class you're attacking and which
class<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:32.910> are<00:04:32.970> using<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.540> attack<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.620> next

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
class you are using to attack the next

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.380 
class you are using to attack the next
one<00:04:34.980> is<00:04:35.100> strength<00:04:35.460> which<00:04:35.700> is<00:04:35.850> weird<00:04:36.180> because

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
one is strength which is weird because

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.840 
one is strength which is weird because
it's<00:04:36.630> also<00:04:36.840> your<00:04:37.140> health<00:04:37.440> so<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.400> say<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.700> you

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
it's also your health so so say if you

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.140 
it's also your health so so say if you
lose<00:04:39.060> 3<00:04:39.540> strength<00:04:39.900> then<00:04:40.620> you're<00:04:41.190> doing<00:04:41.460> 3<00:04:41.880> less

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
lose 3 strength then you're doing 3 less

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.730 
lose 3 strength then you're doing 3 less
strength<00:04:42.570> in<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.840> form<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.110> damage<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.650> your

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
strength in the form of damage to your

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.950 
strength in the form of damage to your
opponent<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.730> lose<00:04:44.910> all<00:04:45.180> your<00:04:45.210> strength<00:04:45.780> and

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
opponent you lose all your strength and

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.990 
opponent you lose all your strength and
then<00:04:46.020> your<00:04:46.200> character<00:04:46.380> dies<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:47.130> terms<00:04:47.850> of

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
then your character dies in terms of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.550 
then your character dies in terms of
dealing<00:04:48.330> damage<00:04:48.510> to<00:04:48.660> an<00:04:48.840> opponent<00:04:48.930> your

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
dealing damage to an opponent your

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.430 
dealing damage to an opponent your
strength<00:04:49.980> -<00:04:50.850> their<00:04:51.120> armor<00:04:51.540> equals<00:04:51.870> damage<00:04:52.290> so

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
strength - their armor equals damage so

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.810 
strength - their armor equals damage so
you're<00:04:52.590> gonna<00:04:52.680> want<00:04:52.920> to<00:04:52.980> build<00:04:53.160> them<00:04:53.370> down<00:04:53.550> any

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
you're gonna want to build them down any

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.030 
you're gonna want to build them down any
way<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.060> can<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.660> by<00:04:55.290> taking<00:04:55.560> away<00:04:55.800> their

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
way you can and by taking away their

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.860
