catching in traffic he is a huge upgrade

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.150 
catching in traffic he is a huge upgrade
for<00:00:15.179> my<00:00:15.269> previous<00:00:15.750> wide<00:00:15.990> receiver<00:00:16.470> which<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
for my previous wide receiver which is

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000 
for my previous wide receiver which is
Mohamed<00:00:17.699> Sanu<00:00:17.910> obviously<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.590> let's<00:00:19.830> just

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
Mohamed Sanu obviously but let's just

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.130 
Mohamed Sanu obviously but let's just
look<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.250> these<00:00:20.400> stats<00:00:20.730> 922<00:00:21.570> speed<00:00:21.990> which

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
look at these stats 922 speed which

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019 
look at these stats 922 speed which
honestly<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.830> could<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.130> been<00:00:23.220> higher<00:00:23.460> but

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
honestly it could have been higher but

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.279 
honestly it could have been higher but
that's<00:00:24.150> fair<00:00:24.449> because<00:00:24.539> Andre<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that's fair because Andre is not the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.740 
that's fair because Andre is not the
fastest<00:00:25.619> player<00:00:25.859> 95<00:00:26.699> awareness<00:00:27.210> that's<00:00:27.480> going

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
now that was a pretty basic catch but

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.139 
now that was a pretty basic catch but
let's<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.090> else<00:02:06.119> Andre<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:08.030> here<00:02:09.030> we

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
let's see what else Andre can do here we

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.059 
let's see what else Andre can do here we
go<00:02:09.270> we<00:02:09.420> hit<00:02:09.599> Andre<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.989> stride<00:02:10.289> he<00:02:10.739> keeps<00:02:10.979> going

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
go we hit Andre in stride he keeps going

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.369 
go we hit Andre in stride he keeps going
cuts<00:02:11.760> beautiful<00:02:12.450> cut<00:02:12.599> move<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.260> he's

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
taken
down<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.360> thought<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
down see I would have thought the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.670 
down see I would have thought the
trucking<00:02:16.020> would<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.230> been<00:02:16.319> better<00:02:16.440> there

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
trucking would have been better there

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.220 
trucking would have been better there
guys<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.340> guess<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.880> all<00:02:18.630> right<00:02:18.870> let's<00:02:19.110> see

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
guys but I guess not all right let's see

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.080 
guys but I guess not all right let's see
if<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.560> get<00:02:19.770> any<00:02:20.069> chance<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.760> take<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> look

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
if we can get any chance to take a look

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.150 
if we can get any chance to take a look
at<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.420> trucking<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.990> bang<00:02:22.319> Andre<00:02:23.040> just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
at that trucking and bang Andre just

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.610 
at that trucking and bang Andre just
gets<00:02:23.400> flattened<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:25.140> shouldn't<00:02:25.530> be

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
gets flattened that shouldn't be

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.330 
gets flattened that shouldn't be
happening<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:26.100> him<00:02:26.280> with<00:02:26.459> 88<00:02:26.819> trucking<00:02:28.340> all

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.310 
happening to him with 88 trucking all
right<00:02:29.490> let's<00:02:29.670> try<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.030> more<00:02:30.209> play<00:02:30.480> here<00:02:30.900> just

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
right let's try one more play here just

right<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.160> here's<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.550> question<00:02:41.670> was<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
right so here's the question was it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.400 
right so here's the question was it
worth<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.380> was<00:02:43.440> spending<00:02:43.860> my<00:02:45.200> 275,000<00:02:46.200> coins
