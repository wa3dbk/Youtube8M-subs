00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.100

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:28.320
 tjoening show koen is my men 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 with what some lowriders 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.989

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.120

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.750

 but it 's great 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.590
 100% tuning 10 years you do not want there 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 You can't beat it 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.739
 we are going to experience it again 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.739
 don't skip it 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 Yes 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.900
 everyone is taking pictures here 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.640
 I know all there is to this 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.770
 honda civic happens to be behind us 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.800
 is so very beautiful 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.100
 the colors look really sporty 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.229
 have enough power and yes we are sporty 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.229
 It's really ideal to Anne's dream 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.909
 well me there yes brute this is the new 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.100
 natural paint 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.780
 and then he does something beautiful you can just do 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.439
 very easy to do clearly 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.600
 make no mistake 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.220
 the really new subtraction as you see 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.030
 that they are busy two days to finish it 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.770
 to put 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.570
 you are certainly half a day busy 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.610
 tidy it up 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.590
 user pinch also malfunction he was not yet 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.330
 ready with you not to be afraid of 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.920
 damage in such 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.390
 so that comes nicely from such a 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.830
 star went up so that is a while 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.940
 important to be there 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.940
 carwrapping we have him 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.609
 what I became mascara is the point I think 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.659
 nice then i can imagine that for 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.219
 you can find there lay gold 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.469
 no but a lot of things you put in one 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.700
 car image became an artsy one 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.159
 but i think if you like very unique things 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.670
 makes them the old human being unique 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.670
 keep looking for things 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.060
 well i have to say 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.060
 Oh 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.470
 look at little cars to look even more 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.860
 women of course I give you are 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.350
 well done men often advise 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.540
 we will do very much once in 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.190
 build multiple layers so that we have one 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.040
 bit of a 3d effect true 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.510
 Jaap Jan Bouwes who build everything 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.730
 flat or much round 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.980
 we really tried with with with depth 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.930
 and colors and themes to build 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.490
 glasses and you see the dust of the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.350
 yes for send to take a long time 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.560
 well i need dust and us 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.810
 my 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.980

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.860
 range can convert over on the 10th time 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.810
 100% tuning 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.770
 And let's be honest it is and 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.770
