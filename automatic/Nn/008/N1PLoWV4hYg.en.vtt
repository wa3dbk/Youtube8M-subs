00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
made a big mistake of putting one piece

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.120 
made a big mistake of putting one piece
trainers<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
trainers and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.950 
trainers and
to<00:00:21.519> be<00:00:21.699> like<00:00:22.029> every<00:00:22.839> single

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
to be like every single

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.520 
to be like every single
or<00:00:24.050> four<00:00:24.349> cylinder<00:00:24.890> every

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
or four cylinder every

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.280 
or four cylinder every
make<00:00:26.400> waves<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.480> will<00:00:27.690> go<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.230> that

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
make waves this will go just like that

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
make waves this will go just like that
and<00:00:28.620> everything

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.660 

like<00:00:37.120> lengthwise

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
like lengthwise

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.399 
like lengthwise
yes<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.089> love<00:00:39.269> that<00:00:40.100> they<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.609> peace

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:42.409 
yes I love that they all want peace

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.099 
yes I love that they all want peace
doing<00:00:43.409> that<00:00:43.710> when<00:00:44.039> you've<00:00:44.159> done<00:00:44.429> there<00:00:45.109> so

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
doing that when you've done there so

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.290 
doing that when you've done there so
basically<00:00:46.469> babies<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.219> stopped<00:00:47.699> making<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
basically babies they stopped making the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.279 
basically babies they stopped making the
opposite<00:00:48.839> come<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.909> assure<00:00:50.909> i<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.170> hit

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
opposite come to assure i think it hit

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840 
opposite come to assure i think it hit
overcome<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.460> needs<00:00:53.640> some

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
overcome that so it needs some

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.689 
overcome that so it needs some
significant<00:00:54.449> bulkheads<00:00:54.869> inside<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> i<00:00:56.339> gotta

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
significant bulkheads inside so i gotta

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.069 
significant bulkheads inside so i gotta
think<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.299> a<00:00:57.360> major<00:00:57.539> ball<00:00:57.839> to<00:00:57.960> get

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
think so we have a major ball to get

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.480 
think so we have a major ball to get
around

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
around

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.299 
around
so<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.150> major<00:01:00.480> balls<00:01:00.750> hanging<00:01:04.190> integrity<00:01:05.190> in

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so I major balls hanging integrity in

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.630 
so I major balls hanging integrity in
them<00:01:05.490> all<00:01:05.730> profiles<00:01:06.740> yeah<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.070> thing<00:01:08.520> I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
them all profiles yeah so this thing I

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
them all profiles yeah so this thing I
had<00:01:09.240> expected<00:01:09.600> she's<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.470> calculation<00:01:10.950> just

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
had expected she's a calculation just

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770 
had expected she's a calculation just
the<00:01:11.430> frame<00:01:11.640> spacing<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> plating

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the frame spacing and the plating

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
the frame spacing and the plating
greatest<00:01:13.200> I've<00:01:13.710> no<00:01:13.950> idea<00:01:14.070> whether<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.640> poufy

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
greatest I've no idea whether it's poufy

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
greatest I've no idea whether it's poufy
enough<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:17.760> is<00:01:17.910> a<00:01:18.150> small<00:01:18.690> hole<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.440> it's<00:01:19.650> not

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
enough it is a small hole like it's not

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.440 
enough it is a small hole like it's not
yet<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.730> was<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.950> 64<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.300> bit

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
yet there was a 64 and be a little bit

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.590 
yet there was a 64 and be a little bit
different<00:01:24.870> or<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.080> happens<00:01:25.350> yo<00:01:26.180> what<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> put

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
different or what happens yo what I put

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.639 
different or what happens yo what I put
the<00:01:27.690> deck<00:01:27.930> on

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.999 

which<00:01:34.649> 18<00:01:35.390> skin<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.049> getting<00:01:37.290> yeah

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
which 18 skin on here it's getting yeah

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.789 
which 18 skin on here it's getting yeah
and<00:01:40.009> I'd<00:01:40.939> like<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.179> check<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.810> out<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.710> little

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
and I'd like to check it out you little

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.719 
and I'd like to check it out you little
calculation<00:01:43.810> it's<00:01:44.810> hard<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.229> say<00:01:45.859> what<00:01:46.280> should

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
calculation it's hard to say what should

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.690 
calculation it's hard to say what should
be<00:01:46.789> your<00:01:46.969> next<00:01:47.569> like<00:01:48.200> stage<00:01:48.560> from<00:01:48.979> her<00:01:49.159> like

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
be your next like stage from her like

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.969 
be your next like stage from her like
what<00:01:49.969> you<00:01:50.119> should<00:01:50.329> be<00:01:50.450> doing<00:01:50.479> with<00:01:51.020> this<00:01:51.289> the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
what you should be doing with this the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.819 
what you should be doing with this the
hall<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.939> say<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.240> we're<00:01:53.450> here<00:01:53.689> say<00:01:54.649> that

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
hall to say this we're here say that

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.330 
hall to say this we're here say that
came<00:01:55.100> off<00:01:55.810> as<00:01:56.810> his<00:01:57.020> plating<00:01:57.319> to<00:01:57.709> thin<00:01:58.009> it

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
came off as his plating to thin it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.740 
came off as his plating to thin it
comfortably<00:01:58.729> well<00:01:58.939> even<00:01:59.509> with<00:01:59.659> everything

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
comfortably well even with everything

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.550 
comfortably well even with everything
group<00:02:00.079> on<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:01.000> yeah<00:02:02.000> because<00:02:02.270> there<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.750> glue

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
group on it yeah because there is a glue

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.199 
group on it yeah because there is a glue
inside<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.189> seams<00:02:04.459> as<00:02:04.789> soon<00:02:05.030> as<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.179> heat

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
inside the seams as soon as the heat

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.770 
inside the seams as soon as the heat
hits<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.530> turned<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.399> comes<00:02:07.670> for<00:02:07.909> gases<00:02:08.390> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
hits it it turned it comes for gases and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.150 
hits it it turned it comes for gases and
it<00:02:09.649> blows<00:02:09.860> whole<00:02:10.160> way<00:02:10.340> through

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
it blows whole way through

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.960 
it blows whole way through
and<00:02:12.730> we're<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.390> blow<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:15.820> you're

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and we're just a blow but if you're

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.820 
and we're just a blow but if you're
going<00:02:16.120> through<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.510> you're<00:02:17.320> might<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.680> well

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
going through that you're might as well

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.850 
going through that you're might as well
start<00:02:18.040> working<00:02:18.400> both<00:02:18.610> you're<00:02:19.480> basically

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
start working both you're basically

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.730 
start working both you're basically
going<00:02:20.860> backwards<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:22.360> right<00:02:23.200> now<00:02:23.440> what

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
going backwards like right now what

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.380 
going backwards like right now what
we're<00:02:23.890> trying<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:25.680> try<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.710> salvage

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
we're trying to do is try to salvage

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.640 
we're trying to do is try to salvage
something

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.630 

that<00:02:31.650> was<00:02:31.830> started<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:33.090> go<00:02:33.390> backwards

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
that was started and not go backwards

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.809 
that was started and not go backwards
right<00:02:35.630> now<00:02:35.840> when<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.670> if<00:02:37.819> I<00:02:37.940> had<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.480> like<00:02:39.080> to

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
right now when and if I had to like to

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.150 
right now when and if I had to like to
fix<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:41.030> hole<00:02:41.300> without<00:02:41.990> loss<00:02:42.500> or<00:02:42.800> anything

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
fix this hole without loss or anything

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.100 
fix this hole without loss or anything
it<00:02:43.370> would<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.760> cheaper<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.360> build<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.690> home<00:02:44.870> in

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
it would be cheaper to build a home in

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.830 
it would be cheaper to build a home in
all<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.220> think<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:47.390> major<00:02:47.630> thing

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
all so I think this is a major thing

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.510 
all so I think this is a major thing
that<00:02:47.930> needs<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.200> be<00:02:48.319> solved<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.250> we<00:02:49.340> don't

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
that needs to be solved it's so we don't

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.630 
that needs to be solved it's so we don't
know<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.700> answer<00:02:49.970> today<00:02:50.209> that's<00:02:50.569> right<00:02:50.750> but

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
know the answer today that's right but

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.330 
know the answer today that's right but
I'll<00:02:52.640> think<00:02:52.700> some<00:02:53.090> are<00:02:53.680> small<00:02:54.680> ways<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.040> do<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
I'll think some are small ways to do the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.600 
I'll think some are small ways to do the
investigation<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.340> sort<00:02:58.580> of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
investigation and I think that sort of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.840 
investigation and I think that sort of
determine<00:02:58.850> density

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
determine density

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.150 
determine density
I<00:03:00.910> mean<00:03:01.570> there<00:03:01.750> may<00:03:01.870> be<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.080> point<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.920> say

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
I mean there may be a point that you say

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.930 
I mean there may be a point that you say
we<00:03:04.120> can't<00:03:04.330> do<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:05.460> realize<00:03:06.460> there<00:03:06.580> may<00:03:06.640> be<00:03:06.760> a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
we can't do this realize there may be a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.710 
we can't do this realize there may be a
point<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.780> says<00:03:08.050> that<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.540> even<00:03:10.690> though

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
point that says that so even though

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.150 
point that says that so even though
there's<00:03:10.960> always<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.350> way<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.590> fix<00:03:11.860> it

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
there's always a way to fix it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.550 
there's always a way to fix it
Savannah's<00:03:15.100> 250<00:03:16.100> over

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
Savannah's 250 over

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.830 
Savannah's 250 over
so<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.340> think<00:03:19.459> there's<00:03:20.209> no<00:03:20.330> points<00:03:20.720> from

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
so I think there's no points from

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.510 
so I think there's no points from
thinking<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.560> stage<00:03:21.770> beyond<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.400> we

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
thinking the stage beyond that that we

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.940 
thinking the stage beyond that that we
solve<00:03:22.760> this
