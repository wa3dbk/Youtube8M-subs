00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.660
 hi his blog legs 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.010
 karine who risked point fr today 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.539
 I propose you a little experience 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.400
 playful to understand a little the 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.000
 ins and outs of dyes 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.250
 food 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.199
 it's very simple you need 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.470
 little sweets that melts in your mouth 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:36.790
 is in the hand of distilled water and 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.100
 we left you had been warned 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.480
 have spread the little candies in the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.130
 glasses you pour distilled water and 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.010
 you wait to see what happens 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.960
 so I just accelerated the video for 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.870
 that you see well 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.840
 what is happening on the screen so 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.980
 she realized in time lapse 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.220
 gradually very have very 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:03.040
 quickly the dye diffuses into 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:09.820
 water and very very easy way and 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.439
 immediate then squillaci funny species 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.880
 white under layer that appear 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.070
 which I think this cabal painting 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.369
 I wanted to do the right painting there 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.960
 need a good under layer so I 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.030
 guess it's sugar but I know 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.079
 not exactly what it is exactly 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.469
 so we have blue of red and yellow 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.689
 so have a few moments you're going 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.689
 to be able to see everything from above 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.290
 so that's what it is for red 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.480
 gives it's still an appetizing by the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.620
 high once under the white layer 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:56.130
 disappears we come to the chocolate 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:59.370
 obviously for blue it's the same 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.880
 little funny detail is that outright 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.030
 the logo has come off and float there 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:16.140
 the glass surface even enough 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:19.950
 impressive and finally the yellow that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.860
 relatively intense in earlier rather 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.150
 successful as diffusion and must not 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.890
 forget that it's only three 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.740
 Members have imagined or the amount of co 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.800
 the ranks agreed then small bonus 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.760
 it's gone with three bombs have 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.130
 orange so this is a process that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.830
 takes a few minutes and you 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.150
 do not need two other things 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.830
 that water then I use of 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.100
 distilled water because it works 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.410
 better 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.820
 but tap water works everything 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.070
 as well and she does not need to be 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.910
 heated it is water at temperature 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.310
 ambient 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.610
 so imagine all these dyes 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.709
 in the space of a few minutes that 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.080
 pass your gut and they go in 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.030
 your sense is imagine what that 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.510
 give this video you liked do not miss 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.489
 not the next ones 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.349
 subscribe to the youtube channel do not 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.480
 do not miss my list of 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.829
 palace races or to receive it it's 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.640
 simple click on the image 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.640
 see you soon
