00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
across the UK now that you stick them in

they've<00:02:41.560> been<00:02:41.680> really<00:02:41.920> dealing<00:02:42.250> with

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
they've been really dealing with

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.850 
they've been really dealing with
relatively<00:02:43.090> dry<00:02:43.300> grain<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.780> harvesters<00:02:44.260> has

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
relatively dry grain so harvesters has

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.540 
relatively dry grain so harvesters has
got<00:02:45.370> out<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.760> way<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.330> time<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:47.680> Rome<00:02:48.130> or

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
got out of the way in time for Rome or

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.070 
got out of the way in time for Rome or
the<00:02:48.610> rape<00:02:48.790> crop<00:02:49.060> has<00:02:49.240> gone<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.810> time<00:02:50.050> I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
the rape crop has gone in on time I

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.350 
the rape crop has gone in on time I
think<00:02:50.440> with<00:02:50.560> most<00:02:50.770> growers<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> rape

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
think with most growers and the rape

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.330 
think with most growers and the rape
crop<00:02:52.600> looks<00:02:52.810> good<00:02:53.050> now<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.770> ground<00:02:54.010> again

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
crop looks good now in the ground again

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.970 
crop looks good now in the ground again
with<00:02:54.640> most<00:02:55.380> members<00:02:56.430> wheat<00:02:57.430> crop<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:58.660> today<00:02:59.350> I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
with most members wheat crop as today I

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.560 
with most members wheat crop as today I
would<00:03:00.310> say<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.550> average<00:03:00.670> can<00:03:01.030> grain<00:03:01.209> farmers

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
would say the average can grain farmers

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.970 
would say the average can grain farmers
finished<00:03:01.870> his<00:03:01.989> first<00:03:02.170> week<00:03:02.500> which<00:03:02.830> is

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
finished his first week which is

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.620 
finished his first week which is
fantastic<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.670> they've<00:03:03.970> had<00:03:04.000> two<00:03:04.360> weeks

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
fantastic that they've had two weeks

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.990 
fantastic that they've had two weeks
just<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.110> keep<00:03:05.290> roaring<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:06.010> they<00:03:06.250> also<00:03:06.370> had<00:03:06.760> a

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
just to keep roaring on they also had a

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.350 
just to keep roaring on they also had a
drop<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.690> rain<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:08.260> September<00:03:09.040> most<00:03:09.790> gross<00:03:10.060> did

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
drop of rain in September most gross did

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.820 
drop of rain in September most gross did
that<00:03:10.570> actually<00:03:10.690> would<00:03:10.989> fire<00:03:11.260> up<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> black

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
that actually would fire up the black

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.320 
that actually would fire up the black
grass<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.100> little<00:03:12.250> bit<00:03:12.580> so<00:03:12.790> they<00:03:12.910> could<00:03:13.060> spray

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
grass a little bit so they could spray

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.729 
grass a little bit so they could spray
it<00:03:13.390> off<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.840> try<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.080> clean<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.470> field

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
it off and try and clean up the field

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.040 
it off and try and clean up the field
before<00:03:14.920> they<00:03:15.160> put<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.430> crop<00:03:15.610> in<00:03:15.820> but<00:03:16.060> average

drilling<00:03:18.459> wise<00:03:18.700> now<00:03:19.000> we've<00:03:19.239> had<00:03:19.330> another<00:03:19.720> drop

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
drilling wise now we've had another drop

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.789 
drilling wise now we've had another drop
of<00:03:20.020> rain<00:03:20.290> today<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.580> think<00:03:22.560> we<00:03:23.560> don't<00:03:23.620> want

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
of rain today and I think we don't want

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.620 
of rain today and I think we don't want
it<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.950> keep<00:03:24.100> raining<00:03:24.430> but<00:03:24.910> another<00:03:25.209> drop<00:03:25.480> is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
it to keep raining but another drop is

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.060 
it to keep raining but another drop is
just<00:03:25.930> right<00:03:26.170> for<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.410> crops<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.739> are<00:03:26.830> in<00:03:26.980> the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
just right for the crops that are in the

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.320 
just right for the crops that are in the
ground<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.489> we<00:03:27.549> have<00:03:27.670> another<00:03:27.880> batch<00:03:28.120> of

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
ground then we have another batch of

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.060 
ground then we have another batch of
drilling<00:03:28.959> let's<00:03:29.140> hope<00:03:29.350> over<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.709> next<00:03:29.799> 2-3

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
drilling let's hope over the next 2-3

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.920 
drilling let's hope over the next 2-3
weeks<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.580> all<00:03:30.670> be<00:03:30.790> wrapped<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.150> by<00:03:31.209> October

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930
