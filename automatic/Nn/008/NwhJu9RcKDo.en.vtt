where the first 10 games were giving you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
where the first 10 games were giving you

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
played season to it and you're not aware

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.560 
played season to it and you're not aware
for<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> first<00:01:35.490> 10<00:01:35.670> games<00:01:35.700> they're<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
for the first 10 games they're kind of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.179 
for the first 10 games they're kind of
like<00:01:36.659> your<00:01:36.780> placement<00:01:37.229> games<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.829> 50

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
like your placement games and you get 50

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
like your placement games and you get 50
points<00:01:38.549> per<00:01:38.850> win<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> loss<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.290> you'll<00:01:40.439> lose

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
points per win and loss so you'll lose

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.460 
points per win and loss so you'll lose
50<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.159> get<00:01:41.400> 50<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.540> didn't<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.960> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
50 or get 50 and I didn't get that so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
50 or get 50 and I didn't get that so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it's really crappy for me though because

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.460 
it's really crappy for me though because
I<00:01:45.540> started<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:47.240> six<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.390> 0<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> season<00:01:48.869> so

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
I started at six and 0 for the season so

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
I started at six and 0 for the season so
I<00:01:49.829> would<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.220> been<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.610> 1400<00:01:51.360> right

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I would have been in like 1400 right

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.359 
I would have been in like 1400 right

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.060 
really need to realize as
a<00:02:01.490> person<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.600> plays<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.930> five<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.560> five<00:02:03.590> game

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
a person that plays a five a five game

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.039 
a person that plays a five a five game
because<00:02:04.460> if<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.939> play<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:05.840> should

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
because if you play this you should

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.520 
because if you play this you should
understand<00:02:06.500> by<00:02:06.619> now<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.549> team<00:02:08.030> game<00:02:08.530> so

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
understand by now this is a team game so

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.270 
understand by now this is a team game so
you<00:02:10.099> should<00:02:11.290> Ram<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:12.500> into<00:02:12.769> your<00:02:12.830> head<00:02:12.920> that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
you should Ram this into your head that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.490 
you should Ram this into your head that
support<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:13.940> necessary<00:02:14.150> whether<00:02:15.080> or<00:02:15.140> not<00:02:15.260> to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
support is necessary whether or not to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.050 
support is necessary whether or not to
play<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.980> or<00:02:16.099> not<00:02:16.250> whether<00:02:16.489> or<00:02:16.700> not<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:17.030> like

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
play it or not whether or not you like

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.449 
play it or not whether or not you like
it<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:18.170> irrelevant<00:02:18.530> because<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.190> going<00:02:19.400> to

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
it is irrelevant because it's going to

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.430 
it is irrelevant because it's going to
be<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.030> game<00:02:20.209> until<00:02:20.450> something<00:02:20.930> replaces

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
be in the game until something replaces

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.830 
be in the game until something replaces
it<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:21.880> get<00:02:22.880> familiar<00:02:23.209> with<00:02:23.330> one<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.690> them

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
it so get familiar with one of them

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.800 
it so get familiar with one of them
