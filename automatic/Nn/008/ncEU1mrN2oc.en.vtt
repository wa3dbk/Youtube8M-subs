this<00:00:00.989> will<00:00:01.170> be<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> quick<00:00:01.740> heatsink<00:00:02.550> removal

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
this will be a quick heatsink removal

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.200 
this will be a quick heatsink removal
guide<00:00:03.720> for<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.200> GTX<00:00:04.650> 580<00:00:05.160> now<00:00:05.850> there's<00:00:06.150> a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
guide for the GTX 580 now there's a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.110 
guide for the GTX 580 now there's a
reason<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.779> have<00:00:07.080> an<00:00:07.350> empty<00:00:07.919> package<00:00:08.580> for

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
reason that I have an empty package for

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.270 
reason that I have an empty package for
a<00:00:09.170> screwdriver<00:00:10.170> sitting<00:00:10.710> next<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
a screwdriver sitting next to it and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.620 
a screwdriver sitting next to it and
that's<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.639> actually<00:00:11.820> had<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.300> run<00:00:12.480> out

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
that's that I actually had to run out

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.020 
that's that I actually had to run out
and<00:00:12.809> buy<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.290> screwdriver<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.549> order<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.910> get

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and buy a screwdriver in order to get

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.609 
and buy a screwdriver in order to get
the<00:00:15.150> heatsink<00:00:15.630> off<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.500> had<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.039> get<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.490> Torx

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
the heatsink off so I had to get a Torx

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.800 
the heatsink off so I had to get a Torx
number<00:00:19.619> sit<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.220> OIT<00:00:20.550> six<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.510> because

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
number sit on OIT six it's not because

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.240 
number sit on OIT six it's not because
they<00:00:22.050> don't<00:00:22.260> use<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> number<00:00:22.830> four<00:00:23.039> Torx

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
they don't use a number four Torx

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.939 
they don't use a number four Torx
apparently<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> had<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> go<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> t6<00:00:25.439> bit

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
apparently so I had to go get a t6 bit

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.179 
apparently so I had to go get a t6 bit
precision<00:00:26.789> screwdriver<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:28.189> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
precision screwdriver because the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.299 
precision screwdriver because the
majority<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.990> screws<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.769> back<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
majority of the screws on the back of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.479 
majority of the screws on the back of
this<00:00:32.430> video<00:00:32.759> card<00:00:33.149> actually<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:35.010> torch

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this video card actually do use a torch

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.400 
this video card actually do use a torch
which<00:00:35.790> looks<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> star<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:37.110> you're<00:00:37.290> not

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
which looks like a star if you're not

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
which looks like a star if you're not
familiar<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> hopefully<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
familiar with it hopefully I can get the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.900 
familiar with it hopefully I can get the
camera<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.840> focus<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> GPU<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
camera to focus on the GPU there so you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.389 
camera to focus on the GPU there so you
can<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.350> I've<00:00:43.530> gone<00:00:43.829> ahead<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
can see that so I've gone ahead and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.799 
can see that so I've gone ahead and
loaded<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.879> correct<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.450> into<00:00:45.690> my

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
loaded the correct bit into my

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
loaded the correct bit into my
screwdriver<00:00:46.200> already<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.399> I'll<00:00:47.489> put<00:00:47.789> that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
screwdriver already so I'll put that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.240 
screwdriver already so I'll put that
there<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> will<00:00:49.770> remove

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
there and then that is how I will remove

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
there and then that is how I will remove
all<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.149> screws<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
all the screws from the back so the you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.470 
all the screws from the back so the you
don't<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> remove<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.610> screws<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
don't have to remove the screws on the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200 
don't have to remove the screws on the
shroud<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.190> only<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.850> remove

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
shroud like here you only have to remove

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.959 
shroud like here you only have to remove
all<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.020> screws<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.789> back

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
all the little screws on the back

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.599 
all the little screws on the back
including<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.719> Phillips<00:01:01.379> head<00:01:01.440> ones<00:01:01.890> here

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
including the Phillips head ones here

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.479 
including the Phillips head ones here
and<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.830> remove<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and that is how we will remove it so

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.899 
and that is how we will remove it so
bear<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.450> me<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> moment<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
bear with me a moment so if you just

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.399 
bear with me a moment so if you just
want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> replace<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.750> stock<00:01:10.020> thermal

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
want to replace the stock thermal

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.020 
want to replace the stock thermal
compound<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:11.070> something<00:01:11.369> else<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
compound with something else this is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420 
compound with something else this is
about<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.390> far<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.070> see

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
about as far as you go so you can see

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.080 
about as far as you go so you can see
here<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.939> GF<00:01:15.930> 110<00:01:16.530> GPU<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
here the GF 110 GPU is right there and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.749 
here the GF 110 GPU is right there and
then<00:01:18.750> that's<00:01:19.020> its<00:01:19.229> corresponding<00:01:19.759> cooling

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
then that's its corresponding cooling

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
then that's its corresponding cooling
plate<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> other<00:01:21.630> side<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> actually

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
plate on the other side so I actually

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
plate on the other side so I actually
want<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.070> take<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> cooler<00:01:23.700> apart<00:01:24.210> which

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
want to take the cooler apart which

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.420 
want to take the cooler apart which
means<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.229> gonna<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.650> delve<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
means I'm gonna have to delve in a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.950 
means I'm gonna have to delve in a
little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.850> further<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.540> gonna<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
little bit further so I'm gonna have to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
little bit further so I'm gonna have to
start<00:01:28.170> undoing<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.310> these<00:01:29.369> other<00:01:29.640> screws

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
start undoing some of these other screws

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.510 
start undoing some of these other screws
in<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> look<00:01:32.280> at

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
in here because I want to have a look at

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
in here because I want to have a look at
the<00:01:32.759> vapor<00:01:33.000> chamber<00:01:33.600> cooler<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.710> is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the vapor chamber cooler that is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210 
the vapor chamber cooler that is
responsible<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.270> keeping<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> GTX<00:01:37.409> 580<00:01:37.860> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
responsible for keeping the GTX 580 so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.819 
responsible for keeping the GTX 580 so
cool<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.360> idle<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.900> well<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.259> under<00:01:40.560> load

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
cool now at idle as well as under load

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
cool now at idle as well as under load
now<00:01:41.579> something<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.180> aware<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
now something to be aware of is if you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.389 
now something to be aware of is if you
are<00:01:43.079> replacing<00:01:43.439> your<00:01:43.829> stock<00:01:44.070> thermal

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
are replacing your stock thermal

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.800 
are replacing your stock thermal
compound<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.970> guess<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.509> call<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
compound I guess that we could call this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.780 
compound I guess that we could call this
like<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> thermal<00:01:46.409> compound<00:01:46.619> removal<00:01:47.310> guide<00:01:47.460> -

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
like a thermal compound removal guide -

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.450 
like a thermal compound removal guide -
so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.049> two<00:01:49.229> birds<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.619> stone<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so you know two birds with one stone you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.469 
so you know two birds with one stone you
should<00:01:50.520> use<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:52.310> something<00:01:53.310> lint-free<00:01:53.520> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
should use like something lint-free to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
should use like something lint-free to
wipe<00:01:54.899> all<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.560> thermal<00:01:55.979> compound<00:01:56.130> off<00:01:56.579> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
wipe all of the thermal compound off of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.749 
wipe all of the thermal compound off of
both<00:01:56.939> surfaces<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.780> some<00:01:58.020> 99%<00:01:58.890> isopropyl<00:01:59.100> or

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
both surfaces use some 99% isopropyl or

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.300 
both surfaces use some 99% isopropyl or
rubbing<00:02:00.180> alcohol<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.810> remove<00:02:01.229> everything<00:02:01.740> put

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
rubbing alcohol to remove everything put

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.830 
rubbing alcohol to remove everything put
on<00:02:02.430> your<00:02:02.579> new<00:02:02.670> thermal<00:02:03.060> compound<00:02:03.180> bearing<00:02:03.750> in

on your new thermal compound bearing in

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300 
on your new thermal compound bearing in
mind<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.200> should<00:02:04.350> apply<00:02:04.530> quite<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> bit<00:02:05.130> more

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
mind you should apply quite a bit more

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.730 
mind you should apply quite a bit more
to<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> GPU<00:02:05.939> than<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> would<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> CPU<00:02:07.259> because

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to a GPU than you would to a CPU because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
to a GPU than you would to a CPU because
it's<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.250> very<00:02:08.520> large<00:02:08.819> area<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.509> got<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> big

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it's a very large area it's got a big

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.089 
it's a very large area it's got a big
heat<00:02:10.140> spreader<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.770> want<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> make

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
heat spreader on it you want to make

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.520 
heat spreader on it you want to make
sure<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.459> covered<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.140> then<00:02:13.140> you'd<00:02:13.290> put<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
sure it's covered and then you'd put it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.820 
sure it's covered and then you'd put it
back

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
back

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.610 
back
now<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.100> not<00:02:14.220> replace<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.630> pads<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.380> RAM

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
now do not replace the pads on the RAM

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.180 
now do not replace the pads on the RAM
or<00:02:16.980> any<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> vrm<00:02:18.630> because<00:02:19.110> they<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.860> not

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
or any of the vrm because they are not

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.720 
or any of the vrm because they are not
thin<00:02:21.150> they<00:02:21.450> are<00:02:21.480> not<00:02:21.810> intended<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.490> can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
thin they are not intended so you can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.100 
thin they are not intended so you can
know<00:02:24.090> you're<00:02:24.390> not<00:02:24.480> really<00:02:24.690> gonna<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.930> able<00:02:24.990> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
know you're not really gonna be able to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.470 
know you're not really gonna be able to
see<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.380> are<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:27.000> kind<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.330> see

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
see that are you you can kind of see

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.420 
see that are you you can kind of see
they<00:02:27.660> actually<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.320> some<00:02:28.680> some<00:02:29.010> depth<00:02:29.280> to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
they actually have some some depth to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.610 
they actually have some some depth to
them<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.120> reason<00:02:30.270> for<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.410> are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
them the reason for that is there are

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.740 
them the reason for that is there are
manufacturing<00:02:32.520> tolerances<00:02:33.180> when<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.570> are

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
manufacturing tolerances when there are

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.420 
manufacturing tolerances when there are
fixing<00:02:34.140> all<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.470> these<00:02:34.590> components<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
fixing all of these components to the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.520 
fixing all of these components to the
PCB<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.510> they're<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:36.840> always<00:02:37.020> going<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.380> at

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
PCB so they're not always going to be at

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.170 
PCB so they're not always going to be at
exactly<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.070> same<00:02:38.280> height<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.700> need<00:02:38.940> a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
exactly the same height you need a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.390 
exactly the same height you need a
little<00:02:39.450> little<00:02:39.900> bit<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.260> variance<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.340> terms

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
little little bit of variance in terms

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.760 
little little bit of variance in terms
of<00:02:41.820> where<00:02:41.970> they<00:02:42.090> make<00:02:42.270> contact<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.590> is

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
of where they make contact so that is

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.160 
of where they make contact so that is
why<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.160> do<00:02:44.220> use<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.550> thicker<00:02:44.880> pad<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:46.020> those

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
why they do use a thicker pad for those

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.980 
why they do use a thicker pad for those
parts<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.700> completely<00:02:48.150> disassembling<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
parts so completely disassembling the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.960 
parts so completely disassembling the
cooler<00:02:49.290> from<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.620> point<00:02:49.950> was<00:02:50.130> actually<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
cooler from that point was actually the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.870 
cooler from that point was actually the
simplest<00:02:51.450> step<00:02:52.020> all<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> had<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.710> do<00:02:52.860> was<00:02:53.610> remove

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
simplest step all I had to do was remove

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.050 
simplest step all I had to do was remove
how<00:02:54.810> many<00:02:54.990> other<00:02:55.170> seven<00:02:55.620> screws<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.760> there's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
how many other seven screws so there's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
how many other seven screws so there's
one<00:02:57.240> on<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> corner<00:02:57.840> here<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.650> here<00:02:58.950> one<00:02:59.160> here

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
one on the corner here one here one here

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.980 
one on the corner here one here one here
one<00:02:59.700> here<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.180> then<00:03:00.270> there's<00:03:00.450> three<00:03:00.660> more<00:03:00.840> on

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
one here and then there's three more on

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.840 
one here and then there's three more on
the<00:03:01.140> bottom<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> plastic

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
the bottom of the this is the plastic

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.330 
the bottom of the this is the plastic

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
shroud that goes over top and it's

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.130 
shroud that goes over top and it's
actually<00:03:05.730> hard<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.090> tell<00:03:06.330> when<00:03:06.990> you're

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
actually hard to tell when you're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.620 
actually hard to tell when you're
looking<00:03:07.470> at<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.770> plastic<00:03:08.220> shroud<00:03:08.490> over<00:03:09.420> the

of<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.650> RAM<00:03:25.890> as<00:03:26.220> well<00:03:26.400> as<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.820> vrm<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.570> can

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
of the RAM as well as the vrm so you can

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.090 
of the RAM as well as the vrm so you can
see<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.020> gonna<00:03:28.110> get<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.620> fair<00:03:28.860> bit<00:03:29.010> of

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
see it's gonna get a fair bit of

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.640 
see it's gonna get a fair bit of
incidental<00:03:29.430> airflow<00:03:30.000> from<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.300> fan<00:03:30.660> itself

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
incidental airflow from the fan itself

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.640 
incidental airflow from the fan itself
which<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.310> clearly<00:03:32.880> see<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.540> all<00:03:34.470> right

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
which you can clearly see here all right

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.580 
which you can clearly see here all right
and<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:36.090> yeah<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.570> does<00:03:36.900> all<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.200> now

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
and so yeah that does all of that now

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.460 
and so yeah that does all of that now
the<00:03:37.650> vapor<00:03:38.010> chamber<00:03:38.580> this<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.540> where<00:03:40.320> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
the vapor chamber this is where the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.710 
the vapor chamber this is where the
magic<00:03:40.650> happens

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
magic happens

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.870 
magic happens
now<00:03:42.720> with<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.020> GTX<00:03:43.500> 580<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.280> don't<00:03:44.640> know<00:03:44.820> if

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
now with the GTX 580 I don't know if

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.580 
now with the GTX 580 I don't know if
you'll<00:03:45.239> but<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.900> know<00:03:45.989> what<00:03:46.110> let<00:03:46.260> me<00:03:46.290> go<00:03:46.440> get

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
you'll but you know what let me go get

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.400 
you'll but you know what let me go get
my<00:03:46.650> 580<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.280> then<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:48.360> there's<00:03:48.540> my<00:03:48.720> 484

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
my 580 and then so there's my 484

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.199 
my 580 and then so there's my 484
contrast<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.190> can<00:03:50.220> kind<00:03:50.580> of<00:03:50.640> see<00:03:50.820> inside

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
contrast you can kind of see inside

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.300 
contrast you can kind of see inside
where<00:03:51.540> it's<00:03:51.660> got<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> similar<00:03:52.140> Finneran<00:03:52.830> and

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
where it's got a similar Finneran and

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.510 
where it's got a similar Finneran and
then<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.209> got<00:03:54.420> these<00:03:54.690> five<00:03:55.250> massive<00:03:56.250> heat

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
then it's got these five massive heat

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.550 
then it's got these five massive heat
pipes<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.480> are<00:03:57.630> carrying<00:03:57.989> heat<00:03:58.290> away<00:03:58.320> from

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
pipes that are carrying heat away from

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.699 
pipes that are carrying heat away from
where<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.430> GPU<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.000> located<00:04:00.510> right<00:04:00.540> there<00:04:00.750> to

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
where the GPU is located right there to

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.100 
where the GPU is located right there to
the<00:04:02.040> aluminum<00:04:02.760> sins<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.450> vapor<00:04:03.660> chamber

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
the aluminum sins so the vapor chamber

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.470 
the aluminum sins so the vapor chamber
is<00:04:04.230> actually<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.800> fairly<00:04:05.160> similar<00:04:05.760> technology

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
is actually a fairly similar technology

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.380 
is actually a fairly similar technology
to<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:07.140> heat<00:04:07.470> pipe<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.250> you're<00:04:09.000> basically

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
to a heat pipe in that you're basically

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.660 
to a heat pipe in that you're basically
using<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.790> gaseous<00:04:11.870> liquidy<00:04:12.950> substance<00:04:13.950> inside

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
using a gaseous liquidy substance inside

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.310 
using a gaseous liquidy substance inside
sometimes<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.360> water<00:04:15.600> sometimes<00:04:16.140> it's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
sometimes it's water sometimes it's

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.560 
sometimes it's water sometimes it's
something<00:04:16.620> else<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.100> you've<00:04:17.970> got<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.390> at<00:04:18.540> a

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
something else and you've got it at a

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.780 
something else and you've got it at a
very<00:04:18.900> very<00:04:19.109> low<00:04:19.260> pressure<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:20.070> there<00:04:20.310> which

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
very very low pressure in there which

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.010 
very very low pressure in there which
allows<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:22.010> basically<00:04:23.010> boil<00:04:23.460> at<00:04:23.900> with

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
allows it to basically boil at with

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.650 
allows it to basically boil at with
very<00:04:25.259> little<00:04:25.440> heat<00:04:25.680> input<00:04:25.889> and<00:04:26.250> then<00:04:26.879> it<00:04:27.240> will

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
very little heat input and then it will

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.170 
very little heat input and then it will
evaporate<00:04:27.990> away<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.800> then<00:04:29.580> it'll<00:04:29.729> find<00:04:30.030> a

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
evaporate away and then it'll find a

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.180 
evaporate away and then it'll find a
cooler<00:04:30.449> part<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.319> vapor<00:04:31.500> chamber<00:04:32.009> or<00:04:32.160> in

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
cooler part of the vapor chamber or in

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.129 
cooler part of the vapor chamber or in
this<00:04:32.430> case<00:04:32.699> a<00:04:32.729> heat<00:04:33.180> pipe<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:33.629> it'll<00:04:33.780> go<00:04:33.900> away

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
this case a heat pipe so it'll go away

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.450 
this case a heat pipe so it'll go away
from<00:04:34.349> the<00:04:34.560> hot<00:04:34.740> GPU

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
from the hot GPU

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.369 
from the hot GPU
come<00:04:35.819> up<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.180> cooler<00:04:36.659> aluminum<00:04:37.139> fins

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
come up to the cooler aluminum fins

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.379 
come up to the cooler aluminum fins
which<00:04:37.620> are<00:04:37.740> being<00:04:37.889> fooled<00:04:38.159> by<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.370> fan<00:04:38.699> then

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
which are being fooled by the fan then

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.570 
which are being fooled by the fan then
it'll<00:04:39.690> turn<00:04:39.840> back<00:04:40.139> into<00:04:40.349> a<00:04:40.470> liquid<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.099> it'll

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
it'll turn back into a liquid and it'll

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.100 
it'll turn back into a liquid and it'll
be<00:04:41.669> whipped<00:04:41.940> away<00:04:42.210> by<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.479> inside<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.050> the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
be whipped away by the inside of the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.200 
be whipped away by the inside of the
heat<00:04:43.289> pipe<00:04:43.500> back<00:04:43.770> down<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.129> the<00:04:44.250> GPU<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:44.789> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
heat pipe back down to the GPU so the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.360 
heat pipe back down to the GPU so the
vapor<00:04:45.479> chamber<00:04:45.960> works<00:04:46.169> similarly<00:04:46.740> except

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
vapor chamber works similarly except

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.260 
vapor chamber works similarly except
that<00:04:47.550> it's<00:04:47.699> kind<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.539> like<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> big<00:04:49.110> huge<00:04:50.270> flat

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that it's kind of like a big huge flat

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.350 
that it's kind of like a big huge flat
fin<00:04:52.169> heat<00:04:52.889> pipe<00:04:53.099> so<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.699> takes<00:04:53.909> all<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.330> heat

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
fin heat pipe so it takes all the heat

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.559 
fin heat pipe so it takes all the heat
from<00:04:54.629> the<00:04:54.810> GPU<00:04:55.139> right<00:04:55.409> here<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.389> disperses<00:04:57.389> it

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
from the GPU right here and disperses it

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.469 
from the GPU right here and disperses it
very<00:04:57.840> evenly<00:04:58.319> over<00:04:59.159> this<00:04:59.340> big<00:04:59.699> surface<00:05:00.120> area

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
very evenly over this big surface area

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.990 
very evenly over this big surface area
so<00:05:00.990> then<00:05:01.139> Nvidia<00:05:01.530> throws<00:05:01.860> some<00:05:02.190> aluminum<00:05:02.789> fins

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
so then Nvidia throws some aluminum fins

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.050 
so then Nvidia throws some aluminum fins
on<00:05:03.210> there<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.539> boom<00:05:03.750> you've<00:05:03.960> got<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.380> very

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
on there and boom you've got a very

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.939 
on there and boom you've got a very
potent<00:05:06.060> cooler<00:05:06.509> now<00:05:06.659> vapor<00:05:06.990> chambers<00:05:07.409> are<00:05:07.680> at

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
potent cooler now vapor chambers are at

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.980 
potent cooler now vapor chambers are at
this<00:05:08.520> time<00:05:08.789> more<00:05:09.210> expensive<00:05:09.840> than

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
this time more expensive than

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.670 
this time more expensive than
implementing<00:05:10.470> heat<00:05:10.830> pipes<00:05:11.069> but<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.449> is<00:05:12.810> from

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
implementing heat pipes but it is from

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.659 
implementing heat pipes but it is from
what<00:05:13.889> we<00:05:14.069> can<00:05:14.250> see<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.669> more<00:05:15.090> elegant<00:05:15.659> solution

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
what we can see a more elegant solution

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.909 
what we can see a more elegant solution
overall<00:05:17.669> so<00:05:18.419> there<00:05:18.659> is<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.139> vapor<00:05:19.380> chamber

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
overall so there is the vapor chamber

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.529 
overall so there is the vapor chamber
design<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:20.460> I'm<00:05:20.520> gonna<00:05:20.639> throw<00:05:21.000> this<00:05:21.150> guy<00:05:21.360> back

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
design so I'm gonna throw this guy back

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.300 
design so I'm gonna throw this guy back
together<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.199> thank<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:22.830> for<00:05:22.979> checking<00:05:23.099> out

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
together and thank you for checking out

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.999 
together and thank you for checking out
my<00:05:23.370> video<00:05:23.699> on<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:24.270> disassembly<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.139> I<00:05:25.770> guess

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
my video on the disassembly and I guess

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.790 
my video on the disassembly and I guess
a<00:05:26.039> thermal<00:05:26.610> compound<00:05:26.789> replacement<00:05:27.780> on<00:05:27.960> the

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
a thermal compound replacement on the
