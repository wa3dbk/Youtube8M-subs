representation number five can be
represented<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.309> binary<00:00:08.580> as<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.510> zero<00:00:10.019> one

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
represented in a binary as one zero one

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.820 
represented in a binary as one zero one
point<00:00:11.040> two<00:00:11.389> we<00:00:12.389> are<00:00:12.450> converting<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.049> binary<00:00:13.410> by

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
point two we are converting to binary by

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.540 
point two we are converting to binary by
multiplying<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.969> by<00:00:15.000> 2<00:00:15.800> point<00:00:16.800> 2<00:00:17.010> times<00:00:17.250> 2<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
multiplying it by 2 point 2 times 2 is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:27.970 
multiplying it by 2 point 2 times 2 is
0.4<00:00:21.619> 0.4<00:00:22.619> times<00:00:22.830> 2<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.250> 0.8<00:00:24.380> 0.8<00:00:25.380> times<00:00:25.650> 2<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
0.4 0.4 times 2 is 0.8 0.8 times 2 is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.299 
0.4 0.4 times 2 is 0.8 0.8 times 2 is
1.6<00:00:29.840> 1.6<00:00:30.840> times<00:00:31.109> 2<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:32.809> 1.2<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.860> see

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
1.6 1.6 times 2 is 1.2 so now we see

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.090 
1.6 1.6 times 2 is 1.2 so now we see
that<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.820> came<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.450> point<00:00:36.899> 2<00:00:37.170> which<00:00:37.680> means

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
that we came back to point 2 which means

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.580 
that we came back to point 2 which means
we'll<00:00:38.399> repeat<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.850> pattern<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:40.379> know

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
we'll repeat that pattern so we know

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.180 
we'll repeat that pattern so we know
that<00:00:41.239> 5<00:00:42.239> point<00:00:42.600> 2<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.170> represented<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that 5 point 2 can be represented in a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.779 
that 5 point 2 can be represented in a
binary<00:00:45.079> s10<00:00:46.640> 1.0<00:00:47.640> 0<00:00:48.030> 1<00:00:48.420> 1<00:00:48.660> 0<00:00:49.289> 0<00:00:49.320> 1<00:00:49.920> 1<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.550> goes

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
binary s10 1.0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 and it goes

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.170 
binary s10 1.0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 and it goes
forever<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.370> converting<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
forever so now we are converting this to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.779 
forever so now we are converting this to
the<00:00:54.420> floating<00:00:54.719> point<00:00:55.020> representation<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the floating point representation the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.110 
the floating point representation the
first<00:00:57.090> step<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.600> moving<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.770> dot<00:00:59.219> just

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
first step is moving this dot just

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.810 
first step is moving this dot just
before<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.980> very<00:01:01.980> first<00:01:03.350> one<00:01:04.350> say<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.040> 1<00:01:05.430> 2

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
before the very first one say it's 1 2

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.810 
before the very first one say it's 1 2
we<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.150> moving<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.799> by<00:01:07.799> 2<00:01:07.860> positions<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.790> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
we are moving this by 2 positions it is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.859 
we are moving this by 2 positions it is
1<00:01:09.240> point<00:01:10.049> 0<00:01:10.619> 1<00:01:10.650> 0<00:01:11.400> 0<00:01:11.460> 1<00:01:11.909> 1<00:01:12.090> 0<00:01:12.330> 0<00:01:12.840> 1<00:01:13.350> 1<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
1 point 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 and so the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.060 
1 point 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 and so the
exponential<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.710> +2<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:18.890> there<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
exponential is +2 so now there is a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.260 
exponential is +2 so now there is a
trick<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.869> we<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.200> add<00:01:22.670> 127<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.119> our

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
trick that we have to add 127 to our

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.420 
trick that we have to add 127 to our
exponential<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> 2<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.240> 1<00:01:27.560> 29<00:01:28.560> which

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
exponential which is 2 it is 1 29 which

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.859 
exponential which is 2 it is 1 29 which
in<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> binary<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.689> 1<00:01:31.680> followed<00:01:32.250> by<00:01:32.750> six<00:01:33.750> zeros

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
in a binary is 1 followed by six zeros

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.850 
in a binary is 1 followed by six zeros
and<00:01:34.470> 1<00:01:35.210> now<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.509> building<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.259> floating

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and 1 now we are building a floating

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.670 
and 1 now we are building a floating
point<00:01:38.750> number<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.869> first<00:01:43.200> part<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
point number the first part is a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.060 
point number the first part is a
mantissa<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.229> represents

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
mantissa it's one bit which represents

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.109 
mantissa it's one bit which represents
that<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.579> sign<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.750> number<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.680> 0<00:01:50.119> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
that a sign of the number if it's 0 that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.240 
that a sign of the number if it's 0 that
means<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.570> number<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.049> positive<00:01:52.560> one

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
means the number is positive one

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190 
means the number is positive one
represents<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> negative<00:01:54.750> number

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
represents a negative number

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.530 
represents a negative number
our<00:01:55.680> number<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.219> positive<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.240> are<00:01:57.299> putting

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
our number is positive so we are putting

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.569 
our number is positive so we are putting
0<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.820> here<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.390> inserting<00:02:01.229> our

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
0 here here we are inserting our

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.300 
0 here here we are inserting our
exponential<00:02:02.579> exponential<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:05.009> has<00:02:05.360> 8<00:02:06.360> bits

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
exponential exponential so it has 8 bits

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.620 
exponential exponential so it has 8 bits
and<00:02:08.310> here<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.300> 8<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.289> 1

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
and here we have this 8 bit which is 1

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.420 
and here we have this 8 bit which is 1
six<00:02:12.760> zeros<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.970> one<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:15.100> here<00:02:16.100> we<00:02:16.370> are

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
six zeros and one and here we are

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.890 
six zeros and one and here we are
inserting<00:02:17.000> our<00:02:17.150> number

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
inserting our number

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.860 
inserting our number
however<00:02:18.440> we<00:02:18.740> are<00:02:18.770> dropping<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.640> one<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.720> we

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
however we are dropping this one so we

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.490 
however we are dropping this one so we
are<00:02:20.990> inserting<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:22.330> over<00:02:23.330> here<00:02:23.750> which<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.080> 0

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
are inserting this over here which is 0

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:35.950 
are inserting this over here which is 0

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
1 0 0 1 1 and then number has a limit so

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.970 
1 0 0 1 1 and then number has a limit so
we<00:02:43.070> will<00:02:43.310> cut<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.790> anyway<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:44.810> now<00:02:44.960> let's<00:02:45.230> see

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
we will cut this anyway so now let's see

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.820 
we will cut this anyway so now let's see
this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.340> one<00:02:46.580> bit<00:02:46.820> this<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.300> bit<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.960> this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
this is one bit this is a bit and this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.650 
this is one bit this is a bit and this
part<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.580> fraction<00:02:50.300> part<00:02:50.570> has<00:02:51.200> 23<00:02:52.070> bits<00:02:53.000> so

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
part the fraction part has 23 bits so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.070 
part the fraction part has 23 bits so
let's<00:02:53.930> count<00:02:54.200> 1<00:02:54.710> 2<00:02:55.160> 3<00:02:55.190> 4<00:02:56.060> 5<00:02:56.480> 6<00:02:56.870> 7<00:02:57.470> 8<00:02:57.620> 9<00:02:58.130> 10<00:02:58.580> 11<00:02:59.080> 12

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
let's count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.810 
let's count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13<00:03:00.440> 14<00:03:01.040> 15<00:03:01.760> 16<00:03:02.240> 17<00:03:02.540> 18<00:03:03.170> 19<00:03:03.770> 20<00:03:04.420> 21<00:03:05.420> 22<00:03:06.080> 23<00:03:06.580> so<00:03:07.580> the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 so the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.820 
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 so the
number<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.300> still<00:03:08.390> here<00:03:08.990> and<00:03:09.140> we<00:03:09.770> are

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
number is still here and we are

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.940 
number is still here and we are
forgetting<00:03:10.370> about<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:11.660> let's<00:03:12.500> rewrite

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
forgetting about that so let's rewrite

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.430 
forgetting about that so let's rewrite
the<00:03:13.460> number<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.970> one<00:03:14.210> more<00:03:14.390> time<00:03:14.690> it's<00:03:14.900> zero

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
the number of one more time it's zero

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.660 
the number of one more time it's zero
one<00:03:16.190> six<00:03:16.970> zeros<00:03:18.400> 1<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:20.270> pattern<00:03:20.930> 0<00:03:21.140> 1<00:03:21.980> 0<00:03:22.640> 0

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
one six zeros 1 and this pattern 0 1 0 0

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:32.020 
one six zeros 1 and this pattern 0 1 0 0
1<00:03:23.180> 1<00:03:23.540> 0<00:03:23.870> 0<00:03:24.770> 1<00:03:25.070> 1<00:03:25.130> 0<00:03:25.400> 0<00:03:26.150> 1<00:03:26.600> 1<00:03:26.780> 0<00:03:27.430> 0<00:03:28.430> 1<00:03:28.640> 1<00:03:28.700> 0<00:03:29.080> 0<00:03:30.080> 1<00:03:30.650> 1<00:03:30.680> 0<00:03:31.030> so

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 so

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.370 
1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 so
this<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.660> floating<00:03:33.020> point<00:03:34.000> number<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:36.140> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
this is the floating point number in the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.150 
this is the floating point number in the
binary<00:03:36.650> we<00:03:37.280> can<00:03:37.460> now<00:03:37.670> convert<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.450> into<00:03:38.720> that

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
binary we can now convert this into that

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.490 
binary we can now convert this into that
hexadecimal<00:03:40.160> number<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.360> we're<00:03:41.600> dividing

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
hexadecimal number so we're dividing

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.390
