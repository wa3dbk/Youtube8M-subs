00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
characters from the movie and I figured

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.000 
characters from the movie and I figured
I'd<00:00:38.920> start<00:00:39.250> off<00:00:39.430> by<00:00:39.670> doing<00:00:40.089> this<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.800> not<00:00:41.890> a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
I'd start off by doing this it's not a

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.469 
I'd start off by doing this it's not a
tutorial<00:00:42.190> because<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:42.970> took<00:00:43.089> me<00:00:43.150> a<00:00:43.269> while<00:00:43.420> to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
tutorial because it took me a while to

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.509 
tutorial because it took me a while to
do<00:00:43.780> but<00:00:44.080> I<00:00:44.110> will<00:00:44.199> tell<00:00:44.470> you<00:00:44.619> what<00:00:44.830> I<00:00:44.860> used<00:00:45.250> and

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
do but I will tell you what I used and

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.990 
do but I will tell you what I used and
how<00:00:45.729> I<00:00:45.760> used<00:00:46.089> it<00:00:46.299> I<00:00:47.369> posted<00:00:48.369> better<00:00:48.549> pictures

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
how I used it I posted better pictures

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.289 
how I used it I posted better pictures
when<00:00:49.900> the<00:00:50.199> video<00:00:50.409> opened<00:00:50.739> obviously<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.699> this

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
when the video opened obviously and this

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.820 
when the video opened obviously and this
is<00:00:52.449> it<00:00:52.629> it's<00:00:53.589> just<00:00:53.769> like<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:54.250> mimic<00:00:54.580> of<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.820> mask

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
is it it's just like a mimic of the mask

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.890 
is it it's just like a mimic of the mask
for<00:00:56.830> what<00:00:56.949> I<00:00:56.979> did<00:00:57.220> first<00:00:57.580> off<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.150> I<00:00:58.390> did<00:00:58.869> the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
for what I did first off is I did the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.560 
for what I did first off is I did the
outline<00:00:59.350> and<00:00:59.710> I<00:01:00.189> could<00:01:00.699> have<00:01:00.790> used<00:01:00.970> regular

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
outline and I could have used regular

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.719 
outline and I could have used regular
eye<00:01:01.600> liner<00:01:02.290> pencil<00:01:02.409> that<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.070> used<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.489> fill<00:01:03.640> it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
eye liner pencil that I used to fill it

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.760 
eye liner pencil that I used to fill it
in<00:01:03.820> but<00:01:04.600> instead<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:04.869> used<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.439> L'Oreal<00:01:05.860> hip

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
in but instead I used the L'Oreal hip

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.740 
in but instead I used the L'Oreal hip
black<00:01:09.240> gel<00:01:10.240> liner<00:01:10.270> or<00:01:11.049> cream<00:01:11.350> liner<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.180> it's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
black gel liner or cream liner and it's

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.200 
black gel liner or cream liner and it's
just<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.110> plain<00:01:14.320> black<00:01:14.680> I<00:01:15.250> raved<00:01:15.580> about<00:01:15.730> this<00:01:16.060> in

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
just a plain black I raved about this in

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.860 
just a plain black I raved about this in
my<00:01:16.300> other<00:01:16.420> video<00:01:16.690> this<00:01:17.050> is<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.410> um<00:01:17.740> I<00:01:18.660> use<00:01:19.660> this

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
my other video this is it um I use this

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.900 
my other video this is it um I use this
instead<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.380> using<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:21.040> regular<00:01:21.160> eye<00:01:21.490> shadow

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
instead of using the regular eye shadow

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.350 
instead of using the regular eye shadow
pencil<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:22.600> am<00:01:22.870> used<00:01:23.260> to<00:01:23.320> fill<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.680> with

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pencil that I am used to fill it in with

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.950 
pencil that I am used to fill it in with
because<00:01:26.010> it<00:01:27.010> dries<00:01:27.610> faster<00:01:28.270> I'm<00:01:28.750> gonna<00:01:28.900> it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
because it dries faster I'm gonna it

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.930 
because it dries faster I'm gonna it
dries<00:01:29.170> like<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.560> can<00:01:29.680> rub<00:01:29.980> it<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.610> won't

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
dries like you can rub it and it won't

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.430 
dries like you can rub it and it won't
come<00:01:31.120> off<00:01:31.300> like<00:01:31.810> at<00:01:32.020> all

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
come off like at all

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.540 
come off like at all
like<00:01:32.620> you'll<00:01:32.770> sit<00:01:32.920> there<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.130> like

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
like you'll sit there and like

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.280 
like you'll sit there and like
eventually<00:01:34.150> you'll<00:01:34.270> flake<00:01:34.510> off<00:01:34.659> but<00:01:34.900> it's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
eventually you'll flake off but it's

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.930 
eventually you'll flake off but it's
really<00:01:35.500> hard<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.040> won't<00:01:36.310> smudge<00:01:36.610> if<00:01:36.850> you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
really hard and it won't smudge if you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.910 
really hard and it won't smudge if you
like<00:01:37.060> dry<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:37.870> I<00:01:37.900> figured<00:01:38.170> using<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.740> would

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
like dry so I figured using that would

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.710 
like dry so I figured using that would
be<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.070> really<00:01:39.280> good<00:01:39.430> outline<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.240> just<00:01:40.540> use

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
be a really good outline so I just use

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.200 
be a really good outline so I just use
an<00:01:40.870> angled<00:01:41.350> brush<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.470> this<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.400> I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
an angled brush like that and this and I

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.490 
an angled brush like that and this and I
took<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.479> picture<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.870> was<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.110> front<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.409> me

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
took the picture it was in front of me

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.870 
took the picture it was in front of me
and<00:01:47.620> I<00:01:47.680> just<00:01:47.710> kind<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.010> traced<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:48.580> like

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
and I just kind of traced it like

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.520 
and I just kind of traced it like
started<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.540> said<00:01:49.690> actually<00:01:49.870> right<00:01:50.110> here<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.470> I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
started I said actually right here and I

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.320 
started I said actually right here and I
worked<00:01:50.800> my<00:01:51.040> way<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.400> way<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.580> that<00:01:51.880> way<00:01:51.940> and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
worked my way this way and that way and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.450 
worked my way this way and that way and
I<00:01:52.870> just<00:01:53.049> did<00:01:53.260> whatever<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.650> did<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.860> this<00:01:53.979> side<00:01:54.250> I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
I just did whatever I did to this side I

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.700 
I just did whatever I did to this side I
did<00:01:54.640> exactly<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.540> side<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:56.500> got<00:01:56.650> a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
did exactly to this side so then I got a

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.070 
did exactly to this side so then I got a
smash-up<00:01:57.159> as<00:01:57.310> best<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.610> possible<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.900> think

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
smash-up as best as possible and I think

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.390 
smash-up as best as possible and I think
I<00:01:59.200> got<00:01:59.350> black<00:01:59.590> on<00:01:59.740> my<00:01:59.799> face<00:01:59.979> him<00:02:00.130> doing<00:02:00.310> that
