you don't know what it does on your

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.290 
computer unless you're super tech savvy
which<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:20.760> not

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
which I'm not

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.480 
which I'm not
it<00:02:21.750> takes<00:02:21.990> up<00:02:22.170> space<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.710> takes<00:02:22.830> up<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.400> know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
it takes up space it takes up you know

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.150 
it takes up space it takes up you know
memory<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.720> slows<00:02:25.290> down<00:02:25.470> your<00:02:25.590> computer<00:02:26.010> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
memory and slows down your computer so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.530 
memory and slows down your computer so
how<00:02:26.430> do<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:26.700> what<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.060> rid<00:02:27.120> of

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
how do you know what to get rid of

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.200 
how do you know what to get rid of
so<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> where<00:02:28.650> sudo<00:02:28.980> comes<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.370> handy<00:02:29.550> so

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
so this is where sudo comes in handy so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.580 
so this is where sudo comes in handy so
my<00:02:30.780> boot<00:02:31.050> sequence<00:02:31.730> will<00:02:32.730> run<00:02:32.970> 53<00:02:33.840> background

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
my boot sequence will run 53 background

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.320 
my boot sequence will run 53 background
apps<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.370> before<00:02:35.670> my<00:02:35.760> computer<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.150> fully

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
apps so before my computer is fully

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.880 
apps so before my computer is fully
loaded<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.750> has<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.020> load<00:02:37.140> 53<00:02:37.740> different

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
loaded it has to load 53 different

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.190 
loaded it has to load 53 different
things<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:39.060> takes<00:02:39.270> me<00:02:39.450> three<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.020> half

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
things and it takes me three and a half

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.680 
things and it takes me three and a half
minutes<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:41.370> my<00:02:41.520> computer<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.210> load<00:02:42.360> up<00:02:42.540> so

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
minutes for my computer to load up so

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.330 
minutes for my computer to load up so
that<00:02:42.810> actually<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.200> pretty<00:02:43.380> long<00:02:43.620> maybe<00:02:44.250> I

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
that actually is pretty long maybe I

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.520 
that actually is pretty long maybe I
need<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.550> look<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.390> new<00:02:45.540> computer<00:02:45.990> but

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
need to look at that new computer but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.200 
need to look at that new computer but
it's<00:02:46.890> gonna<00:02:47.070> tell<00:02:47.340> me<00:02:47.520> what<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> can

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
it's gonna tell me what I can

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.230 
it's gonna tell me what I can
potentially<00:02:48.420> remove<00:02:48.900> now<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.560> zero<00:02:50.240> that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
potentially remove now this is zero that

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.880 
potentially remove now this is zero that
I<00:02:51.720> should<00:02:51.990> remove<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.650> potentially

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
I should remove what I can potentially

things<00:04:39.699> that<00:04:39.940> could<00:04:40.090> potentially<00:04:40.150> remove

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
things that could potentially remove

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.469 
things that could potentially remove
it's<00:04:41.169> only<00:04:41.350> 15<00:04:41.800> seconds<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:42.430> my<00:04:42.729> boot<00:04:42.910> time<00:04:43.120> so

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
it's only 15 seconds of my boot time so

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.540 
it's only 15 seconds of my boot time so
I<00:04:43.510> can<00:04:43.750> load<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:44.050> up<00:04:44.169> now<00:04:44.830> some<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.250> smaller

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
I can load it up now some of the smaller

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.730 
I can load it up now some of the smaller
ones<00:04:46.080> they<00:04:47.080> may<00:04:47.199> not<00:04:47.320> have<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.470> description

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
ones they may not have a description

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.170 
ones they may not have a description
available<00:04:48.100> right<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:48.639> like<00:04:49.020> raw<00:04:50.020> link<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.830> toe

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
available right so like raw link a toe

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.240 
available right so like raw link a toe

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
2.11 and wireless LAN what the heck is

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.439 
2.11 and wireless LAN what the heck is
that<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.699> mean<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:54.910> connects<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.300> the

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
that that mean it connects to the

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.870 
that that mean it connects to the
internet<00:04:56.080> somehow<00:04:56.350> do<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:56.770> need<00:04:56.979> that<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.460> don't

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
internet somehow do I need that I don't

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.210

people keep it in their boot so I'm

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.050 
people keep it in their boot so I'm
probably<00:05:02.889> going<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.160> do<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.340> because<00:05:03.880> I

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060

boot and save myself 5.7 seconds there
you<00:05:26.020> go<00:05:26.139> so<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:27.130> tells<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.460> for<00:05:27.550> each<00:05:27.789> one<00:05:28.030> I'm

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
going to go through these other ones but

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.629 
going to go through these other ones but
it<00:05:29.410> doesn't<00:05:29.680> take<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.830> lot<00:05:30.070> of<00:05:30.130> time<00:05:30.340> for<00:05:30.580> these

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
it doesn't take a lot of time for these

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.640 
it doesn't take a lot of time for these
so<00:05:30.820> it's<00:05:30.940> not<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.090> huge<00:05:31.539> deal<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:32.020> me<00:05:32.260> right<00:05:32.500> now

think<00:05:59.710> it's<00:05:59.979> up<00:06:00.130> to<00:06:00.250> five<00:06:00.460> computers<00:06:00.539> they<00:06:01.539> do

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
think it's up to five computers they do

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.510 
think it's up to five computers they do
have<00:06:01.930> a<00:06:01.960> remote<00:06:02.260> access<00:06:02.560> feature<00:06:03.039> to<00:06:03.310> which

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
have a remote access feature to which

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.920 
have a remote access feature to which
you<00:06:03.669> do<00:06:03.820> have<00:06:03.970> to<00:06:04.090> pay<00:06:04.240> for<00:06:04.300> which<00:06:04.660> I<00:06:04.750> haven't

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
you do have to pay for which I haven't

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.719 
you do have to pay for which I haven't
used<00:06:05.260> so<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:05.500> can't<00:06:05.740> say<00:06:06.099> if<00:06:06.190> it's<00:06:06.340> good<00:06:06.490> or<00:06:06.520> not

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
used so I can't say if it's good or not

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.520 
used so I can't say if it's good or not
but<00:06:06.910> basically<00:06:07.300> if<00:06:07.510> I'm<00:06:07.630> running<00:06:07.840> my<00:06:08.110> computer

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
but basically if I'm running my computer

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.230 
but basically if I'm running my computer
and<00:06:09.190> then<00:06:09.370> I'm<00:06:09.430> running<00:06:09.520> my<00:06:09.729> dad's<00:06:09.970> computer

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
and then I'm running my dad's computer

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.940 
and then I'm running my dad's computer
and<00:06:10.720> he's<00:06:10.930> having<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.289> problem<00:06:11.500> with<00:06:11.680> it

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
and he's having a problem with it
