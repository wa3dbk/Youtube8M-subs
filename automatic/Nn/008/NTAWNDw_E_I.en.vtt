probably<00:04:08.460> good<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.820> don't<00:04:09.030> have<00:04:09.210> this

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
probably good that I don't have this

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.960 
probably good that I don't have this
bike<00:04:10.010> I'd<00:04:11.010> be<00:04:11.160> getting<00:04:11.310> in<00:04:11.520> trouble<00:04:11.700> all<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
bike I'd be getting in trouble all the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.820 
bike I'd be getting in trouble all the
time<00:04:12.060> put<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.840> speed<00:04:13.080> limit<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.590> roads

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
time put the speed limit is on the roads

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:27.340 
time put the speed limit is on the roads
are<00:04:13.950> probably<00:04:14.100> not<00:04:14.400> 70

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:36.850 

I<00:04:30.610> mean<00:04:32.260> under<00:04:33.260> kilometers<00:04:34.300> an<00:04:35.300> hour<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:36.650> only

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
I mean under kilometers an hour is only

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:49.540 
I mean under kilometers an hour is only
16<00:04:38.710> okay<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:39.770> that's<00:04:40.220> fine<00:04:40.460> right

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.600 

you

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.600 

it<00:04:57.240> was<00:04:57.389> too<00:04:57.569> good<00:04:57.599> of<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.870> deal<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.080> not<00:04:58.439> yet<00:04:59.069> so

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
it was too good of a deal to not yet so

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.070 
it was too good of a deal to not yet so
we<00:04:59.879> end<00:05:00.000> up<00:05:00.090> the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
we end up the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.460 
we end up the
her<00:05:02.080> suzuki<00:05:02.920> s40<00:05:03.280> which<00:05:03.520> she<00:05:03.639> was<00:05:03.790> driving

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
her suzuki s40 which she was driving

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.560 
her suzuki s40 which she was driving
turned<00:05:05.470> out<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.830> be<00:05:06.240> something<00:05:07.240> she<00:05:07.360> wasn't

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
turned out to be something she wasn't

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.080 
turned out to be something she wasn't
religious<00:05:08.080> tit<00:05:08.230> anymore

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.240 

one<00:05:13.090> thing<00:05:13.300> I<00:05:13.420> learned<00:05:13.660> about<00:05:14.080> this<00:05:14.950> bike<00:05:15.220> is

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
one thing I learned about this bike is

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.250 
one thing I learned about this bike is
that<00:05:15.670> there<00:05:15.850> is<00:05:15.940> no<00:05:16.180> place<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.690> mount<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
that there is no place to mount the

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:31.340 
that there is no place to mount the
camera<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:21.450> so

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:53.140 

right<00:05:32.350> here

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.800 

hmm<00:05:54.980> didn't<00:05:55.980> need<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.160> make<00:05:56.190> that<00:05:56.460> sound<00:05:56.810> the

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
hmm didn't need to make that sound the

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.040 
hmm didn't need to make that sound the
old<00:05:57.990> man<00:05:58.230> grunting<00:05:58.740> sound
