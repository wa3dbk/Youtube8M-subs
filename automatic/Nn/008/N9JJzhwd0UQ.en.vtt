of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> controversy<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.840> set<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
of the controversy with this set is the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.730 
of the controversy with this set is the
fact<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:18.540> special<00:01:18.900> effects<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.710> been

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
fact that the special effects have been

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.550 
fact that the special effects have been
redone<00:01:20.780> actually<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.840> find<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.290> kind<00:01:22.470> of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
redone actually I find them kind of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.219 
redone actually I find them kind of
interesting<00:01:22.950> although<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.600> you're<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> trek

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
interesting although if you're a trek

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.870 
interesting although if you're a trek
purist<00:01:25.619> which<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.130> guess<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.520> am<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.850> well

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
purist which I guess I am as well

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.370 
purist which I guess I am as well
there's<00:01:27.720> an<00:01:27.869> option<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.280> both<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.520> original

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
there's an option for both the original

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.359 
there's an option for both the original
effects<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.159> new<00:01:32.840> CGI<00:01:33.840> effects<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.500> since

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
effects and the new CGI effects so since

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.830 
effects and the new CGI effects so since
I've<00:01:35.490> seen<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.000> series<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.479> many<00:01:36.630> times

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
I've seen this series so many times

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.010 
I've seen this series so many times
right<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.229> watching<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.590> CGI<00:01:37.890> effects

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
right now I'm watching the CGI effects

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.480 
right now I'm watching the CGI effects
in<00:01:40.020> terms<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> video<00:01:40.710> quality<00:01:41.189> it's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
in terms of the video quality it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
in terms of the video quality it's
actually<00:01:42.210> better<00:01:42.450> than<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:42.899> have

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
actually better than you would have

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.859 
actually better than you would have
thought<00:01:43.110> possible<00:01:43.729> with<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> series<00:01:45.450> that's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
thought possible with a series that's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.060 
thought possible with a series that's
this<00:01:46.229> old<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.780> high-definition<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.950> you're

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this old it is high-definition if you're

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.490 
this old it is high-definition if you're
a<00:01:50.100> long<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.490> Trek<00:01:50.790> fan<00:01:51.000> who<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.290> has

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
a long time Trek fan who like me has

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.520 
a long time Trek fan who like me has
probably<00:01:52.829> seen<00:01:53.189> these<00:01:53.700> episodes<00:01:54.170> more<00:01:55.170> times

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
probably seen these episodes more times

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
probably seen these episodes more times
and<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.009> count<00:01:56.219> over<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> years<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.270> many

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and you can count over the years in many

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.410 
and you can count over the years in many
different<00:01:57.630> formats<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> actually<00:01:59.420> quite

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
different formats it is actually quite

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.100 
different formats it is actually quite
fascinating<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:03.509> new

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
fascinating to see what the new

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.760 
fascinating to see what the new
high-definition<00:02:04.500> transfers<00:02:05.430> look<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
high-definition transfers look like the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.169 
high-definition transfers look like the
new<00:02:07.890> special<00:02:08.280> effects<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.789> take<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.090> or

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
new special effects you can take it or

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.940 
new special effects you can take it or
leave<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:10.009> but<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.060> cool<00:02:12.360> new<00:02:12.629> tape

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
kind of makes sense mainly

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.570 
kind of makes sense mainly
because<00:04:27.319> you<00:04:27.620> know<00:04:27.710> you'd<00:04:27.830> want<00:04:28.039> to<00:04:28.100> see<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.460> if

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
because you know you'd want to see it if

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.559 
because you know you'd want to see it if
there<00:04:28.759> was<00:04:28.789> some<00:04:29.000> kind<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.210> third<00:04:29.389> through

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
there was some kind of third through

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.059 
there was some kind of third through
although<00:04:29.750> there<00:04:29.930> wasn't<00:04:30.080> really<00:04:30.289> any<00:04:30.620> thread

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
although there wasn't really any thread

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.939 
although there wasn't really any thread
with<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.759> Star<00:04:32.060> Trek<00:04:32.270> series<00:04:32.419> in<00:04:32.660> fact

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
with the Star Trek series in fact

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.770 
with the Star Trek series in fact
usually<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.250> order<00:04:34.819> broadcast<00:04:35.330> was<00:04:35.539> somewhat

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
usually the order broadcast was somewhat

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.570 
usually the order broadcast was somewhat
haphazard<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.680> would<00:04:36.919> have<00:04:36.979> preferred<00:04:37.370> to

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
haphazard so I would have preferred to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.960 
haphazard so I would have preferred to
have<00:04:37.610> them<00:04:37.910> an<00:04:38.090> actual<00:04:38.330> shooting<00:04:38.930> order<00:04:39.970> but

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
have them an actual shooting order but

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.249 
have them an actual shooting order but
that's<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.270> small<00:04:41.389> thing<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.720> can<00:04:41.870> watch<00:04:42.020> them<00:04:42.169> in

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
that's a small thing I can watch them in

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.960 
that's a small thing I can watch them in
order<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.530> guess<00:04:42.650> if<00:04:42.919> I<00:04:43.039> want<00:04:43.280> because<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.669> do<00:04:43.729> not

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
order I guess if I want because I do not

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.820 
order I guess if I want because I do not
the<00:04:44.090> order<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.449> well<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:44.780> go<00:04:45.380> to<00:04:45.440> any

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
the order and well it just go to any

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.589 
the order and well it just go to any
Star<00:04:46.250> Trek<00:04:46.430> website<00:04:46.849> you<00:04:47.000> can<00:04:47.120> get<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.300> actual

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
Star Trek website you can get the actual

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.219 
Star Trek website you can get the actual
order<00:04:48.099> but<00:04:49.099> all<00:04:49.520> in<00:04:49.669> all<00:04:49.789> I<00:04:50.090> would<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:50.990> to

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
order but all in all I would have to

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.350 
order but all in all I would have to
give<00:04:51.380> this<00:04:51.740> set<00:04:52.009> an<00:04:52.220> 8<00:04:52.430> now<00:04:52.910> like<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.150> said<00:04:53.330> I

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
give this set an 8 now like I said I

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.850 
give this set an 8 now like I said I
have<00:04:53.479> not<00:04:53.690> been<00:04:53.840> through<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.289> entire<00:04:54.530> thing

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
have not been through the entire thing

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.080 
have not been through the entire thing
yet<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.690> will<00:04:56.990> probably<00:04:57.340> if<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.520> find

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
yet but I will probably if I find

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.409 
yet but I will probably if I find
something<00:04:59.740> highly<00:05:00.740> notable<00:05:01.460> then<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.060> will

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
something highly notable then I will

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.080 
something highly notable then I will
record<00:05:03.080> another<00:05:03.229> video<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:04.520> for<00:05:04.580> right<00:05:04.880> now

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
record another video but for right now

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.610 
record another video but for right now
that<00:05:05.479> is<00:05:05.690> my<00:05:06.199> rather<00:05:07.130> brief<00:05:07.729> view<00:05:08.570> of<00:05:08.630> Star

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
that is my rather brief view of Star

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.400 
that is my rather brief view of Star
Trek<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.949> original<00:05:09.979> series<00:05:10.310> blu-ray<00:05:11.349> but<00:05:12.349> I

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
Trek the original series blu-ray but I

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.200 
Trek the original series blu-ray but I
wanted<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.800> get<00:05:12.919> this<00:05:13.190> review<00:05:13.400> up<00:05:13.639> there<00:05:13.910> as

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
wanted to get this review up there as

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.909 
wanted to get this review up there as
quickly<00:05:14.570> as<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:14.870> could

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
quickly as I could

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.680 
quickly as I could
pricing<00:05:16.580> it's<00:05:16.789> actually<00:05:17.120> better<00:05:17.300> than<00:05:17.509> some

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
pricing it's actually better than some

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.010 
pricing it's actually better than some
of<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.840> other<00:05:17.960> sets<00:05:19.090> got<00:05:20.090> typically<00:05:20.630> with<00:05:20.870> the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
of the other sets got typically with the

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.680 
of the other sets got typically with the
next-generation<00:05:21.409> Voyager<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.370> whatnot<00:05:22.690> be

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
next-generation Voyager and whatnot be

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.469 
next-generation Voyager and whatnot be
anywhere<00:05:23.990> between<00:05:24.139> 120<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.250> some<00:05:26.150> cases

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
anywhere between 120 to some cases

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.770 
anywhere between 120 to some cases
upwards<00:05:26.840> of<00:05:26.960> $150<00:05:27.800> Canadian<00:05:28.250> this<00:05:29.240> one<00:05:29.449> was<00:05:29.630> on

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
upwards of $150 Canadian this one was on

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.550 
upwards of $150 Canadian this one was on
sale<00:05:30.190> we<00:05:31.190> could<00:05:31.370> release<00:05:31.610> for<00:05:31.880> $79.99<00:05:32.599> so<00:05:33.380> they

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
sale we could release for $79.99 so they

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.409 
sale we could release for $79.99 so they
are<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:34.130> little<00:05:34.400> better<00:05:34.550> than<00:05:34.610> they<00:05:35.389> were

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
are a little better than they were

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.020 
are a little better than they were
before<00:05:35.750> but<00:05:36.199> still<00:05:36.610> somewhat<00:05:37.610> over<00:05:37.789> price

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
before but still somewhat over price

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.870 
before but still somewhat over price
compared<00:05:38.449> to<00:05:38.630> other<00:05:38.900> series<00:05:39.830> sets<00:05:40.130> although

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
compared to other series sets although

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.370 
compared to other series sets although
given<00:05:41.090> that<00:05:41.300> it<00:05:41.419> is<00:05:41.449> a<00:05:41.539> blu-ray<00:05:41.930> they<00:05:42.080> do<00:05:42.169> tend

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
given that it is a blu-ray they do tend

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.439 
given that it is a blu-ray they do tend
to<00:05:42.440> be<00:05:42.530> more<00:05:42.620> expensive<00:05:43.009> anyway<00:05:43.400> but<00:05:44.270> that's

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
to be more expensive anyway but that's

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.080 
to be more expensive anyway but that's
at<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:45.020> end<00:05:45.139> of<00:05:45.229> this<00:05:45.380> update<00:05:45.580> so<00:05:46.580> once<00:05:46.969> again

at the end of this update so once again
