00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.659
 we are in your choice 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.380
 a floor where the best for the rojiblancos colors 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 goes hand in hand with a nationalism 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.249
 here in Guadalajara Jalisco 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.869
 presides the most popular Mexican soccer team according to consultation 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.809
 mitofsky chivas has 22 points seven percent of the national preference 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.050
 Chivas has many elements to be able to identify the cd 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.420
 a very big story 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.150
 great big players representing the Mexican national team 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 p is there 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590
 of local age 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.540
 and that is that the Chivas team does not hire foreigners 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.230
 the chivas efe vienna team of mexican talents 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 this strategy at least in the perfect 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.840
 it makes us think that they are representatives to be born 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.350
 from our country 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.630
 Guadalajara's sports club is the only Mexican team that have more 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.130
 of 100 uninterrupted years 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.130
 a young Belgian named edgar rivera was founded in 1906 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.690
 it was called first a 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.640
 and although in the beginning the foreigners predominated shortly after the creation of the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.480
 set the foresight to play with only Mexicans the rest in their code 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.360
 honorary 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.950
 for 1908 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.450
 Take the name of the city and make it yours efe Guadalajara is a city and with 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.880
 ica for mexico almost all cultural identity elements 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.540
 national 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.330
 the years go by 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.850
 that burden is part of the speech of a team that has closed the borders 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.860
 in international markets 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.880
 for me 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.319
 has many partners formulated from a state policy 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.190
 rooney 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.660
 December rose rose gave his 30 years the 70 years there are not many of 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.429
 the assistants institution of imports the unit 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.580
 the best thing for countries economically 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.010
 3 time to decide 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.060
 our own products I do not know what I'm not going to pretend 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.460
 the world economy grew 0 1 percentage point 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.859
 it worked a lot 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.269
 Calixtus is probably the most bolero state in the republic 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.819
 always in the shadow of the chivas have written their history great teams 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.649
 memories 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.649
 being age after the official antagonist of the flock 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.319
 opposes two ways of thinking in all your senses 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.400
 It is a natural classic originated in the region since the early sixteenth century 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.899
 the players are given from jalisco specifically from Guadalajara 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.119
 they make fun of it since then it has gone well urges the proxy the nickname 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.840
 chivas 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.969
 they run like chivas what they do 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.829
 the chiva is the official mascot 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.249
 its origin dates from a pejorative comment launched by a journalist 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.709
 financial 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.190
 the rojiblancos of yesteryear never thought that if I told him they played 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.549
 as chivas 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.279
 but it was this symbol that questioned the team is becoming the 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.279
 imaginary champions 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.439
 nothing the mascot of the nearest city 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.999
 at high loan rates one goes to the Mexican countryside in any region 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:13.439
 any state 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.680
 i the activity of livestock grazing is one of the most common activities 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.029
 especially in the cattle states 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:26.180
 grazing the herd as it is said in the field is something that is very close 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.620
 both the people of the rural media communities 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.799
 as well as urban media 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:32.760
 so 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.419
 in this sense 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.569
 the icon of the chirla 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.919
 It makes us very close 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.630
 and also our cuisine in Mexico 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.239
 is also composed of this entity we save 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.349
 As a symbol 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.530
 so, let's go 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.169
 we already have a 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.909
 efe an icon we have a very consolidated mosaic in our country 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.200
 and the chivas team 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.739
 of course I regulate it 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.899
 all these elements placed in society 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.899
 they make us have the most popular team in our country 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:08.359
 However, the team's sporting successes are imminent, but more than 50% 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.559
 its league titles the organ the very champion 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:15.249
 in 13 years conquer or four championships of the 11 that you have the 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.309
 Chivas people many times 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.749
 what elevates the city with a certain nostalgia for a mexico that no longer exists 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.099
 it's a nation project 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.330
 that in the global world and physically it can be sustained not however 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.169
 to citizens doing chivas 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.680
 the identity of being chiva no 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.880
 since 1959 america wanted to take the antagonistic role of this story at a 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.819
 national 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.879
 and through the media it was developed what today 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.330
 it is known as the national classic 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.520
 center 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.629
 Alvaro Ortega 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:54.159
 has thanked the polls we know the case by case it is assumed that each 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.479
 employee 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.330
 later 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.559
 just one year 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.240
 with this ideology of big business 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.240
 of corporatism 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.809
 this is the jalisco stadium 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.809
 and if the old rojiblancas glories 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:13.740
 the ecopark or terms 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.610
 it was difficult 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.720
 the afternoons in the old stadium seem to be told the new time 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.150
 specific in 2010 a fact that the herd leave this field for 100 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.099
 soccer is nothing but fire to go 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.809
 football efe 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:32.899
 all this social phenomenon that surrounds it from the symbolic aspects these 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.259
 experts of management entities that we already said 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.450
 until also 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.900
 these cultural conditions that are installed outside the stadiums 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.090
 one is going to contemplate an electric party and a model of 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.449
 state 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.800
 the stages 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.300
 this happens because football d the main difference 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.240
 nowadays one of the main roads 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.119
 the past due portfolio has been the most fertile in recent years 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:09.139
 useful she became this administration however it is part of the 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.019
 identity message of the chivas that touch with the way of being of interest 

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:15.939
 from the nostalgia of a country 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.559
 that was built with the cinema of the golden age 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:21.749
 it was built with the speech of the x of the gal 

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:23.559
 well, that sense 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.360
 in the 60s he got off 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.419
 it's not a modernizing discourse stated in practice the company 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.189
 now the club has had to modernize and it does quite well 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:37.900
 but the discourse of imagining in the hearts of people still sees everything 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.020
 this relationship with 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.750
 with the national, not for the moment football is a reflection of this society and 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.860
 it's a one-generation exhaust valve 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.309
 for at least 90 minutes
