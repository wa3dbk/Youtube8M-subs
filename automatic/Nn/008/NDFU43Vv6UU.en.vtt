00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello finally we have someone to thank 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.110
 the creation of the emoticons we are going to 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.820
 allow gratitude because not 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.780
 I like emoticons until I 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.550
 disgusting emoticons are both caritas 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.530
 they are caritas are not warm they are round 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.750
 sick with hepatitis that pretends to be 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.010
 point moods but respect not 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.010
 nothing happens about his fascination with 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.140
 them and I listen I hear you have to 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.400
 say of this 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.800
 well apparently the first emoticon 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.230
 appeared in the 17th century in a poem is 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.700
 they also say that it is a mistake of 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.990
 print that says is not proven 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.190
 what is wrong is that they exist and point 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.990
 you were already going to forgive all the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.700
 emoticons set the devil and already 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.900
 is before before when there were 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.400
 emoticons everything was cooler than what 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.930
 I could send a message to someone arrested 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.610
 in a while and that was enough for the other 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.230
 person is that now you can do that 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.340
 now you can do that the same thing 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.600
 send a message to someone who saw you 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.340
 in a while and it does not include a little face 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.140
 smiling and a flamenco dancing and 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.640
 you have 20 return messages of what you 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.140
 happen you're fine this super series is 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:09.590
 well that describing put the flamenco 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:10.909
 it is already but I am well in existence what 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.130
 I will explain with an example 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.929
 you will not understand is simple imagine 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.929
 that you and I are left to kidnap me 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.569
 Well, anyone because I came out 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.179
 previous 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.310
 Well, there is the wake of what 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.569
 I went and then now let's focus 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.149
 I do not arrive and then you send me a 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.069
 message of all good when they did not exist 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.060
 the emoticons the hijacker in that 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.579
 I knew I had a problem 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.990
 because he wrote exactly like 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.340
 as I write to you or you who 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.740
 suspect and that causes you to call the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.840
 police and problems to like do without 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.420
 But with emoticons when you 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.920
 You send everything right he knows that little face 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.289
 smiling and thumbs up 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.820
 and if for whatever it is you insist and say 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.770
 but you are going to come and I am sending you 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.670
 with a mask you will think in class 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.979
 of government 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.689
 and you will relax in your kidnapped 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.670
 you understand now the greatness of the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.219
 Emoticons to the clear had not thought 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.690
 because we stayed in the colors that 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.019
 is the trick you have to do away with the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.760
 emoticons - with mounts to 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.840
 constituents and touch them I love we'll do 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.099
 as those who can stay but if 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.959
 you ever band a message of everything 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.610
 ok and I send you a bonnet and we would continue 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.200
 the police and so kidnap and everything but 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.200
 do not touch it does not stay 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.519
 nothing country nothing 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.519
 you are welcome 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.240
 the moment that covers his eyes 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.760
 kidnaps also the forest that is covered 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.130
 my eyes have put a ribbon on my 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.860
 clear eyes 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.840
 I do not see anything 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.110
 goodbye 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.110
