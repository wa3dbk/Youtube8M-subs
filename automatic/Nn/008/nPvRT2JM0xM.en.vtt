00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
more things that might not necessarily

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.219 
more things that might not necessarily
be<00:01:46.350> better<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.070> they<00:01:47.579> give<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.850> more<00:01:48.030> options

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
give yourself a fresh start these

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.370 
give yourself a fresh start these
options<00:02:06.280> for<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.940> then<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:08.110> option

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
options for you then this option

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.070 
options for you then this option
basically<00:02:08.740> allows<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.399> know<00:02:09.490> your<00:02:09.670> KD<00:02:10.080> I'm

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
basically allows you know your KD I'm

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
basically allows you know your KD I'm
not<00:02:11.230> sure<00:02:11.440> if<00:02:11.500> those<00:02:11.650> your<00:02:11.830> kills<00:02:12.160> but<00:02:13.000> allows

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
not sure if those your kills but allows

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.750 
not sure if those your kills but allows
your<00:02:13.450> KD<00:02:13.720> your<00:02:14.230> win-loss<00:02:14.680> ratio<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:15.640> what

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
your KD your win-loss ratio and for what

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.850 
your KD your win-loss ratio and for what
I<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.240> definitely<00:02:16.390> resets<00:02:17.230> your<00:02:17.380> level

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
I know it definitely resets your level

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.560 
I know it definitely resets your level
to<00:02:18.010> level<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:18.910> could<00:02:19.060> start<00:02:19.360> over

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
to level one so you could start over

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.260 
to level one so you could start over
again<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.860> next<00:02:20.890> thing<00:02:21.280> they<00:02:21.400> have<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.760> double

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
again the next thing they have is double

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.360 
again the next thing they have is double
XP<00:02:22.720> from<00:02:23.320> what<00:02:23.530> I'm<00:02:23.650> hearing<00:02:23.680> about<00:02:24.220> this

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
XP from what I'm hearing about this

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.370 
XP from what I'm hearing about this
double<00:02:24.730> XP<00:02:25.060> option<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.570> only<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> limited

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
double XP option is only for a limited

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
time when you prestige not actually the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.380 
time when you prestige not actually the
entire<00:02:29.590> prestige<00:02:30.220> post<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.120> some<00:02:31.270> other

entire prestige post with some other

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.320 
entire prestige post with some other
people<00:02:31.510> think<00:02:31.950> all<00:02:32.950> right<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.730> now<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.030> next

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
people think all right so now the next

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.420 
people think all right so now the next
thing<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> list<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.500> have<00:02:35.620> double<00:02:36.070> weapon

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
thing on the list you have double weapon

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.199 
thing on the list you have double weapon
XP<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.450> similar<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.530> double<00:02:39.370> xp<00:02:39.670> for<00:02:39.700> you

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
XP so similar to the double xp for you

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.690 
XP so similar to the double xp for you
know<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.630> game<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.140> kills<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:42.100> double<00:02:42.550> up

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
know the game with kills this double up

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.729 
know the game with kills this double up
in<00:02:42.850> XP<00:02:43.209> allows<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.780> rank<00:02:43.959> up<00:02:44.200> whatever

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
in XP allows you to rank up whatever

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.000 
in XP allows you to rank up whatever
weapon<00:02:45.130> you're<00:02:45.280> using<00:02:45.520> twice<00:02:45.940> as<00:02:46.150> fast<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
weapon you're using twice as fast and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.740 
weapon you're using twice as fast and
basically<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.400> get<00:02:48.670> more<00:02:48.850> attachments<00:02:49.600> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
basically you get more attachments and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.100 
basically you get more attachments and
get<00:02:50.350> your<00:02:50.470> gold<00:02:50.709> camo<00:02:51.010> wherever<00:02:51.459> much<00:02:51.790> quicker

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
get your gold camo wherever much quicker

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.900 
get your gold camo wherever much quicker
using<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.200> option<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.920> think<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.550> is<00:02:54.580> also

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
using this option I think it is also

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.780 
using this option I think it is also
limited<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.660> time<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.739> might<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.040> 24<00:02:57.640> or

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
limited to time so it might be a 24 or

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.090 
limited to time so it might be a 24 or
48<00:02:58.030> hour<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:59.170> know<00:03:00.239> wait<00:03:01.239> time<00:03:01.540> or<00:03:01.900> how<00:03:02.799> long

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
48 hour you know wait time or how long

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.789 
48 hour you know wait time or how long
you<00:03:03.280> can<00:03:03.459> use<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.790> for<00:03:04.000> type<00:03:04.269> thing<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.810> the

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
you can use it for type thing and the

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.590 
you can use it for type thing and the
next<00:03:05.830> thing<00:03:06.160> on<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.340> list<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.299> the

next thing on the list is you have the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.289 
next thing on the list is you have the
unlock<00:03:08.230> year<00:03:08.739> option<00:03:09.250> which<00:03:09.489> allows<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:10.090> to
