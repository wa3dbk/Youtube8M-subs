 ultra line is called he com like this 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.269
 everything is just ultra cam and so this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 carton pack in white color seeds 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.820
 let go of course on the box itself 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.529
 we have pictograms that talk about 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.990
 that he writes 30 frames per second 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.840

 as well as mounting on the windshield 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 which urinate 360 â€‹â€‹degrees 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.820
 rear rolling characteristics 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 evidence of the video decision also 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.059
 hdmi and usb and you video codec interfaces 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920
 that he is at night, respectively 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.320
 Absolutely shoots video format and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.370
 4 each photo format we live naturally 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.140
 here we immediately see the instructions for 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 operation in Russian 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 we have a warranty graph is here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.250
 the very end of xii is all described that guarantees 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 phone where to complain where to shout and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.940
 where actually throw an ax 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.309
 place and so the device itself here it is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 we are available here now 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.130
 talk to him separately so we look 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.070
 although the kit has already said the instruction 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.390
 here's an interesting one 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.330
 tight and Christmas trees know what is called ta 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 general plastic or foam or I would 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.740
 also can not understand but he is enough 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 dense 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.460
 has a soft based so we see 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 mount here to this device and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.880
 drove it that directly 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.220
 useful and by the way here and now so that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 about could in the world in lineup 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.049
 what is it all eating so we see i want 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.780

 piled pretty enough by the way 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.509
 suitable for old cars for example 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.939
 Soviet and German production there 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.710
 very thin and length slots here lit 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.200
 in the car itself why is it interesting yes all 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.240
 very simple as a conclusion, see 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.290

 half a meter everything is great everything is like 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.130
 usually just an interesting one like this 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.500
 the fact that we have one more them this 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.700

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.690
 centimeters on upside down we 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.120
 see a small screen I suppose in. 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.790
 no more than one and a half well, actually very 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.250
 device by the way let's get more 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.170
 a few words about 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.959
 mounting the recorder on the windshield glass 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.700
 Recently, many companies 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.519
 use them minimized that land 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.230
 very well and accordingly she 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.459
 thus fastens clamped and 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.470
 makes the vacuum just a turning point 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.750
 the mount itself by the way here you 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.180
 fortification there is a mini usb entrance for 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.760
 the charger is right here 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.620
 and since here we see a connector for 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.330
 to feed us a registrar 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.240
 Well, let's give it the last trump card 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.360

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.490
 the screen there are three more buttons one 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.590
 of which means own either 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.730

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.080
 check danish total 2 rest 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.760
 Naturally arrows that is management 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.800
 on the menu, well, or maybe they still 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.870
 the rest are such additional functions 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.330
 so we see just such a lens matrix 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.740
 here we are as the manufacturer says 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.930

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.699
 lantern how to say it here we 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.720
 see the speaker from which he is clearly 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.560
 is talking 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.919
 way below hd ice here in the same mini 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.780
 yusb 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.620
 there is a hole for forced 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.360
 rebooting the device itself and 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.790
 naturally tv output as well 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.620
 we have big huge backsides 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.560
 keys well naturally yes by the way here 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.480
 here is micro sd card 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.730
 Well, the connection itself strengthen 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.320
 here and so what is it really 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.960
 really huge 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.570
 the button that starts the video above 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.610
 photo button and below we have a button 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.560
 inclusion in what interest launched 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.000
 shoots video and and in order to make 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.810
 photos are not necessary for us and 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.280
 stop video 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.800
 we just have to press 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.440
 photos at the time of shooting video and some 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.030
 better from frames 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.110
 of this video which will take place in 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.000
 online well, I will chip off as 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.950
 you can take photographs 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.800
 without stopping the video it's very nice 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.850
 So we take clings strictly speaking it 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.250
 what did i tell you 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.220
 clings to quite tightly those not 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.560
 less a slam shut him become 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.630
 that is, something like this 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.820
 this device is yes by the way weight 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.060
 completely small size and i'm already you 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.800
 spoke plastic we have black gloss on 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.240
 which shows fingerprints but I 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.470
 I think that yes is not so important for 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.180
 there are not so many cars 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.860
 where will the matter be considered at all 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.690
 try this to turn it on 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.780
 love firmware is disabled 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.410
 here you see a screen about here 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.360
 By the way, you can see these sizes . 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.540
 by the ratio of the line it can be seen 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.310
 and as usual the battery was not enough for 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.010
 to show everything completely 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.500
 so he leads the glass involved 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:55.070
 turns and so on average 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.690
 you can say it's good with and 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.580
 technological high technological 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.320
 Commerce also speaks look at 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.490
 I get to know him myself 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.560
 this device is nothing supernatural 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.320
 looks uncomplicated even cute from 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.430
 big buttons writes the sound well actually 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.230
 and all are inherent
