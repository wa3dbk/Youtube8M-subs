which<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.710> really<00:02:29.190> odd<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.510> has<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> slight

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
which is really odd so it has a slight

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.550 
which is really odd so it has a slight
essence<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.710> ketchup<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:33.290> paired<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
essence of ketchup to it paired with the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:45.950 
essence of ketchup to it paired with the
beans<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:39.920> yeah<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:42.870> bad<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:45.480> don't<00:02:45.870> know

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
beans and yeah so it's bad I don't know

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.110 
beans and yeah so it's bad I don't know
if<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.430> unconstitutionally<00:02:47.430> bad<00:02:47.930> but<00:02:48.930> um

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
if it's unconstitutionally bad but um

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.640 
if it's unconstitutionally bad but um
let's<00:02:51.120> hope<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.540> will<00:02:51.630> not<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:52.350> any

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
let's hope it will not be on any
