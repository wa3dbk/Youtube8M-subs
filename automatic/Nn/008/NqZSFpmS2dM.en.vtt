00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
it's important that you know how to use

card<00:00:09.510> template<00:00:09.870> but<00:00:10.019> all<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.349> templates<00:00:10.740> have

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
card template but all the templates have

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.459 
card template but all the templates have
the<00:00:11.040> same<00:00:11.250> crop<00:00:11.610> marks<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.120> them<00:00:12.300> let's<00:00:13.259> take<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the same crop marks on them let's take a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490 
the same crop marks on them let's take a
closer<00:00:13.769> look<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:15.360> outermost<00:00:15.660> area<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.289> called

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
closer look the outermost area is called

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.769 
closer look the outermost area is called
the<00:00:16.680> bleed<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> area<00:00:18.420> that

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the bleed and this is the area that

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
the bleed and this is the area that
allows<00:00:18.869> us<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.590> color<00:00:19.920> run<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.760> way

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
allows us to have color run all the way

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.250 
allows us to have color run all the way
out<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> edge<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> paper

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.230 

the<00:00:25.260> next<00:00:25.560> area<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.039> red<00:00:26.490> line<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.090> that's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the next area is the red line and that's

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.359 
the next area is the red line and that's
called<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> trim<00:00:27.900> line<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.039> where<00:00:29.220> we

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
called the trim line this is where we

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
called the trim line this is where we
try<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> cut<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> edge<00:00:30.240> off<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> bleed<00:00:31.109> so

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
try to cut the edge off the bleed so

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
try to cut the edge off the bleed so
that<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.340> color<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.360> out<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that we have color all the way out to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.370 
that we have color all the way out to
the<00:00:33.690> edge<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> paper

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the edge of the paper

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740 
the edge of the paper
now<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.010> try<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> hit<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.700> trim<00:00:36.300> line<00:00:36.510> as

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
now we try to hit that trim line as

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.090 
now we try to hit that trim line as
precisely<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.320> possible

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
precisely as possible

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
precisely as possible
however<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.760> cutting<00:00:39.090> process<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.660> not

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
however the cutting process is not

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.310 
however the cutting process is not
perfect<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.550> you'll<00:00:42.000> definitely<00:00:42.239> lose<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
perfect so you'll definitely lose the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.959 
perfect so you'll definitely lose the
entire<00:00:43.590> bleed<00:00:43.980> area<00:00:45.500> but<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.100> may<00:00:47.340> also<00:00:47.520> lose

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
entire bleed area but you may also lose

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.920 
entire bleed area but you may also lose
a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.600> portion<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.649> inner<00:00:49.950> area<00:00:50.930> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
a little portion of the inner area this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
a little portion of the inner area this
area<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.440> called<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> unsafe<00:00:53.550> zone<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
area is called the unsafe zone and it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
area is called the unsafe zone and it
represents<00:00:55.110> everything<00:00:55.620> between<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.100> trim

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
represents everything between the trim

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.040 
represents everything between the trim
line<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.960> safe<00:00:58.199> zone<00:00:59.359> this<00:01:00.359> area<00:01:00.750> marked

here<00:01:20.820> should<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.630> safe<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.259> won't<00:01:22.830> lose<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
here should be safe you won't lose it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530 
here should be safe you won't lose it
during<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> cutting<00:01:23.820> process<00:01:23.939> no<00:01:24.509> matter

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
during the cutting process no matter

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.070 
during the cutting process no matter
what<00:01:26.090> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.360> where<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:27.990> your

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
what this is where you want to put your

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.100 
what this is where you want to put your
content<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:30.180> let's<00:01:30.390> take<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> look<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:30.960> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
content so let's take a look at this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.020 
content so let's take a look at this
process<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> real<00:01:32.250> playing<00:01:32.759> card<00:01:35.030> we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
process with a real playing card we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.149 
process with a real playing card we
start<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.420> our<00:01:36.450> template<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.979> add<00:01:38.130> our

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
start with our template and we add our

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.330 
start with our template and we add our
graphics<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.320> our<00:01:40.439> content<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> remain

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
graphics we want our content to remain

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.090 
graphics we want our content to remain
all<00:01:41.729> inside<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.780> safe<00:01:42.990> zone<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.619> everything

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
all inside the safe zone so everything

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.160 
all inside the safe zone so everything
outside<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.850> safe<00:01:45.060> zone<00:01:45.299> would<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.020> be

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
outside the safe zone would just be

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.469 
outside the safe zone would just be
bleed<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.829> border<00:01:47.250> area<00:01:49.009> I'll<00:01:50.009> make<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
bleed or border area I'll make it

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.520 
bleed or border area I'll make it
semi-transparent<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.200> see

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
semi-transparent so you can kind of see

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.300 
semi-transparent so you can kind of see
the<00:01:53.340> card<00:01:53.670> through<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> template<00:01:55.310> here

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the card through to the template here

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.389 
the card through to the template here
you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.149> dashed<00:01:57.420> line<00:01:58.189> where<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you can see the dashed line where the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
you can see the dashed line where the
safe<00:01:59.640> zone<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
safe zone is and you can see that the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
safe zone is and you can see that the
content<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.130> well<00:02:02.340> within<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> let<00:02:03.750> me<00:02:03.840> make<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
content is well within it let me make it
