00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
but again I'm on my lunch break I fixed

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.320 
but again I'm on my lunch break I fixed
the<00:00:26.060> LCD<00:00:27.060> monitor<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:28.050> my<00:00:28.380> flip<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:29.300> what<00:00:30.300> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the LCD monitor in my flip or what I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.040 
the LCD monitor in my flip or what I
don't<00:00:30.570> know<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> monitor<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> LCD

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
don't know if it's a monitor but the LCD

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.380 
don't know if it's a monitor but the LCD
display<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.320> flip<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:35.180> got<00:00:36.180> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
display and the flip here got it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.330 
display and the flip here got it
repaired<00:00:36.930> apparently<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> flip<00:00:37.980> mino<00:00:38.280> is

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
repaired apparently the flip mino is

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.979 
repaired apparently the flip mino is
just<00:00:41.340> uses<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> same<00:00:42.079> monitor<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.379> same

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
just uses the same monitor the same

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.520 
just uses the same monitor the same
display<00:00:45.989> screen<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:48.440> second<00:00:49.440> generation

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
display screen as the second generation

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.799 
display screen as the second generation
ipod<00:00:50.309> nano<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> flip<00:00:52.559> mino<00:00:52.920> HD

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
ipod nano so if you have a flip mino HD

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
ipod nano so if you have a flip mino HD
I<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> Flip<00:00:55.469> Ultra<00:00:55.559> uses<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:56.309> 12<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
I think the Flip Ultra uses same 12 and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
I think the Flip Ultra uses same 12 and
it<00:00:57.660> breaks<00:00:57.870> cuz<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.219> easy<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> break

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it breaks cuz it's really easy to break

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
it breaks cuz it's really easy to break
the<00:00:59.940> screen<00:01:00.440> like<00:01:01.440> four<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.010> our<00:01:02.129> friends<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the screen like four of our friends and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.810 
the screen like four of our friends and
I<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:03.149> Shh<00:01:03.780> rocco's<00:01:04.650> broke<00:01:04.979> Erich<00:01:05.400> fodor's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
I think Shh rocco's broke Erich fodor's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.679 
I think Shh rocco's broke Erich fodor's
broke<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:07.680> Frank<00:01:08.310> halley's<00:01:08.850> broke<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.510> lot

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
broke I think Frank halley's broke a lot

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
broke I think Frank halley's broke a lot
of<00:01:09.750> people<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.140> broken<00:01:10.500> screens<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> go

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
of people have broken screens but you go

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.410 
of people have broken screens but you go

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
on amazon for like 14 bucks i think and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.870
