 girls also of all the things there 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.420
 in the environment and that we take during 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.759
 all day in our faces so 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.850

 that for very little makeup that we 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.950
 let's see seemingly 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.950
 reality the face is very dirty 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.049
 percured and we need to clean it for 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.049

 They are generally waterproof as well 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.140
 that we need a make-up remover that 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.929

 we have when trying to remove all the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.049
 mask that we put on but with 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.239
 simple smooth movements down 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:17.220

 very soft we are going to remove the delineated and 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.600
 all those things a little bit more 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.390
 difficult to remove and also with a 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.130
 side of the clean copy we are going to remove 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.910
 impurities that may enter 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.910

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.390
 this is through is quite effective 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.790
 but the more we can clean 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.920

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.680
 express line your face is the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.500
 frothy facial cleanser that is 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.079
 cleanser is with melon and vitamin and you go 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.090
 to need to moisten your hands then 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.390
 Apply a little of the product in your 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.760

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.390
 face is with melon and vitamins 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.090
 so it smells delicious and also contributes 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.560
 vitamin e which is super important for 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.079

 helps eliminate excess fat or 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.290
 any impurities and residues of 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.519
 makeup you can have on your skin 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.519
 what can you ask me 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.540
 after having applied very well the 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.670
 product now rinse it with abundant 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.670
 water that does not have anything on your face 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.599
 sometimes we overdo it a bit in the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.999
 force by drying our face with a 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.700
 towel remember that it must be a towel 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:17.650
 clean and try to do it with little touches 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.959
 that simply the towel absorb and what 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.509
 that is going to mistreat your face with the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.240
 towel after this gel the face

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.169
 well the face is the expression face 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.009

 appearance of bone pores is great what 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.919
 What I like most about this facial lotion 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:54.849
 is that it has a few small exfoliants 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.699
 very delicate that cleanse deeply 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.199
 all the politos besides that that 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.669
 wonder you can reduce the 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.979
 appearance of the open pores that a 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.080
 Sometimes we do not like them very much and it makes us 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.720
 look 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.470

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.900
 then rinse with plenty of water 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.069

 super clean locks 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:54.210

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.240
 last of the face expression line the 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.180
 Facial cream is a multi moisturizer 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.629

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.210
 annoying that we do not like the 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.090
 Moisturizers are usually 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.130

 and remember girls from time to time it's 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:25.620
 Super cute looking at the mirror without a 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.680
 drop of makeup as we are by 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.870
 nature as we are with all those 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.000
 small defects that sometimes throw us 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.890
 a little but those flaws those 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.500
 imperfections are what make us 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.030
 unique and really beautiful so 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.280
 we would smile in front of the mirror without 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.700
 makeup and staying as such as 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.700
