Waterman line this is a wetsuit that
actually<00:00:05.609> comes<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:05.970> three<00:00:06.270> five<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:06.990> seven

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
actually comes in three five and seven

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.589 
actually comes in three five and seven
millimeter<00:00:07.980> thicknesses<00:00:08.580> we're<00:00:09.210> looking<00:00:09.480> at

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
millimeter thicknesses we're looking at

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.030 
millimeter thicknesses we're looking at
the<00:00:09.719> three<00:00:09.960> millimeter<00:00:10.380> today<00:00:10.650> but<00:00:10.920> they're

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
the three millimeter today but they're

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.160 
the three millimeter today but they're
all<00:00:11.219> identical<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.940> construction<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
all identical and construction this is

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
all identical and construction this is
for<00:00:13.559> shallow<00:00:13.860> waters<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.610> not

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
for shallow waters this is not

a look at here first is the three

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.609 
a look at here first is the three
millimeter<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.510> five<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> seven<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
millimeter or the five or the seven is

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.650 
millimeter or the five or the seven is
that<00:00:23.100> thickness<00:00:23.730> throughout<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.300> entire

match which is great let's take a look
at<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.860> water<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> nice<00:01:09.420> sink

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
at the the water we have a nice sink

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.149 
at the the water we have a nice sink
here<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.799> shoulder<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
here on the shoulder so I can get in and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.499 
here on the shoulder so I can get in and
out<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> suit<00:01:14.729> easily<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> nice

out of the suit easily you get a nice
wide<00:01:18.810> opening<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
wide opening here so that's how you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
wide opening here so that's how you
would<00:01:20.430> step<00:01:20.670> into<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> suit<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
would step into the suit and then you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
would step into the suit and then you
would<00:01:22.259> velcro<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:22.979> over<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> shoulder<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
would velcro here over the shoulder and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
would velcro here over the shoulder and
you<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.720> safety<00:01:24.960> velcro<00:01:25.500> cinch<00:01:25.830> here

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you have your safety velcro cinch here

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
you have your safety velcro cinch here
on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> top<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.689> into<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
