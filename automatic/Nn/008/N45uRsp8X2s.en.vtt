00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.779 

what<00:00:10.129> he<00:00:10.400> is<00:00:10.580> is<00:00:10.820> that<00:00:11.299> Apes<00:00:11.809> tend<00:00:12.289> to<00:00:12.499> have<00:00:12.789> 24

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
what he is is that Apes tend to have 24

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.909 
what he is is that Apes tend to have 24
pairs<00:00:14.030> of<00:00:14.299> chromosomes<00:00:14.690> 48<00:00:15.320> chromosomes<00:00:15.650> and

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:15.919 
pairs of chromosomes 48 chromosomes and

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.320 
pairs of chromosomes 48 chromosomes and
all<00:00:16.010> but<00:00:16.100> they're<00:00:16.219> going<00:00:16.340> to<00:00:16.400> be<00:00:16.460> in<00:00:16.550> pairs<00:00:16.790> so

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
all but they're going to be in pairs so

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.350 
all but they're going to be in pairs so
it<00:00:17.450> have<00:00:17.570> 24<00:00:18.170> pairs<00:00:18.440> of<00:00:18.770> chromosomes<00:00:19.460> humans

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
it have 24 pairs of chromosomes humans

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.230 
it have 24 pairs of chromosomes humans
have<00:00:20.600> just<00:00:20.900> 23<00:00:21.530> pairs<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.980> chromosomes<00:00:22.370> so

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
have just 23 pairs of chromosomes so

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.120 
have just 23 pairs of chromosomes so
we're<00:00:23.450> obviously<00:00:23.630> not<00:00:24.050> related<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.920> them

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
we're obviously not related to them

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.580 
we're obviously not related to them
because<00:00:25.400> we've<00:00:25.970> only<00:00:26.150> got<00:00:26.360> 23<00:00:26.810> they<00:00:26.930> got<00:00:27.110> 24

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
because we've only got 23 they got 24

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.360 
because we've only got 23 they got 24
but<00:00:28.190> but<00:00:29.030> what<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.750> will<00:00:29.960> find<00:00:30.290> is<00:00:30.830> that<00:00:30.890> there

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
but but what you will find is that there

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.150 
but but what you will find is that there
is<00:00:31.520> this<00:00:31.809> there's<00:00:32.809> a<00:00:32.870> strange<00:00:33.289> phenomenon<00:00:33.620> in

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
is this there's a strange phenomenon in

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.450 
is this there's a strange phenomenon in
genomes<00:00:35.059> when<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.510> look<00:00:35.989> at<00:00:36.170> genomes<00:00:36.980> you

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
genomes when you look at genomes you

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.829 
genomes when you look at genomes you
sometimes<00:00:37.969> find<00:00:38.300> that<00:00:38.510> it<00:00:38.809> appears<00:00:39.320> as<00:00:39.620> if<00:00:40.839> two

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
sometimes find that it appears as if two

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.079 
sometimes find that it appears as if two
chromosomes<00:00:42.409> have<00:00:42.739> fused<00:00:43.219> together<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.999> they

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
chromosomes have fused together and they

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.759 
chromosomes have fused together and they
tend<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.449> refuse<00:00:44.839> to<00:00:45.050> gather<00:00:45.260> around<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
tend to refuse to gather around the

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.669 
tend to refuse to gather around the
central<00:00:46.280> core<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.480> get<00:00:47.839> what's<00:00:48.620> called

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
central core so you get what's called

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.029 
central core so you get what's called
centric<00:00:49.489> fusion<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:51.620> particular

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
centric fusion and that particular

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.340 
centric fusion and that particular
chromosome<00:00:52.640> is<00:00:52.909> chromosome<00:00:53.390> number<00:00:53.600> two<00:00:54.050> in

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
chromosome is chromosome number two in

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.509 
chromosome is chromosome number two in
the<00:00:54.609> human<00:00:55.609> genome<00:00:55.690> which<00:00:56.690> looks<00:00:57.409> like<00:00:57.890> two

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
the human genome which looks like two

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.360 
the human genome which looks like two
fused<00:00:59.389> chromosomes<00:01:00.229> interest<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.920> argument

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
fused chromosomes interest the argument

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.610 
fused chromosomes interest the argument
is<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:01.579> there's<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.999> lot<00:01:02.179> of<00:01:02.210> common<00:01:02.989> data

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
is that there's a lot of common data

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.600 
is that there's a lot of common data
between<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:05.140> chimp<00:01:06.140> chromosomes<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.369> they

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
between the chimp chromosomes and they

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.910 
between the chimp chromosomes and they
and<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.149> human<00:01:08.479> chromosome<00:01:08.990> creamers

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
and the human chromosome creamers

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.440 
and the human chromosome creamers
chromosomes<00:01:10.399> so<00:01:10.610> therefore<00:01:11.000> they're<00:01:11.149> saying

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
chromosomes so therefore they're saying

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.420 
chromosomes so therefore they're saying
well<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:11.810> fused<00:01:12.259> one<00:01:12.530> shows<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.130> we<00:01:13.250> do

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
well this fused one shows that we do

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.679 
well this fused one shows that we do
actually<00:01:13.579> have<00:01:14.680> evolved<00:01:15.680> from<00:01:15.860> ape-like

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
actually have evolved from ape-like

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.910 
actually have evolved from ape-like
ancestors<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:17.869> just<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.229> two<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
ancestors it's just a two of the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.240 
ancestors it's just a two of the
chromosomes<00:01:19.460> on<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.759> AP<00:01:19.969> fused<00:01:20.299> into<00:01:20.509> one<00:01:21.250> one

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
chromosomes on the AP fused into one one

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.149 
chromosomes on the AP fused into one one
in<00:01:22.430> hands<00:01:22.640> giving<00:01:23.149> us<00:01:23.450> just<00:01:24.079> 23<00:01:24.590> pairs<00:01:24.770> so

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
in hands giving us just 23 pairs so

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.700 
in hands giving us just 23 pairs so
that's<00:01:25.399> why<00:01:25.670> we've<00:01:25.909> only<00:01:26.119> got<00:01:26.390> 23<00:01:27.110> because<00:01:27.530> of

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
that's why we've only got 23 because of

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.130 
that's why we've only got 23 because of
the<00:01:27.829> fused<00:01:28.189> ones<00:01:28.610> yeah<00:01:29.090> No<00:01:29.329> Ken<00:01:29.570> Miller<00:01:29.840> has

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the fused ones yeah No Ken Miller has

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.020 
the fused ones yeah No Ken Miller has
really<00:01:30.530> been<00:01:30.680> popularizing<00:01:31.189> this<00:01:31.430> idea<00:01:31.789> for<00:01:31.969> a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
really been popularizing this idea for a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.789 
really been popularizing this idea for a
number<00:01:32.329> of<00:01:32.450> years<00:01:32.600> I<00:01:33.079> want<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.619> take<00:01:33.770> a

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
number of years I want you to take a

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.649 
number of years I want you to take a
look<00:01:34.039> at<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.340> video<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.729> they<00:01:35.210> produced<00:01:35.539> of

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
look at a video that they produced of

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.050 
look at a video that they produced of
Ken<00:01:35.840> talking<00:01:36.409> about<00:01:36.619> this<00:01:36.859> and<00:01:37.100> showing<00:01:37.939> how

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
Ken talking about this and showing how

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.359 
Ken talking about this and showing how
to<00:01:38.090> him<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:38.719> is<00:01:38.930> absolute<00:01:39.920> proof<00:01:40.130> of

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
to him this is absolute proof of

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.020 
to him this is absolute proof of
evolution<00:01:40.939> check<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:41.630> out<00:01:41.950> if<00:01:42.950> humans<00:01:43.549> share

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
evolution check this out if humans share

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.179 
evolution check this out if humans share
a<00:01:44.090> common<00:01:44.570> ancestor<00:01:44.719> with<00:01:45.320> Abe's<00:01:45.649> you'd

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
a common ancestor with Abe's you'd

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.840 
a common ancestor with Abe's you'd
expect<00:01:46.640> us<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.060> have<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.329> same<00:01:47.600> number<00:01:47.840> but

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
expect us to have the same number but

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.990 
expect us to have the same number but
surprisingly<00:01:49.850> human<00:01:50.689> cells<00:01:51.229> contain<00:01:51.740> only<00:01:52.000> 23

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
surprisingly human cells contain only 23

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.179 
surprisingly human cells contain only 23
pairs

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
pairs

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.859 
pairs
now<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.369> share<00:01:56.400> common<00:01:56.850> ancestor<00:01:57.479> what

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
now if we share common ancestor what

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.399 
now if we share common ancestor what
happened<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:59.729> possible<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> line

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
happened is it possible that in the line

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.160 
happened is it possible that in the line
of<00:02:01.619> evolution<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.280> led<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.610> us<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.030> pair<00:02:03.899> of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
of evolution that led to us a pair of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
of evolution that led to us a pair of
chromosomes<00:02:04.830> from<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.430> primate<00:02:05.790> ancestor<00:02:06.360> just

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
chromosomes from a primate ancestor just

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.169 
chromosomes from a primate ancestor just
got<00:02:06.720> lost<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.500> got<00:02:07.649> discarded<00:02:08.250> well<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
got lost and just got discarded well the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.960 
got lost and just got discarded well the
answer<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.660> no<00:02:09.780> it's<00:02:10.380> not<00:02:10.590> possible

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
answer to that is no it's not possible

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.120 
answer to that is no it's not possible
the<00:02:11.970> reason<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.840> because<00:02:13.080> every<00:02:13.620> primate

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
the reason is because every primate

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.400 
the reason is because every primate
chromosome<00:02:14.730> has<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.540> many<00:02:15.660> important<00:02:16.200> genes

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
chromosome has so many important genes

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.160 
chromosome has so many important genes
on<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> loss<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:18.090> both<00:02:18.450> members<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.959> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
on it but the loss of both members of a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.020 
on it but the loss of both members of a
pair<00:02:19.440> would<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:20.069> fatal<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.790> wouldn't<00:02:21.000> even

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
pair would be fatal you wouldn't even

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
pair would be fatal you wouldn't even
get<00:02:21.269> through<00:02:21.390> embryonic<00:02:21.959> development<00:02:21.989> so

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
get through embryonic development so

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.770 
get through embryonic development so
there's<00:02:23.040> only<00:02:23.160> one<00:02:23.550> possible<00:02:24.180> explanation

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
there's only one possible explanation

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.550 
there's only one possible explanation
and<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:26.370> explanation<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.290> line

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and that explanation is then the line

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.640 
and that explanation is then the line
that<00:02:28.860> led<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.130> us<00:02:29.430> two<00:02:30.180> chromosomes<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.140> were

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that led to us two chromosomes that were

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.130 
that led to us two chromosomes that were
separate<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.370> other<00:02:32.640> primates<00:02:33.209> became<00:02:33.660> fused

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
separate and other primates became fused

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.900 
separate and other primates became fused
to<00:02:34.799> form<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:35.160> single<00:02:35.610> chromosome<00:02:37.910> interesting

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
to form a single chromosome interesting

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.640 
to form a single chromosome interesting
so<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:39.690> happened<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.350> proof

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
so is that what happened is that proof

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.440 
so is that what happened is that proof
of<00:02:40.890> evolution<00:02:41.100> right<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:41.850> does<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.060> does

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
of evolution right there does that does

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.880 
of evolution right there does that does
that<00:02:42.480> guarantee<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.260> that's<00:02:43.410> what<00:02:43.590> happened

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that guarantee that that's what happened

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.610 
that guarantee that that's what happened
well<00:02:44.220> no<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.180> isn't<00:02:45.510> proof<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.900> evolution<00:02:46.049> and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
well no it isn't proof of evolution and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.470 
well no it isn't proof of evolution and
there<00:02:46.830> are<00:02:46.920> number<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.400> reasons<00:02:47.670> why<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.299> not

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
there are number of reasons why it's not

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.390 
there are number of reasons why it's not
proof<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.780> evolution<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.500> before<00:02:50.069> we<00:02:50.160> sort<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
proof of evolution but before we sort of

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.890 
proof of evolution but before we sort of
get<00:02:50.549> into<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:51.750> ought<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
get into that I think we ought to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.160 
get into that I think we ought to
comment<00:02:52.500> as<00:02:52.709> well<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:53.190> actually<00:02:53.989> Ken<00:02:54.989> Miller

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
comment as well that actually Ken Miller

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.110 
comment as well that actually Ken Miller
is<00:02:55.410> someone<00:02:55.799> who<00:02:55.920> claims<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.459> Christian<00:02:56.819> faith

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
is someone who claims a Christian faith

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.930 
is someone who claims a Christian faith
and<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.630> why<00:02:57.810> he<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:59.310> believe<00:02:59.609> his

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
and this is why he is I believe his

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.250 
and this is why he is I believe his
background<00:03:00.239> his<00:03:00.359> Roman<00:03:00.630> Catholic<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.170> this

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
background his Roman Catholic but this

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.990 
background his Roman Catholic but this
is<00:03:01.380> why<00:03:01.560> he<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.799> often<00:03:02.130> being<00:03:02.340> used<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.850> this

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
is why he is often being used on this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.150 
is why he is often being used on this
because<00:03:03.239> people<00:03:03.750> will<00:03:03.840> say<00:03:04.140> well<00:03:04.320> look<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:04.680> one

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
because people will say well look as one

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.740 
because people will say well look as one
of<00:03:05.190> your<00:03:05.430> own<00:03:05.609> there's<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.970> Christian<00:03:06.359> who<00:03:06.480> says

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
of your own there's a Christian who says

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.990 
of your own there's a Christian who says
that<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.530> evolution<00:03:08.160> has<00:03:08.340> happened<00:03:08.790> and

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
that this evolution has happened and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.759 
that this evolution has happened and
without<00:03:09.660> getting<00:03:09.810> into<00:03:10.200> debates<00:03:10.530> about

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
without getting into debates about

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.770 
without getting into debates about
different<00:03:11.220> sorts<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.519> Christians<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.600> this

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
different sorts of Christians on this

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.110 
different sorts of Christians on this
point<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.140> point<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.459> he's<00:03:14.670> claiming

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
point the point is that so he's claiming

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.819 
point the point is that so he's claiming
a<00:03:15.180> sort<00:03:15.359> of<00:03:15.420> theistic<00:03:15.690> evolution<00:03:16.530> here

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
a sort of theistic evolution here

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.979 
a sort of theistic evolution here
correct<00:03:17.280> saying<00:03:17.700> obviously<00:03:17.970> God<00:03:18.510> must<00:03:18.840> have

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
correct saying obviously God must have

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.710 
correct saying obviously God must have
used<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.530> because<00:03:20.160> uh<00:03:20.730> here<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.390> we<00:03:21.540> see

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
used this because uh here it is we see

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.280 
used this because uh here it is we see
it<00:03:21.810> happening<00:03:22.079> isn't<00:03:22.769> he<00:03:23.160> approaching<00:03:23.970> this

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
it happening isn't he approaching this

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.810 
it happening isn't he approaching this
information<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.680> fact<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.160> human

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
information that the fact that human

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.880 
information that the fact that human
chromosome<00:03:27.269> number<00:03:27.390> two<00:03:27.690> looks<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:28.709> it's

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
chromosome number two looks like it's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.470 
chromosome number two looks like it's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
been centrally fused together it's got

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.289 
been centrally fused together it's got
telomeres<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.200> each<00:03:31.350> end<00:03:31.880> but<00:03:32.880> it's<00:03:33.060> got<00:03:33.269> a

this<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> point<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.700> only<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.540> know

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
this is the point it's the only you know

this is the point it's the only you know
you<00:03:42.720> see<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.319> humans<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.680> got<00:03:43.799> 23

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
you see that the humans have got 23

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.030 
you see that the humans have got 23
chromosomes<00:03:44.670> what<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.690> don't<00:03:46.230> what<00:03:46.680> he<00:03:46.769> isn't

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
chromosomes what you don't what he isn't

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.319

saying<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.489> that<00:03:47.579> when<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.819> look<00:03:48.000> at<00:03:48.120> many

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
saying is that when you look at many

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.599 
saying is that when you look at many
other<00:03:48.569> animals<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.260> see<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.769> same<00:03:50.010> effects

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
other animals you see the same effects

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.580 
other animals you see the same effects
but<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.269> those<00:03:51.480> other<00:03:51.660> animals<00:03:52.170> people<00:03:52.500> are
