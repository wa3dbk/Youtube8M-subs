Capcom has finally settled down and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
Capcom has finally settled down and
realized<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.550> need<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> next-generation

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
realized we need a next-generation

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
fighting game and this could potentially

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.100

be<00:00:38.280> happening<00:00:38.760> very<00:00:38.790> soon<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.719> highest

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
be happening very soon the highest

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
be happening very soon the highest
spectrum<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.710> possibility<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.820> Street

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149

Fighter<00:00:44.070> find<00:00:44.309> specifically<00:00:44.760> myself<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
Fighter find specifically myself but I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.750 
Fighter find specifically myself but I
think<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.140> high<00:00:46.410> probability

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
think that's a very high probability

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.860 
think that's a very high probability
there's<00:00:47.760> other<00:00:47.940> things<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.510> been<00:00:48.660> on

saying dude I kind of want to make a new
rival<00:00:56.520> schools<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.390> that's<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.690> potential

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
rival schools so that's a potential

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.990 
rival schools so that's a potential
possibility<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.190> other<00:00:59.309> big<00:00:59.609> games<00:00:59.879> like

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
possibility and other big games like

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
possibility and other big games like
dark<00:01:00.390> stalkers<00:01:00.899> however<00:01:01.710> rival<00:01:02.100> schools<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
dark stalkers however rival schools and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
dark stalkers however rival schools and
dark<00:01:02.609> stalkers<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.570> nice<00:01:03.989> style<00:01:04.439> Capcom

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
dark stalkers are very nice style Capcom

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.980 
dark stalkers are very nice style Capcom
games<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.970> highly<00:01:06.360> doubt<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> they're

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
games and I highly doubt that they're

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.210 
games and I highly doubt that they're
gonna<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.290> games<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.680> they'll<00:01:07.799> take<00:01:07.979> into

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
gonna be games that they'll take into

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
gonna be games that they'll take into
consideration<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:08.970> making<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.360> big<00:01:09.630> new

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
consideration when making a big new

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.469 
consideration when making a big new
triple-a<00:01:10.830> high<00:01:11.100> budget<00:01:11.369> fighting<00:01:11.880> game<00:01:12.090> what

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
triple-a high budget fighting game what

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
triple-a high budget fighting game what
I<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> will<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> high

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
I do think it will be with a high

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.260 
I do think it will be with a high
probability<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.790> said<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.090> Street

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
probability like I said is Street

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
probability like I said is Street

Fighter 5 Street Fighter Alpha has a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
Fighter 5 Street Fighter Alpha has a
good<00:01:17.369> chance<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> coming<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> one

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
good chance of coming back but the one

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
good chance of coming back but the one
game<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.610> true<00:01:21.119> game<00:01:21.420> we've<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.780> been
