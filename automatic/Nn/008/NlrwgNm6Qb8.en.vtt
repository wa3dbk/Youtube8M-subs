this is a great trainer to start with as

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
preventing early gangs however since it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.869 
preventing early gangs however since it
only<00:00:49.320> lasts<00:00:49.590> 60<00:00:49.920> seconds<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> make

if you just saw the jungler far away
from<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> map<00:00:57.350> upgrading<00:00:58.350> this

from you on the map upgrading this

from you on the map upgrading this
trinket<00:00:58.680> into<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> stealth<00:00:59.430> Ward<00:00:59.670> option<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
trinket into the stealth Ward option is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.660 
trinket into the stealth Ward option is
worth<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.260> intend<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> use<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> seven

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
worth it if you intend to use it seven

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.210 
worth it if you intend to use it seven
times<00:01:02.940> which<00:01:03.780> will<00:01:03.930> take<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> minimum<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.680> 14

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
times which will take a minimum of 14

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.950 
times which will take a minimum of 14
minutes<00:01:05.489> into<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> game<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.600> unless<00:01:06.810> you're

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
minutes into the game so unless you're

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
minutes into the game so unless you're
trying<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.470> save<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.010> inventory

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
trying to just save out on inventory

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.760 
trying to just save out on inventory
space<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.330> probably<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.170> worth<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.590> since

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
space it's probably not worth it since

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
space it's probably not worth it since
it's<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.280> likely<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's really likely going to take you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.719 
it's really likely going to take you
around<00:01:12.450> 20<00:01:13.080> minutes<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.920> use<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.430> seven

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
around 20 minutes or so to use it seven

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
around 20 minutes or so to use it seven
times<00:01:14.939> meaning<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> get

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
times meaning that you would have to get

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.469 
times meaning that you would have to get
it<00:01:16.740> early<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.640> hurt<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:18.030> build<00:01:18.270> by

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it early which would hurt your build by

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.350 
it early which would hurt your build by
quite<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.920> pink<00:01:20.189> ward<00:01:20.460> upgrade<00:01:20.880> would

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
quite a bit the pink ward upgrade would

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.330 
quite a bit the pink ward upgrade would
have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.869> used<00:01:22.080> five<00:01:22.500> times<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.159> worth

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
have to be used five times to be worth

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
have to be used five times to be worth
it<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:24.000> would<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> minimum<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.960> 15

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it which would take a minimum of 15

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
it which would take a minimum of 15
minutes<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.460> likely<00:01:26.670> around<00:01:27.000> 20<00:01:27.360> as

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
minutes but more likely around 20 as

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.870 
minutes but more likely around 20 as
well<00:01:27.750> also<00:01:28.290> making<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> upgrade<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.460> really

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
well also making the upgrade not really

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
well also making the upgrade not really
worth<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.390> overall<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.619> almost<00:01:32.250> always

used for face checking and because of

used for face checking and because of
this<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.180> actually<00:02:27.990> kind<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.590> terrible<00:02:29.040> in

this it's actually kind of terrible in
the<00:02:29.460> laning<00:02:29.670> phase<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.170> don't<00:02:31.470> need

the laning phase you really don't need

the laning phase you really don't need

to face check very much if at all in the

to face check very much if at all in the
laning<00:02:34.170> phase<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.100> starting<00:02:35.460> with<00:02:35.490> this

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.940 
laning phase so starting with this
trinket<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.240> be<00:02:36.390> kind<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.870> useless<00:02:37.110> but

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
trinket can be kind of useless but

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.320

having one on your team in the mid game
can<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.660> okay<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.530> guess<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.000> face

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
can be okay I guess so that you can face

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.910 
can be okay I guess so that you can face
check<00:02:42.450> some<00:02:42.660> area<00:02:42.990> so<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.410> not<00:02:43.470> get<00:02:43.740> caught

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
check some area so as to not get caught

totem<00:02:46.050> will<00:02:46.350> be<00:02:46.500> vastly<00:02:47.040> superior<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.940> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
put a value on the upgrade but this

the<00:03:06.780> game<00:03:06.900> almost<00:03:07.380> everyone<00:03:07.860> should<00:03:07.980> be

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the game almost everyone should be

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.890 
the game almost everyone should be
starting<00:03:08.400> with<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> warding<00:03:08.940> totem<00:03:09.120> since<00:03:09.750> it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
starting with a warding totem since it

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.720 
starting with a warding totem since it
is<00:03:09.990> much<00:03:10.260> stronger<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.890> laning<00:03:11.070> phase<00:03:11.400> I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
is much stronger in the laning phase I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.060 
is much stronger in the laning phase I

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
recommend getting one warding totem and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.650 
recommend getting one warding totem and
one<00:03:14.190> sweeping<00:03:14.459> lens<00:03:14.700> between<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.209> two<00:03:15.360> people

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
one sweeping lens between the two people

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.270 
one sweeping lens between the two people
