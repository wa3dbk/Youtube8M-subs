where the fuck is to go scientists
saying<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.699> actually<00:00:20.850> breathe<00:00:21.480> fat<00:00:22.020> out

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
saying that we actually breathe fat out

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.519 
saying that we actually breathe fat out
it<00:00:22.740> requires<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.970> burn<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.660> kilo<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> fat

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
it requires to burn one kilo of fat

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.330 
it requires to burn one kilo of fat
requires<00:00:26.070> three<00:00:26.550> kilos<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.300> oxygen<00:00:28.250> so<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
requires three kilos of oxygen so the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.710 
requires three kilos of oxygen so the
more<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.640> breathing<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> more<00:00:30.480> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
more you breathing in the more and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.690 
more you breathing in the more and
you're<00:00:30.810> taking<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.679> more<00:00:31.859> carbon<00:00:32.160> dioxide

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
you're taking in the more carbon dioxide

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.389 
you're taking in the more carbon dioxide
is<00:00:32.940> breathed<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> fat<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> disposed<00:00:35.190> off

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
is breathed out and fat is disposed off

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.580 
is breathed out and fat is disposed off
by<00:00:35.640> water<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.329> sweat<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.960> piss<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
by water so you sweat it you piss it a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.549 
by water so you sweat it you piss it a
small<00:00:38.579> percent<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.200> majority<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
small percent or majority of it is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.069 
small percent or majority of it is
breathed<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.250> by<00:00:41.280> carbon<00:00:42.059> dioxide<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.989> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
breathed out by carbon dioxide so you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.410 
breathed out by carbon dioxide so you
actually<00:00:43.200> believe<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:44.100> fat<00:00:44.340> outs<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
actually believe the fat outs you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
actually believe the fat outs you
breathe<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> fat<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> burn<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> fat

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
breathe the fat out but to burn the fat

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
breathe the fat out but to burn the fat
you<00:00:47.370> need<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> oxygen<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.539> again<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you need the oxygen in and again this is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.889 
you need the oxygen in and again this is
why<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> say<00:00:50.000> cycling<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.180> best<00:00:51.629> because
