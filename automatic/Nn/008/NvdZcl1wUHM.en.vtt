00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.010
 a delicious recipe called 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.920
 poor gentlemen with very ingredients 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.010
 easy to have in the kitchen we are going to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.700
 need what is a baguette or a 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 Italian bread half a liter of milk 5 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.369
 eggs oil for frying 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 and what's been a teaspoon of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.879
 cinnamon and half a cup of sugar 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.000
 this dessert that we are going to make is very 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.070
 easy what is being the bread pan 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.739
 Italian can even do it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.440
 also with bobbins if they can not find the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.899
 baguette then let's slice 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.649
 so skewed more or less about two 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.960
 centimeters after that let's take 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.019
 each of the slices we are going to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.320
 Soak in the bread and we will remove it 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.370
 excess milk and let's go 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 accommodating in a tray 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.220
 since we finished that we're going to mix 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.330
 the half cup of sugar with one 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.330
 teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.990
 and we are going to mix it very well 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 already after that we are going to separate the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.869
 clear of the buds this I have already done 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.700
 in other videos since I have taught you and 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.430
 let's do what is being a 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.200
 egg to ride if they know how to do it 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.039
 it is necessary that 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.299
 continue to see the last the last 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.909
 last minutes of this video but if not 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.060
 they know how to do let's go as we separate 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.130
 we will beat the whites in the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.829
 blender can be hand blender 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.700
 until bolt and in its refractory and not 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.009
 they fall 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.210
 then as you can see here, I do not know 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.460
 It falls already clear already then 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.539
 since they are already going to re-ignite 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.390
 the machine I will add the yolks and 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.530
 let's beat not much more or less 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.690
 30 more seconds this one just for 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.269
 make sure you are very well 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.630
 clear with the yolks and we have one 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.580
 yellow mixture 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.890
 Then, here are ready the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.580
 our changed that we are going to mop the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.400
 bread 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.900
 and what we are going to do now is that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.530
 let's heat in a large pan that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.420
 this is a great pan this planet to 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.390
 where it fits quite 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.239
 let's heat the oil as it is 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.510
 the hot oil let's grab one 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.040
 of the breads that we put in the milk and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.129
 we are going to bathe with the egg 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 we are going to change and what we are going to put 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.280
 fry again we grab a bread 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.790
 We fill the egg with the eggs 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.990
 pan with hot oil 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.780
 and let's fry 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.200
 and 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.610
 this here you already know for this has to have 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.819
 very careful if our guys 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.760
 fillings open will give us an idea that 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:26.810
 let's do this is not easy then 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.810
 Well, since it was hard on the bottom 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.550
 We are going to turn the bread with the egg 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.090
 If you can not do it like that with the spatula 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.400
 can grab a fork or something to 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.290
 that they help each other and that they can turn 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.780
 because in fact these had something left 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.540
 big boys then they are a little 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.970
 heavy because we are simply going to 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.650
 finish frying all here as you can 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.650
 see are already fried on both sides 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.980
 the knights that are already and well here 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.590
 let's follow him until they finish 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.960
 fry all your knights 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.960
 approximately 12 with the 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.350
 baguette that we cut then that 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.310
 is all the last thing that is going to be done is 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.320
 that are going to be sprinkled with what 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.750
 is being sugar mixture and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.650
 cinnamon 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.190
 Y 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.620
 they are going to sprinkle one by one 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.420
 and then finally they can accompany them 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.420
 either serve as more 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:40.370
 some cherries here and more or less 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.340
 I have the photo of how we stayed 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.050
 proof were the truth good I of the 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.479
 I was very worried about the principle 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.909
 mix with egg and that but the truth is 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.279
 that they know very well I hope that they have 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.590
 liked the video do not forget to share it 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:57.999
