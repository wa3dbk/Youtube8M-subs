alarm<00:02:20.240> down<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.610> it's<00:02:22.610> very<00:02:22.730> simple<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.390> take

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
alarm down and it's very simple to take

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
alarm down and it's very simple to take
the<00:02:23.720> alarm<00:02:24.110> off<00:02:24.260> of

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the alarm off of

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.550 
the alarm off of
the<00:02:24.650> ceiling<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:26.560> counterclockwise

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the ceiling is just a counterclockwise

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.000 
the ceiling is just a counterclockwise
twist<00:02:28.280> pull<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.150> alarm<00:02:29.450> off<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.080> then<00:02:30.380> pull

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010

the pen from the back of the smoke

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.540 
the pen from the back of the smoke
detector<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:36.340> disconnect<00:02:37.340> from<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.090> system

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
detector to disconnect from the system

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.610 
detector to disconnect from the system
here<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.569> smoke<00:02:41.810> detector<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.500> took

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
here is the smoke detector I just took

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.920 
here is the smoke detector I just took
down<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.099> has<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> 9-volt<00:02:43.790> battery<00:02:44.150> right<00:02:44.750> in

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
down it has a 9-volt battery right in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.440 
down it has a 9-volt battery right in
here

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
here

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:55.630 
here
and<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:53.599> can<00:02:53.780> see<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.140> three<00:02:54.380> pins<00:02:55.130> right

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and you can see the three pins right

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.270 
and you can see the three pins right
here<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.959> plug<00:03:00.230> right<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.040> can<00:03:01.160> hear

the alarm tripping right on cue I'm
going<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.010> take<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.310> battery<00:03:07.640> out<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.760> this

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
going to take the battery out of this

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.140 
going to take the battery out of this
one<00:03:08.410> there<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.590> no<00:03:09.860> other<00:03:10.099> alarm<00:03:10.549> connected<00:03:11.030> to

one there is no other alarm connected to
this<00:03:11.299> one<00:03:11.540> there<00:03:11.690> was<00:03:11.810> only<00:03:11.959> one<00:03:12.200> smoke<00:03:12.500> alarm

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
this one there was only one smoke alarm

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.650 
this one there was only one smoke alarm
downstairs<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.610> it's<00:03:13.790> not<00:03:13.910> going<00:03:14.090> shouldn't

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
downstairs so it's not going shouldn't

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:23.800 
downstairs so it's not going shouldn't
affect<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.170> others<00:03:21.280> if<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.549> alarm<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.120> going

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
affect the others if the alarm is going

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.449 
affect the others if the alarm is going
off<00:03:24.019> for<00:03:24.260> no<00:03:24.349> apparent<00:03:24.470> reason

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
off for no apparent reason

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.340 
off for no apparent reason
the<00:03:25.760> usual<00:03:26.209> culprit<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.989> because<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:29.350> tiny

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
the usual culprit is because a tiny

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
the usual culprit is because a tiny
insect<00:03:30.920> or<00:03:31.250> dust<00:03:32.150> or<00:03:32.570> smoke<00:03:32.959> got<00:03:33.709> into<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
insect or dust or smoke got into the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.030 
insect or dust or smoke got into the
alarm<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.870> can<00:03:39.079> usually<00:03:39.530> clear<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.890> by

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
alarm and you can usually clear it by

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:50.410 
alarm and you can usually clear it by
blowing<00:03:40.870> into<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.069> sensor<00:03:43.069> here<00:03:49.420> blowing

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
blowing into the sensor here blowing

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.319 
blowing into the sensor here blowing
into<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.690> sides<00:03:51.549> just<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.730> clear<00:03:53.000> out<00:03:53.120> any

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
into the sides just to clear out any

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.930 
into the sides just to clear out any
dust<00:03:53.690> or<00:03:54.109> or<00:03:54.470> small<00:03:54.889> insect<00:03:55.370> which<00:03:55.579> may<00:03:55.790> have

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
dust or or small insect which may have

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.490 
dust or or small insect which may have
gotten<00:03:56.150> inside<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:57.109> smoke<00:03:57.380> alarm

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
gotten inside the smoke alarm

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.349 
gotten inside the smoke alarm
also<00:04:00.500> this<00:04:00.980> your<00:04:01.700> air<00:04:01.880> conditioning<00:04:02.299> system

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
also this your air conditioning system

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.740 
also this your air conditioning system
will<00:04:02.870> bring<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.319> dust<00:04:03.769> smoke<00:04:04.760> things<00:04:05.540> like

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
will bring in dust smoke things like

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.830 
will bring in dust smoke things like
that<00:04:05.930> from<00:04:06.290> outside<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.190> if<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.639> have<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:10.840> fire

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
that from outside so if you have a fire

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.340 
that from outside so if you have a fire
a<00:04:12.260> forest<00:04:12.769> fire<00:04:12.980> nearby<00:04:13.400> something<00:04:14.359> that<00:04:15.019> will

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
a forest fire nearby something that will

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.699 
a forest fire nearby something that will
cause<00:04:15.590> smoke<00:04:16.280> or<00:04:16.489> dust<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:17.209> can<00:04:17.900> be<00:04:18.229> sucked<00:04:18.500> in

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
cause smoke or dust it can be sucked in

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.849 
cause smoke or dust it can be sucked in
by<00:04:18.889> your<00:04:19.039> air<00:04:19.130> conditioning<00:04:19.549> system<00:04:19.609> and

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
by your air conditioning system and

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.029 
by your air conditioning system and
could<00:04:21.859> be<00:04:22.010> triggering<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.610> alarm<00:04:24.039> generally

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
could be triggering the alarm generally

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.270 
could be triggering the alarm generally
this<00:04:25.310> one<00:04:25.550> is<00:04:25.880> about<00:04:26.419> close<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.410> ten<00:04:27.800> years<00:04:28.010> old

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
this one is about close to ten years old

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.830 
this one is about close to ten years old
I'm<00:04:28.520> thinking<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.030> probably<00:04:29.060> needs<00:04:29.660> to<00:04:29.750> be

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
I'm thinking it probably needs to be

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.070 
I'm thinking it probably needs to be
replaced<00:04:29.930> I'm<00:04:30.560> going<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.770> give<00:04:30.919> a

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
replaced I'm going to give a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.980 
replaced I'm going to give a
one<00:04:31.169> more<00:04:31.349> shot<00:04:32.090> see<00:04:33.090> if<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.330> continues<00:04:33.810> to

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
one more shot see if it continues to

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.520 
one more shot see if it continues to
alarm<00:04:34.370> if<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.639> does<00:04:36.080> I'm<00:04:37.080> going<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.289> have<00:04:37.409> to

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
alarm if it does I'm going to have to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.290 
alarm if it does I'm going to have to
take<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:38.129> the<00:04:38.520> hardware<00:04:38.819> store<00:04:38.879> and
