the top five I put them at number four
and<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.419> would<00:03:42.569> also<00:03:42.750> put<00:03:43.199> Joe<00:03:43.470> Haden<00:03:43.859> in<00:03:43.979> there

maybe<00:03:47.430> I'm<00:03:47.549> taking<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:47.940> too<00:03:48.030> far<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.269> didn't<00:03:48.479> get

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
maybe I'm taking it too far I didn't get

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.659 
maybe I'm taking it too far I didn't get
to<00:03:48.599> see<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> Browns<00:03:49.169> a<00:03:49.379> lot<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:50.099> I<00:03:50.159> think<00:03:50.459> Joe

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
to see the Browns a lot but I think Joe

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.119 
to see the Browns a lot but I think Joe
Haden<00:03:51.060> has<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.659> in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> top<00:03:51.989> five<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.590> think

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
Haden has to be in the top five I think

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.369 
Haden has to be in the top five I think
that's<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.370> clear<00:03:53.609> snub<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.180> my<00:03:54.389> opinion<00:03:54.750> which
