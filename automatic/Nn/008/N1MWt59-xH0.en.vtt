two<00:02:07.359> tablespoons<00:02:08.080> maybe<00:02:08.440> not<00:02:08.679> even<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.950> of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
two tablespoons maybe not even that of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.080 
two tablespoons maybe not even that of
the<00:02:09.700> juice<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:11.379> a<00:02:11.680> low<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.129> little<00:02:12.459> bitter

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the juice it's a low is a little bitter

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.809 
the juice it's a low is a little bitter
in<00:02:13.480> taste<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.129> can<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.459> throw<00:02:15.730> off

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
in taste and so it can really throw off

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.970 
in taste and so it can really throw off
the<00:02:15.940> flavor<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.450> add<00:02:16.599> too<00:02:16.629> much<00:02:16.989> but<00:02:17.379> it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the flavor if you add too much but it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.640 
the flavor if you add too much but it
acts<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.580> prebiotic<00:02:19.030> in<00:02:19.599> your<00:02:19.959> body<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.319> so

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
acts as a prebiotic in your body and so

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.210 
acts as a prebiotic in your body and so
it<00:02:20.800> helps<00:02:21.390> support<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.599> flourishing<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.349> your

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it helps support the flourishing of your

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.449 
it helps support the flourishing of your
flora<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.360> gut<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:26.950> way<00:02:27.310> it

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
flora in your gut and in that way it

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.390 
flora in your gut and in that way it
also<00:02:27.790> helps<00:02:28.239> combat<00:02:28.540> overgrowth<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.530> yeast<00:02:29.590> so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
also helps combat overgrowth of yeast so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.289 
also helps combat overgrowth of yeast so
we're<00:02:31.269> going<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.480> add<00:02:31.629> our<00:02:32.640> probiotic<00:02:33.640> now<00:02:33.879> and

we're going to add our probiotic now and

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.670 
we're going to add our probiotic now and

I really love this so ormos super greens
from<00:02:39.040> some<00:02:39.400> warrior<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> cultured

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
from some warrior and this is a cultured

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.940 
from some warrior and this is a cultured
powdered<00:02:43.260> mixture<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.440> different<00:02:44.560> greens

powdered mixture of different greens

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.670 
powdered mixture of different greens
grown<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:45.910> volcanic<00:02:46.540> soil<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.290> it's<00:02:47.410> really

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
grown in volcanic soil so it's really

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.850 
grown in volcanic soil so it's really
rich<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:48.340> minerals<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:52.140> alfalfa<00:02:53.140> barley

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
rich in minerals so it is alfalfa barley

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.210 
rich in minerals so it is alfalfa barley

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
peppermint and stevia so this will

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.420 
peppermint and stevia so this will
depend<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.569> your<00:03:01.690> taste<00:03:02.140> how<00:03:02.890> much<00:03:03.099> you<00:03:03.280> want

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
really tasty and again you're just

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.050 
really tasty and again you're just
starting<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.560> play<00:04:46.740> around<00:04:46.860> with<00:04:47.190> greens<00:04:47.460> or

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
starting to play around with greens or

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.909 
starting to play around with greens or
or<00:04:48.750> even<00:04:48.990> just<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.260> first<00:04:49.440> time<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.710> do<00:04:49.800> this

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
or even just the first time you do this

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.590 
or even just the first time you do this
recipe<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.430> would<00:04:50.700> probably<00:04:50.880> stay<00:04:51.270> on<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.479> low

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
recipe I would probably stay on the low

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.090 
recipe I would probably stay on the low
side<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.200> super<00:04:52.470> greens<00:04:52.680> because<00:04:52.889> they're

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
side of the super greens because they're

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.600 
side of the super greens because they're
really<00:04:53.340> strong<00:04:53.780> it's<00:04:54.780> really<00:04:54.990> strong<00:04:55.169> flavor

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
really strong it's really strong flavor

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.430 
really strong it's really strong flavor
another<00:04:56.610> idea<00:04:56.850> is<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.389> you<00:04:57.750> can<00:04:57.900> also<00:04:58.080> throw

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
another idea is that you can also throw

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.700 
another idea is that you can also throw
in<00:04:58.470> some<00:04:58.800> fresh<00:04:59.040> mint<00:04:59.370> leaves<00:04:59.490> into<00:05:00.030> this<00:05:00.150> and

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
in some fresh mint leaves into this and

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.340 
in some fresh mint leaves into this and
and<00:05:01.710> have<00:05:01.889> like<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.100> mint<00:05:02.460> flavored<00:05:03.240> drink<00:05:04.139> and

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
and have like a mint flavored drink and

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.690 
and have like a mint flavored drink and
that<00:05:04.530> would<00:05:04.740> also<00:05:04.919> make<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.370> more<00:05:05.490> palatable

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
that would also make it more palatable

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.300 
that would also make it more palatable
and<00:05:06.419> it<00:05:06.870> would<00:05:07.020> have<00:05:07.200> a<00:05:07.500> cooling<00:05:07.860> effect<00:05:07.950> which

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
and it would have a cooling effect which

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.219 
and it would have a cooling effect which
is<00:05:08.490> great<00:05:08.760> in<00:05:08.910> certain<00:05:09.180> cases<00:05:09.360> especially<00:05:09.870> if

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
is great in certain cases especially if

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.590 
is great in certain cases especially if
you're<00:05:10.380> dealing<00:05:10.470> with<00:05:10.680> inflammation<00:05:11.550> or<00:05:12.479> if

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
you're dealing with inflammation or if

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.060 
you're dealing with inflammation or if
you<00:05:12.750> have<00:05:12.900> like<00:05:13.139> if<00:05:13.320> you're<00:05:13.530> really<00:05:13.710> pitta

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070
