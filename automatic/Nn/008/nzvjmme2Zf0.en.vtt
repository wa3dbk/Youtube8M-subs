00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
this show is my kind of private study or

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.079 
this show is my kind of private study or
some<00:00:12.540> question<00:00:13.440> about<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.070> meaning<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.610> our

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
some question about the meaning of our

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.109 
some question about the meaning of our
life<00:00:18.439> this<00:00:19.439> show<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.949> our<00:00:20.430> second<00:00:20.880> exhibition

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
life this show is our second exhibition

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.109 
life this show is our second exhibition
with<00:00:21.570> Lee<00:00:21.720> pool<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.160> completely

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
with Lee pool it's really a completely

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.800 
with Lee pool it's really a completely
new<00:00:24.359> body<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.840> work<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:26.060> haven't<00:00:27.060> seen<00:00:27.359> this

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
new body of work I haven't seen this

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.979 
new body of work I haven't seen this
complexity<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.890> her<00:00:29.519> exhibitions<00:00:30.420> before<00:00:30.929> I

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
complexity in her exhibitions before I

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.479 
complexity in her exhibitions before I
think<00:00:33.989> there's<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> very<00:00:34.620> upfront<00:00:34.890> dialogue

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
think there's a very upfront dialogue

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.000 
think there's a very upfront dialogue
between<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.910> organic<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.960> mechanical<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
between the organic and mechanical of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.250 
between the organic and mechanical of
this<00:00:38.190> work<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.210> human<00:00:39.570> form<00:00:39.899> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
this work the human form and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.780 
this work the human form and
architecture

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
architecture

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.210 
architecture
I'm<00:00:43.690> very<00:00:43.770> interesting<00:00:44.770> about<00:00:44.980> the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
I'm very interesting about the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.400 
I'm very interesting about the
architecture<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:46.600> I<00:00:46.870> can<00:00:47.050> take<00:00:47.200> just

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
architecture because I can take just

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.060 
architecture because I can take just
should<00:00:47.680> think<00:00:48.220> about<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:49.110> ball<00:00:50.110> about<00:00:50.410> human

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
should think about the ball about human

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.290 
should think about the ball about human
and<00:00:51.310> also<00:00:52.210> if<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.900> talk<00:00:53.740> about<00:00:54.070> some<00:00:54.700> kind<00:00:55.150> of

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
and also if I talk about some kind of

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.500 
and also if I talk about some kind of
inner<00:00:55.600> utopian<00:00:56.170> idea<00:00:56.680> it's<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.640> probably

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
inner utopian idea it's a probably

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.100 
inner utopian idea it's a probably
architecture<00:00:59.320> field<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.950> no<00:01:00.460> best<00:01:00.900> example<00:01:01.900> is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
architecture field is no best example is

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.590 
architecture field is no best example is
about<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.890> idea

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
about the idea

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.179 
about the idea
even<00:01:05.600> when<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:05.840> see<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.320> architectural

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
even when you see the architectural

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.420 
even when you see the architectural
works<00:01:07.490> there<00:01:07.939> is<00:01:08.030> always<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:09.219> feeling<00:01:10.219> of

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
works there is always a feeling of

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.510 
works there is always a feeling of
landscape<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.479> idea<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.020> defining

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
landscape and the idea of defining

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.499 
landscape and the idea of defining
spaces<00:01:14.920> she<00:01:15.920> sort<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.220> has<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:16.729> study<00:01:17.210> that

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
spaces she sort of has this study that

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.160 
spaces she sort of has this study that
she's<00:01:17.720> been<00:01:18.189> working<00:01:19.189> on<00:01:19.460> for<00:01:19.490> years<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:21.020> it's

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
she's been working on for years and it's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.569 
she's been working on for years and it's
interesting<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.740> see<00:01:21.890> an<00:01:21.950> exhibition<00:01:22.429> because

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
interesting to see an exhibition because

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.580 
interesting to see an exhibition because
each<00:01:22.939> exhibition<00:01:23.539> is<00:01:23.689> a<00:01:23.720> different<00:01:24.079> facet<00:01:24.259> of

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
each exhibition is a different facet of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.210 
each exhibition is a different facet of
that<00:01:24.770> study<00:01:25.329> really<00:01:26.329> a<00:01:26.360> further<00:01:27.319> continuation

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
that study really a further continuation

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.620 
that study really a further continuation
of<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.369> kind<00:01:28.549> of<00:01:28.610> sculptures<00:01:29.119> she's<00:01:29.450> been

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
of the kind of sculptures she's been

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.340 
of the kind of sculptures she's been
working<00:01:30.319> on<00:01:30.649> however<00:01:31.399> they<00:01:32.179> do<00:01:32.240> have<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:33.110> new

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
working on however they do have a new

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
working on however they do have a new
look

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719 

liebl<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.770> tells<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> story<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.549> her

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
liebl really tells the story with her

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
liebl really tells the story with her
works<00:01:38.939> she<00:01:39.450> begins<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:40.110> two-dimensional

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
works she begins with two-dimensional

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.950 
works she begins with two-dimensional
works<00:01:41.280> drawings<00:01:42.149> of<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.869> eventually

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
works drawings of what will eventually

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.859 
works drawings of what will eventually
become<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.860> larger<00:01:44.430> sculpture<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> next

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
become a larger sculpture then the next

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.580 
become a larger sculpture then the next
step<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> bucket<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.030> drawing<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
step is a bucket of that drawing and the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
step is a bucket of that drawing and the
third<00:01:49.799> step<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.369> these<00:01:50.640> much<00:01:51.090> larger<00:01:51.570> more

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
third step are these much larger more

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.139 
third step are these much larger more
intricate<00:01:52.229> sculptures<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.680> explore<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
intricate sculptures that explore all of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.240 
intricate sculptures that explore all of
the<00:01:54.360> different<00:01:54.659> materials<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.470> wood<00:01:55.500> steel

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the different materials like wood steel

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.130 
the different materials like wood steel
reflective<00:01:57.149> mirrors

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.100 

two-dimensional<00:02:07.140> world<00:02:07.879> can<00:02:08.879> more<00:02:09.690> easily

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
two-dimensional world can more easily

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.400 
two-dimensional world can more easily
bring<00:02:10.890> some<00:02:11.250> emotional<00:02:12.000> effect<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:13.110> three

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
bring some emotional effect but three

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.670 
bring some emotional effect but three
dimension<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> different<00:02:15.110> because<00:02:16.110> there<00:02:16.560> is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
dimension is different because there is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.600 
dimension is different because there is
many<00:02:16.980> step<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.940> production<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.750> can

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
many step for the production I can

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.790 
many step for the production I can
develop<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> neck<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.180> card<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:22.410> will<00:02:22.590> kind

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
develop the neck and card this will kind

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.170 
develop the neck and card this will kind
of<00:02:23.010> beautiful<00:02:23.459> light<00:02:23.880> or<00:02:24.209> something

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.809 

we've<00:02:27.840> been<00:02:28.019> representing<00:02:28.590> label<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.700> was
