00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 May together I wanted to call today 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 do it again and indeed a part to there 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.719
 Somehow my collection is swinging 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 hair black 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.599
 but I wanted it in today and that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.099
 Today, the palettes are my turn 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.960
 actually lipsticks but that was 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.670
 takes a long time and yes 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.109
 by pallets not so much have you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.750
 show you this 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.689
 and yes I'll start now and that 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 I have a range of zuber here 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.390
 and that is the 96er range I 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.669
 now always i was just four 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 palettes have to every little review 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.660
 so to speak, I always mean mine 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 she cost 16 euros or 24 me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 then better get here somewhere was 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690
 yes I will definitely one 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.370
 infobox 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 that is the pallet 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.059
 this is pigmented quite well so me 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.190
 really use them very much 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.109
 So I'm quite ok but I keep aiming 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.399
 think for example that it afterwards 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.050
 really cool color those 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.940
 commented is this is this 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.470
 I really like the women's beautiful out of it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 happy and the black the black 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.930
 use as a one so these are lining up 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.189
 the two go like that but so are 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.810
 really commented and that I go to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.729
 for example totally mart and that's so nice 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.920
 land are you afraid of a finger 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.509
 in the not so here 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.070
 For example, the pink commented on that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.810
 you do not actually see it though 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.939
 now again, as well as the sro 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.700
 to visit the already as a lipstick 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.420
 could use and I have been before 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.220
 short hands 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 So I think the palette is 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.600
 actually quite good for the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.000
 practice of my now 16 euro cost you 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 was in any case for 96er range very much 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.340
 cheap and yes so the green tones use 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.110
 but so often I use this violent one 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 I sometimes and sometimes 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 These pink tones because this is not what 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.869
 in this range that annoys it easy 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.100
 no one knows there are black ones 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.920
 gives millions of purple tones and millions 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.390
 it sounds but it is not a single 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.170
 know that there is such a beige here knows the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.899
 not really know that's me 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.459
 such an ivory which you are pretty 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.980
 but it is such a real dull white 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.310
 the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.030
 both with a palette of rather than that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.900
 million pink or trainer but me 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.640
 find the palette is really great and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.470
 So yes, there is something for everyone 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.670
 You can easily get rival fans 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.590
 so once again came eyeshadow but 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.269
 the range is great find from 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.879
 pigmentation as you can see 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.900
 some really awesome so that is red 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.430
 just awesome 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.849
 that could be smooth as a lipstick 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.260
 convert to the piano plus you say 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.569
 that can be so now must through 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.760
 Sting lip gloss and yes so much to 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.799
 palatina 1 is from cesar franck i you 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.510
 in the infobox 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.040
 then I too have zuewa me 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.840
 the prices do not continue because I 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.010
 the full long employed in full-time 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.540
 I have the sunpower palette here 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.849
 and those are so france has here so 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.440
 rather summer tones very warm tones 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.900
 but I think that's very nice 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.060
 I always liked this example here 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.319
 nice to have these two platforms 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.569
 inspired me very much 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.389
 So these sounds are so I have now completely 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.290
 easy said but you can also 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.069
 Unnormal German So there you see 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.169
 now in force 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.060
 These are two pietsch tones I think 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.959
 the really cool so that she so me 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.290
 I am generally in front of the 40 people 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.030
 people and there I just find everyone 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.769
 great the bond is indeed synonymous with one 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.109
 a bit shorter but I find him and 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.389
 also quite nice so it is not quite max 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.739
 but not quite so that one 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.540
 little bit in it but I think goes 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.630
 sometimes with me spanking his orange 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.120
 Throne and the highlight are for dark 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.230
 skin types so what for now 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.940
 not necessarily for me i could 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.190
 already use as golden bronze but 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.010
 with much glitter but for darker 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.900
 This is a good leader and the skin type 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.150
 it only costs nine euro but i want it 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.019
 Nothing wrong with that 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.299
 I am improving the in the 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.099
 infobox somewhere for that far that is 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.019
 both still uefa at all 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.400
 Millions of palettes and you can too 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.650
 sometimes grabbing so fast for example 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.900
 then there are two palettes or 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.060
 a split 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.949
 then somehow two euros cheaper would have 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.389
 you underestimated and at first there was 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.210
 that in the summer I was long I still 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.919
 to 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.090
 then I once fund a league 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.270
 palette but I already know that 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.949
 if I do not do that there I have to 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.690
 I'll still catch up and have 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:42.240
 I here the sneak palette 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:45.090
 that's the special the 658 or 658 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.979
 the must have a mirror here but 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.539
 I will contact directly and so go the 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.340
 Farmer out of that is one of my 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.220
 Favorite range was that really beautiful 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.289
 Colors are so everyday driving as well 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.130
 so this will rotate but that uses 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:01.440
 always for my part one stroke that 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.850
 marry now and then these two 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.080
 colors lies on my eyes and that 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:11.789
 is really great that are once the 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:14.520
 colors so that's the woman once 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:19.289
 I always use this white here then 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:23.130
 the color is toxic and then the color box 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.849
 or laptop and celebrate and be new 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.340
 I do not speak 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.870
 the and the costs only with the eyes 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.970
 if I'm not mistaken and that's real 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.680
 a great price like palette and me 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.349
 I like it very much I am an absolute 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.370
 fan and came to my last 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:41.970
 palette the purpose i have my baby and has 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.300
 the makeup things and that is that the 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.919
 I've saved it for a long time 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.669
 So I do not really care about that 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:54.690
 Saved because the details but I love 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.400
 the pharma are new shades of brown and am 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.810
 Most of the time I have been meaningful and 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.900
 used these woods are these two 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.210
 most natural colors and brushes and 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:10.349
 which I find really cool 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:12.180
 tostedt and back so the three and the 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.650
 Here's my darling and this one 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.340
 I found that really cool too 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.260
 I used once or something like that 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.650
 is such a metallic that has me 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.599
 a little bit then works the metallic what 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.370
 but totally cool but it looks 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.310
 not so metallic but then 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.770
 rather warmer and I find that really cool 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:36.530
 and drove that is wrong 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.990
 that is so with black with so-called 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.760
 what I grab fully and yes but me 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:48.050
 also use too dark 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:49.730
 this range has 30 or 46 euros 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.470
 even somehow I have about beauty 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.200
 bay dot com may order the shipment 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.760
 not for free and although there is one 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.230
 week until it arrives but it has become 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.360
 really worth it to wait 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.580
 i use them quite often and the farm 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.850
 actually use themselves 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:10.030
 very little off that is not good and yes that 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:14.660
 the colors are virgin in nature 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:17.330
 time card hard facebook posting you 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.560
 drove and even meter I was thinking about 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.420
 if I order the two but 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.980
 I'm going to leave first and she will leave me 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.700
 then maybe follow suit or the two 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.280
 buy more 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.340
 But that's really the best range 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.540
 I've ever had that and it was like that 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.400
 next if then the lipstick 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.630
 Come on, I hope you have this video 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.130
 I wish you one more 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.280
 wonderful day we see you my 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.280
 line
