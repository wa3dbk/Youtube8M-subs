disadvantages of using white ones is you
can<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.410> it<00:00:28.410> sort<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.830> rubs<00:00:29.099> off<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.810> if

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
can get this it sort of rubs off and if

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.590 
can get this it sort of rubs off and if
you<00:00:31.019> keep<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:31.859> hot<00:00:32.130> conditions

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
you keep it in really hot conditions

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.389 
you keep it in really hot conditions
this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.899> happens<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.800> happened<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> me

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
this is what happens this happened to me

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.380 
this is what happens this happened to me
I<00:00:35.610> left<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.719> window<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.120> when<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> came

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I left it in my window and when I came

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.090 
I left it in my window and when I came
back<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:39.989> sticky<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.590> sup<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> rub

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
back it was all sticky here sup to rub

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.150 
back it was all sticky here sup to rub
it<00:00:41.250> off<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.600> black<00:00:43.230> ones<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.680> wouldn't<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:43.980> much

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it off so black ones it wouldn't be much

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.869 
it off so black ones it wouldn't be much
noticeable<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.120> white<00:00:45.960> ones<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.879> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
noticeable but white ones you can the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.680 
noticeable but white ones you can the
plastic<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.700> really<00:00:50.700> cheap<00:00:51.180> style

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
plastic they use is really cheap style

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.490 
plastic they use is really cheap style
it's<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.670> reliable<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
it's not that reliable I think but it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.420 
it's not that reliable I think but it
does<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> job<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.969> extendable<00:00:58.190> on<00:00:59.190> both

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
does the job it's not extendable on both

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.840 
does the job it's not extendable on both
sides<00:01:00.469> so<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> fit<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.280> large

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
sides so you can you fit really large

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.800 
sides so you can you fit really large
heads<00:01:04.010> um<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:06.750> uses<00:01:07.049> two<00:01:07.710> cords<00:01:08.270> like<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.540> I'd

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
heads um it uses two cords like that I'd

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.530 
heads um it uses two cords like that I'd
prefer<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.950> one<00:01:11.220> cord<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.330> much<00:01:12.510> more

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
prefer just one cord so it's much more

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.260 
prefer just one cord so it's much more
easier<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:15.060> leads<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.259> wire<00:01:17.270> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
easier so it leads to just one wire the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.719 
easier so it leads to just one wire the
gold-plated<00:01:20.030> jack<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:22.130> better<00:01:23.130> noise

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
gold-plated jack for better noise

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.090 
gold-plated jack for better noise
transfer<00:01:25.580> it<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.909> around<00:01:27.180> three<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> half

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
transfer it is around three and a half

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.870 
transfer it is around three and a half
foot<00:01:29.100> long<00:01:29.850> wire<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.840> reasonably<00:01:31.350> long<00:01:31.880> it's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
foot long wire it's reasonably long it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.090 
foot long wire it's reasonably long it's
good<00:01:33.060> also<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.020> headphones<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.740> flip

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
good also these headphones can flip

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.179 
good also these headphones can flip
around<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:37.340> easily<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> fold<00:01:39.799> like<00:01:40.799> so

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
around like that easily and fold like so

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.780 
around like that easily and fold like so
i<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.390> demonstrate<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.790> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
i can just demonstrate it to you you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.890 
i can just demonstrate it to you you
cannot<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
cannot do this

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:55.270 
cannot do this
and<00:01:47.900> it<00:01:48.140> goes<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:48.650> at<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:52.640> can<00:01:54.280> fold

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and it goes in at that or you can fold

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.750 
and it goes in at that or you can fold
it<00:01:55.490> in<00:01:58.090> both<00:01:59.090> ways<00:01:59.360> like<00:01:59.690> that<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:01.130> push<00:02:01.580> them

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
it in both ways like that just push them

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.010 
it in both ways like that just push them
against<00:02:02.210> each<00:02:02.330> other<00:02:02.630> like<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.700> or<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.210> find

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
against each other like that or I find

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.490 
against each other like that or I find
the<00:02:06.140> best<00:02:06.350> way<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.650> do<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.929> take<00:02:08.929> both<00:02:09.170> sides

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
the best way to do it is take both sides

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.730 
the best way to do it is take both sides
like<00:02:10.070> that<00:02:10.100> down<00:02:10.930> push<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:12.620> that

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
like that down push this one like that

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.580 
like that down push this one like that
bring<00:02:15.740> it<00:02:15.860> over<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.370> top<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.320> then<00:02:18.320> just

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
bring it over to the top and then just

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:30.670 
bring it over to the top and then just
fold<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.840> hard<00:02:30.110> doing<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.560> with

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
fold it like so it's hard doing it with

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.360 
fold it like so it's hard doing it with
one<00:02:30.890> hand<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.370> yeah<00:02:32.330> that's<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.310> find<00:02:34.310> that

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
one hand but yeah that's it I find that

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.840 
one hand but yeah that's it I find that
the<00:02:34.640> best<00:02:34.850> way<00:02:35.470> they<00:02:36.470> are<00:02:36.530> really<00:02:37.370> loud<00:02:37.550> and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
the best way they are really loud and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.030 
the best way they are really loud and
really<00:02:38.330> comfortable<00:02:38.810> discover<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.440> air<00:02:39.680> very

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
really comfortable discover the air very

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.820 
really comfortable discover the air very
nicely<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.700> securely<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:43.450> sort<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.830> rough

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
nicely and securely it's sort of rough

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.640 
nicely and securely it's sort of rough
fabric<00:02:46.370> inside<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.780> gives<00:02:48.019> really<00:02:48.290> really

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
fabric inside and gives really really

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.240
