00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.620 

while<00:00:03.070> working<00:00:03.250> on<00:00:03.429> my<00:00:03.490> sofa<00:00:03.909> table<00:00:04.270> I<00:00:04.390> keep

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.630 
while working on my sofa table I keep

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.420 
while working on my sofa table I keep
realizing<00:00:05.350> the<00:00:05.440> different<00:00:05.770> aspects<00:00:06.130> of<00:00:06.250> its

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
realizing the different aspects of its

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.759 
realizing the different aspects of its
construction<00:00:07.000> would<00:00:07.570> be<00:00:07.750> valuable<00:00:08.260> material

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:08.769 
construction would be valuable material

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.710 
construction would be valuable material
and<00:00:08.920> putting<00:00:09.070> together<00:00:09.250> a<00:00:09.490> video<00:00:09.790> I<00:00:10.090> wanted<00:00:10.600> to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:10.720 
and putting together a video I wanted to

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.480 
and putting together a video I wanted to
discuss<00:00:11.080> real<00:00:11.320> quick<00:00:11.559> how<00:00:11.769> I<00:00:11.800> attached<00:00:12.250> the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
discuss real quick how I attached the

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.960 
discuss real quick how I attached the
tabletops<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.330> the<00:00:13.450> basis<00:00:14.220> what<00:00:15.220> I<00:00:15.250> do<00:00:15.400> is<00:00:15.940> just

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
tabletops to the basis what I do is just

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.540 
tabletops to the basis what I do is just
using<00:00:16.599> a<00:00:16.869> router<00:00:17.109> I<00:00:17.260> use<00:00:17.529> it<00:00:17.710> mounted<00:00:18.070> into<00:00:18.220> its

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
using a router I use it mounted into its

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.540 
using a router I use it mounted into its
fixed<00:00:18.880> base<00:00:19.119> around<00:00:19.930> a<00:00:20.110> small<00:00:20.470> groove<00:00:21.010> every

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
fixed base around a small groove every

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.550 
fixed base around a small groove every
so<00:00:21.760> often<00:00:22.000> around<00:00:22.390> the<00:00:22.539> inside<00:00:22.930> of<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.140> apron

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
so often around the inside of the apron

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.040 
so often around the inside of the apron
and<00:00:23.770> then<00:00:24.130> use<00:00:24.580> what<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:24.910> call<00:00:25.000> table<00:00:25.570> buttons<00:00:25.900> I

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
and then use what I call table buttons I

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.540 
and then use what I call table buttons I
believe<00:00:26.380> that<00:00:26.619> might<00:00:26.859> even<00:00:27.010> be<00:00:27.130> what<00:00:27.400> they're

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
believe that might even be what they're

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.019 
believe that might even be what they're
called<00:00:27.820> in<00:00:28.060> general<00:00:28.960> but<00:00:29.529> what<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:30.430> does<00:00:30.490> is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
called in general but what this does is

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.000 
called in general but what this does is
it<00:00:31.330> goes<00:00:31.539> into<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:32.259> groove<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:32.829> then<00:00:32.920> a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
it goes into that groove and then a

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.920 
it goes into that groove and then a
screw<00:00:33.340> is<00:00:33.550> put<00:00:33.760> up<00:00:33.850> through<00:00:34.090> that<00:00:34.120> into<00:00:34.780> the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
screw is put up through that into the

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.380 
screw is put up through that into the
bottom<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.440> your<00:00:35.800> tabletop<00:00:36.160> what<00:00:36.910> that<00:00:37.059> allows

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
bottom of your tabletop what that allows

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.420 
bottom of your tabletop what that allows
is<00:00:37.780> expansion<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.559> contraction<00:00:38.739> in<00:00:39.370> the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
is expansion and contraction in the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.590 
is expansion and contraction in the
tabletop<00:00:40.390> without<00:00:40.780> causing<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.380> to<00:00:41.530> Cup<00:00:41.770> or

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
tabletop without causing it to Cup or

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000 
tabletop without causing it to Cup or
bow<00:00:43.600> in<00:00:43.809> any<00:00:43.960> direction<00:00:44.200> so<00:00:44.680> let's<00:00:44.860> take<00:00:44.980> a

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
bow in any direction so let's take a

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.729 
bow in any direction so let's take a
closer<00:00:45.309> look<00:00:45.460> at<00:00:45.820> some<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:46.030> those<00:00:46.180> details

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
closer look at some of those details

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.500 
closer look at some of those details
once<00:00:47.739> again<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.309> achieve<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.790> groove<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:49.210> use<00:00:49.480> a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
once again to achieve the groove I use a

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.540 
once again to achieve the groove I use a
router<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.350> mine<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.710> mounted<00:00:51.040> in<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.219> fixed

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550

router and mine is mounted in a fixed
base<00:00:51.790> and<00:00:52.120> using<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.340> rabbeting<00:00:54.340> bit<00:00:54.370> this<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:54.850> a

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
base and using a rabbeting bit this is a

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.819 
base and using a rabbeting bit this is a
3/8<00:00:55.329> inch<00:00:55.360> rabbeting<00:00:56.079> bit<00:00:56.110> which<00:00:56.440> has<00:00:56.469> the

hardwood this one's a piece of maple and

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.120 
hardwood this one's a piece of maple and
I<00:01:06.759> cut<00:01:07.029> this<00:01:07.299> groove<00:01:07.810> out<00:01:08.049> that<00:01:08.289> rabbit<00:01:08.709> out<00:01:08.799> on

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
I cut this groove out that rabbit out on

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.459 
I cut this groove out that rabbit out on
the<00:01:09.579> table<00:01:09.880> saw<00:01:10.029> using<00:01:10.329> a<00:01:10.630> dado<00:01:10.899> blade<00:01:11.259> you

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
the table saw using a dado blade you

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.830 
the table saw using a dado blade you
could<00:01:11.649> also<00:01:11.859> do<00:01:12.279> this<00:01:12.459> without<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> dado<00:01:13.539> blade

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
could also do this without a dado blade

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.870 
could also do this without a dado blade
on<00:01:13.959> the<00:01:14.049> table<00:01:14.350> saw<00:01:14.499> or<00:01:14.770> do<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.069> on<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.219> bandsaw

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
on the table saw or do it on a bandsaw

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.730 
on the table saw or do it on a bandsaw
another<00:01:16.659> thing<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:16.959> do<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.409> drill<00:01:17.649> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
another thing I do is drill a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.279 
another thing I do is drill a
countersink<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.939> pilot<00:01:19.389> hole<00:01:19.539> to<00:01:20.170> where

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
countersink and a pilot hole to where

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.719 
countersink and a pilot hole to where
this<00:01:20.469> doesn't<00:01:20.740> split<00:01:21.099> a<00:01:21.130> hard<00:01:21.399> wood<00:01:21.579> will

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
this doesn't split a hard wood will

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.910 
this doesn't split a hard wood will
split<00:01:22.090> very<00:01:22.749> easily<00:01:22.990> just<00:01:23.259> like<00:01:23.529> when<00:01:23.799> you're

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
split very easily just like when you're

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.039 
split very easily just like when you're
splitting<00:01:24.099> firewood<00:01:24.399> if<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:25.060> do<00:01:25.209> not<00:01:25.420> allow

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
you need to put your table button then

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.379 
you need to put your table button then
that<00:01:38.679> table<00:01:39.039> button<00:01:39.219> once<00:01:39.520> again<00:01:39.669> has<00:01:40.359> a
