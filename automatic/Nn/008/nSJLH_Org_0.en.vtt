00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
so so stoked with that look at some

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.700 
so so stoked with that look at some
packaging<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.900> these<00:03:45.050> ones<00:03:45.260> here<00:03:45.470> they're

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
packaging of these ones here they're

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.330 
packaging of these ones here they're
romantic<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.180> quite<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.780> bigger<00:03:48.350> kind<00:03:49.220> of

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
romantic so it is quite a bigger kind of

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.510 
romantic so it is quite a bigger kind of
box<00:03:49.850> if<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.300> guys<00:03:50.450> can<00:03:50.810> see

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
box if you guys can see

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.690 
box if you guys can see
so<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.930> guess<00:03:54.260> it's<00:03:54.440> designed<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:55.070> be<00:03:55.370> and

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
so I guess it's designed to be and

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.330 
so I guess it's designed to be and
stores<00:03:56.270> or<00:03:56.660> sort<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.500> catch<00:03:57.710> the<00:03:57.890> eye<00:03:57.920> of<00:03:58.160> the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
stores or sort of catch the eye of the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.460 
stores or sort of catch the eye of the
consumer<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.330> does<00:03:59.570> have<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.960> little<00:04:00.020> butt

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
consumer it does have that little butt
