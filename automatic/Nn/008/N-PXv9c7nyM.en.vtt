abilities at one time let's also not

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
abilities at one time let's also not
forget<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.140> final<00:01:37.590> smashes<00:01:37.860> seem<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> be

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
forget that final smashes seem to be

took the brawl engine from the wii and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.039 
took the brawl engine from the wii and
poured<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> wii<00:02:00.149> u<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.659> course

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.020 
poured it over to the wii u of course
with<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> enhanced<00:02:01.829> power<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> wii<00:02:02.549> u<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
with the enhanced power of the wii u the
game<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.509> looks<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.380> better<00:02:04.560> but

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
game just looks a little bit better but

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.859 
game just looks a little bit better but
let<00:02:05.310> me<00:02:05.399> not<00:02:05.549> stress<00:02:05.850> enough<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.540> looks

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
let me not stress enough that this looks
pretty<00:02:07.140> much<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.350> brawl<00:02:07.860> 2<00:02:08.190> point<00:02:08.489> 0<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.819> lot

know that yellow are that appears around
your<00:02:25.709> character<00:02:26.130> that's<00:02:26.610> also<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> same<00:02:27.330> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
your character that's also the same and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.270 
your character that's also the same and
also<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.959> even<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.709> terms<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
also to even like in terms of the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.340 
also to even like in terms of the
gravity<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> physics<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> game<00:02:31.110> it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
gravity and the physics in the game it

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.229 
gravity and the physics in the game it
seems<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.340> game<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.790> taking<00:02:32.970> that

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
seems like this game is taking that

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.090 
seems like this game is taking that
slower<00:02:33.630> approach<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.380> was<00:02:34.530> featured<00:02:34.980> in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
slower approach that was featured in

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.790 
slower approach that was featured in
brawl<00:02:35.459> rather<00:02:36.150> than<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.540> faster<00:02:37.080> action<00:02:37.350> pays

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
brawl rather than the faster action pays

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.280 
brawl rather than the faster action pays
gameplay<00:02:38.400> from<00:02:38.459> meili<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.720> seems<00:02:40.080> like

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
gameplay from meili so it seems like

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.870 
gameplay from meili so it seems like
Nintendo<00:02:40.800> isn't<00:02:41.160> taking<00:02:41.489> too<00:02:41.640> many<00:02:41.760> chances

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
Nintendo isn't taking too many chances

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
Nintendo isn't taking too many chances
with<00:02:42.569> this<00:02:42.720> game<00:02:42.930> rather<00:02:43.260> they're<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.069> to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
with this game rather they're going to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040 
with this game rather they're going to
stick<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.670> tried<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.060> true<00:02:45.600> from<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.840 
past now with the 3ds this version looks
even<00:02:49.319> more<00:02:49.350> cartoony<00:02:50.160> than<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.459> wii<00:02:50.670> u

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
even more cartoony than the wii u

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.850 
even more cartoony than the wii u
version<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.200> noticed<00:02:52.500> by<00:02:52.590> that

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
could be a fire emblem map who knows

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.620 
could be a fire emblem map who knows
this<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.920> sure<00:03:56.069> looks<00:03:56.340> like<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.700> new<00:03:56.910> Mario<00:03:57.390> map

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
funny that the characters on the left

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.870 
funny that the characters on the left
hand<00:04:01.350> corner<00:04:01.560> are<00:04:01.890> crouching<00:04:02.430> maybe<00:04:02.609> hiding

so on and so forth but finally the map
that<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.069> think<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.400> most<00:04:08.579> interesting<00:04:08.790> is<00:04:09.329> this

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
that I think is most interesting is this

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.020
