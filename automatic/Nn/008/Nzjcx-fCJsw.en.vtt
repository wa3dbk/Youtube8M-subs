00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
together is it okay to have one bar if

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
together is it okay to have one bar if
it<00:01:17.880> works<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.439> else<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.979> there

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it works and if so where else is there

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.539

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
top of it in this piece I'm gonna touch

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
top of it in this piece I'm gonna touch
up<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.149> bit<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> DEA<00:01:51.930> combo<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
up a little bit on the DEA combo and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.050 
up a little bit on the DEA combo and
flow<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:53.430> gonna<00:01:53.549> touch<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
flow I'm gonna touch up on the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.080 
flow I'm gonna touch up on the
highlights<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.659> also<00:01:55.619> 3d<00:01:56.100> also<00:01:56.670> an<00:01:56.790> advanced

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
highlights and also 3d also an advanced

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.760 
highlights and also 3d also an advanced
technique<00:01:57.540> which<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.020> planning<00:01:58.619> your

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
technique which is planning your

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.679 
technique which is planning your
interior<00:01:59.159> detail<00:01:59.700> along<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.479> 3d

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
interior detail along with your 3d

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
interior detail along with your 3d
alright<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> DEA<00:02:01.649> combo<00:02:02.340> does<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.909> flow

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
alright so the DEA combo does it flow

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.810 
alright so the DEA combo does it flow
the<00:02:03.360> answer<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.049> yes<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.860> flows<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.520> reason

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the answer is yes it flows the reason

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.700 
the answer is yes it flows the reason
being<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.140> laying

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
being is because you have the a laying

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.499 
being is because you have the a laying
on<00:02:07.920> top<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> D<00:02:08.700> which<00:02:08.970> I'm<00:02:09.090> drawing<00:02:09.360> in

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
on top of the D which I'm drawing in

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690 
on top of the D which I'm drawing in
right<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.560> AE<00:02:10.739> lays<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.280> top<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
right now and the AE lays on top of the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.350 
right now and the AE lays on top of the
D<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
D on a you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.260 
D on a you
form<00:02:12.750> line<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.560> they<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.220> connect<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:14.970> that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
form line and they also connect on that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.600 
form line and they also connect on that
uniform<00:02:15.510> line<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.290> increases<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.160> flow<00:02:17.400> now

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
uniform line this increases the flow now

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.190 
uniform line this increases the flow now
about<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.060> vertical<00:02:18.420> box<00:02:18.630> when<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> say<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
about that vertical box when you say the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.840 
about that vertical box when you say the
vertical<00:02:19.350> box<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.010> assume<00:02:20.640> you're

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
vertical box to the a I assume you're

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.490 
vertical box to the a I assume you're
talking<00:02:20.880> about<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> only

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
talking about this one as it's the only

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.950 
talking about this one as it's the only
vertical<00:02:22.830> box<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.670> yes<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.660> flows

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
vertical box of the a and yes that flows

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.690 
vertical box of the a and yes that flows
-<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.440> flows<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> different<00:02:26.280> reason<00:02:26.460> now

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
- it flows for a different reason now

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.190 
- it flows for a different reason now
this<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.330> advanced<00:02:27.720> form<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.050> flow

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
this is a more advanced form of flow

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.170 
this is a more advanced form of flow
where<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.620> flow<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.280> momentum<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:30.060> that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
where it's flow of momentum and that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.510 
where it's flow of momentum and that
would<00:02:30.300> be<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> flow<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.380> line<00:02:31.710> in<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.130> certain

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
would be the flow of a line in a certain

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.100 
would be the flow of a line in a certain
direction<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.390> flow<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.930> energy

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
direction it's the flow of energy

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470 
direction it's the flow of energy
throughout<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.800> line<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.490> put<00:02:35.790> quotations

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
throughout a line and I put quotations

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.090 
throughout a line and I put quotations
on<00:02:36.660> energy<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:37.440> there's<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:38.010> not

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
on energy because there's actually not

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.060 
on energy because there's actually not
energy<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.640> line<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.870> line<00:02:40.590> flows

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
energy in that line but this line flows

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.949 
energy in that line but this line flows
very<00:02:41.340> well<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.880> goes<00:02:42.000> from<00:02:42.300> straight<00:02:42.720> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
very well it goes from straight to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.199 
very well it goes from straight to
gradually<00:02:43.620> becoming<00:02:43.920> curved<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.580> goes<00:02:44.880> into<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
gradually becoming curved it goes into a

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.990 
gradually becoming curved it goes into a
curved<00:02:45.540> line<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:46.140> flows<00:02:46.770> with<00:02:47.340> other<00:02:47.580> lines

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
curved line that flows with other lines

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.390 
curved line that flows with other lines
so<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.540> line<00:02:48.870> as<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> whole<00:02:49.440> flows<00:02:49.980> that's<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
so that line as a whole flows that's a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.400 
so that line as a whole flows that's a
very<00:02:50.700> advanced<00:02:51.239> way<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.480> flow<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.080> lot<00:02:52.290> of

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
very advanced way to flow and a lot of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.870 
very advanced way to flow and a lot of
people<00:02:52.650> do<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.890> without<00:02:53.010> even<00:02:53.370> realizing

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
people do it without even realizing

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.430 
people do it without even realizing
they're<00:02:54.000> doing<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.690> consciously

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
they're doing it but if you consciously

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.870 
they're doing it but if you consciously
do<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.250> know<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.760> you're

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
do that and you know what it is you're

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.729 
do that and you know what it is you're
doing<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.600> very<00:02:57.989> effective<00:02:58.350> way<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
doing that is a very effective way to

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.790 
doing that is a very effective way to
flow<00:02:59.160> also<00:02:59.489> this<00:03:00.150> whole<00:03:00.630> line<00:03:00.900> flows<00:03:01.380> into<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
flow also this whole line flows into the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.040 
flow also this whole line flows into the
arm<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.610> line<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.090> similar<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.900> this

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
arm and this line is similar to this

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.620 
arm and this line is similar to this
part<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.470> arm<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.610> line<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.239> similar

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
part of the arm and this line is similar

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.110 
part of the arm and this line is similar
to<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.840> part<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.200> O<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.220> part<00:03:08.670> flows

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
to this part of the O so that part flows

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.580 
to this part of the O so that part flows
you<00:03:09.300> don't<00:03:09.420> have<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.600> worry<00:03:09.780> about<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.230> next

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
you don't have to worry about that next

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.229 
you don't have to worry about that next
thing<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.860> want<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.070> talk<00:03:11.250> about<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.730> your

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
thing I want to talk about is your

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.420 
thing I want to talk about is your
highlights<00:03:12.750> right<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.590> your<00:03:13.920> light

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
highlights right now you have your light

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.100 
highlights right now you have your light
source<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> right<00:03:15.239> hand<00:03:15.510> side<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.959> whole

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
source on the right hand side the whole

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.570 
source on the right hand side the whole
purpose<00:03:16.320> behind<00:03:16.530> highlights<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.459> add

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
purpose behind highlights is to add

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.000 
purpose behind highlights is to add
depth<00:03:18.060> highlights<00:03:18.720> add<00:03:18.959> depth<00:03:19.620> through

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
depth highlights add depth through

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.370 
depth highlights add depth through
highlights<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.910> shadows<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.989> since<00:03:22.260> you

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
highlights and shadows and since you

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.550 
highlights and shadows and since you
have<00:03:22.560> 3d<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.489> your<00:03:23.670> pay<00:03:23.850> switch<00:03:24.239> 3d<00:03:24.900> also<00:03:25.170> adds

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
have 3d on your pay switch 3d also adds

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.830 
have 3d on your pay switch 3d also adds
depth<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.160> highlights<00:03:26.700> would<00:03:27.000> interact<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.780> a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
depth the highlights would interact in a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.350 
depth the highlights would interact in a
realistic<00:03:28.440> way<00:03:28.650> with<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.370> 3d<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
realistic way with the 3d and the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.550 
realistic way with the 3d and the
letters<00:03:30.630> therefore<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.260> your<00:03:31.380> light

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
letters therefore you have your light

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.050 
letters therefore you have your light
source<00:03:31.739> on<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.010> right<00:03:32.130> hand<00:03:32.370> side<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:32.790> light

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
source on the right hand side this light

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.820 
source on the right hand side this light
source<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.600> not<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:33.989> drop<00:03:34.320> shadow<00:03:34.350> this

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
source is not like drop shadow this

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.690 
source is not like drop shadow this
light<00:03:35.070> source<00:03:35.250> would<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.549> a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
light source would be a

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.699 
light source would be a
three-dimensional<00:03:36.330> light<00:03:37.080> source<00:03:37.350> therefore

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
three-dimensional light source therefore

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.560 
three-dimensional light source therefore
casting<00:03:38.310> three-dimensional<00:03:39.060> shadows<00:03:39.390> and

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
casting three-dimensional shadows and

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.340 
casting three-dimensional shadows and
highlights

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
highlights

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.440 
highlights
unlike<00:03:40.950> drop<00:03:41.400> shot<00:03:41.670> which<00:03:41.850> casts<00:03:42.299> a

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
unlike drop shot which casts a

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.229 
unlike drop shot which casts a
two-dimensional<00:03:42.480> shadow<00:03:43.260> now<00:03:43.590> with<00:03:43.799> this

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
two-dimensional shadow now with this

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.370 
two-dimensional shadow now with this
three-dimensional<00:03:45.239> light<00:03:45.450> source<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.230> would

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
three-dimensional light source it would

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.009 
three-dimensional light source it would
cast<00:03:46.680> light<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.190> these<00:03:47.730> directions<00:03:48.209> this

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
cast light in these directions this

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.380 
cast light in these directions this
would<00:03:49.260> cause<00:03:49.500> all<00:03:49.830> highlights<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
would cause all highlights to be on the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.750 
would cause all highlights to be on the
right<00:03:51.750> hand<00:03:52.110> side<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.709> everything<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.670> you

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
right hand side of everything that you

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.220 
right hand side of everything that you
want<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.970> put<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> highlight<00:03:54.420> on<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.720> shadows

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
want to put a highlight on and shadows

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.110 
want to put a highlight on and shadows
if<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.590> choose<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.920> put<00:03:56.100> shadows<00:03:56.459> on<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.640> left

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
if you choose to put shadows on the left

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.729 
if you choose to put shadows on the left
hand<00:03:57.360> side<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.810> everything<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.410> choose<00:03:58.620> to

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
hand side of everything you choose to

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.009 
hand side of everything you choose to
put<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.070> this<00:03:59.400> also<00:03:59.670> means<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.480> type

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
put it on this also means that this type

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.020 
put it on this also means that this type
of<00:04:01.049> highlight<00:04:01.500> would<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.920> exist<00:04:02.190> because<00:04:02.820> you

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
of highlight would not exist because you

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.759 
of highlight would not exist because you
have<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.870> little<00:04:03.989> highlight<00:04:05.060> spritz<00:04:06.060> of

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
have the little highlight spritz of

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.500 
have the little highlight spritz of
highlights<00:04:07.769> going<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.459> these<00:04:08.670> directions<00:04:08.880> it

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
highlights going in these directions it

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.660 
highlights going in these directions it
would<00:04:09.720> suggest<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.980> light<00:04:11.160> source<00:04:11.190> is

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
would suggest that the light source is

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.120 
would suggest that the light source is
right<00:04:12.269> here<00:04:12.930> casting<00:04:13.380> light<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.769> these

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
right here casting light in these

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.580 
right here casting light in these
directions<00:04:14.790> when<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.329> is<00:04:15.450> not<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.900> case<00:04:16.109> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
directions when that is not the case the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.229 
directions when that is not the case the
light<00:04:16.769> source<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.250> up<00:04:17.549> here

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
light source is up here

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.270 
light source is up here
so<00:04:18.390> these<00:04:18.930> highlights<00:04:19.620> would<00:04:19.890> be<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.130> ones

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
so these highlights would be the ones

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.760

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
them off the same way you did like you

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.090 
them off the same way you did like you
didn't<00:05:19.720> draw<00:05:19.960> this<00:05:20.110> line<00:05:20.350> going<00:05:20.620> all<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.070> way

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
didn't draw this line going all the way

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.100 
didn't draw this line going all the way
over<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.729> cut<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.060> off<00:05:22.180> right<00:05:22.330> over<00:05:22.479> here<00:05:22.840> and

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
over you cut it off right over here and

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.570 
over you cut it off right over here and
that's<00:05:23.229> fine<00:05:23.560> it's<00:05:23.740> that's<00:05:24.010> actually<00:05:24.340> better

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
that's fine it's that's actually better

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.730 
that's fine it's that's actually better
so<00:05:24.940> if<00:05:25.030> you're<00:05:25.180> learning<00:05:25.600> vanishing<00:05:26.200> point<00:05:26.410> 3d

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
so if you're learning vanishing point 3d

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.040 
so if you're learning vanishing point 3d
research<00:05:27.310> one-point<00:05:28.120> perspective<00:05:28.180> now

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
research one-point perspective now

we<00:05:49.960> noticed<00:05:50.229> your<00:05:50.320> highlights<00:05:50.590> are<00:05:50.680> all<00:05:50.860> on

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
we noticed your highlights are all on

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.409 
we noticed your highlights are all on
the<00:05:51.160> wrong<00:05:51.280> side<00:05:51.580> they're<00:05:51.820> all<00:05:51.940> on<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.210> left

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
the wrong side they're all on the left

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.700 
the wrong side they're all on the left
when<00:05:52.570> they<00:05:52.630> should<00:05:52.810> be<00:05:52.840> on<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.140> right<00:05:53.320> this

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
when they should be on the right this

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.980 
when they should be on the right this
crack<00:05:54.130> could<00:05:54.610> be<00:05:54.789> located<00:05:55.330> in<00:05:55.450> a<00:05:55.539> better<00:05:55.750> area

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
crack could be located in a better area

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.900 
crack could be located in a better area
though<00:05:56.350> instead<00:05:56.889> of<00:05:57.039> putting<00:05:57.250> it<00:05:57.400> on<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.669> left

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
though instead of putting it on the left

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.480 
though instead of putting it on the left
side<00:05:58.030> you<00:05:58.750> can<00:05:58.780> go<00:05:59.080> ahead<00:05:59.200> and<00:05:59.560> put<00:06:00.070> it<00:06:00.190> on<00:06:00.340> the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
side you can go ahead and put it on the

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.100 
side you can go ahead and put it on the
right<00:06:00.669> side<00:06:01.000> now<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.389> see<00:06:01.570> I've<00:06:01.690> added<00:06:01.870> this

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
right side now you see I've added this

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.020 
right side now you see I've added this
crack<00:06:02.410> I<00:06:02.560> have<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.919> highlights<00:06:03.310> on<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:03.820> crack

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
crack I have the highlights on the crack

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.580 
crack I have the highlights on the crack
and<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.300> add<00:06:04.419> a<00:06:04.450> little<00:06:04.660> bit<00:06:04.810> of<00:06:05.020> red<00:06:05.410> to

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
and I add a little bit of red to

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.020 
and I add a little bit of red to
indicate<00:06:05.830> shadow<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.639> this<00:06:06.729> allows<00:06:07.000> for

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
indicate shadow and this allows for

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.490 
indicate shadow and this allows for
multiple<00:06:07.330> elements<00:06:07.930> in<00:06:08.080> order<00:06:08.200> to<00:06:08.350> work

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
multiple elements in order to work

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.140 
multiple elements in order to work
together<00:06:08.710> making<00:06:09.280> the<00:06:09.520> piece<00:06:09.700> look<00:06:09.910> more

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
together making the piece look more

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.090 
together making the piece look more
detailed<00:06:10.630> than<00:06:10.870> what<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.139> really<00:06:11.169> is<00:06:11.470> I<00:06:11.860> have

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
detailed than what it really is I have

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.920 
detailed than what it really is I have
the<00:06:12.340> crack<00:06:12.580> on<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:12.850> right<00:06:13.030> hand<00:06:13.270> side<00:06:13.389> so<00:06:13.810> like

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
the crack on the right hand side so like

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.690 
the crack on the right hand side so like
that<00:06:14.020> I<00:06:14.050> can<00:06:14.200> put<00:06:14.380> highlights<00:06:14.860> on<00:06:15.039> that<00:06:15.370> crack

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
that I can put highlights on that crack

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.550 
that I can put highlights on that crack
along<00:06:16.150> with<00:06:16.330> this<00:06:16.479> when<00:06:16.900> I<00:06:16.930> outline<00:06:17.260> my<00:06:17.289> letter

which I'm doing in red I have to come in

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.090 
which I'm doing in red I have to come in
word<00:06:19.600> for<00:06:20.229> the<00:06:20.320> circular<00:06:20.770> shape<00:06:20.950> I'm

little divot in my outline that divot

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.270 
little divot in my outline that divot
now<00:06:27.660> effectively<00:06:28.660> changes<00:06:29.020> my<00:06:29.169> 3d<00:06:29.620> because

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
now effectively changes my 3d because

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.340 
now effectively changes my 3d because
now<00:06:30.430> when<00:06:30.580> I<00:06:30.639> do<00:06:30.700> 3d<00:06:31.240> I'll<00:06:31.450> have<00:06:31.780> a<00:06:31.990> line<00:06:32.320> here

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
now when I do 3d I'll have a line here

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.680 
now when I do 3d I'll have a line here
to<00:06:32.770> indicate<00:06:33.039> that<00:06:33.250> divot<00:06:33.700> and<00:06:33.820> this<00:06:34.360> part<00:06:34.630> of

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
to indicate that divot and this part of

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.170 
to indicate that divot and this part of
the<00:06:34.780> 3d<00:06:35.140> will<00:06:35.380> go<00:06:35.560> inward<00:06:36.039> on<00:06:36.280> top<00:06:36.760> of<00:06:36.909> that

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
the 3d will go inward on top of that

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.110 
the 3d will go inward on top of that
your<00:06:37.539> barrier<00:06:38.020> which<00:06:38.260> is<00:06:38.289> in<00:06:38.530> blue

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
your barrier which is in blue

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.879 
your barrier which is in blue
here<00:06:39.300> which<00:06:39.540> I'm<00:06:39.690> indicating<00:06:40.110> in<00:06:40.199> red<00:06:40.380> also

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
here which I'm indicating in red also

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.430 
here which I'm indicating in red also
has<00:06:41.070> to<00:06:41.280> go<00:06:41.460> inward<00:06:41.940> outlining<00:06:42.690> your<00:06:42.870> outline

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
has to go inward outlining your outline

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.140 
has to go inward outlining your outline
so<00:06:43.800> you<00:06:43.860> see<00:06:44.130> how<00:06:44.310> that<00:06:44.370> one<00:06:44.820> little<00:06:45.060> change

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
so you see how that one little change

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.330 
so you see how that one little change
affected<00:06:46.139> so<00:06:46.350> many<00:06:46.470> other<00:06:46.710> things<00:06:47.040> it<00:06:47.250> was

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
affected so many other things it was

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.980 
affected so many other things it was
like<00:06:47.430> a<00:06:47.490> domino<00:06:47.669> effect<00:06:47.910> if<00:06:48.419> you<00:06:48.540> did<00:06:48.720> that<00:06:48.840> in

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
like a domino effect if you did that in

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.050 
like a domino effect if you did that in
other<00:06:49.139> places<00:06:49.470> would<00:06:49.800> look<00:06:50.010> more<00:06:50.310> details<00:06:50.880> and

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
other places would look more details and

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.280 
other places would look more details and
don't<00:06:51.120> mind<00:06:51.270> the<00:06:51.419> 3d<00:06:51.750> going<00:06:52.080> in<00:06:52.169> a<00:06:52.199> different

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
don't mind the 3d going in a different

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.990 
don't mind the 3d going in a different
direction<00:06:52.500> than<00:06:52.860> your<00:06:53.010> 3d<00:06:53.370> because<00:06:53.610> your<00:06:53.760> 3d

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
direction than your 3d because your 3d

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.330 
direction than your 3d because your 3d
is<00:06:54.090> wrong<00:06:54.389> I<00:06:54.570> just<00:06:54.870> put<00:06:55.169> 3d<00:06:55.680> there<00:06:55.860> just<00:06:56.130> to<00:06:56.190> put

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
is wrong I just put 3d there just to put

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.710 
is wrong I just put 3d there just to put
it<00:06:56.430> there<00:06:56.550> to<00:06:56.699> show<00:06:56.850> an<00:06:56.970> example<00:06:57.090> so<00:06:57.449> start

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
it there to show an example so start

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.780 
it there to show an example so start
thinking<00:06:57.930> about<00:06:58.139> how<00:06:58.590> your<00:06:58.800> interior<00:06:59.190> detail

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
thinking about how your interior detail

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.670 
thinking about how your interior detail
affects<00:07:00.360> other<00:07:00.630> parts<00:07:01.080> of<00:07:01.139> your<00:07:01.320> piece<00:07:01.470> and

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
affects other parts of your piece and

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.500 
affects other parts of your piece and
how<00:07:01.830> you<00:07:01.889> can<00:07:02.070> use<00:07:02.250> the<00:07:02.430> interior<00:07:02.880> detail<00:07:03.240> to

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
how you can use the interior detail to

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.450 
how you can use the interior detail to
make<00:07:03.660> your<00:07:03.900> pieces<00:07:04.139> look<00:07:04.500> more<00:07:04.830> detail<00:07:05.280> if

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
make your pieces look more detail if

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.770 
make your pieces look more detail if
you're<00:07:05.669> just<00:07:05.880> starting<00:07:06.060> off<00:07:06.330> in<00:07:06.479> your<00:07:06.600> 3d

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780

this<00:07:13.800> out<00:07:14.039> so<00:07:14.370> in<00:07:14.520> a<00:07:14.580> nutshell<00:07:14.760> to<00:07:15.060> sum

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
this out so in a nutshell to sum

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.480 
this out so in a nutshell to sum
everything<00:07:15.479> up<00:07:15.960> work<00:07:16.260> on<00:07:16.410> 3d<00:07:16.800> definitely

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
everything up work on 3d definitely

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.790 
everything up work on 3d definitely
study<00:07:17.820> some<00:07:18.240> one-point<00:07:18.870> perspective<00:07:18.960> not

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
study some one-point perspective not

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.830 
study some one-point perspective not
vanishing<00:07:20.250> point<00:07:20.460> 3d<00:07:20.729> study<00:07:21.060> one-point

vanishing point 3d study one-point

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.750 
vanishing point 3d study one-point
perspective<00:07:21.930> which<00:07:22.800> you'd<00:07:23.010> find<00:07:23.310> more<00:07:23.580> in<00:07:23.669> the

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760 
perspective which you'd find more in the

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.850 
perspective which you'd find more in the
fine<00:07:24.030> arts<00:07:24.330> and<00:07:24.510> keep<00:07:24.870> on<00:07:25.050> flowing<00:07:25.350> pieces<00:07:25.770> the

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 
fine arts and keep on flowing pieces the

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.590 
fine arts and keep on flowing pieces the
way<00:07:25.949> you're<00:07:26.100> flowing<00:07:26.280> you<00:07:26.550> have<00:07:26.789> dope<00:07:27.270> flow

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.600 
way you're flowing you have dope flow

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.210 
way you're flowing you have dope flow
and<00:07:27.870> it's<00:07:27.990> only<00:07:28.229> gonna<00:07:28.590> get<00:07:28.770> better

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 
and it's only gonna get better

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.219 
and it's only gonna get better
you'll<00:07:29.340> probably<00:07:29.580> soon<00:07:30.389> start<00:07:30.930> to<00:07:31.080> learn

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
you'll probably soon start to learn

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.170 
you'll probably soon start to learn
momentum<00:07:31.889> flow<00:07:32.220> which<00:07:32.490> is<00:07:32.520> a<00:07:32.669> lot<00:07:32.940> more

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
momentum flow which is a lot more

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.969 
momentum flow which is a lot more
advanced<00:07:33.630> and<00:07:33.780> its<00:07:34.169> capabilities<00:07:34.860> are

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 
advanced and its capabilities are

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.590 
advanced and its capabilities are
freaking<00:07:35.370> tremendous<00:07:35.820> but<00:07:36.150> definitely<00:07:36.539> keep
