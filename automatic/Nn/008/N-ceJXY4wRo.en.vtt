Bay Packer history and that's why I

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:14.139 
Bay Packer history and that's why I
chose<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:22.490 

why

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.410 

play<00:01:22.770> action<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> teen<00:01:23.760> wine<00:01:24.120> it<00:01:24.270> all

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.999 

I<00:01:41.990> think<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.140> happens<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> there's<00:01:43.860> no

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I think what happens is there's no

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
I think what happens is there's no
air-conditioning<00:01:44.360> company<00:01:45.360> here<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
air-conditioning company here now and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
air-conditioning company here now and
all<00:01:46.289> this<00:01:46.469> smoke<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.070> still<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
all this smoke that's still in here and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.209 
all this smoke that's still in here and
I<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.689> starting<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.289> warmer<00:01:50.070> on

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
I think it's starting to get warmer on

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.859 
I think it's starting to get warmer on
the<00:01:50.429> field<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.179> players<00:01:51.539> are<00:01:51.719> starting

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
