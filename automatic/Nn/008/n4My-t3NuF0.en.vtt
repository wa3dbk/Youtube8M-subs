so we're going to go over how to use

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.759 
so we're going to go over how to use
your<00:00:09.340> beacon<00:00:09.730> in<00:00:10.209> case<00:00:10.389> you<00:00:10.870> know<00:00:10.990> we<00:00:11.559> need<00:00:11.709> to

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
your beacon in case you know we need to

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.209 
your beacon in case you know we need to
do<00:00:11.889> a<00:00:11.920> search<00:00:12.219> and<00:00:12.490> so<00:00:13.150> these<00:00:13.959> are<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.219> DTS

turn now I'm straight onto him once

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.660 
turn now I'm straight onto him once
you're<00:02:14.599> straight<00:02:14.900> on<00:02:15.110> you're<00:02:15.890> moving<00:02:16.310> you're

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
you're straight on you're moving you're

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.880 
you're straight on you're moving you're
going<00:02:16.880> fast<00:02:17.180> okay<00:02:17.720> once<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.110> get<00:02:18.349> down<00:02:18.560> to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
going fast okay once you get down to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.410 
going fast okay once you get down to
like<00:02:18.920> 10<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.670> starting<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.000> say<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.239> 10

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
like 10 it's starting to say like 10

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.180 
like 10 it's starting to say like 10
meters<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.470> you're<00:02:21.590> starting<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.950> slow<00:02:22.160> down

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
meters then you're starting to slow down

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.309 
meters then you're starting to slow down
a<00:02:22.430> little<00:02:22.700> bit<00:02:22.910> what<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.110> want<00:02:24.290> to

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
a little bit what you do is you want to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.320 
a little bit what you do is you want to
pan<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:25.010> because<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> way<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.940> signal

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
pan this because the way the signal

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.839 
pan this because the way the signal
comes<00:02:26.510> out<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.930> these<00:02:27.019> is<00:02:27.349> it<00:02:27.800> goes<00:02:27.980> like<00:02:28.250> it

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
comes out of these is it goes like it

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.420 
comes out of these is it goes like it
goes<00:02:29.000> like<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.390> okay<00:02:30.160> that's<00:02:31.160> how<00:02:31.310> it

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
goes like this okay that's how it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.430 
goes like this okay that's how it
transmitted<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:32.840> there'll<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.110> dead

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
transmitted and so there'll be dead

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.920 
transmitted and so there'll be dead
spots<00:02:33.800> even<00:02:34.220> though<00:02:34.340> you're<00:02:34.519> straight<00:02:34.849> on<00:02:35.090> so

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
spots even though you're straight on so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.839 
spots even though you're straight on so
when<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.170> get<00:02:36.349> closer<00:02:36.650> you're<00:02:37.519> starting<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
when you get closer you're starting to

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.170 
when you get closer you're starting to
panic<00:02:38.180> like<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.260> okay<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.760> you're<00:02:40.970> working

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
panic like this okay and you're working

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.090 
panic like this okay and you're working
your<00:02:41.480> way<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.080> get<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.860> don't<00:02:42.950> know

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
your way to you get to like I don't know

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.680 
your way to you get to like I don't know
for<00:02:43.850> 34<00:02:44.510> meters<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:45.580> closer<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.700> one<00:02:46.970> right

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
for 34 meters like closer to one right

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.920 
for 34 meters like closer to one right
plus<00:02:48.470> 1<00:02:48.799> meter<00:02:49.100> that's<00:02:49.880> when<00:02:50.209> you're<00:02:50.750> probably

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
plus 1 meter that's when you're probably

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.390 
plus 1 meter that's when you're probably
going<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.170> have<00:02:51.260> another<00:02:51.530> guy<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.220> you're

going to have another guy and you're

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.320 
going to have another guy and you're
probably<00:02:52.519> going<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.819> do<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.060> with<00:02:53.209> your

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
probably going to do this with your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.880 
probably going to do this with your
probe<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.690> your<00:02:53.810> hand<00:02:53.989> because<00:02:54.440> once<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.739> get

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
probe in your hand because once you get

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.470 
probe in your hand because once you get

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
that close you can start stabbing in the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.580 
that close you can start stabbing in the
snow<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.870> you're<00:02:57.019> trying<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.290> find<00:02:57.440> that

the bottom of the slide path and works

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.140 
the bottom of the slide path and works
his<00:03:23.480> way<00:03:23.660> up<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.739> you're<00:03:24.890> going<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.040> meet<00:03:25.250> as
