hello everybody this is mumbo here
welcome<00:00:06.779> back<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.080> today<00:00:07.290> we're<00:00:07.379> gonna<00:00:07.440> be

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
welcome back and today we're gonna be

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.080 
welcome back and today we're gonna be
looking<00:00:07.710> at<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.069> triple<00:00:08.429> button<00:00:08.730> pad<00:00:08.910> now

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
looking at the triple button pad now

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.180 
looking at the triple button pad now
this<00:00:09.240> thing<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.750> wide<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.260> tire<00:00:10.860> ball<00:00:11.099> so

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
this thing is one wide is tire ball so

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.799 
this thing is one wide is tire ball so
that<00:00:11.250> means<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:11.820> infinite<00:00:12.420> arrays

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
that means you can have infinite arrays

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.900 
that means you can have infinite arrays
of<00:00:13.110> buttons<00:00:13.590> which<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.009> fantastically

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
of buttons which is fantastically

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.029 
of buttons which is fantastically
pointless<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.509> guess<00:00:15.750> as<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.350> can<00:00:16.619> see<00:00:16.830> here

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
pointless I guess as you can see here

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.410 
pointless I guess as you can see here
we've<00:00:17.160> probably<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.670> most<00:00:17.730> useful<00:00:18.090> one

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
we've probably got the most useful one

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
we've probably got the most useful one
this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> three<00:00:18.960> by<00:00:19.109> three<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> nine

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
this is a three by three or the nine

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
this is a three by three or the nine
button<00:00:20.850> pad<00:00:21.060> now<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> perfect<00:00:22.020> for

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
button pad now this is perfect for

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.840 
button pad now this is perfect for
things<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.380> combo<00:00:22.830> locks<00:00:23.070> or<00:00:23.519> track

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
things like combo locks or track

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
things like combo locks or track
selectors<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.140> there<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.439> no

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
selectors and as you can see there is no

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740 
selectors and as you can see there is no
space<00:00:25.769> between<00:00:26.310> each<00:00:26.699> bun<00:00:27.000> which<00:00:27.240> i<00:00:27.390> think<00:00:27.449> is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
space between each bun which i think is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.470 
space between each bun which i think is
bloody<00:00:28.050> fantastic<00:00:28.820> now<00:00:29.820> unfortunately<00:00:30.150> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
bloody fantastic now unfortunately I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.120

you'll see we fly around here and this
thing<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.760> fairly<00:00:42.149> substantial<00:00:43.020> it's

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
thing is fairly substantial it's

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.299 
thing is fairly substantial it's
actually<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> lot<00:00:43.739> harder<00:00:43.920> than<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.160> was

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
actually a lot harder than I was

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.639 
actually a lot harder than I was
expecting<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> triple<00:00:45.960> button<00:00:46.410> pad

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
expecting to make a triple button pad

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.470 
expecting to make a triple button pad
but<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.670> we've<00:00:48.090> got<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
but as you can see here we've got the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.360 
but as you can see here we've got the
three<00:00:48.690> lines<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.320> output<00:00:49.500> back<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.219> now

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
three lines of output back here now

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.560 
three lines of output back here now
we're<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.579> gonna<00:00:50.700> test<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
we're just gonna test out one of the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
we're just gonna test out one of the
buttons<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.110> we'll<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.739> hit<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.129> top<00:00:53.399> left

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
buttons so we'll just hit this top left

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
buttons so we'll just hit this top left
one<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.379> will<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:56.070> light

one here and as you will see that light

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
one here and as you will see that light
will<00:00:56.640> come<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.059> over<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.379> we'll

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
will come on over there and then we'll

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
will come on over there and then we'll
just<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.129> start<00:00:59.460> spamming<00:00:59.789> around<00:01:00.149> with

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
just you know start spamming around with

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.849 
just you know start spamming around with
the<00:01:00.359> button<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.469> we'll

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the button see what we can do so we'll

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.470 
the button see what we can do so we'll
go<00:01:02.010> across<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> then<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> bottom

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
go across like that and then the bottom

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
go across like that and then the bottom
right<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.080> well<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.860> let's<00:01:05.010> check<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
right one as well and let's check that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.240 
right one as well and let's check that
that's<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.970> working<00:01:06.150> order<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.250> yep

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that's all in working order and yep

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.510 
that's all in working order and yep
seems<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.210> fine<00:01:09.570> wicked<00:01:10.200> now<00:01:11.159> because

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
seems to all be fine wicked now because

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
seems to all be fine wicked now because
this<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.090> wide<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> would

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this is one wide I don't think it would

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.020 
this is one wide I don't think it would
be<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.619> time<00:01:14.010> efficient<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> me<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
be very time efficient of me to do a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.270 
be very time efficient of me to do a
tutorial<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.689> build<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
tutorial on how to build it so here is a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.340 
tutorial on how to build it so here is a
one<00:01:17.580> wide<00:01:17.880> cutout<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:18.900> should<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.290> be

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
one wide cutout now there should not be
