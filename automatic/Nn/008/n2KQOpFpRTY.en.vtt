everyone<00:00:00.930> wants<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.199> ricotta's<00:00:01.589> butter<00:00:03.770> cool

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
everyone wants to ricotta's butter cool

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.769 
everyone wants to ricotta's butter cool
say<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.430> my<00:00:05.670> class<00:00:05.879> I'm<00:00:06.150> isolated

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
say this is my class I'm isolated

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.830 
say this is my class I'm isolated
pendulums<00:00:07.700> masculine<00:00:08.700> pendulum<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
pendulums masculine pendulum it's like a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.829 
pendulums masculine pendulum it's like a
normal<00:00:10.460> butt<00:00:11.750> isolations<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.990> lot<00:00:13.710> isolated<00:00:14.839> so

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
normal butt isolations a lot isolated so

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.480 
normal butt isolations a lot isolated so
you're<00:00:16.080> traveling<00:00:16.440> across<00:00:16.740> half<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.039> Occupy

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
you're traveling across half the Occupy

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
you're traveling across half the Occupy
circle<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:17.910> your<00:00:17.970> hands<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.720> your<00:00:18.810> head

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
circle with your hands and your head

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.500 
circle with your hands and your head
just<00:00:19.260> traveling<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.740> other<00:00:19.920> hop<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.820> so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
just traveling on the other hop and so

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.960 
just traveling on the other hop and so
it'll<00:00:21.750> feel<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:21.960> an<00:00:22.230> isolation<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:23.730> sort

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it'll feel like an isolation just sort

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.609 
it'll feel like an isolation just sort
of<00:00:24.060> Bounce<00:00:24.660> eeeh<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.220> well<00:00:27.619> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
of Bounce eeeh and not going as well so

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.529 
of Bounce eeeh and not going as well so
from<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> bunch<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.359> pirates

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
from that you can do a bunch of pirates

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.959 
from that you can do a bunch of pirates
because<00:00:31.080> we've<00:00:31.260> got<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.009> unit<00:00:32.279> circle<00:00:32.430> like

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
because we've got the unit circle like

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.690 
because we've got the unit circle like
you<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.390> an<00:00:33.480> isolation<00:00:34.550> anything<00:00:35.550> else

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
you do in an isolation anything else

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.040 
you do in an isolation anything else
that<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.000> want<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> train<00:00:36.329> together<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:39.050> second

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
that you want to train together a second

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
that you want to train together a second
point<00:00:40.290> during<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.340> pattern<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.239> an

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
point during this pattern you can do an

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:52.500 
point during this pattern you can do an
extension

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.840 

and<00:00:52.990> that<00:00:53.140> will<00:00:53.260> create<00:00:53.430> two<00:00:54.430> different

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
and that will create two different

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.900 
and that will create two different
timing<00:00:55.270> directions<00:00:55.810> you<00:00:56.020> can<00:00:56.140> get<00:00:56.290> into<00:00:56.910> say

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
timing directions you can get into say

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.970 
timing directions you can get into say
the<00:00:58.060> one<00:00:58.180> best<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.600> point<00:00:58.840> head<00:00:58.990> and<00:00:59.860> get

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
the one best is the point head and get

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.530 
the one best is the point head and get
at<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.130> same<00:01:00.340> time<00:01:00.550> same<00:01:01.239> direction<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:03.540> same

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
at the same time same direction or same

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.620 
at the same time same direction or same
opposites<00:01:05.050> from

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.940 

and<00:01:11.870> then<00:01:12.020> vestiges<00:01:12.530> like<00:01:13.330> I'm<00:01:14.330> getting<00:01:14.630> to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
and then vestiges like I'm getting to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.810 
and then vestiges like I'm getting to
spend<00:01:15.950> time<00:01:16.040> same<00:01:16.370> direction

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
spend time same direction

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:28.360 
spend time same direction
I<00:01:20.050> think<00:01:21.050> it's<00:01:21.170> put<00:01:21.950> up<00:01:22.040> but<00:01:22.220> yeah<00:01:27.280> there's<00:01:28.280> a

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
I think it's put up but yeah there's a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.800 
I think it's put up but yeah there's a
bunch<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.640> useful<00:01:28.820> transitions<00:01:29.360> there<00:01:29.570> and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
bunch of useful transitions there and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.859 
bunch of useful transitions there and
these<00:01:29.990> four<00:01:30.170> habits<00:01:30.470> haven't<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.869> another

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
these four habits haven't you another

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.660 
these four habits haven't you another
thing<00:01:33.080> you<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:33.320> do<00:01:33.500> with<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:34.160> oscillating

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
thing you can do with this oscillating

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:43.170 
thing you can do with this oscillating
pendulum<00:01:35.150> motion<00:01:35.440> is<00:01:36.440> let<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.040> drop<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.670> lift

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.670 

so<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.210> bottom<00:01:44.600> half<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:45.080> I<00:01:45.259> feel<00:01:45.500> like<00:01:45.530> a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
so the bottom half of that I feel like a

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.150 
so the bottom half of that I feel like a
cat<00:01:46.899> but<00:01:47.899> just<00:01:48.229> sort<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.440> coming<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.770> rest<00:01:48.979> off

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
cat but just sort of coming to rest off

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.310 
cat but just sort of coming to rest off
wait<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.630> really<00:01:50.899> good<00:01:51.020> drill<00:01:51.200> for

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
wait this is a really good drill for

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.130 
wait this is a really good drill for
getting<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.830> bottom<00:01:52.100> half<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.850> right<00:01:53.140> then

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
getting that bottom half just right then

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.600 
getting that bottom half just right then
isolating<00:01:54.710> over<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.950> top<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:58.070> panel<00:01:58.399> has<00:01:58.580> a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
isolating over the top this panel has a

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.330 
isolating over the top this panel has a
couple<00:01:58.910> of<00:01:58.970> cool<00:01:59.210> properties<00:01:59.720> say<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:01.070> it's

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
couple of cool properties say and it's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.040 
couple of cool properties say and it's
making<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.670> circle<00:02:02.060> as<00:02:02.270> well<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.810> point

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
making a circle as well as the point

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.530 
making a circle as well as the point
head<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.399> first<00:02:04.580> traveling<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.119> opposite

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
head and the first traveling in opposite

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.480 
head and the first traveling in opposite
directions<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:06.380> they<00:02:06.560> both<00:02:06.740> meet<00:02:07.040> in<00:02:07.369> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
directions and they both meet in the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.050 
directions and they both meet in the
center<00:02:08.320> so<00:02:09.320> it's<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.770> useful<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.610> kind<00:02:10.970> of

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
center so it's a useful and kind of

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.110 
center so it's a useful and kind of
quirky<00:02:11.209> patent<00:02:11.690> in<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.050> regard<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:14.000> make

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
quirky patent in that regard so to make

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.250 
quirky patent in that regard so to make
a<00:02:14.150> basic<00:02:14.360> hybrid<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:16.220> join<00:02:16.459> an<00:02:16.700> extension<00:02:17.269> to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
a basic hybrid you join an extension to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.949 
a basic hybrid you join an extension to
either<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:18.980> hand<00:02:19.250> or<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.670> playhead<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
either your hand or the playhead so

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.630 
either your hand or the playhead so
turning<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.100> my<00:02:22.190> hand

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
turning it to my hand

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.750 
turning it to my hand
look<00:02:23.030> like<00:02:23.209> this

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.869 

turning<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.629> playhead<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:28.400> look<00:02:28.550> today

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.030 

and<00:02:31.879> both<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> players<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.409> very<00:02:33.769> useful

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
and both the players have very useful

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.780 
and both the players have very useful
transition<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.700> well<00:02:38.799> at<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.950> top<00:02:40.129> again<00:02:40.489> we

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
transition as well at the top again we

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.440 
transition as well at the top again we
have<00:02:41.030> slits<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.690> same<00:02:42.049> direction<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:44.090> get<00:02:44.269> to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
have slits on same direction you get to

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.479 
have slits on same direction you get to
a<00:02:44.480> lot<00:02:44.629> of<00:02:44.690> patents<00:02:44.959> from<00:02:45.019> there<00:02:45.290> that's<00:02:46.280> why

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
a lot of patents from there that's why

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.000 
a lot of patents from there that's why
don't<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.760> have<00:02:47.000> same<00:02:47.390> time<00:02:47.599> opposite<00:02:48.049> you<00:02:48.920> can

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
don't we have same time opposite you can

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.160 
don't we have same time opposite you can
we<00:02:49.069> have<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.370> lot<00:02:49.489> of<00:02:49.549> patents<00:02:49.819> from<00:02:49.910> that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.899 

there's<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.860> two<00:02:55.010> timing<00:02:55.310> directions<00:02:55.819> to

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
there's a the two timing directions to

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.589 
there's a the two timing directions to
get<00:02:56.030> into<00:02:56.239> from<00:02:56.569> this<00:02:56.780> battle<00:02:58.360> first<00:02:59.360> is<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
get into from this battle first is the

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.849 
get into from this battle first is the
head<00:03:00.910> at<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.060> bottom<00:03:02.209> we<00:03:02.569> get<00:03:02.720> into<00:03:02.959> same<00:03:03.680> time

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
head at the bottom we get into same time

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:04.710 
head at the bottom we get into same time
same<00:03:04.069> direction

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
same direction

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.250 
same direction
pretty<00:03:05.720> common<00:03:05.900> useful<00:03:06.470> timing<00:03:07.239> top<00:03:08.239> get<00:03:09.019> into

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
pretty common useful timing top get into

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.850 
pretty common useful timing top get into
with<00:03:10.069> them<00:03:10.250> opposite<00:03:10.730> direction

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.260 

so<00:03:17.400> there's<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.670> two<00:03:17.820> timings<00:03:18.210> and

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
so there's the two timings and

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.530 
so there's the two timings and
directions<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.690> get<00:03:18.870> into<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.150> also<00:03:21.270> join

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
directions to get into you can also join

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.580 
directions to get into you can also join
all<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.110> patents<00:03:22.380> together<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.310> as

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
all the patents together like that as

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.950 
all the patents together like that as
isolation<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:26.370> make<00:03:26.520> more<00:03:26.790> efforts<00:03:27.600> as<00:03:27.750> well

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
isolation to make more efforts as well

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.930 
isolation to make more efforts as well
so<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:29.400> make<00:03:29.610> these<00:03:30.240> kind<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.540> hybrids<00:03:31.940> they

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
so you make these kind of hybrids they

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.300 
so you make these kind of hybrids they
can<00:03:33.090> also<00:03:33.210> join<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.870> hand<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.440> step<00:03:34.680> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
can also join it to the hand and step to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.590 
can also join it to the hand and step to
make<00:03:35.520> this<00:03:36.420> kind<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.690> hybrid<00:03:36.870> there<00:03:41.480> well<00:03:42.480> you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
make this kind of hybrid there well you

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.200 
make this kind of hybrid there well you
could<00:03:42.780> also<00:03:43.040> join<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.340> just<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.670> path<00:03:44.910> that

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
could also join it to just the path that

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.700 
could also join it to just the path that
your<00:03:45.330> hand<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.570> following<00:03:45.900> or<00:03:46.200> just<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.500> top

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
your hand is following or just the top

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.820 
your hand is following or just the top
that<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.190> head<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.430> funneling<00:03:47.790> let's<00:03:48.480> make

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
that the head is funneling let's make

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.050 
that the head is funneling let's make
strange<00:03:49.830> different<00:03:50.160> hazards<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.820> aren't

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
strange different hazards that aren't

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.510 
strange different hazards that aren't
actually<00:03:51.420> joined<00:03:51.630> together<00:03:52.220> let's<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.400> make

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
actually joined together let's to make

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:06.640 
actually joined together let's to make
really<00:03:53.730> cool<00:03:53.880> path

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.800 

like<00:04:07.650> that

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
like that

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.420 

but<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.350> get<00:04:10.560> tuned<00:04:10.740> to<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:10.980> bunch<00:04:11.370> of

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
but you can get tuned to a bunch of

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.280 
but you can get tuned to a bunch of
other<00:04:11.610> Chinese<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.300> directions<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.080> just

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
other Chinese and directions so you just

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.410 
other Chinese and directions so you just
pay<00:04:13.440> attention<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.160> what's<00:04:14.640> happening<00:04:14.700> pop

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
pay attention to what's happening pop

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.660 
pay attention to what's happening pop
what's<00:04:15.870> happening<00:04:16.200> at<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.350> bottom<00:04:16.670> figure

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
what's happening at the bottom figure

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.600 
what's happening at the bottom figure
out<00:04:17.790> where<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.150> go<00:04:18.209> from<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:19.310> yeah<00:04:20.340> so

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
out where to go from that yeah so

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.979 
out where to go from that yeah so
there's<00:04:20.760> lots<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.970> useful<00:04:21.150> hybrids<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.690> come

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
there's lots of useful hybrids that come

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.450 
there's lots of useful hybrids that come
from<00:04:22.260> this<00:04:22.920> style<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.280> patent<00:04:24.410> yeah<00:04:25.460> hybrids

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
from this style of patent yeah hybrids

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.420 
from this style of patent yeah hybrids
are<00:04:26.520> good<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:27.390> another<00:04:28.260> thing<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.470> can<00:04:28.710> do<00:04:28.860> is

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
are good so another thing you can do is

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.590 
are good so another thing you can do is
have<00:04:29.610> two<00:04:29.820> of<00:04:29.940> these<00:04:30.030> at<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.270> same<00:04:30.330> time<00:04:32.600> human

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
have two of these at the same time human

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.400 
have two of these at the same time human
weapon<00:04:34.500> whatever<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.580> prefer<00:04:35.990> but<00:04:36.990> for<00:04:37.260> one

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
weapon whatever you prefer but for one

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.800 
weapon whatever you prefer but for one
particular<00:04:37.560> pattern<00:04:38.130> they're<00:04:38.490> gonna<00:04:38.610> be

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
particular pattern they're gonna be

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.140 
particular pattern they're gonna be
doing<00:04:39.810> opposite<00:04:40.260> each<00:04:40.380> other

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
doing opposite each other

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.570 
doing opposite each other
gonna<00:04:42.150> move<00:04:42.300> one<00:04:42.510> above<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.650> other<00:04:43.680> line<00:04:43.950> each

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
gonna move one above the other line each

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.710 
gonna move one above the other line each
do<00:04:44.760> that<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.810> also<00:04:46.680> get<00:04:46.830> used<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:47.130> other<00:04:48.120> Aryan

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
do that and also get used to other Aryan

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.180 
do that and also get used to other Aryan
tation<00:04:49.080> today<00:04:49.440> with<00:04:51.800> then<00:04:52.800> what<00:04:52.980> we're<00:04:53.070> gonna

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
tation today with then what we're gonna

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.230 
tation today with then what we're gonna
do<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.870> at<00:04:54.870> 90<00:04:55.260> degrees<00:04:55.790> switch<00:04:56.790> which<00:04:56.940> hand<00:04:57.120> is

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
do is at 90 degrees switch which hand is

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.130 
do is at 90 degrees switch which hand is
on<00:04:57.330> top<00:04:57.560> push<00:04:58.560> through<00:04:58.830> then<00:04:59.460> at<00:04:59.580> 90<00:04:59.760> degrees

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
on top push through then at 90 degrees

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.750 
on top push through then at 90 degrees
search<00:05:01.140> your<00:05:01.260> tenders<00:05:01.560> on<00:05:01.650> top<00:05:01.800> again<00:05:01.920> and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
search your tenders on top again and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.090 
search your tenders on top again and
then<00:05:03.030> continue<00:05:03.540> that<00:05:03.630> motion<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.860> make<00:05:04.980> this

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
then continue that motion to make this

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.850 
then continue that motion to make this
path

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
path

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.290 
path
I<00:05:06.889> think<00:05:07.550> that's<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.759> cleanest<00:05:08.120> that

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
I think that's the cleanest that

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.490 
I think that's the cleanest that
explanations<00:05:08.930> gone<00:05:09.400> that<00:05:10.400> was<00:05:10.520> really<00:05:10.789> nice

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
explanations gone that was really nice

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.350 
explanations gone that was really nice
from<00:05:13.310> here<00:05:13.550> there's<00:05:13.849> a<00:05:13.909> lot<00:05:14.060> of<00:05:14.180> useful

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
from here there's a lot of useful

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.689 
from here there's a lot of useful
transitions<00:05:15.050> as<00:05:15.199> well<00:05:15.349> if<00:05:16.159> you<00:05:16.280> get<00:05:16.669> the

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
transitions as well if you get the

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.240 
transitions as well if you get the
bottom<00:05:17.090> hand<00:05:17.270> some<00:05:17.629> more<00:05:17.840> momentum<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:19.159> get

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
bottom hand some more momentum and get

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.210 
bottom hand some more momentum and get
to<00:05:19.430> this<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.180> then<00:05:20.900> into<00:05:21.229> an<00:05:21.319> isolation<00:05:21.680> and

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
to this and then into an isolation and

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.059 
to this and then into an isolation and
you<00:05:22.280> can<00:05:22.819> do<00:05:22.909> that<00:05:23.060> all<00:05:23.150> at<00:05:23.180> once<00:05:23.919> let's<00:05:24.919> make

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 
you can do that all at once let's make

well sorry because I mentioned this 90
degree<00:05:43.129> thing<00:05:43.400> and<00:05:43.940> also<00:05:44.060> rotate<00:05:44.479> this<00:05:44.629> by<00:05:45.530> 45

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
degree thing and also rotate this by 45

degree thing and also rotate this by 45
degrees<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:46.550> get<00:05:46.729> into<00:05:46.909> point<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.270> say

degrees and you get into point I say

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:57.939 
degrees and you get into point I say
frame<00:05:47.690> X<00:05:52.389> from<00:05:53.389> here<00:05:55.719> degrees<00:05:56.719> and<00:05:57.560> you'll

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
frame X from here degrees and you'll

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:08.429 
frame X from here degrees and you'll
arrest<00:05:58.159> the<00:05:58.340> momentum<00:05:58.759> with<00:05:58.879> one<00:05:59.060> of<00:05:59.150> the<00:05:59.210> play

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
same way you change for gravity does to

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.420 
same way you change for gravity does to
it<00:06:11.389> and<00:06:14.529> yeah<00:06:15.529> something<00:06:15.860> that's<00:06:16.099> about<00:06:16.249> it
