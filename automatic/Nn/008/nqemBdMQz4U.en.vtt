00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.410
 do not do it in macro game is in 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.740
 does one against them so I have and who is going 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.650
 go on the proxy 2 gates and in addition 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.289
 this map is imbitable to save 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.940
 my goal and paul for protos and proxiad 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.830
 the ages on the mouth of the blow 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.000
 frankly I like the proxy of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.480
 gate of google panda it's bath and that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.960
 can pass 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.640
 he will not see it can kill me and you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 right there it can kill you see he has it 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.949
 right handed is gradually 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.870
 pity 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.980
 very well played so the two shots that 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.140
 are going to end you know it in this 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.480
 kind of case we do not have any 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.430
 counsel excuse me for cybernetics 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.590
 throat starts a little tired and so 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 so we have only from the top nil all 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 do islets dillon zealots zealot 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.199
 yeah so it's very simple for 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.579
 possibly add a pylon if its 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.870
 3d full olalalala views there we have it's 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.730
 hadj and ong 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.920
 this is the must not do this bo there 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.840
 yeah then the thirst and the defense of 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.390
 jesus then frankly I think you 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.890
 even with Jesus stupas not I saw 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.689
 incredible stuff you see defenses 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.090
 amazing so I'm not going to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.000
 prognosis but hey it's so 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 was played the daf iron squid carole 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.030
 Laura is sure to rediscover ethics 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.470
 no but good the return of life on iron 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.100
 this elbow was still classed 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.159
 badass colas is that there he comes to us 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.990
 help it roll 3 zealots life she is 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.640
 a little bit so I have the camera on jay dong 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.000
 and he had won in the end what there the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.770
 camera on jay dong the disappointment but 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.329
 between well paid people what is your 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.670
 box where the drones in the mouth me 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.049
 I reside in the jaw stop there I 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.880
 do not know why he's fighting like he 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.100
 lose all there is too much to fight there 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 for me you send them to the mouth you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.520
 you go on the mouth you force to do 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.950
 a choice after had there and then after we 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.990
 do if they save time on his 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.850
 hen let's say doing that ah 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.560
 yeah that was just why he wanted 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.670
 keep the shape of the hen and he has it 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.810
 sent after because they wanted 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.550
 be sure to have the time to produce 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.040
 that's just why I think he admits 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.110
 these drones but only to the pilots who 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.250
 leave they leave a villa weave that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.080
 I do not know if it's the right choice with 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.650
 I think if these would make me 6 6 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.690
 4 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.070
 it is necessary that the islets come to destroy 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.310
 this spain absolutely 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.510
 we must prevent the tumba is played here I 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.030
 think Spain will not have the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.480
 time to end at May 6 on defend me 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.880
 I make you take the microphone 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.650
 there they try to push the pilots to 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.570
 the rise they get to leave there louf 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.250
 and what can defend 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.050
 is it takes may depend college 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 spain spain is a gold when 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:45.940
 even look and here I am telling you that 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.740
 would have been better that they stay stabbed 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.600
 the hen where to grab dadge I'm sure 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.980
 that he should have stayed awake so the 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.580
 mecca 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.800
 no no he'll do it the names of both 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.040
 uzi tightrope now we win at the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.100
 end 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.500
 no jesus here they are it is 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.250
 a piece of winning 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.900
 kanye west 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.330
 so you can put without a clip that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.459
 perfectly glue in the meantime he lifted 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.989
 a spine he lifted a half spine spine 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.489
 of angers kidnapping spain but i think 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.890
 that both will suffice the cetp 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.489
 clean up his zealots he will not lose me 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.380
 the third 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.190
 yeah that's the genius of the g10 a year 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.050
 but but 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.310
 must not lose his friends good we will say 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.540
 it's not over yet though 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.370
 because 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.079
 well, there's a lot 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.040
 of unity squeezed the zerg 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.140
 does it laugh at the importance of 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.730
 micro rules saw the cast on 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.959
 Spain too much there but ba 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.810
 difficulties in attack on Spain 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.950
 collard not challenges that go the important 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.629
 it's sending ina arts here 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.069
 regularly punctuated evidence and you 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.709
 see he shows the crowd he has 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.000
 show the hen the good funk case you 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.799
 you think do you think he should have 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.650
 snipe and the crowd after I'm going steve 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.019
 not at all is to have some science 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.579
 that binds to have to the PD so I'm going 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.720
 not to say that I imagine I was 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.670
 really huh it's just that I 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.680
 think it was to lose him because 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.030
 he had too much time go on the gold 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.409
 so obviously it was also some 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.689
 thing that is being prepared 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.790
 so here he won there I'm on the 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.829
 ass finally because it's the worst it's 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.239
 that they were going to stay serene you see 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.099
 so there really I did not think that 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.109
 it was possible in total transparency 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.389
 to defend in this situation 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.769
 like I believed too not 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.599
 all there he will lose his hen and 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.070
 maybe even who will lose 7 h 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.840
 but amateur is too late but 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.979
 it's too late look yeah no 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.229
 frankly it's too late he had to 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.590
 so I had to me it's amazing 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.650
 he is experiencing incredible genro 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.650
 I
