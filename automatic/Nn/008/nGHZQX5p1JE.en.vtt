00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
see out switching I like the matrix

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.120 
see out switching I like the matrix
because<00:06:21.750> as<00:06:21.900> you<00:06:22.050> just<00:06:22.080> saw<00:06:22.380> it's<00:06:22.590> probably<00:06:23.100> a

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
because as you just saw it's probably a

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
because as you just saw it's probably a
little<00:06:23.310> bit<00:06:23.490> more<00:06:25.310> you<00:06:26.310> can<00:06:26.340> go<00:06:26.670> through<00:06:26.910> a<00:06:26.940> lot

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
little bit more you can go through a lot

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.690 
little bit more you can go through a lot
quicker<00:06:27.920> it<00:06:28.920> seems<00:06:29.160> like<00:06:29.310> that's<00:06:29.460> a<00:06:29.580> bit

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
quicker it seems like that's a bit

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.670 
quicker it seems like that's a bit
sluggish<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.360> other<00:06:30.510> one<00:06:30.660> that<00:06:30.690> it<00:06:30.900> the

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
sluggish the other one that it the

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.420 
sluggish the other one that it the
default<00:06:31.860> one<00:06:32.280> is<00:06:32.390> Kosmos<00:06:33.620> it's<00:06:34.620> a<00:06:34.650> very<00:06:34.920> neat

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
default one is Kosmos it's a very neat

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.150 
default one is Kosmos it's a very neat
implementation<00:06:36.210> of<00:06:36.390> the<00:06:36.510> touchscreen<00:06:36.870> as<00:06:37.680> you

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
implementation of the touchscreen as you

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.840 
implementation of the touchscreen as you
can<00:06:38.340> scroll<00:06:38.850> through<00:06:38.910> it<00:06:39.180> like<00:06:39.330> that<00:06:40.850> very

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
can scroll through it like that very

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:49.100 
can scroll through it like that very
visually<00:06:42.450> appealing<00:06:44.060> very<00:06:45.060> nice<00:06:47.810> but<00:06:48.810> as<00:06:48.930> for

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
visually appealing very nice but as for

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.290 
visually appealing very nice but as for
me<00:06:49.260> I'm<00:06:49.410> just<00:06:49.620> gonna<00:06:49.710> stick<00:06:49.980> to<00:06:50.190> the<00:06:50.850> matrix

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
me I'm just gonna stick to the matrix

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.140 
me I'm just gonna stick to the matrix
come<00:06:52.110> out<00:06:52.260> with<00:06:52.380> different<00:06:52.560> ones<00:06:52.770> too<00:06:53.070> so<00:06:53.150> it's

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
come out with different ones too so it's

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.130 
come out with different ones too so it's
not<00:06:54.240> just<00:06:54.330> gonna<00:06:54.540> be<00:06:54.660> that<00:06:54.810> you<00:06:54.840> can<00:06:54.990> change

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
not just gonna be that you can change

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:01.010 
not just gonna be that you can change
the<00:06:55.320> fonts<00:06:55.800> as<00:06:55.980> well<00:06:58.100> sound<00:06:59.100> you<00:06:59.280> can<00:06:59.430> also<00:07:00.020> you

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
the fonts as well sound you can also you

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.840 
the fonts as well sound you can also you
know<00:07:01.170> mess<00:07:01.650> with<00:07:01.800> the<00:07:01.890> equalizer<00:07:02.190> there<00:07:02.580> and

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
know mess with the equalizer there and

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.850 
know mess with the equalizer there and
do<00:07:03.570> whatever<00:07:03.690> you<00:07:03.870> need<00:07:03.900> to<00:07:04.050> a<00:07:04.530> volume<00:07:05.130> limit

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
do whatever you need to a volume limit

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.190 
do whatever you need to a volume limit
let's<00:07:07.860> see<00:07:08.130> I<00:07:08.340> just<00:07:08.700> miss<00:07:08.880> that<00:07:08.910> volume<00:07:09.870> limit

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
let's see I just miss that volume limit

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.960 
let's see I just miss that volume limit
