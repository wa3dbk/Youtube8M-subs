00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.030 
it was the highest level I think anyone
highest<00:03:55.389> level<00:03:55.599> I<00:03:55.659> played<00:03:55.959> and<00:03:56.229> I<00:03:56.739> think<00:03:56.979> if

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
highest level I played and I think if

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.289 
highest level I played and I think if
you<00:03:57.129> speak<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.430> all<00:03:57.549> be<00:03:57.699> all<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:58.000> guys<00:03:58.150> that

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
you speak to all be all the guys that

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.550 
you speak to all be all the guys that
played<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.659> World<00:03:58.870> Series<00:03:58.930> cricket<00:03:59.259> it<00:03:59.470> was

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
played in World Series cricket it was

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.860 
played in World Series cricket it was
probably<00:03:59.769> highest<00:04:00.069> level<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.689> they<00:04:01.689> ever

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
probably highest level that they ever

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.449 
probably highest level that they ever
played<00:04:02.139> in<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.409> highest<00:04:02.620> level<00:04:02.859> I<00:04:02.949> think<00:04:03.189> of

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
played in the highest level I think of

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.089 
played in the highest level I think of
any<00:04:03.639> cricket<00:04:03.939> ever<00:04:04.060> played<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.540> really<00:04:04.780> was

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
any cricket ever played it really was

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.099 
any cricket ever played it really was
fiercely<00:04:06.099> competed<00:04:06.939> but<00:04:07.449> I<00:04:07.509> think<00:04:07.689> the<00:04:07.750> reason

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
fiercely competed but I think the reason

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.719 
fiercely competed but I think the reason
for<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.349> was<00:04:08.739> that<00:04:08.799> we<00:04:09.310> were<00:04:09.400> totally

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
for that was that we were totally

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:14.809 
for that was that we were totally
ostracized<00:04:10.209> from<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.479> rest<00:04:10.629> of<00:04:10.689> the<00:04:10.750> world

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.879
