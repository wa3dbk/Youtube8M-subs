the<00:00:00.659> next<00:00:00.989> step<00:00:01.490> in<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.700> acrylic<00:00:03.060> application

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
the next step in the acrylic application

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.950 
the next step in the acrylic application
is<00:00:04.799> we're<00:00:05.069> going<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.339> apply<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.730> gel<00:00:06.270> resin

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
is we're going to apply a gel resin

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.930 
is we're going to apply a gel resin
the<00:00:07.890> reason<00:00:08.160> were<00:00:08.220> doing<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.670> because

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
the reason were doing that is because

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.560 
the reason were doing that is because
sarah<00:00:09.179> has<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> French<00:00:09.780> tip<00:00:10.070> if<00:00:11.070> she<00:00:11.460> had<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
sarah has a French tip if she had just a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.470 
sarah has a French tip if she had just a
natural<00:00:13.019> tip<00:00:13.259> then<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:13.799> would<00:00:13.950> apply<00:00:14.360> either<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
natural tip then we would apply either a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.010 
natural tip then we would apply either a
gel<00:00:15.780> resin<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.470> make<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.650> shiny<00:00:17.039> or

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
gel resin just to make it shiny or

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.550 
gel resin just to make it shiny or
polish<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:21.240> color<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.630> her<00:00:21.779> choice<00:00:22.140> I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
polish of the color of her choice I

polish of the color of her choice I
dusted<00:00:23.279> off<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> natural<00:00:23.970> nails<00:00:24.150> I'm<00:00:24.480> gonna

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
dusted off the natural nails I'm gonna

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.910 
dusted off the natural nails I'm gonna
pull<00:00:24.840> out<00:00:24.960> my<00:00:25.109> UV<00:00:25.529> light<00:00:26.510> because<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.710> gel<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
pull out my UV light because the gel is

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.389 
pull out my UV light because the gel is
a<00:00:29.160> UV<00:00:29.880> gel<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.019> light<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:31.740> cures<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
a UV gel and the light is what cures it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
a UV gel and the light is what cures it
to<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> hard<00:00:33.719> finish<00:00:36.050> we're<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to a hard finish we're just going to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.590 
to a hard finish we're just going to
start<00:00:37.620> by<00:00:37.860> putting<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:40.520> on<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:42.030> four<00:00:42.390> fingers

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
start by putting it on all four fingers

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.569 
start by putting it on all four fingers
on<00:00:42.960> both<00:00:43.140> hands<00:00:43.500> first<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.070> stick<00:00:44.370> them<00:00:44.489> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
on both hands first and stick them in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
on both hands first and stick them in
the<00:00:44.700> light<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.180> three<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> five<00:00:45.870> minutes<00:00:48.860> then

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the light for three to five minutes then

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:01.920 
the light for three to five minutes then
we're<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:51.320> put<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.559> her<00:00:52.800> thumbs

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.560 

and<00:01:02.469> cure<00:01:02.739> those<00:01:02.920> for<00:01:03.370> three<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.059> five<00:01:04.239> minutes

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
and cure those for three to five minutes

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:24.599 
and cure those for three to five minutes
in<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.930> light<00:01:05.110> as<00:01:05.379> well

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.410 

they<00:01:25.609> do<00:01:25.670> make<00:01:25.969> UV<00:01:26.359> lights<00:01:26.569> big<00:01:26.899> enough<00:01:27.109> to<00:01:27.380> put

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
they do make UV lights big enough to put

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.940 
they do make UV lights big enough to put
both<00:01:29.420> hands<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.079> go<00:01:30.380> ahead<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:30.560> stick<00:01:30.829> those

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
both hands in go ahead and stick those

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.209 
both hands in go ahead and stick those
four<00:01:31.329> at<00:01:32.329> once<00:01:32.659> but<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.740> reason<00:01:33.979> I<00:01:34.039> like

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
four at once but the reason I like

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.539 
four at once but the reason I like
waiting<00:01:34.609> to<00:01:35.479> do<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.140> thumbs<00:01:36.409> last<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.340> that

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
waiting to do the thumbs last is so that

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.359 
waiting to do the thumbs last is so that
the<00:01:37.810> gel<00:01:38.810> doesn't<00:01:39.200> run<00:01:39.319> down<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.770> one<00:01:39.950> side<00:01:40.219> of

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
the gel doesn't run down to one side of

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:48.599 
the gel doesn't run down to one side of
the<00:01:40.520> nail<00:01:40.759> while<00:01:41.299> it's<00:01:41.509> turned<00:01:41.929> on<00:01:42.170> its<00:01:42.350> side

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.059 

some<00:01:49.609> gels<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.090> have<00:01:50.359> to<00:01:50.509> wipe<00:01:50.689> off<00:01:51.969> after

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
some gels you have to wipe off after

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.589 
some gels you have to wipe off after
they<00:01:55.069> cure<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.819> get<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.119> last<00:01:56.329> little

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
they cure just to get the last little

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.859 
they cure just to get the last little
bit<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.840> tacking<00:01:57.530> this<00:01:57.679> off<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:59.090> some<00:01:59.450> should

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
bit of tacking this off and some should

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:11.480 
bit of tacking this off and some should
cure<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:01.750> high<00:02:02.750> shine<00:02:02.780> tech<00:02:03.560> free<00:02:04.009> finish

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.540 

stick<00:02:12.300> no<00:02:12.450> spoiler<00:02:14.810> once<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.320> fingers<00:02:16.740> have

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
stick no spoiler once the fingers have

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:26.780 
stick no spoiler once the fingers have
cured<00:02:21.530> go<00:02:22.530> ahead<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.830> pull<00:02:23.040> them<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.920> do

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
cured go ahead and pull them out and do

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:40.089 
cured go ahead and pull them out and do
the<00:02:26.940> thumbnails<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.810> stick<00:02:31.230> them<00:02:31.500> in

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.179 

again<00:02:40.819> look<00:02:41.030> at<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.359> bottle<00:02:41.749> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.829> resin

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
again look at the bottle of the resin

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.580 
again look at the bottle of the resin
that<00:02:43.219> you<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.909> see<00:02:44.120> how<00:02:44.959> long<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.439> need

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
that you have to see how long you need

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.649 
that you have to see how long you need
to<00:02:45.650> do<00:02:45.889> it<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.189> most<00:02:46.459> or<00:02:46.700> three<00:02:47.359> to<00:02:47.480> five

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
to do it for most or three to five

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:54.759 
to do it for most or three to five
minutes<00:02:52.629> after<00:02:53.629> they've<00:02:53.870> cured<00:02:54.230> for<00:02:54.650> their

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
minutes after they've cured for their

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.429 
minutes after they've cured for their
full<00:02:55.010> time<00:02:55.540> you're<00:02:56.540> going<00:02:56.719> to<00:02:56.870> see<00:02:57.079> that<00:02:57.290> you

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
full time you're going to see that you

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.379 
full time you're going to see that you
have<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:58.840> high<00:02:59.840> shine<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.189> nails<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.700> that

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
have a high shine to the nails and that

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.319 
have a high shine to the nails and that
is<00:03:02.569> how<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.810> apply<00:03:03.139> the<00:03:03.170> resin<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:05.180> the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
is how you apply the resin to the

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.629 
is how you apply the resin to the
acrylic
