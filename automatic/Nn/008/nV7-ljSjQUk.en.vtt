00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
slider hands pert unlocked I get a

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.190 
slider hands pert unlocked I get a
thousand<00:02:21.609> XP<00:02:21.969> per<00:02:22.150> kill<00:02:22.180> instead<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.689> 500

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
thousand XP per kill instead of 500

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.110 
thousand XP per kill instead of 500
which<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.769> very<00:02:24.040> neat<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.280> once<00:02:24.609> you<00:02:24.760> unlock

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
which is very neat and once you unlock

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.179 
which is very neat and once you unlock
the<00:02:25.359> full<00:02:25.599> thing<00:02:25.870> at<00:02:26.109> the<00:02:26.500> eight<00:02:26.650> point<00:02:26.980> streak

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
the full thing at the eight point streak

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.649 
the full thing at the eight point streak
I<00:02:27.280> think<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.579> get<00:02:27.700> double<00:02:27.969> exp<00:02:28.329> for<00:02:28.480> every

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
I think you get double exp for every

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.509 
I think you get double exp for every
single<00:02:28.840> kill<00:02:29.079> I'm<00:02:29.290> not<00:02:29.650> too<00:02:29.889> sure<00:02:30.099> about<00:02:30.129> that

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
single kill I'm not too sure about that

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.729 
single kill I'm not too sure about that
but<00:02:30.579> whatever<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.629> it<00:02:31.840> certainly<00:02:32.349> gives

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
but whatever it is it certainly gives

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.520 
but whatever it is it certainly gives
you<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> lot<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.430> exp<00:02:33.579> not<00:02:34.480> only<00:02:34.689> that<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.139> while

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
you a lot of exp not only that but while

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.990 
you a lot of exp not only that but while

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
and more exp as a result of it and when

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.420 
and more exp as a result of it and when
you're<00:02:44.260> using<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.469> special<00:02:44.709> strike<00:02:45.069> package

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
you're using the special strike package

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.460 
you're using the special strike package
I<00:02:45.579> suggest<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.389> you<00:02:46.569> play<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:47.049> game<00:02:47.260> modes

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
I suggest that you play in game modes

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.839 
I suggest that you play in game modes
like<00:02:47.560> team<00:02:47.980> defender<00:02:48.340> or<00:02:48.459> kill<00:02:48.669> confirmed

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
like team defender or kill confirmed

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.420 
like team defender or kill confirmed
which<00:02:49.569> are<00:02:49.720> generally<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.230> two<00:02:50.439> highest<00:02:50.680> exp

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
which are generally the two highest exp

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.550 
which are generally the two highest exp
gaining<00:02:52.239> game<00:02:52.450> modes<00:02:52.689> maybe<00:02:53.200> because<00:02:53.379> you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
gaining game modes maybe because you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.869 
gaining game modes maybe because you
want<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.799> get<00:02:53.889> those<00:02:54.069> gun<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.400> kills<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.700> want

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
want to get those gun and kills you want

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.729 
want to get those gun and kills you want

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
to get those high killstreaks to unlock

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.550 
to get those high killstreaks to unlock
those<00:02:56.980> all<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.790> /<00:02:57.969> challenges<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.260> if<00:02:59.409> you're

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
those all the / challenges but if you're

30<00:03:29.709> or<00:03:29.949> so<00:03:30.220> ranks<00:03:30.669> mainly<00:03:31.329> because<00:03:31.479> at<00:03:31.840> these

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
30 or so ranks mainly because at these

a<00:04:04.000> weapon<00:04:04.509> in<00:04:04.689> that<00:04:05.049> prestige<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.739> kind<00:04:06.009> of

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
a weapon in that prestige it kind of

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.759 
a weapon in that prestige it kind of
maximizes<00:04:06.939> your<00:04:06.970> exp<00:04:07.720> count<00:04:08.079> per<00:04:08.290> kill<00:04:08.530> and

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
maximizes your exp count per kill and

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.649 
maximizes your exp count per kill and
it's<00:04:09.129> not<00:04:09.220> really<00:04:09.340> worth<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.759> to<00:04:09.849> use<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
it's not really worth it to use the

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.170 
it's not really worth it to use the
weapon<00:04:10.959> after<00:04:11.109> 500<00:04:11.709> kills<00:04:11.919> so<00:04:12.129> after<00:04:12.639> 500<00:04:13.030> kill

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180
