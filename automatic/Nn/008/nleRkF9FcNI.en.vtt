of tricky to get to this is my second

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.359 
of tricky to get to this is my second
time<00:00:14.160> doing<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.790> figured<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.509> better<00:00:16.109> share

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.279 

all<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:20.670> why<00:00:20.970> underneath<00:00:21.420> here's<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
all right why underneath here's the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.060 
all right why underneath here's the
starter<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:24.000> crankshaft<00:00:24.449> sensor<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.439> behind

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
starter the crankshaft sensor is behind

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.890 
starter the crankshaft sensor is behind
the<00:00:26.279> starter<00:00:26.930> takes<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.050> half-inch<00:00:28.590> socket<00:00:28.880> and

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
the starter takes a half-inch socket and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
the starter takes a half-inch socket and
you<00:00:30.900> want<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.199> job<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.590> start<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.009> down<00:00:32.189> which

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
you want a job to start it down which

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
you want a job to start it down which
I'm<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.059> now

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.250 

better<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.500> do<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.830> when<00:00:56.980> your<00:00:57.160> motors<00:00:57.550> cool

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
better to do it when your motors cool

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.150 
better to do it when your motors cool
it's<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.350> little<00:00:59.620> warm<00:00:59.770> right<00:01:00.100> now<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:03.040> I

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
it's a little warm right now and I

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:49.420 
it's a little warm right now and I
should<00:01:03.190> have<00:01:03.550> put<00:01:03.700> my<00:01:03.730> extension<00:01:04.420> on

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:02:32.259 

one<00:01:50.430> now

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.500 

as<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.569> remember<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:34.080> disconnect<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:35.510> ground

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
as you remember to disconnect the ground

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.160 
as you remember to disconnect the ground
cable<00:02:38.150> before<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.269> take<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:39.510> starter<00:02:40.049> out

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
cable before you take your starter out

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.610 
cable before you take your starter out
which<00:02:40.379> I<00:02:40.530> didn't<00:02:40.829> show<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:42.079> is<00:02:43.079> for<00:02:43.319> your<00:02:43.500> own

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.009 
which I didn't show that is for your own
safety<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.470> pull<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.829> starter<00:02:47.099> out<00:02:51.019> my

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
safety and you pull the starter out my

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:03.830 
safety and you pull the starter out my
starter<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.560> off<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.980> cot

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.070 

now<00:03:04.840> when<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.260> get<00:03:05.440> started<00:03:05.770> on<00:03:10.080> crankshaft

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
now when you get started on crankshaft

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.250 
now when you get started on crankshaft
sensor<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:14.290> located<00:03:14.350> right<00:03:15.160> above<00:03:16.110> there<00:03:17.110> it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
sensor is located right above there it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.360 
sensor is located right above there it
is<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.600> can<00:03:22.750> get<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.050> here<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:24.160> your

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
is see if I can get you here is your

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.060 
is see if I can get you here is your
crankshaft<00:03:27.060> something<00:03:28.440> looks<00:03:29.440> like<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.650> Texas

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
crankshaft something looks like a Texas

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.890 
crankshaft something looks like a Texas
7/16<00:03:31.060> Oh<00:03:31.830> which<00:03:32.830> is<00:03:33.010> right<00:03:33.820> underneath<00:03:34.300> here

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
7/16 Oh which is right underneath here

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.860 
7/16 Oh which is right underneath here
when<00:03:35.800> I<00:03:35.830> plug<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.460> you<00:03:36.550> can<00:03:36.700> see<00:03:42.570> one<00:03:43.570> bolt

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
when I plug it so you can see one bolt

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.790 
when I plug it so you can see one bolt
holds<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.350> in<00:03:45.870> run<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.900> pause<00:03:47.170> because<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.590> gotta

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
holds it in run a pause because I gotta

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.020 
holds it in run a pause because I gotta
get<00:03:48.390> my<00:03:49.390> wrench

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.500 

alright<00:03:58.980> how's<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.250> for<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.670> king<00:04:00.910> camera

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
alright how's that for the king camera

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.620 
alright how's that for the king camera
angles

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.690 

it<00:04:10.630> ended<00:04:11.290> up<00:04:11.410> being<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.830> 3/8<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:12.670> a

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
it ended up being a 3/8 so a

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:22.290 
it ended up being a 3/8 so a
10-millimeter<00:04:15.090> possibly<00:04:16.950> take<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.100> one<00:04:21.300> one

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
10-millimeter possibly take the one one

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:46.300 
10-millimeter possibly take the one one
nut<00:04:27.600> one<00:04:28.600> nut<00:04:28.630> on<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.740> name<00:04:29.950> take<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.550> off

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.680
