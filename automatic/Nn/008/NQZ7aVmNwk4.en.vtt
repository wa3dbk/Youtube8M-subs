00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
them quite newbie so I'm going to put

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.100 
them quite newbie so I'm going to put
this<00:04:48.200> around<00:04:49.200> their<00:04:49.500> base<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:51.300> not<00:04:51.810> let<00:04:51.990> them

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
this around their base and not let them

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.360 
this around their base and not let them
free<00:04:52.350> pretty<00:04:52.620> much<00:04:54.590> yeah<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.650> ain't<00:04:56.040> kind<00:04:56.280> of

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
through so I think that's they should be

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.020 
through so I think that's they should be
putting<00:05:00.840> on<00:05:01.050> their<00:05:01.440> bits<00:05:01.680> down<00:05:01.890> yeah<00:05:02.730> so
