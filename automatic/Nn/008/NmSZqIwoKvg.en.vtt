00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.499
 training guidelines to gain muscle mass 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.380
 was here some interesting guidelines for you to apply them centered session 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.939
 of training 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:10.690
 one 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.939
 increases the eccentric load 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:17.719
 the eccentric load is neither more nor less than the negative phase of a repetition 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.189
 when you do it slower increase is a little the weight in this interval the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.110
 fast fibers exert a greater action and therefore you have more 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.079
 possibilities to generate profits 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.970
 two 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.970
 increase the external load 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.120
 there are many people who do not know how to measure the right load for everyone 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.530
 sometimes they surpass what translates into poorly performed exercises and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.360
 important injuries 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.200
 On the other hand there are people who can try a little harder to achieve what 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.930
 What does he want 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.510
 but they just prefer to go from exercise to exercise and not focus on 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.930
 perform even one or two series intensely 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.070
 the important thing here is to begin to master deficiencies where you can 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.180
 perform at least 6 to 8 repetitions with some degree of difficulty 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.869
 3 increase the number of series per muscle group 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.770
 It is recommended at this point that if you decide to apply it to increase your 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.060
 number of series in training you do it in a targeted manner and with a 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 food focused on your pain pilot that you will need 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.319
 remember that the important thing is that you do not fall into categorical processes 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.990
 4 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.140
 reduce rest time between series 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.020
 this simply translates into an increase in the density of your 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.450
 training 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.000
 in less time you make a significant number of movements and with a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.210
 insured intensity as long as you keep the shortcomings that you are 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 used to handle in all exercises 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.880
 5 Focus on the basic exercises 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.840
 it is advisable to use the basic exercises and straight bars to win 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.150
 muscle mass 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.420
 the squat above any type of machine the basic price for 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.670
 the pectorals and the curry com / for the biceps 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.220
 they are undoubtedly the kings in their respective muscle groups 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:13.469
 6 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.869
 concentration 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.239
 the most important of all 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.379
 if you do not have the mental capacity to concentrate on what you are doing 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.620
 infocal raise all your energies in the muscles worked 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.780
 much less can be disciplined at the table and in the goals that you have 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.839
 proposed 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.519
 people look fat do not manage to increase their muscles spend time 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.409
 Winning and losing weight 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.709
 only for lack of a correct mental focus 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.340
 when you propose something 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 you just change your perspective on things and it's no longer difficult to start 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.920
 replace meals exercise a little leave bad habits aside 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.210
 everything is a matter of starting to be what we want and as if by magic the 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.959
 body will begin to show us the way 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.310
 it seems like a lie 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.590
 but it's really just a simple attitude change
