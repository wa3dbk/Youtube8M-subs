the<00:01:17.640> story<00:01:17.940> was<00:01:18.119> completely<00:01:18.240> unfair<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.050> spike

like<00:06:30.960> this<00:06:31.080> episode<00:06:31.530> that<00:06:31.710> much<00:06:31.979> there<00:06:32.460> could

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
like this episode that much there could

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.070 
like this episode that much there could
have<00:06:32.699> been<00:06:32.880> a<00:06:32.910> lot<00:06:33.150> more<00:06:33.180> elements<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:33.870> the

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
have been a lot more elements to the

have been a lot more elements to the
structure<00:06:34.500> and<00:06:34.530> story<00:06:34.919> better<00:06:35.160> at<00:06:35.669> the<00:06:35.820> very

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
structure and story better at the very

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.909 
structure and story better at the very
least<00:06:36.180> it's<00:06:36.479> not<00:06:36.780> just<00:06:37.080> for<00:06:37.260> sidekicks<00:06:37.740> I

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919

still<00:06:38.430> think<00:06:38.639> that<00:06:38.669> episode<00:06:39.240> was<00:06:39.449> awful<00:06:39.990> in

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
still think that episode was awful in

still think that episode was awful in
comparison<00:06:40.740> but<00:06:41.099> so<00:06:41.310> far<00:06:41.520> Rainbow<00:06:42.210> Falls<00:06:42.240> is
