extra<00:00:45.000> bowling<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.930> an<00:00:46.050> advantage<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
extra bowling can be an advantage I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
extra bowling can be an advantage I
actually<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.510> chance<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.140> helping

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
actually get a get a chance in helping

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually get a get a chance in helping
to<00:00:49.710> break<00:00:49.890> those<00:00:50.100> down<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.610> hopefully<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to break those down and hopefully get to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.100 
to break those down and hopefully get to
breaking<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> want<00:00:51.960> them

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
breaking down the way that I want them

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.880 
breaking down the way that I want them
so<00:00:52.789> advantage<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.559> look<00:00:55.739> at

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
so advantage is a way that you look at

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
so advantage is a way that you look at
it<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.850> looking<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.420> bowling<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> first
