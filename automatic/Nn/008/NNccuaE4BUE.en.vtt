00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
been using his HDMI analyzer a lot of 10

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.610 
been using his HDMI analyzer a lot of 10
points<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.059> problems<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.989> away<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
points of problems right away so you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.039 
points of problems right away so you
know<00:01:01.859> exactly<00:01:02.039> what's<00:01:02.579> wrong<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.180> saves<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049

hopefully when our devices get out there

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030 
hopefully when our devices get out there
they're<00:01:12.000> both<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> work<00:01:12.720> properly<00:01:13.560> when

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
they're both going to work properly when

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.670 
they're both going to work properly when
everybody's<00:01:14.640> TV<00:01:16.759> Dobey<00:01:17.759> bugs<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.259> HDMI

even<00:01:37.079> though<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> said<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.860> gonna<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.100> in

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
even though I said that was gonna be in

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.240 
even though I said that was gonna be in
the<00:01:38.220> video<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.700> isn't<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.600> oh<00:01:39.869> well<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.890> he

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the video it isn't so oh well so he

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.649 
the video it isn't so oh well so he
should<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.460> having<00:01:41.729> his<00:01:42.030> thing<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
should be having his thing out in a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.200 
should be having his thing out in a
couple<00:01:43.020> weeks<00:01:43.229> at<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> most<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.490> think
