that's right you heard it you switch
easy<00:00:18.789> colors<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:21.070> switcheasy<00:00:21.640> okay<00:00:22.119> now

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
easy colors from switcheasy okay now

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.359 
easy colors from switcheasy okay now
these<00:00:22.390> are<00:00:22.599> silicon<00:00:23.109> cases<00:00:23.409> and<00:00:23.769> let<00:00:24.009> me<00:00:24.099> start

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
these are silicon cases and let me start

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.050 
these are silicon cases and let me start
off<00:00:24.460> by<00:00:24.519> saying<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:26.199> not<00:00:26.259> a<00:00:26.560> fan<00:00:27.130> at<00:00:27.460> all<00:00:27.730> of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
off by saying I'm not a fan at all of

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.809 
off by saying I'm not a fan at all of
silicon<00:00:28.539> cases<00:00:28.839> I've<00:00:29.109> had<00:00:29.289> I<00:00:29.319> skins<00:00:29.859> I've<00:00:30.609> had

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:30.819 
silicon cases I've had I skins I've had

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:32.870 
silicon cases I've had I skins I've had
a<00:00:30.849> bunch<00:00:31.060> of<00:00:31.210> other<00:00:31.359> things<00:00:31.659> and<00:00:31.839> I<00:00:31.899> hated<00:00:32.200> them

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
a bunch of other things and I hated them

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.569 
a bunch of other things and I hated them
they<00:00:33.880> are<00:00:34.090> total<00:00:34.720> in<00:00:34.899> catchers<00:00:35.470> they<00:00:36.340> do<00:00:36.399> all

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
they are total in catchers they do all

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.569 
they are total in catchers they do all
this<00:00:36.940> stuff<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.269> I<00:00:37.510> just<00:00:37.780> hate<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.460> know

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
this stuff that I just hate and you know

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.569 
this stuff that I just hate and you know
the<00:00:40.210> colors<00:00:40.719> are<00:00:40.840> different<00:00:41.019> they<00:00:41.559> are<00:00:41.590> not

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
the colors are different they are not

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.009 
the colors are different they are not
lend<00:00:42.940> catchers<00:00:43.420> they're<00:00:43.570> actually

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
lend catchers they're actually

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.919 
lend catchers they're actually
surprisingly<00:00:44.760> went<00:00:45.760> detractors<00:00:46.570> in<00:00:46.719> right

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
surprisingly went detractors in right

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.630 
surprisingly went detractors in right
now<00:00:47.079> they're<00:00:47.260> not<00:00:47.440> they<00:00:47.920> get<00:00:48.039> some<00:00:48.250> lint<00:00:48.519> on

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
now they're not they get some lint on

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.700 
now they're not they get some lint on
the<00:00:48.879> back<00:00:49.059> but<00:00:49.870> that's<00:00:50.050> not<00:00:50.199> when<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.410> pull<00:00:50.620> it

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
the back but that's not when you pull it

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.900 
the back but that's not when you pull it
out<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:50.920> your<00:00:51.010> partner<00:00:51.339> when<00:00:51.429> you<00:00:51.550> lay<00:00:51.699> it<00:00:51.730> on

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
out of your partner when you lay it on

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.279 
out of your partner when you lay it on
the<00:00:52.030> ground<00:00:52.059> and<00:00:52.390> there's<00:00:52.600> some<00:00:52.750> dirt<00:00:53.260> and

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
the ground and there's some dirt and

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.290 
the ground and there's some dirt and
crap<00:00:53.679> like<00:00:53.829> that<00:00:53.890> sometimes<00:00:54.370> it<00:00:54.519> gets<00:00:54.609> all<00:00:55.179> you

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
crap like that sometimes it gets all you

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.319 
crap like that sometimes it gets all you
do<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:55.510> take<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.719> microfiber<00:00:56.100> wipe<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.280> off<00:00:57.429> and

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
do is take a microfiber wipe it off and

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.590 
do is take a microfiber wipe it off and
it<00:00:58.420> cuts<00:00:58.629> off<00:00:58.809> right<00:00:59.199> fine<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.289> can<00:01:02.469> also<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
it cuts off right fine you can also it's

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.290 
it cuts off right fine you can also it's
really<00:01:05.050> easy<00:01:05.230> to<00:01:05.350> put<00:01:05.590> on<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:05.830> off<00:01:06.280> okay<00:01:07.090> now

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
really easy to put on and off okay now

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.500 
really easy to put on and off okay now
one<00:01:07.630> thing<00:01:07.660> I'm<00:01:08.340> wondering<00:01:09.340> about<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.790> that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
one thing I'm wondering about is that

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.750 
one thing I'm wondering about is that
there<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.560> if<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:12.100> can<00:01:12.220> see<00:01:12.460> there<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.640> a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
there is if you can see there is a

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
there is if you can see there is a
little<00:01:13.030> bit<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.360> lint<00:01:13.570> I've<00:01:13.810> taken<00:01:14.230> it<00:01:14.410> off<00:01:14.590> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
little bit of lint I've taken it off I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.890 
little bit of lint I've taken it off I
take<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.810> off<00:01:17.020> probably<00:01:17.470> once<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:19.270> once<00:01:19.600> or<00:01:19.780> two

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
take it off probably once it once or two

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.190 
take it off probably once it once or two
times<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.230> day<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.670> clean<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.210> for<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> lot<00:01:23.140> of

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
times a day and clean it so for a lot of

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.720 
times a day and clean it so for a lot of
people<00:01:23.620> there<00:01:23.650> will<00:01:23.890> be<00:01:24.040> some<00:01:24.250> lint<00:01:24.490> that<00:01:24.550> you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
people there will be some lint that you

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.490 
people there will be some lint that you
get<00:01:24.910> caught<00:01:25.120> in<00:01:25.240> there<00:01:25.360> however<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:26.080> does<00:01:26.350> not

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
get caught in there however it does not

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.070 
get caught in there however it does not
stick<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.160> case<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.210> just<00:01:28.390> gets<00:01:28.540> inside

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
stick to the case it just gets inside

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.260 
stick to the case it just gets inside
the<00:01:29.140> case<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:30.130> silicon<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.970> actual

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
the case the silicon and the actual

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.300 
the case the silicon and the actual
phone<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:32.170> it's<00:01:32.320> not<00:01:32.500> you<00:01:32.740> just<00:01:32.920> take<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.100> wipe

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
phone and it's not you just take a wipe

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.070 
phone and it's not you just take a wipe
down<00:01:33.490> every<00:01:33.730> night<00:01:33.910> news<00:01:34.060> right<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.900> case

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
down every night news right the case

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.680 
down every night news right the case
itself<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.770> very<00:01:35.830> very<00:01:36.520> nice<00:01:36.790> this<00:01:37.090> this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
itself is very very nice this this

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.250 
itself is very very nice this this
texture<00:01:38.410> is<00:01:38.620> really<00:01:38.890> nice<00:01:39.190> I<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:40.540> like<00:01:40.930> the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
texture is really nice I really like the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.080 
texture is really nice I really like the
quality<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.190> build<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:42.760> there's<00:01:43.030> no

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
quality to build of this there's no

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.920 
quality to build of this there's no
there<00:01:43.780> was<00:01:43.900> no<00:01:44.050> flash<00:01:44.380> in<00:01:44.410> there<00:01:44.850> perfectly

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
there was no flash in there perfectly

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.740 
there was no flash in there perfectly
it's<00:01:46.930> just<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.350> really<00:01:47.590> nice<00:01:47.920> silicon<00:01:48.850> now<00:01:49.390> it's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
it's just a really nice silicon now it's

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.140 
it's just a really nice silicon now it's
it's<00:01:50.050> thick<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.740> mean<00:01:51.160> this<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.520> not<00:01:51.700> your

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
it's thick I mean this is not your

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.260 
it's thick I mean this is not your
average<00:01:52.470> silicon<00:01:53.470> if<00:01:53.620> you<00:01:53.710> can<00:01:53.890> see<00:01:54.100> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
average silicon if you can see that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.940 
average silicon if you can see that
that's<00:01:55.270> about<00:01:55.660> how<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.080> thickness<00:01:56.650> is<00:01:56.800> so

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
that's about how the thickness is so

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.220 
that's about how the thickness is so
it's<00:01:57.070> pretty<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:58.180> pretty<00:01:58.300> hefty<00:01:58.870> duty<00:01:59.200> I

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
it's pretty it's pretty hefty duty I

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.780 
it's pretty it's pretty hefty duty I
mean<00:01:59.470> there's<00:01:59.620> no<00:01:59.800> ripping<00:02:00.220> through<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:00.580> at

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
mean there's no ripping through this at

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.450 
mean there's no ripping through this at
all<00:02:02.220> now<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.250> few<00:02:03.640> things<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.120> mention<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.950> is<00:02:06.430> a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
all now a few things to mention it is a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.199 
all now a few things to mention it is a
little<00:02:07.060> bit<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.250> sticky<00:02:09.519> because<00:02:09.910> it's<00:02:10.119> a

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
little bit it is sticky because it's a

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.000 
little bit it is sticky because it's a
silicon<00:02:10.599> case<00:02:10.629> not<00:02:11.110> like<00:02:11.319> sticky<00:02:11.770> when<00:02:11.920> you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
silicon case not like sticky when you

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.860 
silicon case not like sticky when you
feel<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.400> but<00:02:12.790> when<00:02:12.940> you're<00:02:13.090> sliding<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.690> it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
feel it but when you're sliding it it

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.920 
feel it but when you're sliding it it
sticks<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.590> table<00:02:14.770> so<00:02:15.580> there's<00:02:16.090> no<00:02:16.240> that's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
sticks to the table so there's no that's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.690 
sticks to the table so there's no that's
light<00:02:17.079> action<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.709> get<00:02:17.859> with<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.129> rebel

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
light action you get with the rebel

light action you get with the rebel
we're<00:02:18.819> just<00:02:19.090> pulling<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.599> across<00:02:19.689> the<00:02:19.870> table

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
we're just pulling it across the table

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.030 
we're just pulling it across the table
it<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.840> what<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.049> does<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.560> does<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
it that's what it does it does have the

lay on the table design not a ton but a

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.890 
lay on the table design not a ton but a
little<00:02:27.069> bit<00:02:27.219> and<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.120> good<00:02:28.269> thing<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.510> it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
little bit and that the good thing is it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.170 
little bit and that the good thing is it
is<00:02:29.019> super<00:02:29.590> easy<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.920> put<00:02:30.159> on<00:02:30.189> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> great

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
is super easy to put on this is a great

throw away case I mean if something
happens<00:02:32.950> all<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.549> do<00:02:33.670> slide<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.250> i

happens all you do slide it in and i
found<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.730> fastest<00:02:37.389> method<00:02:37.629> is<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.530> flip

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
found the fastest method is to flip

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.000 
found the fastest method is to flip
these<00:02:38.950> corners<00:02:39.489> backwards<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.650> then<00:02:41.650> lift

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
these corners backwards and then lift

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.149 
these corners backwards and then lift
over<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.549> phone<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:43.590> put<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.709> there<00:02:44.859> so

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
over the phone and just put it there so

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.569 
over the phone and just put it there so
lift<00:02:45.909> over<00:02:46.359> and<00:02:46.629> my<00:02:46.750> fingers<00:02:47.170> are<00:02:47.379> not<00:02:47.620> my

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
hands aren't washed that's why I'm

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.289 
hands aren't washed that's why I'm
leaving<00:02:50.019> away<00:02:50.290> fingerprints<00:02:51.120> anyway<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.180> you

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
leaving away fingerprints anyway so you

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.849 
leaving away fingerprints anyway so you
just<00:02:52.450> slip<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.939> and<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:56.200> pretty<00:02:56.470> easy<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
just slip it in and it's pretty easy and

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.069 
just slip it in and it's pretty easy and
it<00:02:56.980> lines<00:02:57.220> up<00:02:57.400> perfectly<00:02:57.819> every<00:02:58.030> time<00:02:58.120> Cameron

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
it lines up perfectly every time Cameron

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.899 
it lines up perfectly every time Cameron
all<00:02:59.169> is<00:02:59.319> perfectly<00:02:59.919> aligned<00:03:00.129> if<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.549> can<00:03:00.730> see

love these this this feels more like a
button<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:04.019> can<00:04:05.019> hear<00:04:05.229> that<00:04:05.699> feels<00:04:06.699> more<00:04:07.000> like

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
button you can hear that feels more like

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.509 
button you can hear that feels more like
a<00:04:07.269> button<00:04:07.750> than<00:04:08.229> without<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.919> case<00:04:09.129> I<00:04:09.370> mean

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
a button than without the case I mean

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.240 
a button than without the case I mean
when<00:04:09.669> I<00:04:09.699> took<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:10.090> case<00:04:10.299> off<00:04:10.509> and<00:04:10.919> was<00:04:11.919> pushing

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
when I took the case off and was pushing

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.879 
when I took the case off and was pushing
it<00:04:12.340> down<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:12.909> felt<00:04:13.720> like<00:04:13.840> less<00:04:14.319> of<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.650> button

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
it down it felt like less of a button

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.860 
it down it felt like less of a button
than<00:04:15.489> with<00:04:15.759> the<00:04:15.939> case<00:04:16.120> on<00:04:16.269> which<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.599> kind<00:04:16.780> of

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
than with the case on which is kind of

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.529 
than with the case on which is kind of
easy<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.709> does<00:04:17.889> not<00:04:18.130> slide<00:04:18.459> around<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:19.299> stick

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
easy it does not slide around you stick

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.749 
easy it does not slide around you stick
it<00:04:19.659> on<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:19.930> it's<00:04:20.079> sticking<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:20.889> you<00:04:21.579> have<00:04:21.669> to

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
it on and it's sticking like you have to

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.490 
it on and it's sticking like you have to
try<00:04:22.030> really<00:04:22.240> hard<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.659> it<00:04:22.750> even<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.229> pops

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
try really hard and it even just pops

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.529 
try really hard and it even just pops
back<00:04:23.770> into<00:04:24.009> place<00:04:24.220> so<00:04:24.820> in<00:04:24.909> terms<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.330> it's

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
back into place so in terms of that it's

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.440 
back into place so in terms of that it's
a<00:04:25.659> really<00:04:26.229> good-looking<00:04:26.560> case<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:28.270> some

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
a really good-looking case and some

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.839 
a really good-looking case and some
negatives<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.900> found<00:04:29.139> its<00:04:29.889> silicon<00:04:30.370> so

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
negatives I found its silicon so

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.119 
negatives I found its silicon so
I mean<00:04:31.029> you<00:04:31.119> get<00:04:31.240> some<00:04:31.479> lint<00:04:31.959> not<00:04:32.379> a<00:04:32.409> ton<00:04:32.860> at

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
I mean you get some lint not a ton at

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.040 
I mean you get some lint not a ton at
all<00:04:33.399> by<00:04:33.819> any<00:04:34.029> means<00:04:34.330> but<00:04:35.159> enough<00:04:36.159> to<00:04:36.429> make<00:04:36.459> you

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
all by any means but enough to make you

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.359 
all by any means but enough to make you
pull<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.199> out<00:04:38.289> every<00:04:38.619> night<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.800> clean<00:04:39.189> it

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:39.369 
pull it out every night and clean it

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:42.269 
pull it out every night and clean it
okay<00:04:39.759> so<00:04:40.389> I<00:04:40.839> mean<00:04:41.110> there's<00:04:41.319> a<00:04:41.379> few<00:04:41.679> things<00:04:41.860> that

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
okay so I mean there's a few things that

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.540 
okay so I mean there's a few things that
are<00:04:42.399> down<00:04:42.610> right<00:04:42.759> now<00:04:42.909> one<00:04:43.149> other<00:04:43.179> thing<00:04:43.689> is

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
are down right now one other thing is

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.329 
are down right now one other thing is
when<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.669> take<00:04:45.909> it<00:04:46.089> off<00:04:46.679> should<00:04:47.679> probably

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:48.339 
when you take it off should probably

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:50.909 
when you take it off should probably
take<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.610> all<00:04:48.729> your<00:04:48.939> ports<00:04:49.240> out<00:04:49.509> but<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.319> don't

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
take you all your ports out but I don't

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.779 
take you all your ports out but I don't
anyway<00:04:51.699> so<00:04:52.289> if<00:04:53.289> you'll<00:04:53.889> notice<00:04:54.129> you<00:04:54.490> can't

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
anyway so if you'll notice you can't

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.239 
anyway so if you'll notice you can't
because<00:04:55.179> my<00:04:55.209> screen<00:04:55.659> shield<00:04:55.869> is<00:04:56.080> nasty<00:04:56.589> if<00:04:57.069> i

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
because my screen shield is nasty if i

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.260 
because my screen shield is nasty if i
pipe<00:04:57.550> my<00:04:57.580> screen<00:04:58.089> shield<00:04:58.300> off<00:04:58.539> you<00:04:59.199> can<00:04:59.439> notice

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
pipe my screen shield off you can notice

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.139 
pipe my screen shield off you can notice
that<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:02.020> screen<00:05:02.319> shield<00:05:02.589> is<00:05:02.860> pulled<00:05:03.249> up<00:05:03.519> now

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:04.149 
that the screen shield is pulled up now

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:05.699 
that the screen shield is pulled up now
this<00:05:04.300> is<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.539> switch<00:05:04.839> easy<00:05:05.050> this<00:05:05.319> is<00:05:05.379> the<00:05:05.589> one

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:05.709 
this is a switch easy this is the one

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:07.290 
this is a switch easy this is the one
they<00:05:05.830> include<00:05:06.189> and<00:05:06.429> they<00:05:06.519> are<00:05:06.639> great<00:05:06.939> screen

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
they include and they are great screen

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.489 
they include and they are great screen
shields<00:05:07.719> there's<00:05:07.929> a<00:05:07.990> little<00:05:08.229> bit<00:05:08.319> right<00:05:08.469> there

00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:08.499 
shields there's a little bit right there

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:12.239 
shields there's a little bit right there
a<00:05:08.919> little<00:05:09.519> bit<00:05:09.699> right<00:05:09.879> there<00:05:09.939> and<00:05:10.919> that's<00:05:11.919> it

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:12.249 
a little bit right there and that's it

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.589 
a little bit right there and that's it
but<00:05:13.229> you<00:05:14.229> can<00:05:14.439> notice<00:05:14.709> that<00:05:15.550> when<00:05:15.819> you<00:05:15.969> do<00:05:16.209> slip

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
but you can notice that when you do slip

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.350 
but you can notice that when you do slip
those<00:05:16.899> when<00:05:17.139> you<00:05:17.259> lift<00:05:17.529> them<00:05:17.709> over<00:05:18.209> when<00:05:19.209> you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
those when you lift them over when you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.239 
those when you lift them over when you
lift<00:05:19.659> the<00:05:19.839> case<00:05:20.050> over<00:05:20.319> if<00:05:20.559> that's<00:05:20.889> the<00:05:21.099> way<00:05:21.189> you

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:21.249 
lift the case over if that's the way you

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:24.269 
lift the case over if that's the way you
do<00:05:21.459> it<00:05:21.490> it<00:05:22.389> tugs<00:05:22.959> on<00:05:23.289> that<00:05:23.469> screen<00:05:23.800> shield<00:05:24.009> when

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:24.279 
do it it tugs on that screen shield when

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.969 
do it it tugs on that screen shield when
it's<00:05:24.429> it<00:05:24.729> pushes<00:05:25.479> in<00:05:25.659> so<00:05:26.229> it<00:05:26.439> lifts<00:05:26.800> up<00:05:26.949> the

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
it's it pushes in so it lifts up the

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.100 
it's it pushes in so it lifts up the
shield<00:05:27.339> and<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.999> mean<00:05:28.179> that's<00:05:28.300> not<00:05:28.599> that<00:05:28.809> big<00:05:29.050> a

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
shield and I mean that's not that big a

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.809 
shield and I mean that's not that big a
deal<00:05:29.199> if<00:05:29.649> you<00:05:29.830> leave<00:05:30.009> it<00:05:30.069> on<00:05:30.249> if<00:05:30.459> this<00:05:30.580> is<00:05:30.699> your

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
deal if you leave it on if this is your

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.509 
deal if you leave it on if this is your
primary<00:05:31.059> case<00:05:31.479> that's<00:05:31.719> fine<00:05:32.019> but<00:05:32.919> if<00:05:33.099> it's<00:05:33.309> not

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:33.519 
primary case that's fine but if it's not

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.369 
primary case that's fine but if it's not
your<00:05:33.729> primary<00:05:33.909> case<00:05:34.330> that<00:05:34.749> will<00:05:34.899> bother<00:05:35.110> you
