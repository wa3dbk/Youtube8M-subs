00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.000
 up here 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.560
 the part of the white and 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.580
 analysts who have white part and 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.920
 another of another color has a pair of wings 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.870

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.300
 crest the two wings them a little more 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.720
 Fathers have a little heart and have their 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.610
 little body although I was looking between 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.560
 when I'm always mitigating well the 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.989
 another place areas in hen one that is 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.080
 lengthened because the ones that we were all 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.640
 doing so far are like this 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.250
 which we were doing are 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.870
 well then obviously the toaster in 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.850
 the microwave and I had precious 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.590
 but in the blender or mode 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.020
 They were very fat, that's why it was that 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.000
 it was decided to make the other board that is 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.530
 you see then 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.049
 We started working to prepare the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.170
 applications we show us what 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.409
 next we have the room we have the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.099
 Crest the little heart the whole body 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.110
 and the little head here after the 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.810
 I did because one the measure in practice 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.849
 is that things appear, I said 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.860
 what is this these complete in shape 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.900
 pear perfectly what you fold and 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.030
 because anyway afterwards 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.769
 the other piece on top so you know 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.070
 that happened to me when the steps and in 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.710
 truth they let you complete be leaving 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.690
 good friend once they have 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.460
 marked all the pieces are going to go to the 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.560
 machine to sew it now you will see me 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.849
 a trick I can show you my students 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.919
 Wednesday 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.080
 you have to grab the fabric of 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.229
 cotton and support it on the pattern that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.639
 you take them in the guide decal the 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.800
 figure that already has an increase of 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.499
 position and decide to put the TV that you 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.509
 they are going to put and immediately support 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:48.300
 so they do not have so much pattern 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:51.240
 cardboard or anything like that will capture 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.430
 directly from your leaf pattern 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.980

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.630

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.440
 it comes out right on the screen that they are 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.440

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:11.280
 ok then we go to the machine 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.590
 sew on ready couples so they were very 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.199
