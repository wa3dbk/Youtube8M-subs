each<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.389> those<00:02:40.480> parts<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:50.560> let's<00:02:50.799> start

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
each of those parts now let's start

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.990 
each of those parts now let's start
assembling<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.639> frame<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.859> diagram<00:02:54.370> showing

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
assembling the frame the diagram showing

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.199 
assembling the frame the diagram showing
which<00:02:55.150> parts<00:02:55.510> go<00:02:55.689> where<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.169> in<00:02:56.439> the<00:02:56.530> manual<00:02:57.209> as

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
which parts go where is in the manual as

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.839 
which parts go where is in the manual as
you<00:02:58.540> piece<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.810> together<00:02:59.400> you'll<00:03:00.400> start<00:03:00.700> to

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
you piece it together you'll start to

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.839 
you piece it together you'll start to
see<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.620> beginning<00:03:03.099> of<00:03:03.250> your<00:03:03.489> Seaport

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
see the beginning of your Seaport

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.209 
see the beginning of your Seaport
vehicle<00:03:04.329> your<00:03:05.290> manuals<00:03:05.739> going<00:03:05.919> to<00:03:05.980> show<00:03:06.159> you

vehicle your manuals going to show you

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.530 
vehicle your manuals going to show you
exactly<00:03:06.879> how<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.299> put<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:07.689> together<00:03:09.540> now

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
exactly how to put this together now

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.000 
exactly how to put this together now
that<00:03:10.750> we've<00:03:10.870> completed<00:03:11.049> putting<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.769> frame

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
that we've completed putting the frame

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.580 
that we've completed putting the frame
together<00:03:12.219> we<00:03:12.909> need<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.120> drill<00:03:13.480> our<00:03:13.719> vent<00:03:14.349> and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
together we need to drill our vent and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.890 
together we need to drill our vent and
drain<00:03:14.919> holes<00:03:15.219> in<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.669> frame<00:03:15.909> to<00:03:16.540> allow<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
drain holes in the frame to allow the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.750 
drain holes in the frame to allow the
water<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.500> come<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.129> and<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.549> frame

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
water to come in and out of the frame

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.089 
water to come in and out of the frame
it's<00:03:19.629> amazing<00:03:20.109> how<00:03:20.260> much<00:03:20.469> a<00:03:20.530> little<00:03:20.799> bit<00:03:21.010> of

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
it's amazing how much a little bit of

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.890 
it's amazing how much a little bit of
air<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.519> frame<00:03:21.790> makes<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.209> big<00:03:22.449> difference

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
air in the frame makes a big difference

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.920 
air in the frame makes a big difference
to<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.199> fact<00:03:23.409> that<00:03:23.500> won't<00:03:23.799> go<00:03:24.040> underwater<00:03:24.400> to

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
to the fact that won't go underwater to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.970 
to the fact that won't go underwater to
do<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.139> we'll<00:03:26.709> use<00:03:26.919> a<00:03:26.949> drill<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.879> drill<00:03:28.980> a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
do that we'll use a drill and drill a

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.800 
do that we'll use a drill and drill a
hole<00:03:30.219> in<00:03:30.669> each<00:03:30.849> of<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.060> high<00:03:31.209> points<00:03:31.629> and<00:03:31.719> low

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
hole in each of the high points and low

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.319 
hole in each of the high points and low
points<00:03:32.079> in<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.829> frame<00:03:33.040> start<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:34.120> the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
points in the frame start with the

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.170 
points in the frame start with the
smaller<00:03:35.189> 3/32<00:03:36.189> drill<00:03:36.220> bit<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.699> drill<00:03:36.759> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
smaller 3/32 drill bit and drill the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.270 
smaller 3/32 drill bit and drill the
hole<00:03:37.359> we'll<00:03:38.049> go<00:03:38.229> ahead<00:03:38.349> and<00:03:38.500> do<00:03:38.739> that<00:03:38.919> in<00:03:39.159> all

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
hole we'll go ahead and do that in all

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.099 
hole we'll go ahead and do that in all
of<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.579> high<00:03:39.729> spots<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.419> then<00:03:40.780> we'll<00:03:40.900> come

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
of the high spots and then we'll come

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.379 
of the high spots and then we'll come
back<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.620> drill<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.459> larger<00:03:42.909> quarter<00:03:43.239> inch

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
back and drill the larger quarter inch

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.210 
back and drill the larger quarter inch
hole<00:03:43.629> in<00:03:44.109> each<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.530> pilot<00:03:44.889> holes<00:03:45.069> that

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
hole in each of the pilot holes that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:54.150 
hole in each of the pilot holes that
we've<00:03:45.370> given<00:03:45.579> ourselves

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:03.390 

you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.460 

now<00:04:04.400> once<00:04:04.790> we've<00:04:04.940> done<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.180> in<00:04:05.660> all<00:04:06.140> of<00:04:06.290> our

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
now once we've done that in all of our

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.870 
now once we've done that in all of our
areas<00:04:09.700> we'll<00:04:10.700> take<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.239> larger<00:04:11.810> drill<00:04:11.959> bit

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
areas we'll take the larger drill bit

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.900 
areas we'll take the larger drill bit
and<00:04:14.709> open<00:04:15.709> up<00:04:15.770> each<00:04:16.010> one<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.280> these<00:04:16.340> holes<00:04:16.609> to

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
and open up each one of these holes to

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.680 
and open up each one of these holes to
allow<00:04:17.359> better<00:04:17.870> flow<00:04:19.060> by<00:04:20.060> drilling<00:04:20.510> the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
allow better flow by drilling the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.030 
allow better flow by drilling the
smaller<00:04:21.139> holes<00:04:21.440> first<00:04:23.440> we've<00:04:24.440> ensured<00:04:24.800> that

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
smaller holes first we've ensured that

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.730 
smaller holes first we've ensured that
the<00:04:25.310> drill<00:04:25.610> bit<00:04:25.790> won't<00:04:25.970> jump<00:04:26.330> out<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.740> we'll

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
the drill bit won't jump out and we'll

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:45.190 
the drill bit won't jump out and we'll
be<00:04:27.770> much<00:04:28.370> safer<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:29.240> drill<00:04:29.480> these<00:04:29.600> holes
