00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
and really that's it so now i'm going to

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.979 
and really that's it so now i'm going to
refrigerate<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.069> about<00:02:44.370> an<00:02:44.730> hour<00:02:44.989> okay

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
so now the hour is up and maybe i might

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.300 
so now the hour is up and maybe i might
have<00:02:48.690> been<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> little<00:02:49.410> misleading<00:02:49.769> when<00:02:50.250> I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
really you can get by which is flipping

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.610 
really you can get by which is flipping
them<00:02:57.120> over<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:57.870> what<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.049> pancake<00:02:58.470> so
