00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.170
 added to firefighters 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.949
 firefighters are probably yes but in 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.239
 scene guys but what do you want to do free 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.239

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.570

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.620

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.800

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.120
 no instead 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.480
 they are cutting the rope 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.530

 we are promised my chess game 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.039
 I delayed my hernanes ii 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.039
 for chess games I don't know but 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.179
 certainly delaying a euro is very serious 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.270
 unless you have a good one 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.060
 explanation I believe that diamonds 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.729
 stolen has mate checkmate 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.340
 inside that suitcase drained and a 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:10.860
 look because we have nothing to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.230
 hide me nothing but here I only see of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.540
 normal scheck the normals 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.590
 apparently but made up to the evidence 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.440
 but those who want to come I did not know I 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.880
 I knew you knew it indeed sent 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.000
 your assistant to recover that 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.459
 piece 32 stolen diamonds just how many 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.019
 they are the chess pawns so that's it 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.920
 the rat gang got away with it 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.519
