here and take a look at the examples the
first<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> menu<00:00:51.870> structure<00:00:52.289> done

first one is just a menu structure done
for<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> Dan's<00:00:53.760> end<00:00:54.149> menu<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.960> go

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
for a Dan's end menu and if we go

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.630 
for a Dan's end menu and if we go
control-enter<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.699> that

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.590 

there's<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.540> effect<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.200> as<00:01:03.380> I<00:01:03.590> approached

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
there's the effect so as I approached

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.830 
there's the effect so as I approached
inventor<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.790> come<00:01:07.790> back<00:01:07.970> down<00:01:08.030> by<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.630> way

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
inventor and come back down by the way

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.420 
inventor and come back down by the way
these<00:01:09.080> are<00:01:09.140> hot<00:01:09.530> even<00:01:09.979> though<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.250> mouse

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
these are hot even though the mouse

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.280 
these are hot even though the mouse
doesn't<00:01:10.460> show<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.060> little<00:01:11.360> finger<00:01:11.780> that's<00:01:11.960> just

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
doesn't show a little finger that's just

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.920 
doesn't show a little finger that's just
the<00:01:12.440> screen<00:01:12.619> capture<00:01:13.159> program<00:01:13.659> so<00:01:15.430> that's<00:01:16.430> the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
the screen capture program so that's the

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.650 
the screen capture program so that's the
sort<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:17.990> more<00:01:18.200> elegant<00:01:18.800> flow<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.360> now

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
sort of more elegant flow of it now

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.280 
sort of more elegant flow of it now
let's<00:01:20.810> take<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.170> look<00:01:21.290> at<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.910> flutter<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:27.140> is

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
let's take a look at the flutter this is

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.410 
let's take a look at the flutter this is
making<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.710> noise<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.250> we<00:01:28.369> are<00:01:28.670> picking<00:01:28.970> up<00:01:29.240> on

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
making a noise that we are picking up on

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.060 
making a noise that we are picking up on
the<00:01:29.450> screen<00:01:29.780> capture<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> little<00:01:30.740> sort<00:01:31.009> of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
the screen capture a little sort of

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.540 
the screen capture a little sort of
fluttering<00:01:31.690> hummingbird<00:01:33.190> you<00:01:34.190> see<00:01:34.399> how<00:01:34.490> that

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
fluttering hummingbird you see how that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.160 
fluttering hummingbird you see how that
seems<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:35.090> little<00:01:35.119> bit<00:01:35.479> like<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.750> hummingbird

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
seems a little bit like a hummingbird

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.100 
seems a little bit like a hummingbird
now<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.710> there's<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.399> 3d<00:01:37.850> parallax<00:01:38.330> effect

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
now and there's the 3d parallax effect

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.300 
now and there's the 3d parallax effect
that<00:01:39.259> we're<00:01:39.380> getting<00:01:39.500> these<00:01:39.770> are<00:01:39.950> just<00:01:40.190> a

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
that we're getting these are just a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.550 
that we're getting these are just a
bunch<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.640> concentric<00:01:41.240> circles<00:01:41.810> shot<00:01:42.140> all<00:01:42.410> the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
bunch of concentric circles shot all the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.380 
bunch of concentric circles shot all the
way<00:01:42.680> back<00:01:42.890> in<00:01:43.280> NZ<00:01:44.180> depth<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.750> as<00:01:45.500> we<00:01:45.830> move<00:01:46.390> it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
way back in NZ depth and as we move it

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.210 
way back in NZ depth and as we move it
follows<00:01:47.840> an<00:01:47.990> hummingbird<00:01:48.440> also<00:01:48.770> gives<00:01:49.009> the

dans<00:02:33.200> n<00:02:34.450> file<00:02:35.450> over<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:35.810> has<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.790> a

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
dans n file over here has this is a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.869 
dans n file over here has this is a
holder<00:02:38.799> right<00:02:39.799> here<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:41.299> we<00:02:41.510> take<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.780> look

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
holder right here and if we take a look

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.869 
holder right here and if we take a look
say<00:02:43.879> double<00:02:44.209> click<00:02:44.390> into<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.780> holder<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
say double click into the holder and

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:55.509 
say double click into the holder and
open<00:02:46.879> up<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.030> library<00:02:52.660> do<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.860> want<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.160> see<00:02:55.310> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
open up the library do I want to see the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.690 
open up the library do I want to see the
properties<00:02:55.970> panel<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.170> if<00:02:58.099> I<00:02:58.250> click<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.519> this

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
properties panel so if I click on this

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.780 
properties panel so if I click on this
one<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.450> has<00:02:59.659> a<00:02:59.690> Zed<00:03:00.230> right<00:03:00.709> here<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.159> available

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
one it has a Zed right here is available

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.500 
one it has a Zed right here is available
as<00:03:01.909> that<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.150> zero<00:03:02.569> where<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.730> 1995<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> Zed

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
as that of zero where the 1995 is a Zed

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.780 
as that of zero where the 1995 is a Zed
of<00:03:05.660> 500<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:06.799> going<00:03:07.040> deeper<00:03:07.519> into<00:03:07.670> a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
of 500 so that's going deeper into a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.839 
of 500 so that's going deeper into a
page<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.420> finally<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.530> back<00:03:09.980> background

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
page and finally the back background

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.479 
page and finally the back background
there<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.420> can<00:03:12.019> click<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.379> there<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
there I can click it there we go the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.990 
there I can click it there we go the
background<00:03:13.940> has<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> Zed<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.750> 1000<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.459> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
background has a Zed of 1000 so the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000 
background has a Zed of 1000 so the
background<00:03:17.510> will<00:03:17.660> hardly<00:03:17.959> shift<00:03:18.349> now<00:03:18.769> when<00:03:18.980> I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
background will hardly shift now when I

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.789 
background will hardly shift now when I
put<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.489> in<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.940> set<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.780> 1,000<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.650> got

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
put that in and set it to 1,000 it got

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.520 
put that in and set it to 1,000 it got
really<00:03:21.980> small<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.459> then<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.030> had<00:03:23.299> to<00:03:23.510> set<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
really small so then I had to set the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.300 
really small so then I had to set the
scale<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:27.370> scales<00:03:29.019> 287<00:03:30.099> whereas<00:03:31.099> the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
scale of that scales 287 whereas the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.220 
scale of that scales 287 whereas the
scale<00:03:31.609> of<00:03:31.640> our<00:03:32.239> front<00:03:32.599> is<00:03:32.870> probably<00:03:33.470> just<00:03:33.970> 100

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
scale of our front is probably just 100

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.229 
scale of our front is probably just 100
so<00:03:36.230> as<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.650> goes<00:03:36.829> further<00:03:37.069> back<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:37.489> increase

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
so as it goes further back you increase

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.180 
so as it goes further back you increase
the<00:03:38.630> scale<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.260> then<00:03:39.349> it<00:03:39.500> all<00:03:39.620> kind<00:03:39.889> of<00:03:40.010> comes

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
the scale and then it all kind of comes

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.319 
the scale and then it all kind of comes
together<00:03:40.750> like<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.730> back<00:03:43.730> in<00:03:43.940> our<00:03:44.060> code

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
together like this and back in our code

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.030 
together like this and back in our code
that<00:03:45.230> was<00:03:45.410> all<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.829> holder<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:47.889> then<00:03:48.889> we

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
that was all in the holder and then we

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.819 
that was all in the holder and then we
tell<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.549> shift<00:03:49.760> about<00:03:50.090> 30<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.870> X<00:03:51.049> about

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
tell it to shift about 30 in the X about

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.759 
tell it to shift about 30 in the X about
10<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.430> Y<00:03:52.579> that's<00:03:53.030> less<00:03:53.299> than<00:03:53.329> the<00:03:53.569> Y<00:03:53.769> 18

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
10 in the Y that's less than the Y 18

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.470 
10 in the Y that's less than the Y 18
and<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.040> depth<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.519> as<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:55.819> go<00:03:55.970> up<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.359> gets

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
and the depth so as I go up it gets

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.629 
and the depth so as I go up it gets
closer<00:03:56.870> as<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.349> go<00:03:57.500> down<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.980> gets<00:03:58.099> farther<00:03:58.400> away

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
closer as I go down it gets farther away

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.629 
closer as I go down it gets farther away
and<00:03:59.060> then<00:03:59.959> here's<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.620> damping<00:04:01.190> this<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.489> how

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
and then here's the damping this is how

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.430 
and then here's the damping this is how
quickly<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:03.549> feature<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:05.090> clip<00:04:05.989> follows

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
quickly the feature the clip follows

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.789 
quickly the feature the clip follows
your<00:04:07.069> your<00:04:08.030> mouse<00:04:08.209> if<00:04:08.480> it's<00:04:08.630> set<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:08.870> 1<00:04:09.169> it<00:04:09.319> it

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
your your mouse if it's set to 1 it it

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.190 
your your mouse if it's set to 1 it it
goes<00:04:10.250> immediately<00:04:10.549> and<00:04:10.940> follows<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.329> mouse<00:04:11.599> if

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
goes immediately and follows a mouse if

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.710 
goes immediately and follows a mouse if
it's<00:04:12.349> set<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.590> 0<00:04:12.919> won't<00:04:13.250> move<00:04:13.400> at<00:04:13.579> all

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
it's set to 0 won't move at all

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.710 
it's set to 0 won't move at all
in<00:04:14.810> flutter<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:16.130> same<00:04:16.400> thing<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.690> happening

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
in flutter the same thing is happening

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.770 
in flutter the same thing is happening
here<00:04:18.350> there's<00:04:18.980> our<00:04:19.220> hummingbird<00:04:19.700> this<00:04:20.540> time

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
here there's our hummingbird this time

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.780 
here there's our hummingbird this time
we've<00:04:20.989> got<00:04:21.200> much<00:04:21.980> bigger<00:04:22.280> x<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.780> y<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.010> z

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
we've got much bigger x and y and z

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.150 
we've got much bigger x and y and z
movement<00:04:26.420> we<00:04:26.990> still<00:04:27.200> have<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.500> damping<00:04:27.890> set

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
movement we still have the damping set

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.450 
movement we still have the damping set
the<00:04:28.280> same<00:04:28.550> now<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.390> holder<00:04:29.870> is<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.920> bunch<00:04:31.310> of

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
the same now the holder is a bunch of

the same now the holder is a bunch of
this<00:04:31.790> is<00:04:31.970> done<00:04:32.150> with<00:04:32.330> code<00:04:32.570> this<00:04:32.840> time<00:04:33.110> it's

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
this is done with code this time it's

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.750 
this is done with code this time it's
just<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.770> bunch<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.070> circles<00:04:35.020> with<00:04:36.020> its<00:04:36.230> Zed

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
just a bunch of circles with its Zed

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.820 
just a bunch of circles with its Zed
each<00:04:37.760> time<00:04:38.210> it's<00:04:38.540> zed<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:38.840> increased<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.650> looks

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
each time it's zed is increased it looks

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.710 
each time it's zed is increased it looks
like<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.040> spacing<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.730> about<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.060> hundred<00:04:41.300> so

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
like a spacing of about a hundred so

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.960 
like a spacing of about a hundred so
each<00:04:41.900> circle<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.530> hundred<00:04:42.980> in<00:04:43.100> depth<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.610> i

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
each circle is a hundred in depth and i

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.880 
each circle is a hundred in depth and i
didn't<00:04:44.270> change<00:04:44.510> our<00:04:44.720> scale<00:04:45.020> i<00:04:45.050> left<00:04:45.500> them<00:04:45.650> kind

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
didn't change our scale i left them kind

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.130 
didn't change our scale i left them kind
of<00:04:45.980> going<00:04:46.220> off<00:04:46.370> into<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.820> distance<00:04:47.140> so

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
of going off into the distance so
