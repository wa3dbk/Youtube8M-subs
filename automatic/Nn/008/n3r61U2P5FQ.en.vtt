00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650

jacking<00:00:14.690> it's<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> couple<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.940> burrs<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.090> it

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
jacking it's got a couple of burrs in it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.660 
jacking it's got a couple of burrs in it
which<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> probably<00:00:20.070> where<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
which is probably where it's going to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.070 
which is probably where it's going to
break<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.060> guess<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> break<00:00:21.810> right

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
break I guess it's going to break right

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.349 
break I guess it's going to break right
here<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.400> additionally<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.060> side<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
here and then additionally one side of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.450 
here and then additionally one side of
it<00:00:24.449> I've<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.600> tied<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.619> single<00:00:26.010> overhand

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it I've just tied in a single overhand

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.810 
it I've just tied in a single overhand
knot<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> worst<00:00:29.160> possible<00:00:29.519> thing

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
knot so this is the worst possible thing

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.640 
knot so this is the worst possible thing
you<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.240> ever<00:00:30.420> use<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.960> slackline<00:00:31.380> upon

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.819 
you would ever use to slackline upon
bulls<00:00:32.489> webbing<00:00:32.940> someone<00:00:33.750> horribly<00:00:34.079> signed<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829

knot<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.280> some<00:00:35.850> Nixon<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:37.290> bad<00:00:37.440> idea

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.479 

so<00:02:26.660> we're<00:02:27.660> defeated<00:02:28.109> by<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.319> sling<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.310> on

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
so we're defeated by the sling but on

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.280 
so we're defeated by the sling but on
the<00:02:29.579> other<00:02:29.639> hand<00:02:29.730> emboldened<00:02:30.720> by<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.019> fact

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the other hand emboldened by the fact

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.750 
the other hand emboldened by the fact
that<00:02:31.410> even<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.889> piece<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.250> crap<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.609> take

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
that even this piece of crap can take

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.780 
that even this piece of crap can take
2,000<00:02:33.269> pounds<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.569> pressure
