an experience of an East Coast raw vegan
well<00:00:59.699> all<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.030> my<00:01:00.180> strategies<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:00.960> pretty

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
well all of my strategies are pretty

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.250 
well all of my strategies are pretty
much<00:01:01.379> low<00:01:01.620> cost<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.340> i'm<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> student<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
much low cost because i'm a student and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.420 
much low cost because i'm a student and
i'm<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> stipend<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:04.949> i<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.339> only

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
i'm going to stipend so i can only

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.100 
i'm going to stipend so i can only
afford<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.330> much<00:01:07.280> just<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.430> much<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.850> anything

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
afford so much just so much of anything

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.030 
afford so much just so much of anything
probably<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> most<00:01:10.500> important

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
probably one of the most important

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
probably one of the most important
strategies<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> eat<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.240> season<00:01:12.659> because

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
strategies is to eat in season because

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
strategies is to eat in season because
well<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.369> cheaper<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> let

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
well for one thing is cheaper and let

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.120 
well for one thing is cheaper and let
them<00:01:15.780> taste<00:01:15.990> better<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.100> two

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
them taste better so those are two

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
them taste better so those are two
pluses<00:01:17.549> right<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.799> for<00:01:19.799> another

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
pluses right there and for another

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
pluses right there and for another
reason<00:01:20.189> i<00:01:20.490> thought<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.030> prepares<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
reason i thought it prepares you for the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
reason i thought it prepares you for the
winter<00:01:22.439> because<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.700> you're<00:01:23.820> eating<00:01:24.180> when

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
winter because when you're eating when

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
winter because when you're eating when
you're<00:01:24.509> gorging<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.020> summer<00:01:25.470> fruits<00:01:25.860> usually

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
you're gorging on summer fruits usually

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.010 
you're gorging on summer fruits usually
by<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.000> end<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.270> summer<00:01:27.330> you're<00:01:27.659> ready<00:01:27.810> for

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
by the end of summer you're ready for

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
by the end of summer you're ready for
fall<00:01:28.200> foods<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.430> gorge<00:01:29.729> on

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
fall foods and then when you gorge on

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.819 
fall foods and then when you gorge on
fall<00:01:30.390> foods<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:31.320> ready<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.710> winter

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
fall foods then you're ready for winter

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.609 
fall foods then you're ready for winter
like<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.220> usually<00:01:32.340> ready<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> change

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
like you're usually ready for a change

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.800 
like you're usually ready for a change
when<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> change<00:01:34.950> actually<00:01:35.250> happens<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
when a change actually happens and so I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
when a change actually happens and so I
find<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.409> i<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.070> really

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
stress at the same time and how those

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.380 
stress at the same time and how those
two<00:03:50.230> interact<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.829> how<00:03:51.150> experiencing<00:03:52.150> stress

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
two interact and how experiencing stress

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.560 
two interact and how experiencing stress
can<00:03:52.660> really<00:03:52.930> hamper<00:03:53.380> your<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:55.000> benefit<00:03:55.420> of

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
can really hamper your the benefit of

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.720 
can really hamper your the benefit of
being<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:56.079> raw<00:03:56.230> vegan<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.860> so<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.400> talked<00:03:57.700> about

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
being a raw vegan and so I talked about

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.670 
being a raw vegan and so I talked about
that<00:03:58.209> just<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.690> put<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.959> information<00:03:59.200> out

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
that just to put that information out

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.830 
that just to put that information out
there<00:03:59.769> I<00:04:00.190> was<00:04:00.610> going<00:04:01.090> under<00:04:01.209> while<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.750> was

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
there I was going under while I was

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.600 
there I was going under while I was
basically<00:04:02.079> under<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.590> lot<00:04:02.860> of<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:03.070> lot<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.370> stress

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
basically under a lot of a lot of stress

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.120 
basically under a lot of a lot of stress
every<00:04:04.329> single<00:04:04.540> day<00:04:04.739> robbing<00:04:05.739> at<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:05.950> same

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
every single day robbing at the same

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.350 
every single day robbing at the same
time<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.640> even<00:04:06.700> though<00:04:06.880> we're<00:04:07.030> all<00:04:07.090> vegan

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
time and even though we're all vegan

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.270 
time and even though we're all vegan
protected<00:04:07.840> me<00:04:08.019> from<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.650> lot<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:09.040> symptoms

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
protected me from a lot of the symptoms

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.750 
protected me from a lot of the symptoms
from<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:10.180> stress<00:04:11.100> they<00:04:12.100> eventually<00:04:12.340> caught

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
from that stress they eventually caught

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.009 
from that stress they eventually caught
up<00:04:12.910> with<00:04:13.090> me<00:04:13.269> because<00:04:13.450> dress<00:04:13.930> always<00:04:14.260> wins

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
up with me because dress always wins

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.360 
up with me because dress always wins
and<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.259> just<00:04:16.440> create<00:04:16.919> an<00:04:17.039> environment

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and you just create an environment

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.599 
and you just create an environment
around<00:04:17.789> yourself<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.949> maintains<00:04:20.430> your

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
around yourself that that maintains your

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.339 
around yourself that that maintains your
maintains<00:04:21.419> your<00:04:21.569> lifestyle<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.940> for<00:04:23.940> me<00:04:24.349> you

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
maintains your lifestyle and for me you

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.339 
maintains your lifestyle and for me you
know<00:04:25.379> I've<00:04:26.190> found<00:04:26.759> strategies<00:04:27.389> to<00:04:27.990> do<00:04:28.110> that

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
know I've found strategies to do that

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.770 
know I've found strategies to do that
because<00:04:28.500> I'm<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.949> only<00:04:28.979> one<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.699> only<00:04:29.849> raw

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
because I'm the only one of the only raw

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.839 
because I'm the only one of the only raw
vegans<00:04:31.169> in<00:04:31.409> mind<00:04:31.860> my<00:04:31.979> town<00:04:32.250> it's<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.610> small

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
vegans in mind my town it's a small

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.839 
vegans in mind my town it's a small
college<00:04:33.270> town<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:34.039> so<00:04:35.039> there's<00:04:35.490> no<00:04:35.639> like<00:04:35.819> I

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
college town and so there's no like I

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.390 
college town and so there's no like I
have<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> big<00:04:36.360> raw<00:04:36.690> vegan<00:04:37.080> network<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.770> in

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
have a big raw vegan network in in

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.100 
have a big raw vegan network in in
Pennsylvania<00:04:39.150> during<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.750> dead<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.080> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
Pennsylvania during the dead of the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.860 
Pennsylvania during the dead of the
winter<00:04:40.520> nothing's<00:04:41.520> being<00:04:41.759> grown<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.569> so

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
winter nothing's being grown and so

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.050 
winter nothing's being grown and so
whatever<00:04:43.349> you<00:04:43.650> get<00:04:43.860> from<00:04:44.099> farms<00:04:44.639> they're

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
whatever you get from farms they're

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.210 
whatever you get from farms they're
basically<00:04:45.780> root<00:04:46.169> vegetables<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.979> have<00:04:47.039> been

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
basically root vegetables that have been

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.499 
basically root vegetables that have been
stored<00:04:47.460> up<00:04:47.639> and<00:04:47.819> think<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.090> have<00:04:48.210> been<00:04:48.300> grown

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
stored up and think that have been grown

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.480 
stored up and think that have been grown
in<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.720> green<00:04:48.900> house<00:04:49.050> green<00:04:49.259> house<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.860> so

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
in the green house green house and so

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.120 
in the green house green house and so
one<00:04:50.759> of<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.940> strategies<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.690> use<00:04:51.960> is<00:04:52.349> to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
one of the strategies that I use is to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.370 
one of the strategies that I use is to
store<00:04:53.639> my<00:04:53.849> own<00:04:54.000> fruits<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:54.630> vegetables<00:04:55.080> and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
store my own fruits and vegetables and

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.469 
store my own fruits and vegetables and
so<00:04:56.099> during<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.460> summer<00:04:56.729> what<00:04:57.030> I'll<00:04:57.120> do<00:04:57.300> is

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
so during the summer what I'll do is

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.680 
so during the summer what I'll do is
I'll<00:04:57.599> by<00:04:58.909> basically<00:04:59.909> boxes<00:05:00.919> of<00:05:01.919> tomatoes<00:05:02.690> from

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
I'll by basically boxes of tomatoes from

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.809 
I'll by basically boxes of tomatoes from
one<00:05:03.990> of<00:05:04.080> my<00:05:04.169> local<00:05:04.500> farms<00:05:04.800> organic<00:05:05.069> heirloom

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
tomatoes and I'll freeze them whole and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.499 
tomatoes and I'll freeze them whole and
basically<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.580> will<00:05:11.759> use<00:05:11.880> them<00:05:12.060> throughout<00:05:12.210> the

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
basically I will use them throughout the

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.659 
basically I will use them throughout the
winter<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.560> don't<00:05:13.740> use<00:05:13.949> them<00:05:14.129> very<00:05:14.159> much<00:05:14.400> I

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
winter and I don't use them very much I

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.580 
winter and I don't use them very much I
probably<00:05:15.030> use<00:05:15.270> maybe<00:05:15.629> like<00:05:15.780> eight<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.139> ten<00:05:16.379> a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
probably use maybe like eight to ten a

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.409 
probably use maybe like eight to ten a
month<00:05:16.919> so<00:05:17.370> it's<00:05:17.520> not<00:05:17.669> it's<00:05:18.000> not<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.180> lot<00:05:18.360> but
