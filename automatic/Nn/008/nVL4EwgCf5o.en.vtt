 This template is what you can do. 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 with another type of mold but I recommend 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.150

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.640

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.229

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:24.829

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:27.170
 a triangle smoking a servant here is 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.439
 You're going to cut it all down here. 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.429

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.390
 in half 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.860

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.399
