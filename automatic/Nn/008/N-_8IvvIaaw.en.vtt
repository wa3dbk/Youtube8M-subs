and I got them I looked up at 0.5 ohms
I'm<00:00:29.740> gonna<00:00:30.039> give<00:00:30.160> a<00:00:30.189> demo<00:00:30.430> today<00:00:30.579> hitta

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
truck getting metered and I tested it

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.819 
truck getting metered and I tested it
out<00:00:38.739> and<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.790> twice<00:00:40.090> as<00:00:40.269> loud<00:00:40.480> as<00:00:41.290> before

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
when I had the SB 5k at 0.5 ohms these

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.090 
when I had the SB 5k at 0.5 ohms these
do<00:00:45.159> these<00:00:45.309> things<00:00:45.610> are<00:00:45.879> as<00:00:46.690> they<00:00:47.350> made<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:47.980> a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
I can still get over possibly 3000 with

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.039 
I can still get over possibly 3000 with
these<00:01:07.990> well<00:01:08.439> with<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.650> 3,500<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:10.780> really

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
these well with the 3,500 so they really

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:11.700 
these well with the 3,500 so they really
ain't<00:01:11.140> gonna<00:01:11.320> matter

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
ain't gonna matter

ain't gonna matter
but<00:01:11.860> at<00:01:11.979> 0.5<00:01:12.369> ohms<00:01:12.640> man<00:01:12.880> this<00:01:13.000> thing<00:01:13.180> put<00:01:13.390> out<00:01:13.479> a

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
but at 0.5 ohms man this thing put out a

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.249 
but at 0.5 ohms man this thing put out a
strong<00:01:14.020> signal<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:16.090> I'm<00:01:16.810> definitely

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
strong signal and it's I'm definitely

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.999 
strong signal and it's I'm definitely
satisfied<00:01:17.650> with<00:01:17.830> crescendo<00:01:18.250> audio<00:01:18.549> products

like<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.009> small<00:01:27.490> demo<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.420> then<00:01:28.540> gonna<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:28.810> long

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
like a small demo and then gonna be long

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:44.820 
like a small demo and then gonna be long
but<00:01:31.860> slow<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.980> job<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.409> say<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.680> is

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
but slow the job here like I say this is

00:01:44.830 --> 00:02:12.699 
but slow the job here like I say this is
at<00:01:44.979> 0.5<00:01:45.520> ohms

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:23.319 

I<00:02:21.010> came<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.129> have<00:02:22.219> it<00:02:22.310> playing<00:02:22.549> too<00:02:22.760> loud<00:02:22.790> and

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
too long I'm in a garage and I got

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.059 
too long I'm in a garage and I got
neighbors<00:02:25.969> so<00:02:26.530> well<00:02:27.530> yeah<00:02:27.620> that's<00:02:27.739> just<00:02:27.920> like

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
neighbors so well yeah that's just like

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.000 
neighbors so well yeah that's just like
a<00:02:28.099> small<00:02:28.939> little<00:02:29.469> proves<00:02:30.469> on<00:02:30.650> what<00:02:30.829> these

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
a small little proves on what these

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.759 
a small little proves on what these
nowadays<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.819> do<00:02:32.000> at<00:02:32.510> 0.50<00:02:33.019> I'm<00:02:33.409> a<00:02:33.530> while<00:02:33.680> I'm

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
nowadays can do at 0.50 I'm a while I'm

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.379 
nowadays can do at 0.50 I'm a while I'm
down<00:02:33.889> to<00:02:34.129> them<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.609> can<00:02:34.819> play<00:02:35.000> them<00:02:35.120> at<00:02:35.209> high

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
down to them so I can play them at high

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.569 
down to them so I can play them at high
outputs<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.109> long<00:02:36.950> periods<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.400> time

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
outputs with long periods of time

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.250 
outputs with long periods of time
without<00:02:37.700> notice<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.239> put<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.510> distortion<00:02:38.959> on

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
without notice I put a distortion on

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.709 
without notice I put a distortion on
myself<00:02:39.469> so<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:39.980> couldn't<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:40.730> if<00:02:41.540> y'all

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
myself so I couldn't up if y'all
