00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.900
 pleases nothing but the zombies and 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.790
 the creepers and then also the 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.220
 enemies that is where minecraft is the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.860
 it gets stronger as they are here 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.020
 ok here is this clipper and it can be 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.520
 what to see each time as for example you 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.120
 tell him this is going to put like this guy 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.810
 of finding to me has put me is that what 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.840
 that must be there 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.970
 and how 20 puts this and well more like this 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.770
 to reach and then it will explode also 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.430
 adds you to types of skeletons for 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.430
 identify them 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:04.539
 4 how do you see this to identify them 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.539
 they should be highlighting like this guy d 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.420
 as of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.070
 particles and then while they go on their 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.480
 the world is going to be finding orbital 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.480
 I had found was the clip 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.720
 every time they see them, they are going to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.700
 identify with that or when they leave 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.250
 as for example they take out this then not 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.250
 says nothing and does not say anything but good 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.119
 when they approach this type of sea 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.119
 Well, he's going to put them as 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.820
 as a kind of 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.000
 Credit above 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.710
 and well it is also not easy to find 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.320
 good yes but how are they going to be 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.510
 finding that but because you 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.960
 they are going to need so that in their world they 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.960
 see how 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.369
 so, for example, he is tenacious and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.229
 government and suddenly it comes out 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.530
 obviously kill them to be 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.530
 make more 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.530
 and I do not find another 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.530
 hypersonic creeper you are 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.190
 since every now and then , 10 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.190
 meeting 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.410
 the 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.980
 found because it 's what I was looking for 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.810
 because it depends 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.810
 of where you are for what existence 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.300
 no, it does not work out like that, but 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.820
 it's going to come out because it's going to 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.190
 out a zombie also the widgets 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.360
 as well 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.340
 is it so 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.940
 they will be going to leave you more like 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940
 when you go out 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.569
 and then they do not give you anything just that is more 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.829
 difficult to kill taxes 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.829
 so come 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.260
 to others 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.640
 and there 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.069
 I'm going to draw different types of 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.069
 skills and well if they want 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:59.780
 this description is going 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.469
 all the names of the maps what 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.540
 they are in English and so here you have what 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.540
 which is in Spanish here as well 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.880
 20 these types come out also 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.259
 this spiderlings can also be here 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.410
 it may be fine for them to see how 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.600
 which ones are you going to battle 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.759
 here he tells you a little video of the 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.169
 they show all they do but 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.199
 it's more fun than you see them 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.940
 finding and then you're fighting against 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.250
 them good what they should do is 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.190
 give me take pictures for any 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.979

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.430
 leads to download the most recent good 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.770

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.840
 download media car force and get 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.650

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.780
 fall 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.110
 install hope with second of your 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.830
 college 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.830
 let's see 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:03.710
 dad 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.840
 Well here he brings you and wants to download 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.600
 and since it was downloaded it happens in the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.280
 desk so it 's installation a 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.460
 once done this goes to the beginning 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.190
 and they put percent app percent data 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.260
 percentage and leave your minecraft folder 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.960
 also for the user according to 28 magicians 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.840
 when they give him here they open the folder and 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.940
 puts a broad is percent by 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.980
 hundred app date and will direct them again 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.990
 to minecraft here if you do not have a folder 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.400
 called mods can create it on the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:38.969
 Right click give it a new name 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.839
 but since I already have nothing, I think 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.839
 of this law 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.270
 and get on his motorcycle 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.800
 and then it would only be supplied 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.800
 open to magnify 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:08.099
 and then to give the play 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.250
 on average 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.500
 and here as it opened up well and opens 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.070
 His world 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.070
 well 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.380

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.970
 I was throwing these bulbs and then 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.090
