00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.899
 new spoiler a change in the channel and in 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.930
 this tutorial what we will do will be 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.680
 teach them how to download minecraft no 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.000
 they have 1.7 point 10 we are going to do 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.729
 using a launcher that is 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.699
 upgradeable when a new one comes out 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.879
 version that's going to work for us and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.140
 then let's start then then we 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.360
 let's go to the link that we have in the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.450
 description of the cultural video in which 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.340
 this is a lot of publicity then because 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.050
 since I have a google version 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.640
 chrome the new ones that you just install 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.250
 some extensions and it gives me problems 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.790
 with the act then the advertising does not 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.700
 take away 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.570
 how to give a file called main 1.7 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.100
 point 10 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.100
 It will not take long 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.230
 as you can see worked I have not 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.730
 had to pause the video and of 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.440
 desk bring that file rar 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.110
 let's extract the file where you 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.240
 want to give in studying here and we have 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.850
 that is the caine the launcher villar 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.280
 tutorials that is the one to a jet is 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.630
 taken from the channel ar tutorials that 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.780
 same as I will in the description of 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.990
 video 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.360
 I took him out of that same video because 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.070
 to avoid problems then we go to 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.070
 give right click execute 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.320
 and then good as I said 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.610
 let's run an administrator and we 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.560
 a table will appear with which 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.869
 let's have three options ok 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.910
 update or cancel we will give it in 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.010
 ok we can be because the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.990
 singer is not giving problems in this 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.510
 part I will verify that I keep recording 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.870
 I 've already recorded this three times 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.290
 but it demands me inter problems we're going to 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.379
 create us a user 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.340
 we thank you at login and now what 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.659
 we'll do is go to profile 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.780
 choose the direction of the psuv minecraft 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.409
 no pm we are not going the last version that has 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.510
 left this application is 1.7 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.000
 punto dÃ­az here we have it as 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.470
 select or use the latest version on 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.329
 more recommendable is the latest version 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.430
 Here we can avoid the name of the profile 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.610
 a use it in saving let's give the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.040
 play for agreement on your brand 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.010
 and make sure it works like 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.600
 can see works correctly the same 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.970
 in the next video I'm going to teach you 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.220
 how to download texture packages 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.630
 then as good here we have what 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.000
 It does not stain as you can see it comes to us 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.740
 entirely in Spanish and is not 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.940
 we have a place language or nothing for the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.510
 style 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.350
 then as I said we are going to be able to 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.050
 show them that it works the same whether it was a 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.150
 disgust because the textures package that 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.150
 I had better besides the graphs 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.380
 then it is later as you can see 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.880
 works perfectly you have without the 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.700
 textures package that had 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.130
 placed so well I'm just going to 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.990
 put back and I hope you have them 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.670
 liked remember subscribe and give 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.110
