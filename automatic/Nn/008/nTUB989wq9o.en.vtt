00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.760
 to update the operating system of 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:35.220
 an iphone device 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.200
 of 5.0 and 6.0 should do the following 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.500
 the example of this tutorial we are going to 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.300
 update an iphone4 the first thing that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 we must do is connect the iphone to 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.600
 our computer once they are finished 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.590
 of installing the drivers is going to run 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.200
 automatically 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.430
 the itunes program and in the part 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.370
 left in the menus 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 On the part of devices, the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.960
 name of our iphone that we have 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.960
 connected 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.850
 we will appear this circular we can 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.850
 give him to cancel 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.220
 or if we want to update directly 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.020
 from them, we click on 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.020
 update let's go to the device 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.200
 and in version we have two buttons apply 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 update and apply a restoration in 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.770
 this case we are going to click on 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.319
 update he will look for the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 update in this case tells us that 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.500
 there are no elements synchronized with the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.870
 library that if we want to do it 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.490
 we are not interested at this time 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.980
 elements of the library then 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.900
 we can give you continue 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.760
 and it tells us that we have not made a copy 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.180
 security or if we want to create 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.680
 let's choose to save copy of 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.630
 security 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.630
 the last message appears 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.310
 to click on update 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.330
 and we wait while the itunes program 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.490
 connects to the apple server 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.320
 to make the downloads appear 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.830
 the terms of the contract we do not give 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.830
 click on next 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.830
 and we wait 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.050
 to the download 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.050
 of operating system 6.0 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.750
 once the download is finished 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.320
 will extract the software to install it 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.320
 Finally 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.480
 on our iphone 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.230
 and it is possible that this 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.230
 message the iphone 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.400
 could not be updated has been 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.209
 An unknown error occurred 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.209
 we press in here 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.730
 and the iphone will we do restoration 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.819
 in case this happens simply 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.579
 we click on accept and restore 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.530
 the summary device that is the 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:17.000
 only option that appears 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.000
 let's click on restore 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.390
 this happens because of some connection failure 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.180
 for some 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.040
 fails to download the file 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.420
 which contains the operating system for 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.580
 the iphone 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.730
 but the same is a mistake completely 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.860
 workable from the application 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.860
 we wait for the restoration to be done 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.540
 that finally the process is quite 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.540
 similar to the update 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.880
 finally what we can do is 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.880
 restore the backup 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.160
 and we can see our iphone 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.770
 updated if the error does not appear 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.150
 simply the progress bar will continue 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.110
 until the end and you will notice that 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.110
 synchronized 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.750
