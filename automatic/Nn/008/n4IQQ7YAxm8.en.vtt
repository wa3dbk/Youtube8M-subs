length by holding one pad and hitting

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.349 
length by holding one pad and hitting
the<00:03:46.930> other<00:03:47.079> like<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:47.979> this<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:48.609> two<00:03:48.909> balls<00:03:49.120> and

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
the other like so this is two balls and

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.619 
the other like so this is two balls and
this<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.500> four<00:03:50.739> balls<00:03:50.949> if<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:52.060> go<00:03:52.209> into<00:03:52.359> life

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
this is four balls if we go into life

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.490 
this is four balls if we go into life
and<00:03:53.370> look<00:03:54.370> at<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.549> clip<00:03:55.049> we<00:03:56.049> can<00:03:56.199> see<00:03:56.349> that

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
and look at the clip we can see that

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.780 
and look at the clip we can see that
it's<00:03:57.220> 16<00:03:57.639> balls<00:03:58.440> four<00:03:59.440> balls<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.459> can<00:04:00.639> also

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
it's 16 balls four balls and I can also

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.610 
it's 16 balls four balls and I can also
edit<00:04:01.150> individual<00:04:02.079> balls<00:04:04.109> let's<00:04:05.109> go<00:04:05.260> back<00:04:05.440> to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
edit individual balls let's go back to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.879 
edit individual balls let's go back to
two<00:04:05.769> balls<00:04:06.750> let's<00:04:07.750> create<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.079> dumb<00:04:08.319> bit<00:04:08.530> using

two balls let's create a dumb bit using
the<00:04:09.040> step<00:04:09.340> sequencer<00:04:09.909> I'll<00:04:10.629> create<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.989> two

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
the step sequencer I'll create a two

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.199 
the step sequencer I'll create a two
ball<00:04:11.530> clip<00:04:11.889> but<00:04:12.370> first<00:04:12.609> I'll<00:04:12.760> change<00:04:13.030> the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
ball clip but first I'll change the

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.920 
ball clip but first I'll change the
