00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it's a bit more fair all right so the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.010 
it's a bit more fair all right so the
Xbox<00:01:35.880> one's<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:36.360> bit<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.720> expensive

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
Xbox one's a little bit more expensive

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870 
Xbox one's a little bit more expensive
and<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> show<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.979> why<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and here I'm going to show you why you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.539 
and here I'm going to show you why you
actually<00:01:39.150> need<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> remove<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.409> small<00:01:41.130> portion

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
actually need to remove a small portion

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.580 
actually need to remove a small portion
of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> middle<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.990> fit<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
of the middle so you can fit in the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.870 
of the middle so you can fit in the
upscaler<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.000> graphics<00:01:49.430> now<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.729> can

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
upscaler and the graphics now as you can

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.249 
upscaler and the graphics now as you can
see<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> hole<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> center

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
see we have the hole in the center

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.600 
see we have the hole in the center
cutout<00:01:52.590> that's<00:01:52.829> ready<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> fill<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.430> all

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.639 
cutout that's ready to fill with all
kinds<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> graphics<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.509> features<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.350> first

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
kinds of graphics and features but first

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.670 
kinds of graphics and features but first
we<00:01:55.860> need<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> put<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.750> Xbox<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:58.020> into<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
we need to put the Xbox one into the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.889 
we need to put the Xbox one into the
heat<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.880> maybe<00:02:02.880> 30<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.360> 40<00:02:03.630> minutes

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
heat for all maybe 30 or 40 minutes

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.050 
heat for all maybe 30 or 40 minutes
ought<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:04.229> it

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.639 

now<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.119> last<00:02:09.450> test<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.050> heating<00:02:10.380> unit

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
now the last test with the heating unit

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
now the last test with the heating unit
I<00:02:10.740> mean<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.950> my<00:02:11.070> crappy<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.460> heating<00:02:11.760> unit

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
I mean the my crappy the heating unit

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820 
I mean the my crappy the heating unit
was<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.600> make<00:02:12.750> sure<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.200> bought<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> heat

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
was to make sure that you bought a heat

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
was to make sure that you bought a heat
impervious<00:02:14.430> root<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.700> mean<00:02:14.880> Xbox<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.570> another

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
impervious root I mean Xbox one another

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.080 
impervious root I mean Xbox one another
step<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.920> we're<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.190> add<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.490> up<00:02:17.640> scaler

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
step is we're going to add the up scaler

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.970 
step is we're going to add the up scaler
I<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.750> had<00:02:18.900> recommendations<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.710> use<00:02:19.800> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
I have had recommendations to use this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.320 
I have had recommendations to use this
product<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:20.760> not<00:02:20.790> sure<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.300> is

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
but we will use it this will upscale the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.740 
but we will use it this will upscale the

right guys am i right we have our
graphics<00:02:33.510> which<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.959> little<00:02:34.200> bit

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
graphics which it's a little bit

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.010 
graphics which it's a little bit
different<00:02:34.500> from<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> graphics<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:36.060> ps4

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
different from the graphics in the ps4

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.560 
different from the graphics in the ps4
but<00:02:37.350> that's<00:02:37.620> okay<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> each's<00:02:38.520> own<00:02:38.640> sure<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
but that's okay to each's own sure it

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.970 
but that's okay to each's own sure it
gives<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.230> same<00:02:40.500> level<00:02:40.890> as

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
gives about the same level as

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.510 
gives about the same level as
performance<00:02:42.320> alright<00:02:43.320> give<00:02:43.920> me<00:02:43.950> one<00:02:44.160> second

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
performance alright give me one second

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.330 
performance alright give me one second
here<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.790> need<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.970> nice<00:02:45.270> nice<00:02:46.230> healthy<00:02:46.739> dose<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
here we need a nice nice healthy dose of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.949 
here we need a nice nice healthy dose of
graphics<00:02:47.880> even<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.270> little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.630> less<00:02:48.780> than<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
graphics even a little bit less than the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.380 
graphics even a little bit less than the
PlayStation<00:02:49.470> 4<00:02:49.500> though<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.950> Xbox<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.610> does

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
PlayStation 4 though the Xbox one does

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.360 
PlayStation 4 though the Xbox one does
skimp<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.020> little<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.350> on<00:02:52.470> power<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.220> get

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
skimp a little bit on power so I can get

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.120 
skimp a little bit on power so I can get
that<00:02:53.520> Kinect<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.120> there<00:02:54.530> alright<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.830> should

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
that Kinect in there alright that should

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.770 
that Kinect in there alright that should
be<00:02:56.220> just<00:02:56.459> about<00:02:56.790> enough<00:02:56.940> graphics<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.660> may

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
be just about enough graphics you may

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.670 
be just about enough graphics you may
not<00:02:57.900> even<00:02:57.959> have<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.230> eat<00:02:58.350> some<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> this

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
not even have to eat some of this

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.750 
not even have to eat some of this
yourself<00:02:59.040> because<00:02:59.310> we're<00:02:59.459> something<00:02:59.610> left

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
yourself because we're something left

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.350 
yourself because we're something left
over<00:03:01.370> okay<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.550> are<00:03:02.640> ready<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.030> start<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
over okay we are ready to start the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.650 
over okay we are ready to start the
soldering<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.050> securing<00:03:04.470> process<00:03:05.570> simple<00:03:06.570> as

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
soldering and securing process simple as

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.610 
soldering and securing process simple as
that<00:03:07.160> we'll<00:03:08.160> just<00:03:08.310> light<00:03:08.550> these<00:03:08.760> ends<00:03:09.060> up<00:03:09.620> and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
that we'll just light these ends up and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.229 
that we'll just light these ends up and
let<00:03:10.830> them<00:03:10.980> go<00:03:11.160> down<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.459> little<00:03:11.700> ways<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.209> that

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
let them go down a little ways so that

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.210 
let them go down a little ways so that
we<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:12.570> have<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> better<00:03:13.140> space<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.680> secure<00:03:14.010> to

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
we can have a better space to secure to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.830 
we can have a better space to secure to
so<00:03:14.640> almost<00:03:14.790> forgot<00:03:15.090> when<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.750> is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
so almost forgot when this is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.150 
so almost forgot when this is
extinguished<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.590> burning<00:03:16.799> any<00:03:16.980> more

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
extinguished and not burning any more
