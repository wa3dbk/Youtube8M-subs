Rodham and to do this what we need to do

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.039 
Rodham and to do this what we need to do
is<00:01:07.770> push<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.909> stick<00:01:09.270> now<00:01:09.750> think

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
is push in on the right stick now think

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.420 
is push in on the right stick now think
about<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.380> smart<00:01:10.650> route<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> doesn't

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
about the smart route is it doesn't

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460 
about the smart route is it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:12.060> take<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.360> 10<00:01:12.570> yards<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.290> going

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
necessarily take it 10 yards it's going

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
necessarily take it 10 yards it's going
to<00:01:13.500> take<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> first<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:14.880> marker<00:01:15.150> or
