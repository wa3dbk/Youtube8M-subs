00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 it's time to change the protective film 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:14.210
 screen phone I bought a universal 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.520
 Chinese in her 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.980
 cloth to wipe the screen in front 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.010
 a sticker of the film itself 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.740
 the film number 1 is the layer which 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.059
 the door is removed on the adhesive film on 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:39.620
 the screen is then removed the protective layer with 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:43.770
 I chose such a film with the number 2 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:50.000
 so that its width corresponds to the height 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.570
 screen size is different for segments 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.570
 determined by the numbers printed on the edge 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.570
 film 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.180
 the film is cut off we remove the factory 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.180
 protective film 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:29.930
 and carefully wipe the screen on that place 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.930
 where the new protective film will stick 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.910
 on how good you are 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.910
 Wipe the screen will depend on the quality 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:51.370
 fit protective film 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.370
 it is important that bubbles do not form 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.190
 protective layer 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:19.209
 Do not take off immediately so that you do not have a hall under 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:19.209
 You can now smooth the film 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.670
 I remove the second protective layer 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:03:05.099
 again wipe around the edges is especially important 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:07.790
 glue quality around the edges look 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.790
 what happened
