favorite designers he designed agricola

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
favorite designers he designed agricola
as<00:01:19.710> well<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.580> whole<00:01:20.729> harvest<00:01:20.970> trilogy

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
as well as the whole harvest trilogy

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
as well as the whole harvest trilogy
which<00:01:21.600> now<00:01:21.720> has<00:01:21.869> five<00:01:22.020> games<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.650> imagine

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
which now has five games and I imagine

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.410 
which now has five games and I imagine
caverna<00:01:23.340> Wilson<00:01:23.670> off<00:01:23.790> into<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.240> it'll<00:01:24.390> be

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
caverna Wilson off into that so it'll be

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.980 
caverna Wilson off into that so it'll be
a<00:01:24.509> six-game<00:01:24.960> trilogy<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> i<00:01:27.240> guess<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> count

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
a six-game trilogy so i guess the count

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.010 
a six-game trilogy so i guess the count
trilogy's<00:01:28.439> differently<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.040> germany<00:01:29.400> but

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
trilogy's differently in germany but

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
trilogy's differently in germany but
it's<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.619> sort<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> semi<00:01:32.430> sequel<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970

it's this is sort of a semi sequel to
agricola<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.630> sort<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> redesign<00:01:34.560> it's

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
of Pride and Prejudice and you play

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.830

so it's designed by a female it's kind

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.610 
so it's designed by a female it's kind
of<00:04:26.639> not<00:04:27.419> it's<00:04:27.720> for<00:04:27.930> everyone<00:04:28.260> it's<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.440> board

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
haven't seen anything like it and we

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.320 
haven't seen anything like it and we
thought<00:05:56.370> we<00:05:56.490> could<00:05:56.610> do<00:05:56.700> it<00:05:56.820> well<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:56.970> we<00:05:57.180> had<00:05:57.300> a

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
thought we could do it well and we had a

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.420 
thought we could do it well and we had a
area<00:05:58.080> of<00:05:58.200> expertise<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.830> filmmaking<00:05:59.160> that<00:05:59.340> we

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
area of expertise and filmmaking that we

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.100 
area of expertise and filmmaking that we
thought<00:05:59.610> we<00:05:59.760> could<00:05:59.789> apply<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.330> so<00:06:00.570> that's

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
thought we could apply to that so that's

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.350 
thought we could apply to that so that's
where<00:06:01.320> that<00:06:01.349> came<00:06:01.560> from<00:06:01.620> and<00:06:02.610> it's<00:06:02.910> a<00:06:03.120> way<00:06:03.330> that

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
where that came from and it's a way that

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.940 
where that came from and it's a way that
we<00:06:03.630> hope<00:06:03.960> we<00:06:04.110> can<00:06:04.289> spread<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:05.280> board<00:06:05.820> game<00:06:06.030> and

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
we hope we can spread the board game and

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.890 
we hope we can spread the board game and
tabletop<00:06:07.950> community<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:09.539> fandom<00:06:09.870> and

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
tabletop community and the fandom and

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.240 
tabletop community and the fandom and
stuff<00:06:10.080> like<00:06:10.169> that<00:06:10.229> introduce<00:06:10.710> new<00:06:10.860> people<00:06:11.130> to

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
stuff like that introduce new people to

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.100 
stuff like that introduce new people to
stuff<00:06:11.460> in<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:12.000> way<00:06:12.150> that<00:06:12.389> maybe<00:06:12.630> some<00:06:12.960> other

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
stuff in a way that maybe some other

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.740 
stuff in a way that maybe some other
they<00:06:13.650> haven't<00:06:13.950> had<00:06:14.070> access<00:06:14.280> to

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
they haven't had access to

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.680 
they haven't had access to
you<00:06:14.840> know<00:06:14.960> maybe<00:06:15.320> they<00:06:15.530> don't<00:06:16.060> watch<00:06:17.060> great

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
you know maybe they don't watch great

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.120 
you know maybe they don't watch great
shows<00:06:17.870> like<00:06:18.080> tabletop<00:06:18.410> because<00:06:18.980> it's<00:06:19.100> just

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
shows like tabletop because it's just

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.470 
shows like tabletop because it's just
playing<00:06:19.400> board<00:06:19.610> games<00:06:19.640> so<00:06:19.910> maybe<00:06:20.120> they'd<00:06:20.330> get

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
playing board games so maybe they'd get

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.440 
playing board games so maybe they'd get
into<00:06:20.810> a<00:06:21.140> sitcom<00:06:21.710> basically<00:06:22.550> and<00:06:22.790> then<00:06:23.030> go<00:06:23.270> back

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450
