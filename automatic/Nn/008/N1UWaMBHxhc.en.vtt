00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello hello how are you all welcome 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.189
 one more time to the yola hobbies I'm 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.250
 very happy because this time you 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.969
 I'm going to share a super trick for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.960
 leave this copper jug as new 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.289
 it's an old cart that you're going to see the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.289
 transformation 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.840
 Here I will show you what we are going to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.349
 use this is white vinegar but you can 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 use any table salt vinegar 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.030
 normal and a fiber that as you see is already 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 pretty worn that is what I use for 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 clean the procedure is very easy 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.890
 you are going to introduce your fiber inside the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.530
 vinegar and you're going to bathe the piece you go 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.180
 to clean since it is with enough 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.949
 vinegar you're going to sprinkle the salt like that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.750
 as I 'm showing you here that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.750
 the piece is very well covered 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.630
 you are going to take your fiber again and go to 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.780
 start carving gently on the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.620
 piece in this way you do not need to do 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.650
 what luck 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.240
 and little by little you will be noticing everything 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.850
 it's those spots that are characteristic 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.120
 of copper when they already have because they do not 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.380
 it has cleared disappear look there you what 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.950
 I show 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.860
 little by little 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.799
 how it's going to disappear if 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.320
 you need to repeat the operation you do it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.520
 you return to bathe your piece with vinegar and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 then you come back to sprinkle salt 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.640
 do it as many times as you need to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:52.880
 leave your piece completely clean that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.880
 it will be seen as little by little 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.499
 it is already remaining as its color should 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.499
 be 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.030
 good since we have cleaned it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.610
 totally 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.150
 how can you observe here now what 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.060
 we're going to do is we're going to rinse it 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.940
 with water to remove all that vinegar 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.670
 and that salt you rinse them perfectly 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.819
 well as I show it here look what 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.010
 shine that my daughter took rita 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.319
 If I had not known this trick already 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.430
 I would have thrown the garbage was that the 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.280
 hair as it reflects the light you were going to take 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.909
 a cloth and you will dry it perfectly 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.859
 if you need to do the 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.939
 procedure you can do without any 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:47.909
 problem because it is usually dry and 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:50.830
 you can see every other spot 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.920
 and good you do the same again 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.640
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.550
 super trick as you see super super fast 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.800
 very effective and our pieces remain 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.520
 as new again 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.530
 ready to be admired because I'll 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.410
 I appreciate very much that you have accompanied me 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.540
 I hope to see you in my next tutorial on 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.540
