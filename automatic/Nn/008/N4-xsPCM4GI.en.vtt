at any pace that you want to move it

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.589 
at any pace that you want to move it
gives<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.519> just<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.849> real<00:02:33.060> good<00:02:33.239> sense<00:02:33.510> of

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
gives you just a real good sense of

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.180 
gives you just a real good sense of
stability<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:35.750> felt<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> first<00:02:37.170> C<00:02:37.560> Lake<00:02:37.769> was<00:02:38.040> as

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
stability I felt the first C Lake was as

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.520 
stability I felt the first C Lake was as
perfect<00:02:38.579> as<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.819> could<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.150> moving<00:02:40.049> into<00:02:40.319> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
perfect as it could be moving into the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.960 
perfect as it could be moving into the
second<00:02:40.920> one<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.160> looking<00:02:41.519> for<00:02:41.730> an<00:02:41.819> even

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
second one I'm looking for an even

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.420 
second one I'm looking for an even
higher<00:02:42.120> level<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.810> perfection<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.650> think<00:02:44.280> I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
higher level of perfection I think I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.220 
higher level of perfection I think I
have<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> different<00:02:45.150> expectation<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.959> time

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
have a different expectation this time

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.229 
have a different expectation this time
around<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.739> want<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.069> one<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.430> better

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
around that I want this one to be better

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.729 
around that I want this one to be better
than<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.599> first<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.169> that's<00:02:49.230> that's<00:02:49.590> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
than the first and that's that's a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.530 
than the first and that's that's a
difficult<00:02:50.190> expectation<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.150> because

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
difficult expectation to have because

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.820 
difficult expectation to have because
the<00:02:51.660> first<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.440> did<00:02:52.739> work<00:02:52.919> so<00:02:53.160> well<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.370> me
