book it's not well organized the Bible
is<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> huge<00:00:33.000> mess

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
is a huge mess

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.360 
is a huge mess
I<00:00:33.719> mean<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.230> written<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.829> chronological

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I mean it's written in chronological

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.750 
I mean it's written in chronological
order<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.750> thematic<00:00:37.530> order<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.579> might

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
order not thematic order and that might

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
order not thematic order and that might
be<00:00:38.790> okay<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> Bible<00:00:39.780> were<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> history<00:00:40.500> book

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
be okay if the Bible were a history book

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.130 
be okay if the Bible were a history book
but<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.120> when<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.570> guidebook

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
but not so much when it's a guidebook

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650 
but not so much when it's a guidebook
for<00:00:43.170> life<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.670> especially<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.360> huge

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
for life and that's especially a huge

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.690 
for life and that's especially a huge
problem<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.230> Christians<00:00:46.770> use<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> Bible<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
problem when Christians use the Bible to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.569 
problem when Christians use the Bible to
justify<00:00:47.910> their<00:00:48.870> beliefs<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> actions<00:00:49.890> they

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.030 
there's not even a helpful index and
