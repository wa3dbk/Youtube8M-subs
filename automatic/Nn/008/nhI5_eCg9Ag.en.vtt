really it's not really necessarily a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
really it's not really necessarily a
problem<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:30.769> when<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> paddle<00:00:32.099> whitewater

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820

in there but when paddling long foam

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.680 
in there but when paddling long foam
tends<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.100> develop<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.629> guess

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

whatever water goes back out kind of you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.680 
whatever water goes back out kind of you
know<00:00:56.070> fluctuates<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.390> out<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> both

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
discover holes don't really have to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.610 
discover holes don't really have to
worry<00:00:59.820> about<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> lake<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.109> foam<00:01:01.350> kind

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
worry about it on the lake the foam kind
of<00:01:01.680> gets<00:01:01.800> annoying<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.840> kind

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019

of gets annoying and it really just kind
of<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> don't<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.540> need<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> scuppers

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of you don't really need the scuppers

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.390 
of you don't really need the scuppers
because<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.799> taking<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.159> water

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because you're not taking on water

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.620 
because you're not taking on water
usually<00:01:08.880> from<00:01:09.180> waves<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:09.659> anything<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
usually from waves or anything so I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.270 
usually from waves or anything so I
opted<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> plug<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.710> scuppers<00:01:14.130> you've

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
opted to plug all of my scuppers you've

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
opted to plug all of my scuppers you've
got<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> four<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.909> there<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.439> frame<00:01:16.710> there

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920

have any water in the cockpit area up
here<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> did<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> tank<00:01:36.150> well

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
here but I did have it in the tank well

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
here but I did have it in the tank well
and<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.079> causing<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.470> tackle<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.040> wet<00:01:38.250> my

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
and it's causing my tackle to get wet my

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.670 
and it's causing my tackle to get wet my
crate<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:41.240> looked<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> few<00:01:42.600> options<00:01:42.680> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
crate so I looked at a few options and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
crate so I looked at a few options and
they<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.460> scupper<00:01:44.820> plugs<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
they do make scupper plugs that are you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.580 
they do make scupper plugs that are you
know<00:01:46.140> custom<00:01:46.799> fit<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.450> your<00:01:48.450> boat<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.500> get

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
know custom fit to your boat you can get

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.770 
know custom fit to your boat you can get
them<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> rods<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.520> them

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
them for the rods here you can get them

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.880 
them for the rods here you can get them
scupper<00:01:51.780> plugs<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.439> any<00:01:52.680> boat

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
scupper plugs for just about any boat

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.399 
scupper plugs for just about any boat
out<00:01:53.070> there<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.640> didn't<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:58.290> know

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409

pair of them so I actually went out and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
pair of them so I actually went out and
got<00:02:03.780> some<00:02:03.840> foam<00:02:05.360> practice<00:02:06.360> golf<00:02:06.659> balls<00:02:07.310> now

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
got some foam practice golf balls now

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.969 
got some foam practice golf balls now
you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.060> either<00:02:09.209> get<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.780> these<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you can either get these these have the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.120 
you can either get these these have the
dimples<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.459> them

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
dimples in them

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.640 
dimples in them
see<00:02:12.430> them<00:02:12.520> there<00:02:12.760> or<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:14.170> can<00:02:14.230> get<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.500> kind

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
see them there or you can get the kind

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.770 
see them there or you can get the kind
like<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.790> actually<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.690> my

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
like this that actually one of my

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.360 
like this that actually one of my
beagles<00:02:17.170> got<00:02:17.350> ahold<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:18.460> is<00:02:18.640> actually<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
beagles got ahold of this is actually a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.670 
beagles got ahold of this is actually a
just<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.460> regular<00:02:22.060> foam<00:02:22.240> golf<00:02:22.540> ball<00:02:22.810> or<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.560> can

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
just a regular foam golf ball or you can

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.890 
just a regular foam golf ball or you can
get<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.950> firm<00:02:24.160> nerf<00:02:24.520> balls<00:02:24.790> every<00:02:25.660> now<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
get the firm nerf balls every now and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.230 
get the firm nerf balls every now and
then<00:02:25.990> but<00:02:26.290> these<00:02:27.160> actually<00:02:27.670> will<00:02:27.820> probably

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
then but these actually will probably

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.820 
then but these actually will probably
work<00:02:28.390> better<00:02:28.630> notice<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.380> got<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.530> little<00:02:29.620> teeth

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
work better notice I got a little teeth

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.670 
work better notice I got a little teeth
marks<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.520> one<00:02:30.700> but<00:02:31.630> these<00:02:32.230> actually

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
marks in this one but these actually

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.990 
marks in this one but these actually
probably<00:02:32.950> work<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.250> little<00:02:33.340> bit<00:02:33.490> better<00:02:33.670> than

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
probably work a little bit better than

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.110 
probably work a little bit better than
these<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> little<00:02:35.110> bit<00:02:35.230> different<00:02:35.650> foam

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
these it's a little bit different foam

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.820 
these it's a little bit different foam
these<00:02:37.120> take<00:02:37.570> on<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.750> little<00:02:37.960> bit<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.200> memory<00:02:38.410> of

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
these take on a little bit of memory of

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
these take on a little bit of memory of
the<00:02:38.980> hole

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
the hole

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.420 
the hole
once<00:02:40.900> they're<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.200> there<00:02:41.350> for<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.770> few<00:02:42.100> days<00:02:42.250> or

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
once they're in there for a few days or

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.190 
once they're in there for a few days or
whatever<00:02:42.580> they<00:02:43.360> kind<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.600> become<00:02:43.840> Oh<00:02:43.900> blah

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
whatever they kind of become Oh blah

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.530 
whatever they kind of become Oh blah
stand<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> don't<00:02:46.030> really<00:02:46.180> think<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
stand that I don't really think the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.170 
stand that I don't really think the
water<00:02:46.750> will<00:02:46.840> push<00:02:47.080> them<00:02:47.260> out<00:02:47.380> or<00:02:47.470> anything<00:02:47.620> but

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
water will push them out or anything but

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.220 
water will push them out or anything but
they<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.390> become<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> little<00:02:49.780> bit<00:02:49.900> easier<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
they do become a little bit easier to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.110 
they do become a little bit easier to
push<00:02:50.410> out<00:02:50.590> but<00:02:50.830> they<00:02:50.950> still<00:02:51.220> serve<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
push out but they still serve the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.200 
push out but they still serve the
purpose<00:02:52.420> fine<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.990> a<00:02:53.050> lake<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:54.310> I'm<00:02:54.790> happy<00:02:55.060> with

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
purpose fine in a lake so I'm happy with

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.080 
purpose fine in a lake so I'm happy with
them<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:56.590> got<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> looks<00:02:57.700> like<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:58.000> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
them and I got a looks like it's a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.420 
them and I got a looks like it's a
twelve<00:02:58.420> pack<00:02:58.690> for<00:02:59.140> five<00:02:59.620> bucks<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:02.160> put<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.220> few

twelve pack for five bucks and put a few
in<00:03:03.490> my<00:03:03.580> discover<00:03:04.420> holes<00:03:04.660> they're<00:03:04.900> very<00:03:05.260> easy

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
in my discover holes they're very easy

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.640 
in my discover holes they're very easy
to<00:03:05.530> put<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.860> blocks<00:03:06.930> 100%<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.050> water<00:03:08.230> from

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
to put in blocks 100% of the water from

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.100 
to put in blocks 100% of the water from
coming<00:03:08.830> up<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.160> scupper<00:03:09.400> holes<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:10.870> said

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
coming up to scupper holes like said

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.870 
coming up to scupper holes like said
these<00:03:11.290> are<00:03:11.560> kind<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.920> put<00:03:12.070> up<00:03:12.160> here<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.520> stop

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
these are kind of put up here to stop

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.340 
these are kind of put up here to stop
the<00:03:13.060> foam<00:03:13.710> from<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:15.100> lake<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.810> then<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.140> ones

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
the foam from the lake and then the ones

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.010 
the foam from the lake and then the ones
back<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.430> tank<00:03:18.640> well<00:03:18.850> we're<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.720> stop<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
back and the tank well we're to stop the

back and the tank well we're to stop the
actual<00:03:20.320> water<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.770> then<00:03:21.550> I<00:03:21.580> actually<00:03:21.910> took

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
actual water and then I actually took

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.140 
actual water and then I actually took
one<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:23.400> drilled<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> little<00:03:24.550> hole<00:03:24.670> through<00:03:25.030> it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
one and drilled a little hole through it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.880 
one and drilled a little hole through it
or<00:03:25.270> actually<00:03:25.900> melted<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.320> hole<00:03:26.350> through<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.740> and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
or actually melted a hole through it and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.860 
or actually melted a hole through it and
put<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.430> from<00:03:27.610> under<00:03:28.000> my<00:03:28.090> bungee<00:03:28.450> cord<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.720> make

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
put it from under my bungee cord to make

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.560 
put it from under my bungee cord to make
a<00:03:28.900> nice<00:03:29.500> little<00:03:29.970> paddle<00:03:30.970> holder<00:03:31.180> whatever

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
a nice little paddle holder whatever

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.410 
a nice little paddle holder whatever
there<00:03:32.520> this<00:03:33.520> about<00:03:33.760> did<00:03:33.970> come<00:03:34.180> with<00:03:34.300> like<00:03:34.390> a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
there this about did come with like a

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.830 
there this about did come with like a
rubber<00:03:34.720> wheel<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.770> went<00:03:35.980> right<00:03:36.160> there<00:03:36.370> but

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
rubber wheel that went right there but

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.000 
rubber wheel that went right there but
this<00:03:37.840> actually<00:03:38.050> races<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.650> up<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.770> little<00:03:38.890> bit

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
this actually races that up a little bit

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.140 
this actually races that up a little bit
higher<00:03:39.160> makes<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.490> pad<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.700> little<00:03:39.850> bit<00:03:39.940> easier

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
higher makes the pad a little bit easier

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.440 
higher makes the pad a little bit easier
tuck<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.570> there<00:03:40.750> but<00:03:41.970> anyhow<00:03:42.970> that's

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
tuck in there but anyhow that's

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.600 
tuck in there but anyhow that's
basically<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:45.100> can<00:03:45.250> find<00:03:45.460> these<00:03:45.550> things

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
basically it you can find these things

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.630 
basically it you can find these things
at<00:03:45.910> Walmart<00:03:46.360> I<00:03:46.600> got<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:46.990> Dunham's<00:03:49.140> Dick's

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
at Walmart I got this Dunham's Dick's

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.560 
at Walmart I got this Dunham's Dick's
pretty<00:03:51.640> much<00:03:51.730> any<00:03:51.910> sporting<00:03:52.270> goods<00:03:52.390> store

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
pretty much any sporting goods store

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.750 
pretty much any sporting goods store
I'll<00:03:52.660> have<00:03:52.810> found<00:03:53.080> practice<00:03:53.500> balls<00:03:53.710> I<00:03:53.980> said

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
I'll have found practice balls I said

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.990 
I'll have found practice balls I said
these<00:03:55.630> foam<00:03:56.020> ones<00:03:56.290> are<00:03:56.890> probably<00:03:57.340> better<00:03:57.760> to

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
these foam ones are probably better to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.360 
these foam ones are probably better to
get<00:03:58.210> the<00:03:58.570> loop<00:03:58.900> just<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.380> hair<00:03:59.650> more<00:03:59.680> expensive

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
get the loop just a hair more expensive

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.700 
get the loop just a hair more expensive
just<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.640> couple<00:04:00.880> dollars<00:04:01.000> but<00:04:01.990> they're<00:04:02.500> kind

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
just a couple dollars but they're kind

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.900 
just a couple dollars but they're kind
of<00:04:02.740> worth<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.310> if<00:04:03.490> they<00:04:03.580> would<00:04:03.670> have<00:04:03.730> had

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
of worth it and if they would have had

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.470 
of worth it and if they would have had
them<00:04:04.120> when<00:04:04.570> I<00:04:04.600> went<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:06.550> got<00:04:06.730> these<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:06.970> would

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
them when I went and got these I would

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.960 
them when I went and got these I would
have<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.900> would<00:04:08.530> have<00:04:08.740> got<00:04:08.950> this<00:04:09.430> one<00:04:09.610> instead

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
have I would have got this one instead

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.870 
have I would have got this one instead
but<00:04:10.330> they<00:04:11.230> didn't<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:11.770> I<00:04:11.980> got<00:04:12.160> those<00:04:12.400> they<00:04:12.820> were

but they didn't so I got those they were

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.570 
but they didn't so I got those they were
good<00:04:13.210> I'll<00:04:13.900> use<00:04:14.170> them<00:04:14.260> till<00:04:14.500> they<00:04:14.650> lose<00:04:15.370> them

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
scupper holes are pretty tall so they

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.650 
scupper holes are pretty tall so they
got<00:04:32.509> a<00:04:32.539> little<00:04:32.600> bit<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.840> room<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.050> work<00:04:33.259> with<00:04:33.320> so
