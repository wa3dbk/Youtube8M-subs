00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.299
 all alone welcome to the review 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.219
 of the naruto episode so listen we did not 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.840
 not had this calm this week but we 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.930
 had I find a great episode in 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.939
 compensation so I'm rather I 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.740
 I'm pretty happy from the beginning 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.900
 incidentally from the episode I could see that 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.840
 it was my team of designers 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.090
 favorite since you know it at every 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.900
 that each episode is entrusted to 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.239
 different teams 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.730
 so the graphics are not always 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.260
 always the same one this one so is my 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.510
 favorite I do not know if it's a team 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.480
 or a draftsman finally, I love them 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.280
 graphics of this episode and it did not 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.390
 that bach to please me from the beginning 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.950
 of the episode 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.660
 so regarding what happened 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.570
 past remember last week 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.800
 our doubist friend will start a 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.840
 new transformation 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.149
 so from the beginning of the episode we see 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.100
 turn into florid zar then he 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.170
 there is a little bit that explain to us 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.089
 that they swallow to several forms etc 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.340
 So that's it's always always 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.509
 interesting to know it as I the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450
 said he turns into species of 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.390
 flora izard and he's starting to send a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.440
 ball to make a jewels bomb to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.190
 huge it's one of the biggest 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.619
 saw in naruto is there then I 'm 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.660
 recalls that in those in this passage 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.179
 there of the episode 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.590
 when it came out in scan it had 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.179
 leaked a lot of ink and had 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.700
 a lot of people if it was a bit hungry 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.319
 which was a little critical etc since 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.060
 it's true that in this episode we can 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.530
 find that there are a lot of things that 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.149
 were a little surprising 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.369
 so let's just say we start with 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.610
 that as I said to protect myself 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.009
 of jewels bomb all the chickens 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.680
 shinobi we're coming out of autumn 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.990
 just with the help of hinault 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.790
 chica brown and the father of kurotsuchi that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.050
 was done like that pays once 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.550
 autumn sunday that's all 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.280
 explained to us since the beginning of the manga 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.090
 that here is to use a chakra nature 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.160
 that was not ours it was 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.540
 really complicated we were well done 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.479
 understand these things right from the beginning of the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.450
 manga we talked about genius for example 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.399
 itachi that used clones to that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.660
 so clones back while he was from 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.670
 basic catone etc 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.080
 without having explained everything here and there 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.060
 have two three minutes everyone 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.530
 learns to do autumn so already 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.760
 that's true it's really 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.540
 questionable I do not know what you in 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.520
 think to leave 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.830
 leave me your opinion on it at all 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.900
 case I remember that in scan it had 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.430
 does it anyway 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.810
 speak so whatever it is the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.760
 autumn is not enough since the bomb 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.160
 of jewelry arrives right to them and there 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.690
 the arrival of the great message and hyundai 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.420
 but where should act sooner and water 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.459
 there have been but here it comes and he 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.470
 save all the railroads migration china 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.209
 denny chin under a little bit 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.980
 like but what he did with ruby 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.370
 at the time in in the village of 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.410
 konoha 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.030
 he manages to deviate so the bomb and we 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.790
 sees happen right after all the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.260
 notebooks so helped at the mines at 20:30 east 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.709
 endowed with jal so helped the center 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.690
 to love and axes and rama and and 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.610
 autobirama opera but you'll notice 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.540
 only to the voice of pain if you have 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.549
 tense the ear so it's rather this 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.049
 rather let's say nice that they arrive 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.640
 now because here we go 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 account that the whole shinobi alliance is 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.880
 still really dirty sheets 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.290
 so it's really good that they arrive 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.489
 that they are coming now to be able to 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.799
 save everyone so then the 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.480
 notebooks so the teenager kage gets put himself 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.910
 put in the sauce of our flora friend 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.140
 izard and so we see second thing that 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.110
 had done a lot of talking we see 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.540
 minato turn into kacm mode so 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.610
 exactly like naruto so that makes it 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.769
 really really really talk about it 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.120
 had very few people who was I 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.560
 remember there were very few people 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.239
 that they agreed with that so 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.370
 minato is transformed then how is it 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.100
 possible knowing he's dead like 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.500
 you know it so saving his fiance 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.180
 lampard whose son and hans van conway 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 he had sealed some of the cully to 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.330
 inside him a part to 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.890
 inside of them 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.040
 the roto and he died a few minutes 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.860
 after so how was he able to train 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
 knowing that Naruto has put almost everything 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.270
 the world has to turn into this mode 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.740
 is to make alliance with him 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.810
 so some people had said 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.800
 that there were two quimby crappy cats 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.380
 what is true there was the chakra 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.580
 negative and positive chaqra people 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.770
 say it's more like the chakra 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.959
 positive that was put in naruto and that 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.080
 that's why in minato excusez 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.760
 me and that's why he was able to 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.350
 much faster to access this stage 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.970
 while naruto with the other part of the 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.470
 chakra that was more complicated to handle 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.990
 in short, that there has been a lot of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.310
 blah blah on it anyway we 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.070
 will come to see them again at the end 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.830
 of the scan anyway so minato 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.840
 turns into kacm we see achi rama 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.820
 gets into sennin mode as really 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.800
 really really really handsome kid and 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.050
 to keep it all that happens 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.880
 also on the ground and makes us a 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.380
 new statement that once again 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.080
 made a lot of ink flow a lot 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.840
 he tells us he wants to become hokage 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.640
 so you remember when that 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.080
 reads talk with the kag and he gets 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.240
 asked if he was going to destroy Caunois 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.400
 or not finally he decided to become 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.500
 hokage so that what is the cac and of 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.690
 konoha despite everything he has despite 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.010
 everything he did here so 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.040
 obviously it makes you laugh the most 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.140
 people and that had also sank 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.780
 a lot of ink here then at the end 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.730
 of this episode so we see now 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.950
 that 's what the training came back 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.440
 team 7 which comes back to the day 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.720
 so know what sakura is and 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.490
 naruto who will be fighting side by side 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.070
 then we stop there for this 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.140
 episode in the in the episode 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.990
 next in the preview we see that 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.110
 sakura also will develop a new 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.280
 power and that the fight will continue from 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.390
 more beautiful here then anyway 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.990
 it was good we were really good 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.300
 and is thus announced to stop these small 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.560
 these little surprises we will say in 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.530

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.900

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.530
 so that everyone has used the 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.570
 autumn what do you think of 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.760

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.719
 small points that were significant

 in this episode and who had done like 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.800
