 Year hosted Shakira and welcome to a guest the clip of 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.359
 someone the transfer is a few months in the ORF whether it stands 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.669
 Year was unfortunately only moderately successful so far 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.989
 Maybe it's because he 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.059
 not quite as many assembly makes it is therefore experiencable does not make any 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.009
 Escape gives those themselves 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.220
 and yes he knows 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.360
 now just not the people who can or can not place it 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.720
 not quite as lucky as me, for example, or the stout one 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.040
 Percent and yes, not every clip has the local announce 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.490
 Nonetheless, it is a very good gamer 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.080
 almost every 200 the guys and I said 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.620
 come the world must see that too 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.960
 good, Cardoso said 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.890
 someone who can do so much indium so well 12% of the bass can do it 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.109
 Do not just dare so way and have him bring in gameplay GBP 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 and yes he sent it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.450
 he plays with the 1 on it has the red visor of our network 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.190
 Dexterity per holiday per pound nee nee 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 and yes the very special he plays there domination 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 he plays percent of Imboden attack mode nine to nine 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.270
 and produces percent the originals end second pass so do not serve percent 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.420
 everyday life something is now twitching on stage 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 and year for Schalke's attacker was only light 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.800
 and Diarra it would certainly be happy and 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.770
 do not be happy now 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.430
 Unia the Wars 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.210
 to today's gameplay 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.630
 and have fun doing the work that the primary meant from Höhn 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.670
 in the background, music was playing in the background 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.620
 I'll do that from now on, but not every single one percent 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.570
 because year 30 kilos 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.020
 but sometimes I want to play without music 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.540
 Make percent of himself as before 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.270
 and yes I hope this danger clearly 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.270
 and that relaxes a bit on this summer music there in the background 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.099
 and the 2 percent 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 stand below in the description 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.949
 and since he has none 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.639
 There are questions 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.189
 Porr and year the Wars

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.189
 Percent I worked the Causa cutlets 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.569

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.209
 And yes, I am pleased, of course, happy resistance 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.350
 Anyway, Biel is when he first the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.359
 Partner of ducks which is just the white house in the 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.319
 the number 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.329
 from the action several times missing the target 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.719
 that one will achieve something 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.329
 man man Hanks "So 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.510
 you are already halfway known there are people who know one 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.250
 and yes of course it is always sad Mertesacker human use percent numbers 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.829
 at the comments and then notified and water vapor on 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.279
 Percent that is 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.719
 goes uphill and that brews plenty 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.600
 the percent must be in one 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.999
 from the FBI 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.089

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.619
 and which one does that also hear his breaks 500 mark cracked 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.190
 I do not have exactly what I had from 140 employees and 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.889
 about 6600 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.269
 but it remained the shore's percent Yvan manpower to do and so to speak 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.489
 after Holzhausen pause whistle 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.329
 and yes we want to do a working meeting together Stuntman is not one now 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.450
 Get through for its course of the festival since percent of it still consequences 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.679
 many people miss 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:57.199
 but percent we thought about finding an mp3 and destroying it 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:03.419
 and yes you have heard right so far he ran because 6 2 Hoffmann this 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.609
 no MB 2 percent though on the 8th 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.199
 and yes that has the reason the exact I persuaded him percent May 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.639
 A lot of people like to form liaison people Oliver 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.519
 Beneke was a bit more popular for him 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.550
 and yes he said percent in one of us apparently made that of us like it 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.449
 Percent of these are not fighters that the Canucks overflowed his people 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.099
 With bags and years began to look like that percent watching there is 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.870
 no problem 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.849
 and 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.659
 Percent of the appointment is not fixed yet 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:44.129
 privately he does not carry on per cent work very much the Odette has experienced in 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.919
 «The Sun» the broken playstation controller and imports 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.710
 had repaired screwed up but there was even more shredded and yes he 

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:51.580
 was 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.789
 pretty angry 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.009
 Knappik had the doctors for something like that 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.999
 and just get excited about clicking the look gate we'll be in fourth 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.909
 the subscribers 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:00.870
 divide 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.199
 the television 15 20 of it and of me percent each are divided and 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.199
 Percent under a second day may compete 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:10.960
 and year 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.810
 maybe we manage to get in shape with gambling and not only 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.259
 observe 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.310
 Value then each take the kick and percent 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:19.780
 Miss Dr 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.389
 either normal to each other a possessed Montes what do they do after that 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.430
 the pros are 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.370
 Loya «I hope that people will join in, I hope that is 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.819
 Meanwhile, Roddick stopped and, frankly, I already 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.470
 Euro a year 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.419
 that I also want to address now 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.309
 Percent because I still work a bit of time 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.969
 "I'm off 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.990
 almost no school any more than I do not have any school anymore because it's ok for me 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:51.910
 No one in the school is the Hornets the trap for school week 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.800
 and last week presumably final under pressure but there is no 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.719
 Trouble reason for four five six seven people 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.580
 Euro the AHL next week it lure two trips and further it said 

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:08.029
 by distribution and then I have nine weeks vacation in Germany 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:13.689
 I think that a little less noticed in Luxembourg for example and yes 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.810
 I was pretty questions where the construction law goes on vacation so fly it 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:23.289
 not value Fischbeck at such a month in Vienna percent then often times after 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.200
 Lower Austria Upper Austria were 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.800
 in the country, the light intensity or what the finest not in the well 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.529
 Percent perhaps it embittered Italy 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:34.800
 because it's a few relatives 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.339
 Crown 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:39.740
 Yartey it is not fixed yet fixed 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.250
 but there are certainly enough people missing percent or even since 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.509
 Have booked months 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.479
 i just wanted it because i just ask where it is going in the 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.699
 Caribbean for here to have more money 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.800
 to Spain Italy percent Sweden 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.020
 America New Zealand made it the destination countries of the world 

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:01.789
 Euro and Yaris is an interesting topic supporting percent 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:05.879
 write in the comments and drive here and maybe even off 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.639
 why the FWG through the parents 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.589
 Maybe you are old enough and I drive alone 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.349
 and the nature of the work 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.349
 Also for this it is sufficient because the weight is reached 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.309
 SZ the atomic bomb as the game ended prematurely 

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:26.359
 and yes the corps is I think 53 percent right that the 

00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:29.659
 Sony Vegas is wrong that they will be the windows gg 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:34.530
 and I hope the gameplay has been safe Captain has paid it 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.649
 Musicians run through and decade until next time 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.330
