write that down and we'll visit that
later

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.850 

or<00:04:25.430> LCM<00:04:26.180> you're<00:04:26.330> suggesting<00:04:26.770> okay<00:04:28.780> yeah<00:04:29.860> LCD

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
or LCM you're suggesting okay yeah LCD

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.180 
or LCM you're suggesting okay yeah LCD
as<00:04:30.950> well<00:04:31.130> okay<00:04:32.090> sounds<00:04:32.690> good<00:04:32.920> okay<00:04:33.920> when<00:04:34.100> we

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
as well okay sounds good okay when we

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.630 
as well okay sounds good okay when we
look<00:04:34.400> here<00:04:35.620> hmm<00:04:36.620> if<00:04:36.680> I<00:04:36.770> want<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.010> increase<00:04:37.430> this

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
look here hmm if I want to increase this

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.050 
look here hmm if I want to increase this
what<00:04:38.210> operation<00:04:38.780> should<00:04:39.020> i<00:04:39.050> use<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:40.760> reach

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
what operation should i use to reach

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.460 
what operation should i use to reach
here<00:04:41.500> x<00:04:42.500> 3<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.120> didn't<00:04:44.470> multiplication

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
here x 3 so you didn't multiplication

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.460 
here x 3 so you didn't multiplication
okay<00:04:46.160> all<00:04:46.760> right<00:04:46.970> and<00:04:47.300> then<00:04:47.870> what<00:04:48.140> did<00:04:48.230> I<00:04:48.320> have

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
to do here then and what do you get 12

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.180 
to do here then and what do you get 12
okay<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.170> then<00:04:55.040> on<00:04:55.310> this<00:04:55.520> one<00:04:56.560> times<00:04:57.560> ten<00:04:57.770> nice

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
okay and then on this one times ten nice

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.540 
okay and then on this one times ten nice
nice<00:04:59.380> ok<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:00.770> then<00:05:00.919> what<00:05:00.950> do<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.160> have<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.340> do

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
nice ok so then what do I have to do

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.380 
nice ok so then what do I have to do
they're<00:05:02.230> not<00:05:03.230> subtract<00:05:03.730> multiply<00:05:04.730> by<00:05:04.880> 10<00:05:05.090> good

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
they're not subtract multiply by 10 good

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.390 
they're not subtract multiply by 10 good
and<00:05:05.900> that's<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.380> I<00:05:06.410> think<00:05:06.530> we<00:05:06.860> have<00:05:06.890> enough<00:05:07.220> now

please<00:05:47.840> take<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.169> off<00:05:48.229> I'm<00:05:48.410> going<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:48.590> be

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
please take it off I'm going to be

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.110 
please take it off I'm going to be
collecting<00:05:49.130> it<00:05:49.250> it<00:05:49.370> is<00:05:49.490> going<00:05:49.700> to<00:05:49.760> be<00:05:49.850> for<00:05:50.090> a

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
collecting it it is going to be for a

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.620 
collecting it it is going to be for a
grade<00:05:50.330> so<00:05:51.080> put<00:05:51.260> your<00:05:51.410> name<00:05:51.590> on<00:05:51.620> both<00:05:51.950> I<00:05:55.630> really

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
grade so put your name on both I really

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.600 
grade so put your name on both I really
do<00:05:56.840> believe<00:05:56.990> in<00:05:57.320> cooperative<00:05:57.890> groups<00:05:58.280> it

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
do believe in cooperative groups it

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.020 
do believe in cooperative groups it
gives<00:05:59.090> me<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.330> opportunity<00:05:59.720> to<00:06:00.290> walk<00:06:00.590> around

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
gives me the opportunity to walk around

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.659 
gives me the opportunity to walk around
to<00:06:02.110> informally<00:06:03.110> assess<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.860> students<00:06:04.340> and

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
to informally assess the students and

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.900 
to informally assess the students and
that<00:06:05.570> way<00:06:05.870> I<00:06:05.900> can<00:06:06.320> see<00:06:06.530> where<00:06:06.890> to<00:06:07.010> go<00:06:07.160> next<00:06:07.460> or

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
that way I can see where to go next or

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.750 
that way I can see where to go next or
perhaps<00:06:08.840> maybe<00:06:09.610> differentiate<00:06:10.610> the

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
perhaps maybe differentiate the

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.240 
perhaps maybe differentiate the
instruction<00:06:11.390> at<00:06:11.510> that<00:06:11.720> time<00:06:12.050> based<00:06:12.440> on<00:06:12.740> the

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
instruction at that time based on the

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.280 
instruction at that time based on the
information<00:06:13.550> that<00:06:14.000> I'm<00:06:14.270> gathering<00:06:14.540> as<00:06:14.960> I<00:06:14.990> walk

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
information that I'm gathering as I walk

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.460 
information that I'm gathering as I walk
around<00:06:15.470> I<00:06:16.070> also<00:06:17.000> think<00:06:17.450> it's<00:06:17.630> very<00:06:17.810> important

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
around I also think it's very important

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.590 
around I also think it's very important
to<00:06:18.530> do<00:06:18.740> independent<00:06:19.430> work<00:06:19.490> so<00:06:20.120> that<00:06:20.300> I<00:06:20.540> can

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
to do independent work so that I can

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.590 
to do independent work so that I can
assess<00:06:21.310> formerly<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.490> student<00:06:23.150> trying<00:06:23.450> to

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
assess formerly the student trying to

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.710 
assess formerly the student trying to
complete<00:06:24.110> one<00:06:24.710> of<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:24.979> problems<00:06:25.550> and<00:06:25.729> attempt

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
complete one of the problems and attempt

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.770 
complete one of the problems and attempt
the<00:06:26.870> problem<00:06:27.380> and<00:06:27.500> see<00:06:27.890> what<00:06:28.729> steps<00:06:29.510> they're

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
the problem and see what steps they're

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.409 
the problem and see what steps they're
taking<00:06:29.810> and<00:06:30.440> if<00:06:30.740> my<00:06:30.950> instruction<00:06:31.610> assisted<00:06:32.270> in

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
taking and if my instruction assisted in

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.370 
taking and if my instruction assisted in
that<00:06:32.630> process<00:06:32.870> to<00:06:33.320> solve<00:06:33.770> the<00:06:33.919> problem
