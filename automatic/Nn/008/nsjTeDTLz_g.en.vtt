00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 Good morning, the beauty guys are here. 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.099
 with a xr flex 2014 14 and a 2010 that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.070
 It's not flex yet. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.100
 good this death of my friend Gustavo is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.800
 changing a pawn here on the port street 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.609
 for those who do not know the port street 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:28.859
 ends a beautiful tourist spot 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.160
 but it 's a good thing not to talk about death 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.110
 Good. Let's get it from the front to the back. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.489
 The first thing they changed is here. 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.790
 O compliment told her she told 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.160
 baby it's too short, right? 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.840
 He leaves the water from here, I can 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.719
 be that comes in the guy's face 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.440
 you can not see the distance the size 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.660
 his 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 and this one is the size of him is much more 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.809
 than a hand span a finger 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.370
 leaning over here, look at the stick 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.520
 there will now O looks the difference 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.290
 You see, it's almost six centimeters in there. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.140
 this is the first modification they have done 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.120
 on this bike because of the mud it throws 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.010
 here, as I already said and goes to 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:29.020
 guy's second face mod is é 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:32.160
 visible on the side cowlings that 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.770
 change changed down here in the fairing 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.510
 She's a sucker for this lightweight motorcycle. 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:44.140
 in the match and this carnage here she is 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.250
 interesting here that is another piece 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.440
 right 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.330
 the third modification tank 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.640
 fuel as well as if your motorcycle 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.970
 I ended up with 2 liters more 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.310
 the bike flex tank 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 this one fits 2 liters less 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.100
 fourth modification fuel pump 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.110
 in the fuel pump of this bike flex 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 it stays inside the fuel tank 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.620
 is this bike here the fuel pump 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:22.209
 her staying down here 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.900
 under the tank right fifth 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.060
 modification they did on this bike 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.340
 here is the head 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.090
 this one a video candle is a candle 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.209
 a thinner candle for 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.870
 decrease the chance of 30 in the head and a 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.000
 problem on that bike 30 in the head then 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.560
 change on sale here I do not know if it will 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.410
 to give illegal form 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.390
 but here table the spark plug and 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.350
 now let's see the sale of that here this 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:05.450
 motorcycle that 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.450
 It is a certain differentiated sail 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.830
 a different candle is here is a 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.990
 What part do you have in my place? 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.230
 I do not know what this is 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.350
 I do not know what this is but it 's a 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.630
 Modification, you can see this bike. 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.810
 that did not give this piece there are 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.350
 mod tanaka person 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.120
 the head because it is the finest candle 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.600
 and increased the wall boy risk of 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:48.600
 leakage and cracking in the head 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.810
 the staff is dry is to improve too 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.940
 This babysitting business looks here. 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.010
 can see the love that is with 1 4 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:02.520
 km 12,000 km km 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.970
 you see that it is leaking into the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.930
 gasket and head gasket 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.470
 of the engine down the engine 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:20.220
 the other modification is one more thing of the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:24.210
 The head is the head of xr and 2014 he 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:29.370
 has another conversion rate because it is 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.610
 driven can be moved to total 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.800
 conversion of this xr head plus 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:41.370
 old is smaller than the other one is right 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.919
 Is this from here now has an option of abs 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.509
 In this one I think that 2009 had already 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:51.150
 s option 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:54.449
 No, I do not remember now, I do not remember. 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.139
 Now that is good wheel tire size 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:02.550
 the same tank even the rear scale is the 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:07.740
 same of the rest I think in a very 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:12.199
 more thing is not so big change in the 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:16.500
 moto changed the spelling the graphics the colors 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:19.830
 but there are practically 66 modifications there 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.870
 we had on both bikes 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.169
 It's okay to be getting better at this. 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.889
 motor problem that this bike has a 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:33.349
 blackout and headscrap 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:41.580
 it's okay then too here xr model 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:47.690
 1414 flex is here at xr and 2010 a 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:52.430
 gasoline is sure taken farther than 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:58.670
 the two motorcycles né 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.530
 then it is are two very nice bikes and 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.890
 there I would like you to find it there 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:08.630
 a good partner for us there by 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:12.530
 motorcycle recommends this liked said that 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:18.040
 will replace the head gasket, right? 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:22.520
 since exactly but the rest is just walking 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:25.240
 Only beauty and beauty with this beautiful view. 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:36.920
 the piracicaba river 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:49.330

 and new brand new bridge here as 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.330
 old 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:07:01.400
 here is the old sugar mill 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:10.180
 as well on the ramp where the boat descends 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:11.510
 Where will you be at these very cool bar?
