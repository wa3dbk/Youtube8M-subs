00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.820
 and is just called as in my 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.230
 document now adventure map for fabi 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.340
 so I just assume that times 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 she has no name or stands 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.190
 something now tip yes we are curious 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.170
 and I think really good as crass the 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.300
 adventure webspace arrive so find 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.059
 I really really good or we really 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.790
 make time here at night and 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.470
 gen pena thanks in any case for that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.879
 I have to do it again and again 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.680
 Thought because I realize you correctly 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 crass but also the last pixelpark where 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 I talked about topics, for example 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.050
 there were indeed the rating at 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.850
 pixel x the rating no longer 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.040
 so blatant but comments you have 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
 written a lot and find that 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.079
 I really cool so thanks to everyone 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 case for that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.579
 and then we watch the story 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.500
 So read like you are in one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.240
 prison for a murder and want it 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.740
 fly as fast as possible 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.869
 but you have to go past the guards 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.289
 fortunately, no idea of ​​minecraft 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.450
 So you have loose vegetables of all riddles 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.080
 around the guards and around 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.880
 escape 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.380
 yes that have washed here 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.090
 maybe he is what texture 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 Incidentally, I always use when used 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.450
 that varies half that you can always in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.369
 the description by these people looks 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.349
 by the description of this always 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.030
 very important so always keep that in mind 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:41.160
 first inventories claude stay okay 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.149
 not so much at waking room one 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.250
 comic spiros if no waking though 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.959
 no guards please place her like that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.330
 that there were actually doing or something 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.300
 not matter that they are easy 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.220
 We think that wading into the water first 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.000
 ask which blog is the daylight 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.770
 Sensor the switch direction has nothing 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.679
 with ok they 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:11.380
 wrong okay good 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:17.200
 second question how do you get 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.200
 I believe that here you are 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.110
 resistance value are you what is that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.230
 resistance of matt rocking tnt 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.019
 I had the easy league against strong 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.959
 the youtuber against gonna gonna lead the 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.510
 Wake and fly through her chamber 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.209
 the chamber of which all ask everyone 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.650
 for me, of course, nothing too 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.720
 should now be here to watch or what 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.799

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.799
 I stay on as they have to play 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.220
 it would be a favor 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.220

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.400

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.980
 over and up from the prison 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.290

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.980
 So that with the heads I find the 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.660
 not made in itself the map the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.900
 bavaria not bad built but the 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.430
 was so short I have to say we go 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 now very short in game mode 0 and 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.600
 I'll see if that works now 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.660
 with the weapons come pixel has 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.380
 So a kind of pixel from we look now 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.240
 so it was really so short 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.500
 I did not expect that but one 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.580
 bit with command plates on each 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.260
 case worked with rescue 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.630
 bad I found the more you did not 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.310

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.370
 I am sorry that the web is so short 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.230
 I can not do that because I knew that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.720
 I did not know how to do it 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.720
 if you are normal 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:11.459
