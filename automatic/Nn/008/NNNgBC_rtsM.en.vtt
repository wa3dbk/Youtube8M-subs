00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.429
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.880
 hum at the request of some channel users 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:15.920
 asked me to do some 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.920
 videos explaining about 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.150
 some about some aspects of the system 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.579
 android operational nÃ© 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.250
 in the installation the operation of 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.019
 applications but some explain about 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.309
 some subjects that we use a lot 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:37.449
 how they want the fourth and last round and 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:41.500
 cover anyway because this is the 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.690
 first video of this series is and therefore 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.190
 in my opinion the most important 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.839
 I was talking about one of the aspects 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.620
 most important in the operating system 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.500
 android I want in the system 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.969
 operating system has either windows 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.199
 a goal has them with a drive also has 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.719
 one and linux 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.679
 obviously also has the best of pipes 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:10.149
 from my opinion the woo card used 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:12.429
 on android for example android 4.0 is 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:18.479
 a linux kernel is based on the kernel 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:20.649
 linux in my case it's a mistake 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.329
 customized right 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.610
 it is based on the linux kernel 30 15 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:32.530
 3.0.1 15 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.500
 and I'm hurting in Corsica 17 is one for 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.110
 I was the best the most economical 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.030
 I've been using it since yesterday 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.530
 morning six thirty in the morning when I took 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.040
 of the charger 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:50.000
 today we are already now it is already 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.780
 the out there that's wrong right wrong 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.730
 today season 8 hours and 16 minutes later 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.660
 I tried to set this time that 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.910
 Later if not tomorrow, I'll be late. 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.520
 I do not want to think that when I was 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.210
 stirring in the bread that I am changing by 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.670
 get worse 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:17.230
 wilson 8 hours and 15 minutes I have 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:20.360
 still 42% of battery to battery also 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.950
 I want and it's not just for saving 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.340
 battery it is much more important 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.800
 that this is the part of the system 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.250
 which is closer to the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.670
 hardware exist 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.260
 no I would not say layers but the system 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.690
 operational it works in a let 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.790
 call layers for now we have the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.950
 operating system 10 ours 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.670
 android dolls here we have the 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.670
 operational system 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.370
 we have the kernel 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.440
 and we have the water 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.280
 it's not convenient android dolls years 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 here to explain 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.170
 the first one here that the hardware is 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.069
 here in front and he is a lazy not 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.129
 wants to function 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.969
 I do not want to walk so who's going to do it? 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.969
 with him to walk 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.049
 I just want that I want to myself 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.970
 also does nothing 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:30.200
 it is necessary that the operating system 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:33.560
 android push and even push me the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.790
 hardware or the operating system 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.790
 android captain on what the user 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.189
 He asked the wants and I answered 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.560
 requesting by doing this by 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.590
 requesting the hardware so that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.599
 the best possible performance 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.950
 that request for example when the 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.700
 your active same operating system 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.959
 android and easy 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.989
 this movement that I am the user that 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.780
 I'm introducing an action system 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.720
 sending is operating recognizing 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.459
 requests to the kernel so that the 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.889
 processor for example work one 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.239
 A little faster when I'm 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:22.699
 playing new 3 my addiction right? 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.880
 I will introduce information to the 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.909
 driving range or system 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.909
 operational 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.780
 respond by making your quote to either 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.300
 which in turn causes the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.630
 hardware to respond in the way it is 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.759
 necessary to make everything work well 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.949
 then memory management 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:45.889
 CPU operation management right 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.110
 all this is what it is and what it does 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.449
 Of course he alone does nothing 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.539
 I need an operating system to capture the 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.970
 information passed to the kernel to 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.300
 that he requests the hardware 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.569
 when you connect the mhl cable here 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.050
 it is what makes a recognition that 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.080
 allows your smartphone to 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.659
 work with this car right there 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.520
 then you want is not the core of the heart 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:19.880
 android operating system which is a 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.159
 linux younger brother on linux too 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.280
 You have the possibility of staying 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.169
 mod modifications an android is not 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.599
 an exception 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.419
 I hope it has been possible to understand 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:37.810
 It's kind of over there, right? 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.810
 o a kernel thanks for this
