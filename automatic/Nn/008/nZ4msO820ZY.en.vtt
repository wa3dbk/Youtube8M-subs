00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Good evening, do you live here? 

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:05.000
 - Yes. - Yes? What is your name? 

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:07.000
 - Kim - Okay Kim, please stand back. 

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:10.500
 We have reports of underage noise and drinking. 

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.000
 Everyone will sit down, it will take a while. 

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.000
 Do you have anything sharp about me that I can inject? 

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.000
 No. 

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.900
 It is well. Because I do. 

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.500
 THIS IS A MAGIC MIKE 

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.500
 THIS ARE HIGH PRICE CUSTOMERS 

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.900
 I usually pay for what I do in my work. 

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.000
 MIKE HAS MONEY 

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.000
 Wau, a busy man! 

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.000
 Welcome to the unique Magic Mike on stage! 

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:39.500
 MIKE HAS FANKS 

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.000
 You're a husband they'll never have. 

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.500
 You're the dream guy who never gets past them. 

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.000
 BUT MIKE WANT SOMETHING MORE 

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:54.000
 This is a cool table. Did you make that? 

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:56.000
 You should sell it. 

00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:57.800
 That's just what I want. 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.000
 THIS SUMMER 

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.900
 - My sister. - Mike ... 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.800
 Oh, thanks, Mike. 

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.000
 Where do you know my brother? 

00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.000
 Um, I'm running a few businesses ... 

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:07.500
 Hey, are you following my sister? 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.500
 Well, we talked ... 

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.000
 - Stripper-entrepreneur-stripper - Probably both. 

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:15.000
 I was hoping it was just a joke. 

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:17.500
 But he's pretty funny. 

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.000
 I'm just trying to figure out why a stripper. 

00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:24.700
 Women, money and fun. 

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.500
 Try to put yourself in the role of people who live through the day, not vampires. 

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.000
 We're arguing? Is this our first argument? 

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.500
 WHEN YOUR LIFE IS FANTAZIA 

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.000
 What would really make you happy? 

00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:38.300
 Custom furniture. 

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.500
 Custom furniture? You have to be very skilled. 

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.500
 How do you deal with reality? 

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.900
 I can't live like you. 

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.900
 Does Magic Mike talk to you now? 

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:49.500
 He's not my real life. 

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.000
 And do you believe what you just said? 

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:52.200
 CHANNING TATUM 

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.000
 ALEX PETTYFER 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.000
 CODY HORN 

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:57.300
 OLIVIA MUNN 

00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:58.800
 and MATHEW McCONAUGHEY 

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.500
 The rule is: Don't touch. 

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.000
 But I think I see a lot of violators. 

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.000
 - You only have a little change. - I have a couple of fives. 

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:12.000
 - Okay, and twenty? - You don't want to know what I have to do for twenty. 

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.000
 WITHOUT PANTS 

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.900
 - Then come to see? - No. 

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.000
 You just said you liked our performance. 

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:21.500
 That doesn't mean I'm going back there. 

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:23.000
