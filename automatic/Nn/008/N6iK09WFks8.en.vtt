00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
boards each of the board has all the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
boards each of the board has all the
different<00:01:04.500> toys<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.460> often<00:01:05.880> found<00:01:06.150> in

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
different toys that are often found in

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.280 
different toys that are often found in
the<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.800> you<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.640> books<00:01:09.020> each<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the can you see what I see books each of

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.490 
the can you see what I see books each of
these<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.850> done<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> different<00:01:12.510> pattern<00:01:12.690> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
these is done in a different pattern so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.370 
these is done in a different pattern so
for<00:01:13.740> example<00:01:14.190> while<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.850> spring<00:01:15.570> may<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
for example while the spring may be here

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
for example while the spring may be here
on<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
on this one it's over here in this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.680 
on this one it's over here in this
corner<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.670> up<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.000> corner<00:01:21.570> over

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
corner this one up in this corner over

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.649 
corner this one up in this corner over
here<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> over<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.270> say<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:24.600> will

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
here and over here and you say what will

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.030 
here and over here and you say what will
you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.170> rotate<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> boards<00:01:25.830> but

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you know you can rotate the boards but

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.480 
you know you can rotate the boards but
the<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.970> variations<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.930> there<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> each

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the the variations are there so each

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.850 
the the variations are there so each
player<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> board<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.660> front<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:31.170> them<00:01:31.289> and

player has a board in front of them and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.080 
player has a board in front of them and
let's<00:01:32.009> take<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.220> closer<00:01:32.430> look<00:01:32.580> at<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> board

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
let's take a closer look at the board

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.650 
let's take a closer look at the board
here<00:01:34.430> what<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> player<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:35.940> do<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.240> their<00:01:36.390> turn

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
of these little green hexagons

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.520 
of these little green hexagons
and<00:01:41.910> you<00:01:42.600> say<00:01:43.220> spring<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:46.020> everybody

a<00:03:28.710> tutorial<00:03:29.250> teaching<00:03:30.030> game<00:03:30.270> this<00:03:30.570> actually

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
a tutorial teaching game this actually

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.010 
a tutorial teaching game this actually
can<00:03:31.140> work<00:03:31.320> pretty<00:03:31.620> well<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:33.420> kids<00:03:33.660> can<00:03:33.840> look

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
can work pretty well the kids can look

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.900 
can work pretty well the kids can look
at<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.380> say<00:03:34.470> hey<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.370> best<00:03:35.640> move

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
at it and say hey this is the best move

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.310 
at it and say hey this is the best move
for<00:03:35.940> me<00:03:36.150> at<00:03:36.210> this<00:03:36.300> point<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.630> pick<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.080> one

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
for me at this point to pick this one

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.500 
for me at this point to pick this one
because<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.710> will<00:03:37.830> connect<00:03:38.310> my<00:03:38.910> sides<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
because it will connect my sides of the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.750 
because it will connect my sides of the
board<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.470> game<00:03:40.710> I<00:03:40.740> think<00:03:40.920> works<00:03:41.370> best

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
board so this game I think works best

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.940 
board so this game I think works best
for<00:03:41.910> four-year-olds<00:03:42.830> kindergarten<00:03:43.830> age

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
for four-year-olds kindergarten age

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.950

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
maybe first grade they're the ones we're

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.380 
maybe first grade they're the ones we're
gonna<00:03:46.050> get<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.650> best<00:03:46.980> out<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.460> this<00:03:47.820> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
gonna get this the best out of this the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.450 
gonna get this the best out of this the
