00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.460
 hey people what's up there from hetzner 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.690
 another video to the song of the need 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.700
 Again and again I show you two 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.199
 Tricks in my opinion right 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.359
 The first is about how cool 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.600
 to fill a bunny hop with a truck 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.279
 can 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.830
 the second time I tell you how to enter 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.470
 can use board to make skateboard 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.699
 Let's go around with a bunny hop 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.769
 a truck needs to run 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.810
 Of course, first of all a truck for that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.700
 you call pegasus on truck scania 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.920
 Buy rostock on the website 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.960
 the hot mill and exactly this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 You will then select vehicle there 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.739
 so that it will not be delivered 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.969
 completely delivered that means it will be at the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.070
 next location near you 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.930
 placed and sit down now 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.430
 Just score a point with me 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.620
 on the beach here there you turn mobile 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.719
 definitely needs this trick 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.030
 Two people set up to perform 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.860
 has front on it the way I did it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.390
 the other sits down on the driver 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 Production and driving with the vehicle 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.570
 Go ahead and conquer the top of the truck 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.160
 it says on the can now decide 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.840
 When does the vehicle install job 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.729
 just by jumping, that's his name 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.830
 press on the playstation 3 the four 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.689
 Quarters on the xbox are wegs button 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.970
 currently there are even smaller jumps 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.500
 abl expects to see the truck immediately 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.790
 a bit more ride has included 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.340
 then it can even happen 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 that the truck makes a rash what 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.180
 pretty cool and something simple from 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.409
 outside also really cool looks still 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.790
 cool that maybe that one there 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.140
 can roll the friend this trick 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.939
 you do not know yet as only 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.409
 buddy the rake with the truck drives and he 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.610
 does not know the trick, just get started 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.409
 jump on the front and jump up 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.490
 you'll see in the other one 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.290
 example , the whole of the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 Another draws you notice as a driver 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.049
 not only really why the vehicle 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.009
 jump high if you can not do the trick 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.780
 one knows here seen 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.579
 My buddy just got up on it 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 once have made the rash and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.220
 that looks pretty cool in any case 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.899
 out and can the buddy right 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.280
 We wonder how we do it 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.140
 continue with the next trick namely 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 So how to make a board as a skateboard 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.159
 in the gta 5 online mode can use 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.909
 of course, but also in the offline mode man 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.560
 Lust has needed for the next trick 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.420
 you a titan and you get on the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.640
 best in the very south of the international 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.960
 lausanne airport from time to time 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.939
 Of course you can do trick this time 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560
 You are there alone 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.720
 arrived as you can see here 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.160
 already decide in the sentences and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.900
 Just go with the one in a free 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.360
 area you have that done by 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.220
 ng 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.230
 an arbitrary weapon with her 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.060
 can the did in the air blast 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.070
 Grenade launcher can also be quite 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.150
 normal sc is four or similar 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.680
 he flew in the air 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.300
 look around such small boards 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.710
 here is already one in front of me 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.030
 That could definitely be for the trick 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.470
 I'll show you how that works 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.510
 whole out of sight of other people 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.100
 looks like my buddy elias has now 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.930
 already such a board found for the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.330
 but we can not see it anyway 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.770
 See it get rid of right now 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.900
 he always telephones himself from place to place 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.730
 and that's how it looks to others 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.290
 people from my own view, I think 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.180
 the whole thing is even a bit 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.800
 cooler that we will now see if 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.660
 We on our own board on it 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.580
 you have to face the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.959
 own corner of the board and shoot 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.200
 Just look at the other and you see 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.970
 beautiful 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.800
 you drive slowly and there can be one 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.690
 lots of fun because you can with buddies 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.190
 make and a little exercise takes as 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.560
 you can record right ride without 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.700
 that one flies from the part also 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.260
 Of course that's just a technical thing 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.270
 do not give it a pc or money 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.400
 get or other but I think about 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.320
 fun it's all about needs online gta 5 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.880
 as I said just on one side 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.350
 of the board put on the other side 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.790
 shoot the bed you do not have to 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.410
 shoot all the way to the other side 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.970
 it's enough if you just before 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.100
 you shoot that means relatively central 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.180
 then on the board you can do the board 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.680
 maybe even a bit under 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.360
 keep control because that's pretty 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.860
 difficult the board under control 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.900
 times so that it is not all in the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.070
 circle turns but after a bit of exercise 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.209
 this is clearly the fight in any case 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.440
 maybe do little tricks 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.700
 CIRCULAR DANCE like I am in there now 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.200
 did live background 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.430
 that was it in any case 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.959
 video were in my opinion two 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.610
 really cool tricks fell to it 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.959
 leave it under now I have 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.549
 Vacation then maybe in the future 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.080

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.400
 Come on next week, look forward to it
