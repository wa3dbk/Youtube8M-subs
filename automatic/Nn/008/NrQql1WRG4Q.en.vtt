of were similar I think until 2006 or 7

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.990 
of were similar I think until 2006 or 7
and<00:02:02.289> they<00:02:02.440> revamped<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.039> cases<00:02:03.519> and<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.700> couple

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:05.769 
things for better durability and they

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:08.910 
things for better durability and they
were<00:02:05.890> they<00:02:06.280> were<00:02:06.310> really<00:02:06.819> good<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.679> so<00:02:08.679> I
