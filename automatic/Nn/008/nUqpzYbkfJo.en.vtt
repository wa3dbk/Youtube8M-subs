00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.889
 sony xperia z3 if he wants to know that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.660
 what's up with my status bar like 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.519
 I came to this service menu 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.410
 why a homescreen looks so funny 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.690
 or you want to know how its display 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.090
 is lit as well as I like it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 then stay tuned and enjoy that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.189
 video now it starts I wish you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.019
 have fun 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 We start with a secret service 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.309
 menu that you about the dialer so that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.340
 phone reaches phone open 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.200
 asterisk rhombus asterisk rhombus service 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.420
 rhombus asterisk rhombus asterisk 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 type in and the menu will open 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.890
 serbia and the choice between four 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.809
 further mues and we choose 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.239
 service tests here can all now 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.739
 to test important functions 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 Functioned touchscreen reliable 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.879
 So even in all corners the lights 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.260
 lightning when he should work the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.300
 speakers and the vibration 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.980
 reliable all that and much more 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.969
 you can test it here take a look 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.830
 just a similar menu 1 the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.950
 is much better looks and looks 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.960
 Sony in the phone information 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.760
 Settings via the telephone diagnosis 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530
 and device testing are the steps the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 are necessary 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.590
 Here too, the most important can be 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.509
 to test things for functions 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.159
 why you should do it anyway 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 it would be useful, for example, if 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.500
 to buy a used smartphone like 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.150
 always know her knowledge 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.100
 continues 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.780
 Tip 2 is the smart against 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.390
 light control and it needs a little bit 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 preparation to demonstrate it to you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.340
 First of all , we set the display 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.240
 time out so the resting state on 15 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.220
 seconds 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 Let's leave the display untouched 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.229
 Switched as desired after 15 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.549
 seconds off but I activate the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.310
 intelligent against light control 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.930
 This does not happen to z 3 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.939
 registered that for example one 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.430
 reads text or looks at a photo and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.649
 the display stays on working fine 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.460
 and reliable good thing 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.840
 Tip 3 makes for a tidy 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.250
 notification bar who knows it 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.409
 not you have a new game 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.959
 installed and says it all urges you 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.480
 few hours an offer on who that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.970
 not like the can in the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.730
 personalization 1 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.560
 the notifications manage her 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.810
 do not want any notifications from 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.410
 Just play the games or other apps 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.270
 remove hook and says you have rest 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.310
 the calibration of a display is 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.340
 always a thing for everyone 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.680
 own taste which one too cold 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.620
 is the other too bluish too warm 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.480
 Displays often look yellow as well 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 already with the co2 can the display 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.610
 of the z3 according to own wishes 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.250
 off in the display settings and there 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.260
 call the point white balance and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.570
 now just set exactly that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.850
 What do you like like you blue here 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.730
 we want a bit more red and green 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.140
 do not see it at all 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.420
 do you know the missed calls 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.360
 screenshot taken there next to it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.040
 the time of the battery status wireless bluetooth 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.560
 and network services and zack is the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.050
 complete status bar full of icons 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.810
 locked on it has no desire of the can 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.520
 bring in a little order 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.709
 Settings Personalization status 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.540
 you can just symbolize the symbols 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.430
 they do not remove you from the symbols 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.640
 interested and says there will be here 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.470
 again you are new to the smartphone 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.840
 Area is the surface too 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.000
 complicated or it's just too much 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.850
 try everything then 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.989
 simple home screen 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.459
 settings home screen and there 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.739
 select the easy start screen 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.050
 and you are already bringing 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.630
 here you have another page with you 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.790
 the most important apps three folders the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.750
 Access to all apps and three important ones 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.880
 contacts 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.650
 Everyone understands that and also if so 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.730
 it is not unbelievably beautiful it is 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.160
 really easy 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.720
 to finish this mode click again 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.739
 her easy on settings and 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.269
 finish simple home screen 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.840
 everyone should now be able to enjoy triple zoom 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.880
 recognize 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.920
 her tip thrice in one place 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.900
 display and the area increases 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.100
 now you can pinch to zoom the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.080
 Change zoom factor 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.120
 with a finger through the normal 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.880
 delete pages and wipe with two 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.110
 finger through the display content around the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.940
 leave the mode again 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.310
 Tip again three times in one place 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.109
 By the way, the following is very nice if 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.120
 just for a short something 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.950
 would like to have enlarged then hold the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.620
 finger on the third tap just on the 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.930
 display and move around 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.740
 let go now is the mode again 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.780
 leave 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.760
 activate your fun in the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.210
 Settings under input helps and 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.190
 magnification movements once tapped 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.840
 never stopped like that 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.000
 I would use the following function 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.770
 describe who will be display once 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.300
 unlocked by doppelrap has the wants it 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.620
 no longer miss it and above all else 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.449
 with every other smartphone 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.570
 try that he picks up 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.930
 and also the z3 can be unlocked via tab 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.449
 become 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.430
 I do not know why but this function 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.620
 is unfortunately deactivated at delivery 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.510
 So quickly in the setting and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.190
 under display the check mark at 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.560
 set wake tap 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.240
 the unlock works extremely fast 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.070
 Lock the display again 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.330
 However, that's not too bad we are 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.190
 come slowly to the end 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.260
 you want to call the next one 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.620
 Do not send number with just her 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.330
 Just tap roasted 31 rhombus and add 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.000
 then the number of the contact 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.650
 Now it will call for exactly this one 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.880
 euro number hidden and you are 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.889
 anonymous on the way 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.660
 this saves the long way over that 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.940
 Settings menu and should be everyone 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.620
 I think I know 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.510
 it is slowly getting to winter and 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.430
 also because there are far too few snow 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.530
 it will be here really speed 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.970
 then there is one again 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.840
 reason that the whole hipster theirs 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.550
 wear caps 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.380
 in summer have me not to 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.510
 head lost and to the other it is 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.010
 Glove time that you use the smartphone 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.530
 can also operate with gloves 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.990
 only needs a few clicks settings 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.669
 display glove mode and says is that 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.880
 display highly sensitive and you can 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.680
 los tap until the plans of gloves

 most exciting I'll just show you two 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.320
 ways to create a screenshot 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.410

 both times a screenshot is created 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.750
 then also considered the same or 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.930
