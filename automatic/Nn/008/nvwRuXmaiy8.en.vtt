third one which I might get chirp for
this<00:02:19.079> but<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.379> think<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.859> Reebok<00:02:20.219> 8k<00:02:20.760> looks

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
this but I think the Reebok 8k looks

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.020 
this but I think the Reebok 8k looks
pretty<00:02:21.269> cool<00:02:21.569> um<00:02:22.519> especially<00:02:23.519> if<00:02:23.639> you<00:02:23.730> got<00:02:23.819> the

pretty cool um especially if you got the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.629 
pretty cool um especially if you got the
the<00:02:24.569> right<00:02:24.780> inserts<00:02:25.349> with<00:02:25.829> your<00:02:26.040> team<00:02:26.249> colors

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
and stuff but I think the Reebok 8k

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.759 
and stuff but I think the Reebok 8k
