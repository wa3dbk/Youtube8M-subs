00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.249 

hello<00:00:03.750> and

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:05.259 
hello and

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.270 
hello and
going<00:00:05.410> to<00:00:05.560> be<00:00:06.629> recording<00:00:07.629> what<00:00:08.559> seems<00:00:08.889> to<00:00:09.010> be

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
going to be recording what seems to be

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.430 
going to be recording what seems to be
the<00:00:09.490> oil<00:00:09.670> separator<00:00:10.450> that<00:00:10.599> is<00:00:10.869> failing<00:00:11.200> in

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
the oil separator that is failing in

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.349 
the oil separator that is failing in
this<00:00:11.559> car<00:00:12.119> I<00:00:14.129> believe<00:00:15.129> that<00:00:15.670> I'm<00:00:15.789> told<00:00:16.059> that<00:00:16.180> if

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.359 
this car I believe that I'm told that if

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.820 
this car I believe that I'm told that if
you<00:00:16.480> take<00:00:16.660> off<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:16.990> oil<00:00:17.140> cap<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:19.000> engine<00:00:19.390> will

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
you take off the oil cap the engine will

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.130 
you take off the oil cap the engine will
will<00:00:20.830> lose<00:00:21.039> our<00:00:21.310> pan<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:22.180> then<00:00:22.690> the<00:00:22.869> oil

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
will lose our pan and then the oil

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.650 
will lose our pan and then the oil
separator<00:00:23.740> was<00:00:23.980> sound<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:24.550> it's<00:00:24.699> will<00:00:25.420> sound

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
separator was sound and it's will sound

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.140 
separator was sound and it's will sound
pretty<00:00:25.750> like<00:00:26.230> Chewbacca<00:00:26.949> for<00:00:27.490> example<00:00:28.000> so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
pretty like Chewbacca for example so

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.260 
pretty like Chewbacca for example so
here<00:00:28.300> we<00:00:28.420> go

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.510 

wait<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.870> second

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.800 

there<00:00:37.120> we<00:00:37.210> go<00:00:39.000> yeah<00:00:40.000> I'm<00:00:40.150> guessing<00:00:40.330> that<00:00:40.630> the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
there we go yeah I'm guessing that the

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.360 
there we go yeah I'm guessing that the
oil<00:00:41.050> separator<00:00:41.470> down<00:00:41.680> there<00:00:41.950> that's<00:00:42.190> making

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
oil separator down there that's making

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.529 
oil separator down there that's making
that<00:00:42.520> Roy

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
that Roy

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:55.110 
that Roy
Oh

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.439 

so<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:57.769> it's<00:00:57.949> sound<00:00:58.339> in<00:00:58.670> its<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.239> noise

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
so and it's sound in its the noise

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.149 
so and it's sound in its the noise
that's<00:00:59.629> coming<00:00:59.719> exactly<00:01:00.440> where<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:00.890> oil

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
that's coming exactly where the oil

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.740 
that's coming exactly where the oil
separator<00:01:01.640> is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.090 

so<00:01:08.750> I'm<00:01:08.960> guessing<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.410> is<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.860> other

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
so I'm guessing that is the other

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.190 
so I'm guessing that is the other
separator<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.790> every<00:01:11.000> time<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.360> punch<00:01:11.630> every

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
separator and every time you punch every

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.220 
separator and every time you punch every
time<00:01:12.260> you<00:01:12.530> accelerate<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.250> just<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.550> tad<00:01:13.790> bit<00:01:14.230> it

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
time you accelerate it just a tad bit it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:23.899 
time you accelerate it just a tad bit it
makes<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.860> annoyed<00:01:16.990> chief<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.170> can<00:01:18.350> make<00:01:18.560> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 

I<00:01:23.940> don't<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.870> gonna<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.200> heard<00:01:25.350> from

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I don't think it's gonna be heard from

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.789 
I don't think it's gonna be heard from
right<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.340> let<00:01:26.460> me<00:01:26.550> see<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:27.690> we<00:01:27.810> go

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.709 

yeah<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> anyway<00:01:34.289> that's<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.549> problem<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.570> I

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
yeah so anyway that's the problem that I

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.090 
yeah so anyway that's the problem that I
have<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.840> guys<00:01:40.020> tell<00:01:40.409> me<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> oil

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
have so you guys tell me if it's the oil

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.270 
have so you guys tell me if it's the oil
separator<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> not

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
separator I think it is but it's not

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
separator I think it is but it's not
making<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.789> Chewbacca<00:01:45.030> noise<00:01:45.600> when<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
making that Chewbacca noise when you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
making that Chewbacca noise when you
turn<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.289> off<00:01:46.469> and<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.920> has<00:01:47.039> no<00:01:47.219> problem

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
turn it off and it has no problem

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.050 
turn it off and it has no problem
turning<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:49.520> oh<00:01:51.950> yeah<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.429> ninety

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
turning on and oh yeah this is a ninety

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.830 
turning on and oh yeah this is a ninety
nine<00:01:54.209> three<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> eight<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> by<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:59.840> well

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
nine three to eight I by the way so well

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.139 
nine three to eight I by the way so well
there<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.110> go

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149

I'm gonna see what I can do about this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.919 
I'm gonna see what I can do about this
and<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:08.190> other<00:02:08.310> question<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.479> replace

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and one other question if I do replace

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.270 
and one other question if I do replace
this<00:02:10.349> uh<00:02:11.720> what<00:02:12.720> other<00:02:12.750> hoses<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.799> recommend

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
this uh what other hoses you recommend

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.160 
this uh what other hoses you recommend
me<00:02:14.430> buying<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.390> ones<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.780> are<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.079> be

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
me buying the ones that are going to be

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.870 
me buying the ones that are going to be
brittle<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.769> don't<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.370> stranded

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
brittle so I don't have to be stranded

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.839 
brittle so I don't have to be stranded
and<00:02:18.030> wait<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.450> parts<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.900> arrive<00:02:19.849> that's

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
and wait for the parts to arrive that's

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:29.360 
and wait for the parts to arrive that's
my<00:02:21.060> other<00:02:21.180> question<00:02:21.299> okay<00:02:22.640> well<00:02:26.180> see<00:02:27.180> ya
