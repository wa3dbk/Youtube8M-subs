00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.630
 hello my people how are you fucking me 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 willy and today I bring you a new video the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.030
 second part about the video of the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.579
 abandoned wwf championships today 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.690
 I will talk about the million championship 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.250
 of dollars created in 1989 by man 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.590
 million dollars 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.230
 ted dibiase since he always persecuted 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.989
 the championship of the wwf and not what 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.699
 got and tired of losing decided that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.059
 If I could not win or buy the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.190
 wwf championship would create its own 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.680
 title the million-dollar championship 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.600
 dollars the belt was golden with 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.340
 blank dollar symbols are 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.680
 self-proclaimed first champion of the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.070
 history of that title getting a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.340
 reign of 992 days wow 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.860
 losing it in 1991 the title was 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 rarely put into play because it was not 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.330
 an official championship as it would be 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.869
 intercontinental championship or the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.580
 couples the belt was abandoned in 1992 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.610
 but brought abandoned again and another 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.470
 for the last time in 2010 where he was 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.980
 new to the trunk of memories 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.810
 in total we had 5 champions obviously 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.630
 I will not talk about all the titles 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.100
 abandoned since there are many only 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.950
 I will talk about some of the most 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.090
 relevant good now I will talk about the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.280
 female title created in 1956 the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.400
 first champion was the fabulous mule 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.190
 with a reign of 28 years the fucking mother 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.710
 the championship was a key piece in the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:11.380
 rivalry between the wps w and the wwf in 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.260
 1995 the then champion lark blaze 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.170
 was hired at double from c &amp; w and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.050
 she was still a women's wwf champion 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.450
 and in a mold the nitro took the belt 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.790
 and threw it in the trash hahahaha poor 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.280
 vince sure he would have shit in 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.060
 the pants the title happened to be 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.990
 inactive until 1998 when jacques it 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.600
 reactivated during 2000 and in 2006 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.380
 we had excellent champions like china 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.110
 bunk 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.040
 victoria mori holy mickie james and for 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.410
 course trish stratus in 2006 after 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.960
 of the departure of his last two divas of 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.060
 gold that were sad deals and lita the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.400
 championship stopped having the brightness that 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.530
 I had before and started to have less 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.390
 importance of what I had up to 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.810
 unify it with the title of the butterfly 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.780
 in 2010 deactivating the female title 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.330
 what a pity last I will talk about the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.580
 title cruiserweight the title just for 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.800
 wrestlers with cruiserweight by 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.530
 example king mysterio chavo warrior o 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.990
 tiger and the title was exclusive for the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.510
 blue mark actually this title what 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.410
 created the double pc w but because of the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.480
 bankruptcy of this the wwf decided to reactivate 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.790
 it and make it exclusive for smackdown 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.610
 for this belt they gave good 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.890
 struggles and we had good champions but 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.660
 after this championship became 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.910
 the championship of the joves and 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.910
 discrediting what's good about everything 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.910
 he had given the wps wv and a bit of the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.350
 wwf up to take everything to shit on 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.690
 2007 when 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.300
 they gave it to him now with the dwarf is 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.520
 leaving him inactive until his disappearance 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.520
