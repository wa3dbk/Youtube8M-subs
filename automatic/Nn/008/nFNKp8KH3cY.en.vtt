00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this tutorial we will analyze 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.950
 Berlin version of the Spanish party but 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.809
 first a little history of the spanish party 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.990
 how debut was first analyzed 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.080
 outstanding chess players of 15 16 centuries 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.850
 Spaniards and Lucian and Lopez as we already 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.130
 know from lesson 71 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 spanish party begin next 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.310
 by moves e4 e5 horse f3 horse c6 elephant b5 in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.579
 those times the main purpose of nursing elephant b5 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.860
 was to create the threat of the e5 pawn modern 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.050
 debut interpretations this is only the beginning 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 deep strategic plans to fight for 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 center and conservation initial initiative 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.160
 however, Blackâ€™s position is very reliable 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.969
 so with the right answers they have 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 there is every chance to get a good game 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.000
 various systems of the Spanish party 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 usually divided by formal 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 a sign on the more ancient without a 6 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.250
 and more modern with move a6 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.020
 in this lesson we will look at the old 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.910
 Berlin version of the Spanish party 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.199
 introduced into modern practice 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.810
 Vladimir Kramnik 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.490
 this option determines the knight f6 move 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 black attacked the pawn e4 castling this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 White shows that they are ready 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.689
 sacrifice this pawn why because 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.180
 black king is in the center if 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.080
 open vertical he will fall under attack 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.970
 the knight beats on e4 the black take the pawn more 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.680
 calm answer elephant e7 horse c3 d6 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.210
 back to the fourth move black knight 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.820
 beats on e4 d4 this white move continued 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.220
 plan to open the line e horse c6 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.350
 I suggest that White decides the fate of the elephant 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.329
 be 5 elephant beats on c6 dc let f5 knight 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.049
 as other fields for the departure of the horse 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.560
 less profitable firs beats on d 8 king 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.020
 beats on d 8 horse c3 this ending 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 met in thousands of parties objectively 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.490
 White's position is slightly better but if 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.469
 White plays the attacking chess player to him 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.990
 pretty nasty play it's boring 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.660
 endgame disadvantages black position 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.819
 striking lack of castling and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.850
 corrupted pesic on queen structure 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.220
 his flank 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.530
 since f5 limits the possibilities 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.490
 developing your own elephants and hits 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.350
 under the same attack 2 4 + and black positions 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.060
 lack of queens on the board and 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.000
 respectively, the absence of acute 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.400
 options the advantage of two elephants is not 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.100
 roger van eyck role in case of exchange 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.110
 rooks quickly come into play to what should 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.350
 seek the parties in this endgame 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.140
 first fight for line d white must 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.680
 whenever possible to keep lags exchange to 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.810
 it is also not profitable for them to spend 5 6 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.630
 so that blacks have to beat 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.350
 f7 beats on e6 at some point 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.550
 transfer the game to the pawn endgame 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.790
 accordingly black needs to do everything 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.790
 vice versa 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.060
 I do not and the job will consider the following 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:13.680
 batch e4 e5 horse f3 horse c6 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:18.060
 elephant b5 horse f6 castling horse beats on 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.980
 e4 rook on e1 more often play up to 4 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.360
 now the right thing to do was 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.660
 black horse c6 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.540
 for example a horse beats on e5 a horse beats on e5 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.200
 rook beat on e5 check elephant e7 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.110
 elephant d3 castling horse c3 elephant 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.750
 f6 equal chances but on the fifth move 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:42.209
 black played f5 how to use 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:46.680
 this error in the next assignment after 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:51.569
 initial moves e4 e5 nf3 nc6 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.330

 knight beats on e5 knight beats on e5 rook 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.600
 beats on e5 check elephant e7 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.510
 knight c3 black played knight beats on b5 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.120
 how to use this black error 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.120
 Answers, see lesson 73 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.060
 and type 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.310
 building lesson 71 is doing on the seventh move 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.539
 you can not play as well because they 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.360
 come under strong attack and h2 horse 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.860
 one more mistake figure is better to give 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.990
 afterburner 4 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:41.699
 rook and one bishop c5 d4 bishop beats on d4 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:46.259
 E36 bishop beats h2 king king f1 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.100
 f6-horse d2- horse castling and black 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.090
 are winning 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.150
 after 7 moves , but if White gives up 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:59.250
 the figure is possible the next option d 3 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:03.060
 same fps poor in three versions h4 queen h3 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.530
 the queen beats our 3a rook beats on h3 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.380
 same king 2 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.380
