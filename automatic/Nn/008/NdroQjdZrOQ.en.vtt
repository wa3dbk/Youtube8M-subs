instructions<00:00:24.340> they<00:00:25.060> are<00:00:25.179> rather<00:00:25.420> important

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
instructions they are rather important

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.669 
instructions they are rather important
so<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:28.420> not<00:00:28.599> going<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.869> name<00:00:28.960> any<00:00:29.109> particular

so I'm not going to name any particular

manufacturers but we're going to go

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.770 
manufacturers but we're going to go
ahead<00:00:33.310> and<00:00:33.610> take<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.120> look<00:00:34.300> at<00:00:34.450> some<00:00:34.600> of<00:00:34.690> the

ahead and take a look at some of the
things<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.170> need<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.320> know<00:00:35.560> when<00:00:35.770> doing<00:00:36.100> this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
things you need to know when doing this

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.970 
things you need to know when doing this
install<00:00:37.290> now<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.350> first<00:00:38.650> thing<00:00:38.860> the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
install now the first thing the

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.200 
install now the first thing the
manufacturer<00:00:39.700> tells<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.150> to<00:00:40.270> do<00:00:40.450> is<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
manufacturer tells you to do is to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.590 
manufacturer tells you to do is to
remove<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.870> old<00:00:43.900> intake<00:00:44.560> box<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.300> unplug<00:00:46.300> the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
remove the old intake box and unplug the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.410 
remove the old intake box and unplug the
mass<00:00:47.110> airflow<00:00:47.410> sensor<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.340> rip<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.060> whole

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
mass airflow sensor and rip that whole

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.830 
mass airflow sensor and rip that whole
assembly<00:00:49.570> out<00:00:50.040> I'm<00:00:51.040> going<00:00:51.400> to<00:00:51.430> tell<00:00:51.700> you<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.690> go

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
assembly out I'm going to tell you to go

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.460 
assembly out I'm going to tell you to go
ahead<00:00:52.990> and<00:00:53.410> not<00:00:53.980> do<00:00:54.340> that<00:00:54.610> first<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:56.260> first

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
ahead and not do that first the first

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.820 
ahead and not do that first the first
thing<00:00:56.830> you're<00:00:57.310> going<00:00:57.490> to<00:00:57.550> do<00:00:57.820> is<00:00:58.170> remove<00:00:59.170> the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
thing you're going to do is remove the

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.090 
thing you're going to do is remove the
top<00:01:00.010> bolts<00:01:00.460> right<00:01:01.060> here<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:02.800> here

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
top bolts right here and right here

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.009 
top bolts right here and right here
and<00:01:03.250> then<00:01:04.000> you're<00:01:04.150> going<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.330> take<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:04.780> these

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
and then you're going to take out these

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.530 
and then you're going to take out these
bolts<00:01:05.500> okay<00:01:06.400> you're<00:01:06.549> going<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:06.759> do<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
bolts okay you're going to do the the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.469 
bolts okay you're going to do the the
bumper<00:01:07.930> cover<00:01:08.140> take<00:01:09.009> off<00:01:09.250> before<00:01:09.850> you

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
bumper cover take off before you

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.150 
bumper cover take off before you
actually<00:01:10.630> start<00:01:10.990> getting<00:01:11.290> into<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.740> intake

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
actually start getting into the intake

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.180 
actually start getting into the intake
and<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:13.270> reasoning<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:13.900> your<00:01:14.290> bottom<00:01:14.800> bolts

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
and the reasoning is your bottom bolts

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.600 
and the reasoning is your bottom bolts
here<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:16.420> underneath<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.140> collar<00:01:17.520> there's<00:01:18.520> uh

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
here up underneath the collar there's uh

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.680 
here up underneath the collar there's uh
one<00:01:22.020> nine<00:01:23.020> bolts<00:01:23.440> up<00:01:23.770> underneath<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.400> car

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
one nine bolts up underneath the car

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.540 
one nine bolts up underneath the car
that<00:01:25.690> are<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:26.050> t20<00:01:26.770> Torx<00:01:27.220> um<00:01:28.800> even<00:01:29.800> though<00:01:29.980> my

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
that are a t20 Torx um even though my

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.280 
that are a t20 Torx um even though my
particular<00:01:31.060> instructions<00:01:31.750> told<00:01:31.960> me<00:01:32.110> they

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
particular instructions told me they

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.130 
particular instructions told me they
were<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.440> 25<00:01:33.070> by<00:01:33.400> 25<00:01:33.460> does<00:01:34.180> not<00:01:34.330> fit<00:01:34.630> they<00:01:34.870> are<00:01:35.020> at

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
were a 25 by 25 does not fit they are at

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.660 
were a 25 by 25 does not fit they are at
20<00:01:36.120> ok<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.320> reasoning<00:01:38.890> why<00:01:39.250> you're<00:01:39.520> going

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
20 ok but the reasoning why you're going

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.660 
20 ok but the reasoning why you're going
to<00:01:39.790> win<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:41.350> because<00:01:41.740> there<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.040> also<00:01:42.220> three

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
to win is because there is also three

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.130 
to win is because there is also three
bolts<00:01:43.090> on<00:01:43.150> either<00:01:43.840> side<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:47.320> are<00:01:48.960> inside<00:01:49.960> the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
bolts on either side that are inside the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.020 
bolts on either side that are inside the
wheel<00:01:50.320> well<00:01:50.560> here<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.400> don't<00:01:51.460> know<00:01:51.760> if<00:01:51.909> you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
wheel well here and I don't know if you

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.550 
wheel well here and I don't know if you
can<00:01:52.210> see<00:01:52.450> them<00:01:52.630> but<00:01:53.049> you're<00:01:53.200> just<00:01:53.380> going<00:01:53.470> to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
can see them but you're just going to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.880 
can see them but you're just going to
have<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.830> trust<00:01:54.070> me<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.580> they<00:01:55.299> exist<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.560> get

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
have to trust me that they exist to get

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.300 
have to trust me that they exist to get
these<00:01:57.280> bolts<00:01:57.670> out<00:01:58.500> you're<00:01:59.500> going<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.860> have<00:02:00.070> to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
these bolts out you're going to have to

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.170 
these bolts out you're going to have to
turn<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:01.570> tires<00:02:02.190> turn<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.700> right<00:02:03.729> to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
turn the tires turn it to the right to

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.630 
turn the tires turn it to the right to
get<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.450> driver's<00:02:05.080> side<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.159> left<00:02:06.460> to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
get the driver's side and to the left to

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.229 
get the driver's side and to the left to
get<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.880> passenger<00:02:07.390> side<00:02:07.659> if<00:02:08.470> you've<00:02:08.799> already

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
get the passenger side if you've already

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.690 
get the passenger side if you've already
disconnected<00:02:10.239> your<00:02:10.810> mass<00:02:10.959> airflow<00:02:11.230> sensor

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
disconnected your mass airflow sensor

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.580 
disconnected your mass airflow sensor
and<00:02:12.700> pull<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> intake<00:02:13.450> out<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:14.470> you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and pull the intake out then you

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.530 
and pull the intake out then you
certainly<00:02:14.860> don't<00:02:15.790> want<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> start<00:02:16.389> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
certainly don't want to start the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.040 
certainly don't want to start the
vehicle

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
vehicle

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.140 
vehicle
in<00:02:17.530> order<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.860> turn<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.340> wheels<00:02:18.520> left<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
in order to turn the wheels left and

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.430 
in order to turn the wheels left and
right<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:22.120> ahead<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.750> once<00:02:23.260> you've

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
right so go ahead and and once you've
