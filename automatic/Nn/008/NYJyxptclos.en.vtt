00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.820 

I've<00:00:12.420> been<00:00:12.570> following<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:13.200> rocket<00:00:13.590> stills

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
I've been following about rocket stills

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.189 
I've been following about rocket stills
with<00:00:13.980> our<00:00:14.099> space<00:00:14.370> heater<00:00:14.610> project<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.690> decided

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
with our space heater project we decided

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.070 
with our space heater project we decided
to<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.440> serious<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.250> rocket<00:00:17.970> mass<00:00:18.180> heater<00:00:18.210> now

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
to get serious a rocket mass heater now

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.170 
to get serious a rocket mass heater now
that's<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> project<00:00:19.830> way<00:00:20.250> too<00:00:20.310> enticing<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that's the project way too enticing to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.390 
that's the project way too enticing to
resist<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.380> had<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.160> place

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
resist and we had just the right place

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.429 
resist and we had just the right place
for<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:24.119> recently<00:00:24.359> moved<00:00:24.750> our<00:00:24.960> large<00:00:25.199> wood

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
for it we recently moved our large wood

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.990 
for it we recently moved our large wood
stove<00:00:25.680> into<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> family<00:00:26.340> room<00:00:26.519> or<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.910> could

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
stove into the family room or it could

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.759 
stove into the family room or it could
be<00:00:27.090> more<00:00:27.269> useful<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> larger<00:00:28.170> room<00:00:28.380> we

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
be more useful in the larger room we

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
be more useful in the larger room we
gathered<00:00:29.099> many<00:00:29.369> ideas<00:00:29.849> off<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.240> Internet

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.810 
gathered many ideas off of the Internet
there<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.679> many<00:00:31.980> ways<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.460> build<00:00:32.640> these

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
there are so many ways to build these

it was inexpensive to build we only had
to<00:07:02.210> purchase<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:02.900> six<00:07:03.140> inch<00:07:03.320> piping<00:07:03.770> Oh<00:07:03.980> what

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700

to purchase the six inch piping Oh what
is<00:07:04.820> she's<00:07:05.000> for<00:07:05.180> burning<00:07:05.510> which<00:07:05.930> creates<00:07:06.380> a<00:07:06.500> lot

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
is she's for burning which creates a lot

is she's for burning which creates a lot
of<00:07:06.890> nails<00:07:07.160> but<00:07:08.000> brian<00:07:08.240> has<00:07:08.390> a<00:07:08.510> solution<00:07:09.050> to

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200 
of nails but brian has a solution to

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.930 
of nails but brian has a solution to
this<00:07:09.320> problem<00:07:09.530> with<00:07:10.250> all<00:07:10.400> the<00:07:10.520> pallets

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
this problem with all the pallets

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.430 
this problem with all the pallets
there's<00:07:11.180> a<00:07:11.240> lot<00:07:11.420> of<00:07:11.540> nails<00:07:11.720> that<00:07:11.960> are<00:07:12.050> stuck<00:07:12.290> in

there's a lot of nails that are stuck in

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.140 
there's a lot of nails that are stuck in
them<00:07:12.590> so<00:07:13.100> when<00:07:13.250> you<00:07:13.310> burn<00:07:13.520> them<00:07:13.730> all<00:07:13.820> the<00:07:13.970> nails

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
them so when you burn them all the nails

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.450 
them so when you burn them all the nails
fall<00:07:14.450> in<00:07:14.570> the<00:07:14.660> ashes<00:07:14.870> so<00:07:15.590> I<00:07:15.620> made<00:07:15.890> this<00:07:16.070> to<00:07:16.310> get

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
fall in the ashes so I made this to get

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:24.880 
fall in the ashes so I made this to get
it<00:07:16.550> out<00:07:16.730> a<00:07:16.970> magnet<00:07:17.510> and<00:07:17.690> a<00:07:17.990> wire<00:07:23.020> now<00:07:24.020> it's<00:07:24.590> time

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
it out a magnet and a wire now it's time

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.850
