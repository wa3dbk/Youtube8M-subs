getting going but this is just kind of
like<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.449> demo<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:53.399> see<00:00:53.610> how<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.660> works<00:00:54.989> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
like a demo to see how good it works and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
like a demo to see how good it works and
everything<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.980> isn't<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.550> such<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
everything this isn't you know such a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479 
everything this isn't you know such a
tank<00:00:57.780> I'd<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.260> Oh<00:00:58.410> use<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:59.010> every<00:00:59.280> day<00:00:59.309> for

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
tank I'd be like Oh use it every day for

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.630 
tank I'd be like Oh use it every day for
it<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.590> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.920> kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> demo

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it you know this is just kind of a demo

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.950 
it you know this is just kind of a demo
tank<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.420> show<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> what<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.799> does<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
tank to show you what it does and I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.859 
tank to show you what it does and I
think<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> pretty<00:01:07.530> good<00:01:07.650> demo<00:01:08.040> take<00:01:08.400> cuz

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
think it's a pretty good demo take cuz

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.160 
think it's a pretty good demo take cuz
shape<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> hex<00:01:10.380> bug<00:01:10.619> off<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:12.090> shaped<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
shape like a hex bug off it shaped like

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
shape like a hex bug off it shaped like
a<00:01:13.290> hexbug<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.610> logo<00:01:15.000> cuz<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.310> hexagon<00:01:17.310> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
a hexbug the logo cuz it's a hexagon so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.399 
a hexbug the logo cuz it's a hexagon so
make<00:01:18.330> sense<00:01:18.600> hexagon<00:01:19.470> hex<00:01:19.950> bog<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:22.350> I'm

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
make sense hexagon hex bog so now I'm

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.179 
make sense hexagon hex bog so now I'm
kind<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.860> sense<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> here<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.450> go

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
kind of make sense but here we go

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.039 
kind of make sense but here we go
sometimes<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.430> dive<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.869> see

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
sometimes they dive down as you can see

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.520 
sometimes they dive down as you can see
right<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.590> good<00:01:29.159> example<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.079> I've<00:01:31.079> found

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
right there good example and I've found

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.520 
right there good example and I've found
out<00:01:31.860> something<00:01:32.299> when<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.900> flip<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.350> over

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
out something when you flip it over

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.050 
out something when you flip it over
upside<00:01:35.189> down<00:01:36.259> something<00:01:37.259> will<00:01:37.470> happen<00:01:38.060> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
upside down something will happen it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.810 
upside down something will happen it
will<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.479> flip<00:01:40.020> back<00:01:40.439> oh<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.479> again

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
will just flip back oh so do that again

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.840 
will just flip back oh so do that again
see<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.869> let's<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.670> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
see and now let's see if we can do that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.280 
see and now let's see if we can do that
again<00:01:48.439> when<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.520> near<00:01:50.909> us<00:01:51.290> not

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
again when it can get right near us not

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.789 
again when it can get right near us not
really<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.909> he<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.799> see

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
really but there he is kind of like see

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.100 
really but there he is kind of like see
that's<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.579> perfect<00:01:56.969> sensor<00:01:57.329> because<00:01:57.509> right

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that's a perfect sensor because right

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.560 
that's a perfect sensor because right
now<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.439> looks<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.680> he<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.250> um<00:01:59.570> feeding

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
