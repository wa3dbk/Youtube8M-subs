00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.100
 now we take out the third position 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.350
 car in the fall we were carrying Russo-Balt 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.320
 yesterday they took my 15 today ford and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.079
 the second will go for copper yet we have 1 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.680
 position left 15 cars 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.470
 20 trucks and 20 bicycles but the amount 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.060
 20 moh is motorcycles with motorcycles 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.250
 Widows of bicycles problems will be less 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:01:00.140
 and the difficulties are the same museum building not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.629
 adapted to move the car 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:10.220
 so we face it every 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.320
 from fans give me some wind 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.490
 here I hold the position of senior 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.640
 researcher curator of the hall 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 cosmonautics 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.770
 the first step is packaging 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.829
 1 item and that was closest 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.590
 this is a bunch of union zalet progress otherwise 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.990
 first being photographed in general, we see 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.810
 from all sides 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.970
 then there is a disassembly and this is every step 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.799
 disassembly is photographed in order to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.130
 descendants 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:45.090
 They can be assembled in the reverse order 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:49.890
 then measure the preparation in the package and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.539
 packaging we are now i'm in 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.490
 storage where the packaging takes place 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.420
 museum items in front 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.159
 transportation of new places they are only 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.959
 people are now familiar with the kit 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.420
 sample gel work wonderful 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.640
 Russian master or petrovich and hot 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.829
 who worked for fulfilling orders 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.019
 the main chamber of weights and measures after 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.810
 Dmitri Wonju Mendeleev Maiden himself 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.420
 made of bronze were on top 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.640
 no chemicals are gilded and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.620
 even elemental salt with copper 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.690
 perfectly acceptable this is done 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.459
 lodgements now but i'm thrust which 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.130
 fix and hard position 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.650
 still on top there will be more lodgements 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.750
 which will be fixed by the neck too 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.180
 so they would be 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.069
 fixed in this pack and here 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.470
 the rest are small then a set of such 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:43.340
 the same thing will happen to them 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.440
 most it contains the whole chain of the museum 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.600
 on a specific subject further 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.270
 I define 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.430
 who rotates this link from 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.160
 museum network or outside well here you can 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.560
 submit different amounts of information either 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.300
 only personal data that is available 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.870
 should hands over the net 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.360
 tax and through our or if it is 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.440
 authorized and the device from the museum is not 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.440
 go to can give directly to 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.210
 extended again 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.690
 virtually all plastics that go all 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.690
