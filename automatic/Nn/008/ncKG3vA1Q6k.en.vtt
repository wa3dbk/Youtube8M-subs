flavorful here's some ideas the trouble
with<00:00:37.320> protein<00:00:37.890> sources<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.000> are

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
with protein sources is that they are

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
with protein sources is that they are
pretty<00:00:39.690> bland<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.559> really<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.250> any

fish shellfish and ground beef the key

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.720 
fish shellfish and ground beef the key
to<00:00:45.989> making<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> protein<00:00:46.829> sources<00:00:47.129> flavorful

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to making the protein sources flavorful

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
to making the protein sources flavorful
is<00:00:47.879> simply<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.450> use<00:00:48.780> herbs<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> spices

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
