 my name is manuel antonio redero short 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.890
 I am an apprentice in bakery technician 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.870
 the donuts are a typical food inside 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.019
 of the American pastry shop today we are going to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.630
 learn what to do at home 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.910
 ingredients for approximately 12 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 Donuts are 500 gram wheat flour 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.180
 milk powder 20 grams at 5 grams 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.609
 common sugar 20 grams margarine 40 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.019
 grams eggs a unit egg yolks 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.740
 2 units 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.520
 Yeast 30 grams water 200 to 250 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.469
 cubic centimeters approximately for 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.649
 The decoration of the donuts can be 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.840
 use different elements in the day 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.050
 today we will use chocolate coverage 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 to the bathroom maria dragees of colors 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 arequipe powdered sugar stirred with 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.629
 10% cornstarch to absorb us 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.579
 much the first step we mix the flour 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.670
 of wheat with salt and milk powder 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.129
 we make a crown then in the middle 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.800
 add the sugar the margarine 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.500
 eggs and the yolks and the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.710
 hard dissolved later we mix 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.050
 until obtaining a smooth and homogeneous mass 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.710
 as a fourth step we let this 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.900
 mix for 30 minutes after the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.690
 30 minutes as the fifth step we give you a 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.509
 point of elasticity after we extend 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.369
 with the rolling pin on a floured table 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.369
 and cut with a circular mold 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.660
 and then lead to growth for 30 to 40 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.080
 minutes goes up to double its size 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:41.540
 fry at 180 degrees centigrade up 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.310
 brown for decoration in this 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.500
 opportunity we are going to use three forms 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.560
 we can cover chocolate we pass 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 the previously fried donut we flipped and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.130
 we scatter color thanks is another 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.190
 way to decorate is with arequipe 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.760
 arequipe what we thin with a little 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.430
 wine or water we passed the donut 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.930
 previously fried above 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.720
 arequipe and if we want we add 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:13.150
 the other form would be with the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.150
 powdered sugar with 10% cornstarch 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.680
 this is an easy practical and 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.680
 simple to make donuts at home
