00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.220
 and that's all we're all new match 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.420
 prognosis so at last matches that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.580
 I did so it was for the Swiss 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.860
 France good prognosis for me so 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.330
 as usual rapsi reminder of the rules 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.980
 with regard to the little contest that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.470
 I launched since a few 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 matches already so on gamescapt it is enough 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.070
 to leave your prognosis 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.300
 so win a draw and that's 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 while on youtube 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.949
 just let your prognosis 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.520
 simply or then given the score 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 exact match at the end so if you 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.630
 give the the good the good winner 6 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.430
 would score a point if you give the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.719
 exact score would score points to 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.899
 the outcome of the Jeffrey World Cup 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.530
 won a ps3 xbox game or pc I the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.610
 remember but do not stop one of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.719
 last games it's going to be a game 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 relatively old is very 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 certainly because I inevitably 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.140
 ways to do anything 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.109
 but here it is just for the fun of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.910
 have fun then then that's for how 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.250
 formerly why participate all 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 together at this world cup a little 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.210
 little in our way so this is this 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 so here so prognostics on a germany 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 ghana then you're going to tell me this is it 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.470
 there are no match with the predictions have 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.520
 relatively easy yes predictions 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.100
 relatively easy I am totally 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 agree with you at the time I am you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.060
 speak at the coast of the coast of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.610
 Germany is 29 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.090
 so I do not know where the site lists 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.829
 this rating 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 in any case the rating of germany and at 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.150
 1.29 on betclic she is a lot 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.990
 much much lower 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.840
 I do not make my prono was much more 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.440
 bass not tell you is how much this 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.570
 from that of his draw at 100 to 5.75 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.790
 and the ghana to 10 so much to tell you 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.780
 that germany is hyper favorites for 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.920
 this match as on everything as on the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.930
 most of their matches at the same 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.450
 time we'll say that should not be 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.870
 too complicated for them to get out of these 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.760
 chickens even to go tickle the last 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.800
 square to see against who 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.479
 to see against who could fall 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.880
 France is well gone we are well 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.500
 gone for a france germany one in 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.150
 talk and talk about it with damien 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.890
 especially on the site we left well 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.300
 for a france germany so to see 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.980
 how could that how could that 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.130
 to unleash a little bit of everything but 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.180
 six years ago france-allemagne in quarters 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.440
 frankly it could be very very 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.860
 very nice finally bout them 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.750
 last performances of the duo la roja I 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.870
 I am completely lost on my sure 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.130
 but on my cards a lot and so to 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.880
 Damascus by the latest performances of 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.510
 the hall of germany you the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.620
 know all 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.580
 this is humiliation we will say that they 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.320
 have inflicted Portugal 4 goals to 0 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.910
 before that was the 6 5 against Armenia 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.410
 there was 1 2 2 to 1 in a friendly match 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.550
 against cameroon in friendly match that 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.680
 I was going to remind him I will repeat it 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.730
 never enough the 0 0 against Poland the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.070
 1 0 to Chile 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.960
 and before that so there was also the 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.280
 win 1 0 6 against against 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.260
 England and the draw against Italy 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.490
 and before that we were really in 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.130
 the qualifying phases of the cup 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.810
 world with the 5-3 against Sweden on 3 0 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.209
 against Ireland the 3-0 confuse islands 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.930
 Faroe is that the Faroe Islands on 3 0 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.890
 against Austria 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.200
 etc etc etc while on the side of ghana 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.910
 inevitably and I really like this 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.170
 ghana team already i really like 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.910
 a lot a lot this ghana team 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.190
 they really dominated understands the 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.410
 United States unfortunately as of 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.300
 many african teams the cfa ce 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.600
 who sins the most already is a guardian 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.050
 of purpose that have not terrible but especially 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.240
 the offensive potential of both 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.830
 of his different teams then there was 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.030
 already samoa before there was there 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.100
 had the ayew brothers and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.280
 and below what I found 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.930
 finally there are ends and remains is 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.490
 always super good individualities 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.910
 in his African teams 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.010
 but the problem is that offensively 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.230
 we tend to want to do 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.970
 star and want to score by 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.500
 strikes of often very far while 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.450
 there are always some best 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.760
 possibilities always has the lag to 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.800
 create but no the guy is going to try to 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.010
 hit 30 yards to try to 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.450
 put a top goals we do not care what he 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.209
 must is that the ball was at the bottom 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.380
 so try to hunger what would be good 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.620
 is that it is because these 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.480
 teams manage to to put between 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.680
 quotes their ego aside for 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.169
 propose offensive football more 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.730
 more worked and stop hitting from 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.350
 30 meters and harvested opportunities 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.790
 because that's if it's really what 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.210
 what they lacked against 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.650
 United States 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.210
 because they really dominated the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.590
 match they had occases but 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.760
 here it was striking from afar 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.620
 by far strikes from afar while they 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.229
 had a lot better to do at once 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.660
 defeat against the States 2 goals to 1 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.950
 victory 4 0 against South Korea 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.750
 the 1-0 defeat against the Netherlands 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.060
 only even if it was a bit of a 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.800
 friendly match 1 0 and 1-0 defeat 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.780
 also against Montenegro the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.160
 defeat 2-1 against Egypt that was 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.950
 for the qualifiers of the world cup 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.960
 the victory 6 1 against Egypt always 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.640
 for the qualifiers of the World Cup the 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.970
 2 1 against Zambia 2-2 against the 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.520
 Turkey 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.280
 it was in a friendly match that's all 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:15.330
 to say that ghana will only do very 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.710
 certainly not finally they will go very 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.290
 certainly not tickle the Germans 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.460
 with their offensive armada the bread the 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.880
 son of a monstrous team 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.200
 germany with gÃ¶tze muller kddi put 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.810
 his tripled in one match 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.130
 you have a defense a strong defense 20 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.920
 girls and philipp lahm that eventually have 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.350
 placed in defensive midfield and that made 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.040
 a beautiful game against against against 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.410
 Portugal 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.690
 even though the first few minutes he had 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.030
 need a little time to adapt 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.950
 but not there will be no picture there will 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.110
 not match against Ghana at less than one 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.060
 huge surprise this second I hope but 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.470
 it's stop 13.7 it's very very very 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.370
 improbably so logically my prono 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.320
 victory of germany i really 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.090
 wanted to make this match just for fun 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.160
 a prognosis this match for fun 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.200
 because ghana is a team that 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.470
 I like he had done very good 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.300
 figure in 2010 unfortunately there is 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.230
 high chances for that for that for 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.410
 that they are eliminated as soon as 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.020
 chicken phases / 7 / on this cut 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.160
 of the world he should have won against them 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.770
 against the united states to have a 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.270
 chance and eventually to go out a 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.620
 match against Portugal it would have been 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.900
 something quite playable 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.480
 although portugal is greater on 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.460
 paper but here is germany 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.710
 Portugal so of course victory 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.540
 of Germany 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.240
 it should not pose too too too 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.470
 problem or not at all but that's it 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.880
 never know maybe a surprise go 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.390
 know 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.070
 so when to me I give you 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.480
 rendezvous so beat is very 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.190
 soon so tomorrow as 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.860
 usually the next game that I will you 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.060
 prediction very well that should be that 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.800
 should be it should be it should 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.080
 to be that I look at that I look that 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.669
 I watch 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.729
 oh no no normally it should be 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.199
 south korea algeria normally because 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.139
 that because it's Algeria so 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.419
 inevitably I wish that I wish 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.889
 talk a little about this game but 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.210
 normally it should be that match at 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.810
 unless they have a change of 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.250
 last minute 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.330
 so here you go, do not you? 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.069
 friends do not hesitate to let your 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.400
 pronouncements in the comments and at the 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.400
 next
