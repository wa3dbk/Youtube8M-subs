I've been riding to Niners for over a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.520 
I've been riding to Niners for over a
decade<00:00:23.560> now<00:00:23.920> and<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:25.150> past<00:00:25.390> three<00:00:25.750> years

decade now and the past three years
I<00:00:26.560> wasn't<00:00:26.950> ran<00:00:27.220> into<00:00:27.490> Niner<00:00:27.700> at<00:00:27.910> all<00:00:28.050> when<00:00:29.050> we

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
I wasn't ran into Niner at all when we

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.210 
I wasn't ran into Niner at all when we
redeveloped<00:00:30.940> our<00:00:31.060> suspension<00:00:31.420> lineup<00:00:31.960> I<00:00:32.650> was

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
redeveloped our suspension lineup I was

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.540 
redeveloped our suspension lineup I was
on<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.400> heart<00:00:33.670> Delta<00:00:34.030> 9er<00:00:34.360> for<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.830> attribute

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
on a heart Delta 9er for the attribute

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.420 
on a heart Delta 9er for the attribute
of<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:37.000> front<00:00:37.270> wheel<00:00:37.420> being<00:00:38.140> able<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:39.280> get

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
of the front wheel being able to get

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.040 
of the front wheel being able to get
over<00:00:39.580> things<00:00:39.910> that<00:00:40.000> much<00:00:40.270> easier<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:40.960> that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
over things that much easier and that

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.290 
over things that much easier and that
being<00:00:41.440> my<00:00:41.650> leading<00:00:42.040> edge<00:00:42.220> but<00:00:42.970> one<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.180> the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
being my leading edge but one of the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.510 
being my leading edge but one of the
biggest<00:00:43.629> thing<00:00:43.870> with<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.440> two<00:00:44.739> Niner<00:00:44.950> was<00:00:45.370> the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
biggest thing with the two Niner was the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.310 
biggest thing with the two Niner was the
contact<00:00:46.000> patch<00:00:46.180> on<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.629> front<00:00:46.930> end<00:00:47.080> of<00:00:47.230> the

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
contact patch on the front end of the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.830 
contact patch on the front end of the
bike<00:00:47.470> you<00:00:47.860> have<00:00:48.370> more<00:00:48.699> of<00:00:48.910> this<00:00:49.090> tire<00:00:49.390> on<00:00:49.690> the

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
bike you have more of this tire on the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.689 
bike you have more of this tire on the
ground<00:00:50.080> so<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.620> stability<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.460> front

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
ground so the stability of the front

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.780 
ground so the stability of the front
wheel<00:00:51.940> is<00:00:52.900> very<00:00:53.080> very<00:00:53.530> beneficial<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:54.550> then

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
wheel is very very beneficial and then

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.090 
wheel is very very beneficial and then
that<00:00:54.940> rear<00:00:55.300> will<00:00:55.720> follow<00:00:55.960> as<00:00:56.230> well<00:00:56.440> with<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.830> two

was we did some key things to the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.230 
was we did some key things to the
geometry<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.740> our<00:01:12.280> full<00:01:12.520> suspension<00:01:12.729> to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
reduction of parts and it also allows us

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.030 
reduction of parts and it also allows us

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
bike it has a lot of the same kind of

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.640 
bike it has a lot of the same kind of
nimble<00:07:00.659> feel<00:07:00.900> you<00:07:01.139> can<00:07:01.259> throw<00:07:01.469> it<00:07:01.560> around

nimble feel you can throw it around
really<00:07:02.039> easy<00:07:02.310> they<00:07:03.000> climb<00:07:03.449> very<00:07:03.659> similar<00:07:04.139> but

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
really easy they climb very similar but

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.040 
really easy they climb very similar but
the<00:07:04.919> bigger<00:07:05.759> wheel<00:07:06.060> I<00:07:06.330> definitely<00:07:06.840> feel<00:07:07.020> like

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
the bigger wheel I definitely feel like

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.580 
the bigger wheel I definitely feel like
I<00:07:07.259> notice<00:07:07.620> a<00:07:07.830> big<00:07:08.310> difference<00:07:08.340> in<00:07:09.590> rotational

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
I notice a big difference in rotational

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.830 
I notice a big difference in rotational
weight<00:07:10.949> and<00:07:11.189> feel<00:07:11.969> like<00:07:12.120> I<00:07:12.270> have<00:07:12.360> a<00:07:12.389> little<00:07:12.750> bit

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
weight and feel like I have a little bit

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.240 
weight and feel like I have a little bit
more<00:07:13.020> to<00:07:13.169> log<00:07:13.289> up<00:07:13.469> even<00:07:13.800> though<00:07:13.889> it's<00:07:14.009> only<00:07:14.099> a

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
more to log up even though it's only a

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.209 
more to log up even though it's only a
24<00:07:14.639> pound<00:07:14.789> bike<00:07:15.029> it<00:07:15.469> it's<00:07:16.469> definitely<00:07:16.800> not<00:07:17.159> the

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:17.219 
24 pound bike it it's definitely not the

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:20.689 
24 pound bike it it's definitely not the
same<00:07:17.580> as<00:07:17.699> my<00:07:17.849> top<00:07:18.029> fuel<00:07:18.680> the<00:07:19.680> top<00:07:19.889> with<00:07:20.520> two

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 
same as my top fuel the top with two

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.180 
same as my top fuel the top with two
three<00:07:20.909> tap<00:07:21.180> fuel<00:07:21.419> in<00:07:21.509> this<00:07:21.770> top<00:07:22.770> fuel<00:07:23.009> goes

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
three tap fuel in this top fuel goes

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.820 
three tap fuel in this top fuel goes
uphill<00:07:23.599> quite<00:07:24.599> a<00:07:24.629> bit<00:07:24.810> better<00:07:24.960> it's<00:07:25.620> a<00:07:25.650> little

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 
uphill quite a bit better it's a little

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.680 
uphill quite a bit better it's a little
more<00:07:25.949> active<00:07:26.099> suspension<00:07:26.430> so<00:07:27.029> you<00:07:27.569> have

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690 
more active suspension so you have

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.899 
more active suspension so you have
better<00:07:27.900> traction<00:07:28.259> up<00:07:28.710> the<00:07:28.919> hill<00:07:29.069> down<00:07:29.849> the

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:29.909 
better traction up the hill down the

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:32.779 
better traction up the hill down the
hill<00:07:30.029> though<00:07:30.650> they<00:07:31.650> both<00:07:31.889> work<00:07:32.129> really<00:07:32.159> well

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:32.789 
hill though they both work really well

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:34.939 
hill though they both work really well
but<00:07:33.270> these<00:07:33.479> big<00:07:33.810> wheels<00:07:34.020> in<00:07:34.440> this<00:07:34.620> kind<00:07:34.860> of

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:34.949 
but these big wheels in this kind of

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:37.459 
but these big wheels in this kind of
Rolly<00:07:35.190> terrain<00:07:35.610> they<00:07:36.270> just<00:07:36.479> roll<00:07:36.750> I<00:07:36.990> wish<00:07:37.349> the
