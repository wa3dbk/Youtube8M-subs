 am a great follower of this kind of 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.939
 smoothie I 'm doing almost every 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.800
 northern days several times a week and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.910
 I ride very regularly and I know 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.290
 that for some people it can 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.390
 look very repulsive because of the 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.890
 color and one may wonder if my 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.149
 sense him of the greenery and is that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.160
 it is a particular interest 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.620
 and the answer is yes it's hyper 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.329
 beneficial for the health he for the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.130
 beauty it allows to have a pretty 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.200
 poor a fresh complexion and and nails 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.820
 and strong hair and it also allows 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.470
 mainly to be fit in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.790
 bringing to our body a maximum of 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.230
 1000 very slow I will give you my 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.940
 little tips to succeed at best 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.700
 your green smoothies and I'm going to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.930
 present two greenhouse is absolutely 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.150
 delicious and bursting with good nutrients 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.220
 it's perfect in this is when you have a 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.750
 peck after a workout or 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.200
 in addition to breakfast it is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.790
 as you want the first time that 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.770
 I heard about air smoothie 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.720
 it was with a recipe in which 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.700
 they will use spirulina 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.740
 these microalgae which is very very rich 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.960
 in proteins and particularly iron 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.520
 it's not the option I prefer because 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.140
 that it smells exactly like the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.390
 fish food and that's 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 difficult to hide the green color 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.009
 got a little pulls towards dark blue 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 gold is not a bright glass but after 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.340
 many people love this super 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.100
 food because it remains one of the most 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.689
 concentrated in good nutrients 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.340
 the second technique I discovered 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.289
 to have smoothies pours and 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.359
 to add spinach it's still 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.369
 today one of my favorite options 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.330
 spinach is dense in nutrients 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.890
 like doing it 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.210
 calcium it also gives a color 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.860
 very high rise but also with 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.510
 only a handful of leaves at 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 level of taste we still feel their 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.780
 presence but it's pretty light next 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.330
 fruit mix that accompanies its 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.010
 goes more or less unnoticed I also 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.270
 tried the experiment with fires 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.130
 the shield when I was running 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.180
 of spinach the color is less vivid and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.290
 the leaves are less rich in 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.300
 nutrients so it's not so 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 interesting that spinach and I 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.960
 personally find that we feel more 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.350
 the end is sweet slightly bitter but 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.820
 well present and my last discovery 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.510
 in terms of finding ci towards this are 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.190
 the chard 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.540
 there was plenty in the kitchen garden 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.460
 my parents and that's where I tried 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.960
 dying first juice made from pet and 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.820
 blow if it works for the judges that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.650
 also works for the seconds if the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.720
 leaves in nutritional profile very 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.520
 close to spinach on the other hand for or 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.110
 is imperceptible so it's now 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.480
 my number one choice for shaking 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.980
 winter it remains a vegetable quite rare to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.880
 find in the trade but it's very 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.620
 easy to cultivate 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.870
 so I try the experiment in a 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.040
 big pot on my balcony and already invited 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.410
 some leaves for your future this 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.450
 word if I 'm going to give you a few 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.040
 little tips in addition firstly if 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.330
 you want a nice green smoothie with 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.769
 a very clear latent color 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.650
 avoid adding fruit 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.239
 red raspberry blueberry strawberries okay 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.070
 to be rather give a color that pulls 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.470
 on the maran so not necessarily 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.820
 appetizing but personally and I 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.410
 do it anyway I mix can even 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.090
 not what the red fruit association 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.190
 and greenery his ranks a bombshell 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.630
 nutrients so it's hyper beneficial and 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.760
 in addition to that it is very good 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.980
 secondly know that all that is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.660
 gone from a little facebook studies and 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.100
 spinach and so on these are the diets 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.870
 who receive the most pesticides 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.280
 because these are the very vegetables 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.870
 pest sensitive 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.060
 so if you really want none 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.800
 trace of pesticides choose bios 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.140
 or so you are you can cultivate 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.239
 yourself and finally really take the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.310
 winter smith like more for health 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.140
 for example I know me if I add 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.880
 and pass some leaves but there by 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.430
 here and there in but this word if they 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.019
 would not want another moment 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.430
 and on the other hand it is true that 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.900
 when the leaves are cooked that there are 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.510
 more nutrients available and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.069
 assimilated by the body but when 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.569
 the sword its believed would be there anyway it is 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.430
 just in lesser quantities anyway 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.689
 not as good at assimilating them but 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.700
 it's still a plus in the end 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.980
 to have this daily intake or almost 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.629
 of nutrients it can only be 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.189
 beneficial and if he did not do I know 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.930
 that those movements lost to a 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.739
 quarter and now we move on to 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.359
 recipes for the first I thought about 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.430
 all the people who asked me 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.680
 a creamy smoothie recipe but 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.540
 without banana I use a leaves of 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.340
 and I take care to remove the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.250
 white part that is very fibrous and 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.349
 low in nutrients 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.209
 I will also use the equivalent of 25 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.599
 centiliters of sugar- free almond milk 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.759
 added 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.530
 I add some dates it allows to 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.419
 sugar and his son without using the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.030
 white sugar that has become all-fiber 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.949
 vitamins minerals for the fruity side 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.630
 I use one of our languages ​​and a 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.820
 handle of frozen pineapple pieces and 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.169
 I bought it all to picard to be 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.849
 sure the leaves are going to be fine 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.210
 mixer I liked first in the 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.039
 blender 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.900
 I also add almond milk to 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.370
 start because when the blades is bathing 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.330
 in the liquid the mixing was done 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.979
 much more easily 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.430
 then there is nothing to do but put the 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.430
 remaining ingredients 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.430
 I rotate my mixr speed 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.430
 maximum for a minute to have 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.260
 something good slip this smoothie 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.580
 there is a little wonder especially if 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.750
 you are a little chilly with the 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.150
 green smoothies I recommend you to 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.310
 start by testing that one there if the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.840
 ultra sweet and fruity and we feel 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.010
 absolutely not the green side for the 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.960
 second recipe I present you a 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.000
 Oranges classic show variant 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.830
 bananas and pinards that are also 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.450
 I'm doing the most because he's very 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.470
 economical and with ingredients 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.720
 easy to find 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.700
 but then I used grapefruit 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.169
 the place of the orange and I added 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.970
 fishing because it's the season and 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.470
 I love this fruit for grapefruit I 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.000
 go on the meadow it's me it's better 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.620
 to take fresh fruits rather than 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.630
 of the game in the bottle although it happens to me 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.580
 also to use the rich fruits in 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.380
 Vitamin C are great for increasing 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.389
 our iron option that there is in 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.950
 spinach if you plan to consume 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.450
 little or no meat is good 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.790
 trick to know to avoid 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.530
 shortcomings 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.910
 so it's a pretty acidic smoothie with 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.740
 grapefruit then if you want 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.710
 add some dates to balance 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.020
 the flavors do not hesitate when everything is 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.350
 well mixed in a greenhouse and we taste everything 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.350
 simply 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.850
 I hope you enjoyed this video and 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.320

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.120
 green smoothies if it's not already 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.560
 do not hesitate to tell me 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.270
 in commentary of recipes that you 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.820
 prefer or so your failures in the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.470
 matter me it will remain spirulina that 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.289
 jamie with big tablespoon 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.490
