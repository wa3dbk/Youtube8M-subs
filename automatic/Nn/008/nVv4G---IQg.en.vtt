00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.210 

whatever<00:03:16.689> but<00:03:17.439> the<00:03:17.530> big<00:03:17.680> thing<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.890> people

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
kind of get into is to actually start

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.860 
kind of get into is to actually start
developing<00:03:19.689> a<00:03:19.810> sense<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.140> speed<00:03:20.379> two<00:03:20.950> things

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
developing a sense of speed two things

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:29.990 
developing a sense of speed two things
y'all<00:03:22.870> trip<00:03:23.079> taking<00:03:23.290> going<00:03:23.950> up<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.159> down<00:03:24.250> so

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.250 

it<00:03:31.000> kind<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.329> like<00:03:31.510> actually<00:03:31.900> doing<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.139> lot<00:03:32.200> of

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
it kind of like actually doing a lot of

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.099 
it kind of like actually doing a lot of
hammer<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.650> stuff<00:03:36.419> it's<00:03:37.419> got<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:37.659> a<00:03:37.689> sweepy

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
hammer on stuff it's got like a sweepy

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:46.199 
hammer on stuff it's got like a sweepy
action<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:45.310> like<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> metal<00:03:45.790> thing<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.120> know

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
action it's like a metal thing you know

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.190 
action it's like a metal thing you know
I<00:03:46.239> mean<00:03:46.359> wants<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.569> start<00:03:46.720> doing<00:03:46.870> those<00:03:46.930> kinds

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
I mean wants to start doing those kinds

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.080 
I mean wants to start doing those kinds
of<00:03:47.230> techniques<00:03:47.639> economic<00:03:48.639> speed<00:03:48.879> picking

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
of techniques economic speed picking

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.119 
of techniques economic speed picking
they<00:03:49.299> call<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.629> you<00:03:49.720> know<00:03:49.859> starting<00:03:50.859> it<00:03:50.950> out<00:03:51.010> of

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
they call it you know starting it out of

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.839 
they call it you know starting it out of
those<00:03:51.189> habits<00:03:52.379> but<00:03:53.379> um<00:03:54.099> so<00:03:54.400> if<00:03:54.459> you<00:03:54.519> go<00:03:54.639> to<00:03:54.700> your

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
those habits but um so if you go to your

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.970 
those habits but um so if you go to your
Panasonic

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.410 

you're<00:03:59.550> starting<00:03:59.670> at<00:03:59.909> your<00:04:00.000> speed<00:04:00.180> kind<00:04:00.330> of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
you're starting at your speed kind of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.030 
you're starting at your speed kind of
built<00:04:00.599> up<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:03.150> do<00:04:03.450> what<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.900> call<00:04:04.170> chasing<00:04:04.739> we're

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
built up I do what I call chasing we're

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.070 
built up I do what I call chasing we're
doubling<00:04:05.430> I'm<00:04:06.090> sure<00:04:06.209> there's<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.420> great<00:04:06.629> word

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
doubling I'm sure there's a great word

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.420 
doubling I'm sure there's a great word
for<00:04:07.409> there's<00:04:07.590> like<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.709> real<00:04:07.950> name<00:04:08.190> for<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
for there's like a real name for the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.030 
for there's like a real name for the
technique<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:09.230> as<00:04:10.230> you're<00:04:10.409> coming<00:04:10.590> back<00:04:10.739> up

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
technique but as you're coming back up

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.309 
technique but as you're coming back up
the<00:04:11.519> pentatonic<00:04:11.909> instead<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:12.989> just<00:04:13.110> playing

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
the pentatonic instead of just playing

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.689 
the pentatonic instead of just playing
it<00:04:13.440> straight<00:04:13.530> through<00:04:16.430> cooking<00:04:17.430> through<00:04:17.639> all

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
it straight through cooking through all

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.099 
it straight through cooking through all
those<00:04:17.790> notes<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.209> can<00:04:18.630> kind<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:18.959> start

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
those notes you can kind of start

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:31.779 
those notes you can kind of start
chasing<00:04:19.350> back<00:04:19.680> on<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.190> can<00:04:20.340> go<00:04:20.430> like

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:44.619 

and<00:04:32.789> up<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.120> speed

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.249 

especially<00:04:45.629> if<00:04:45.689> you<00:04:45.780> listen<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.020> something

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
especially if you listen to something

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.230 
especially if you listen to something
recorded<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.830> sounds<00:04:47.099> like<00:04:47.219> way<00:04:47.520> more<00:04:47.550> than<00:04:48.180> it

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
recorded it sounds like way more than it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.679 
recorded it sounds like way more than it
really<00:04:48.389> is<00:04:48.539> you<00:04:48.810> know<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:51.090> that's<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.449> kind

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
really is you know so that's that kind

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:52.309 
really is you know so that's that kind
of<00:04:51.719> thinking<00:04:51.900> that's<00:04:52.080> just<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.289> first

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
of thinking that's just the first

00:04:52.319 --> 00:05:02.330 
of thinking that's just the first
position<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.889> know<00:04:55.400> here's<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.460> second<00:05:01.340> you

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
position you know here's a second you

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.209 
position you know here's a second you
always<00:05:02.520> go<00:05:02.639> back<00:05:02.759> you<00:05:02.939> see<00:05:03.889> wherever<00:05:04.889> it<00:05:05.099> is

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
always go back you see wherever it is

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:12.050 
always go back you see wherever it is

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
what see you're starting with and you

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.950 
what see you're starting with and you
can<00:05:35.580> still<00:05:35.759> play<00:05:36.000> out<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.300> same<00:05:36.449> pentatonic

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
can still play out the same pentatonic

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.559 
can still play out the same pentatonic
ideas<00:05:37.259> um<00:05:37.909> but<00:05:38.909> yeah<00:05:39.000> these<00:05:39.330> are<00:05:39.389> all<00:05:39.539> just

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
ideas um but yeah these are all just

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.869 
ideas um but yeah these are all just
good<00:05:39.870> things<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.169> keep<00:05:40.319> in<00:05:40.409> mind<00:05:40.469> and<00:05:40.889> when<00:05:41.819> you

good things to keep in mind and when you
do<00:05:41.999> any<00:05:42.150> turn<00:05:42.330> around<00:05:42.599> stead<00:05:43.319> of<00:05:43.349> just<00:05:43.439> go<00:05:43.620> on

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
do any turn around stead of just go on

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:51.769 
do any turn around stead of just go on
you<00:05:43.860> know<00:05:43.889> for<00:05:44.129> that<00:05:44.249> I<00:05:50.300> like<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.389> kind<00:05:51.479> of<00:05:51.599> drop

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
you know for that I like to kind of drop

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.240 
you know for that I like to kind of drop
it<00:05:51.930> down<00:05:52.050> go<00:05:52.319> down<00:05:52.349> an<00:05:52.620> octave<00:05:52.740> so<00:05:53.039> you<00:05:53.129> got

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
it down go down an octave so you got

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:10.520 
it down go down an octave so you got
your
