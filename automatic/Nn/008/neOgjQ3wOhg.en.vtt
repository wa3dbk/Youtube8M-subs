00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.639
 or the one that does not give me much to show you 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.220
 we actually had a weekend 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.200
 rainy, hot, cold temperatures 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.850
 in the morning and continue this 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.590
 forecast in this same way and what 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.450
 we see in the satellite image we have 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.119
 a tropical disturbance near 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.490
 Mexican coasts especially in Nayarit and 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.439
 manzanillo the zone of instability as 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.089
 good is going to continue in this way 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.339
 especially for the southwest area and 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.929
 West of Mexican territory joined 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.519
 to this maximum wind coming from 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.439
 peaceful ocean this temperature 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.720
 hot that predominates in territory 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.340
 Mexican continue in this heat wave 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.899
 pretty marked for the territory 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.640
 national and of course we're going to 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.140
 continue monitoring the area of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.510
 southwest because we have a zone of 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.100
 instability that will cause rains of 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.120
 moderate to strong especially for the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.370
 Yucatan Peninsula 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.079
 cancÃºn and quintana roo of course 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.910
 affecting people and the valley of mexico 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.410
 these temperatures also continue 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.390
 quite hot affecting what is 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.769
 puebla and the federal district but 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.870
 also these rains so 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.089
 intermittent that they conspire with this 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.980
 zone of instability and these gusts of 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.019
 maximum wind coming from the Pacific 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.550
 towards what is the gulf of mexico and 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.440
 this image of rainfall with this 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.880
 blue red spot because it also continues 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.710
 indicating us this one 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.450
 constant precipitation in the area 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.610
 southwest and west at least the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.140
 next 72 hours so to take it very 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.369
 account for maritime transport 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.259
 and terrestrials a lot of eye because the waves 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.119
 could you be seen elevated in the 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.560
 next 48 hours and now let's check 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.149
 the climatic conditions for our 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.880

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.280

 instability causing precipitation 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.939
 for here to populate the maximum between 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.560
