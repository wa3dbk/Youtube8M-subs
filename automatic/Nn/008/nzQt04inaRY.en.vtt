00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.679
 What happened recently, everyone? Oh, I miss you all, I just want to make you all right. 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.640
 Ah, except you, because of your face problem 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.550
 Other people, let's see Thailand! 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.820
 Yeah, I am coming back (the first few episodes are someone else's class) 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 Just come back and share this movie with you. There is a guy who is desperately showing his very eyebrows when the golfer is interviewed. 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.420
 I guess this guy must be popular with the opposite sex. 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.350
 Try to think about it, ladies and women, now if you are single, people are in a club, you drink wine leisurely, and then see someone looking at you through the bar. 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.039
 I think I will definitely go with him, right, ladies. 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.829
 This guy is my idol, I don’t think he has any problems with the quiz at the time of the interview. 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.649
 Anyway, no one will go to see any golf interviews?? 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.599
 Is there any relationship between these two people? 

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.789
 Or do they look a lot like just because whites seem to be almost the same? 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.000
 So far, this film has been seen by 50,000 people in 3 days. To be honest, it is not too much. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.870
 But in fact, every movie I want to talk about today is not so popular. 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.579
 But what kind of "hot movie" to go to, I am talking about "interesting videos" here!! 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.849
 So what kind of cat stuck in the mouse ball, Fuck you!! 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.269
 Do you all remember a magazine called Highlights? 

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:29.649
 It’s the kind of magazine that will be put in the dentist’s office. There is a game area for everyone to look for in the picture. 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.200
 Now everyone is looking for a place where the film is not right. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.469
 What is wrong, are you finding out? 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.459
 This is probably one of the most interesting things I have seen in my life. 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.299
 Who is the crazy woman who is holding the car?? 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.510
 This is not the only way for women in the Middle East to travel. 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.270
 From this video, I guess this is probably happening somewhere in East Asia. 

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:58.390
 This will explain why she will fall off the seat cushion, because women in East Asia have no ass! 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 Troll: Don't make fun of East Asian women, Ray!! 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.030
 Ok, he is already hanging, let's not mention him anymore. 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.340
 I think the man on the bike should go buy a T-shirt with the words "If you can see this line, it means that the woman in my back seat has fallen." 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.710
 I saw the best laughter comment below the original film, "Let's drag her ass into the kitchen all the way!" 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.400
 But everyone, do you know that there is a kind of girl who will constantly call you? 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.439
 Then there will be nothing to happen suddenly in your home, like living to preach 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.530
 This kind of person does not need you to throw her off the locomotive, I have to do it! 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.620
 Then before we start talking about the last film, let me remind you that if you click on the subscribe button above, the alcoholic stepfather will magically stop drinking and find work! 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.900
 Um, it’s bad... good to continue 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.270
 Please forgive me for being too excited when I talk about the next film. 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.850
 But you also know that I actually excite every film. 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.609
 This feeling is probably like the day when the black man was suddenly replaced by the Pink King Kong Warrior*. In short, I have to say that this movie is probably the best movie I have ever seen. 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.640
 There are several contractors here who are doing things, and then they don’t pull the handlebars up. 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.629
 Then... no, the car swept him!! 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.139
 Then now another person is anxious to stop the truck, but he also forgot to pull the handle 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.109
 Now we are a bit like watching a slow and painful death penalty... 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.210
 Oh, my god, the car is coming. 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.880
 He was hit by two trucks in a row! 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.879
 Ok, there are a few interesting things about this movie. 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.099
 This video was uploaded to Youtube by a young man and then posted on his blog. 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.229
 Usually the uploaded video content will not be the uploader’s own experience. 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.479
 Really happy for him! Someone was injured in his grandfather's yard, and then his reaction was like this 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.229
 Wow! I want to upload this to Youtube! And my blog! 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.939
 This is great, have you heard it? "If God gave you a lemon, let's just have a lemon party!" 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.849
 Don't use google to check the sentence! 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.259
 You think the guy in the movie will run back to help you after the accident. 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.099
 No! He just ran past the injured! 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.819
 "Hey, I have to hurry, because there is a golf interview!!" 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.009
 Just kidding, I think he will definitely help in the past! 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.189
 But what’s more interesting is that the person who was hit by the truck didn’t break any of the bones. 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.069
 The kid who uploaded the movie wrote this in the movie description! 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.159
 So this is not my fault. 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.289
 Obviously this guy is too fat, so even if it is hit by two trucks, it will not hurt! 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.789
 I am not lying! This is really his joke! 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.909
 But it is also quite amazing, because he was not injured! 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.569
 Ok, now, I want to thank Kassem G. When I was in the last episode, he helped me on behalf of the show. 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.819
 I think we have the clips he hosts here. 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.599
 I am Kassem G, I have the characteristics of women. 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.280
 I often accidentally harden and bring a lot of trouble to my friends. 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.909
 And I am still a member of the former al-Qaeda organization, the United States is going to die! 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.379
 Um.. Thank you very much, and thank you today's questioner! 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.279
 I am asking these 3 guys today. 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.130
 This is their problem 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.189
 Hey! Ray! We have a few Joey here! 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.000
 Our question is: What is the banana used for? 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.470
 So what exactly is banana used for? 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.910
 I will tell you why bananas are used. 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.689
 In fact, I want you to answer it. 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.910
 Leave your interesting and creative response in the comments section. 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.060
 Just in the "that" place below 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.089
 I still want to thank everyone for watching this episode. I am Ray William Johnson. I am very happy to return to the show again. The above information is provided by me. 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:02.750
 Tell me now! What have you heard about the most stupid rumors about yourself? 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:26.899
 "I heard that my third egg is cancerous." "Some people say that I am a fool.... Shut up, mom!" "There is a rumor that I can't spell it." Misspelling) "Someone told me: Black Warrior is my dad..." "I lost my virginity at a family gathering" 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:36.000
