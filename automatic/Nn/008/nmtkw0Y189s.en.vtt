00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
they're both roughly the same color they

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.630 
they're both roughly the same color they
are<00:01:43.259> different<00:01:43.619> dimpled<00:01:44.040> patterns<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.520> them

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
are different dimpled patterns on them

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
are different dimpled patterns on them
we're<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> hit<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> couple<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.110> balls<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
we're going to hit a couple of balls and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.780 
we're going to hit a couple of balls and
see<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.630> I've<00:01:48.750> done<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:49.790> trusty

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
see so what I've done here is my trusty

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.359 
see so what I've done here is my trusty
Cleveland<00:01:51.360> 53<00:01:52.079> degree<00:01:52.439> wedge<00:01:52.710> I've<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.100> set

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
Cleveland 53 degree wedge I've just set

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.899 
Cleveland 53 degree wedge I've just set
the<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.149> greens<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.689> soft<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> gc2<00:01:56.340> she's

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the the greens to soft on the gc2 she's

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.420 
the the greens to soft on the gc2 she's
in<00:01:57.090> front<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.920> about<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> hundred

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
in front of you here about a hundred

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.330 
in front of you here about a hundred
yards<00:01:59.850> away<00:02:00.000> from<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> flag<00:02:01.469> here<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.280> I'm

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
yards away from the flag here so I'm

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.200 
yards away from the flag here so I'm
just<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.759> hit

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
just going to hit

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480 
just going to hit
the<00:02:03.299> shots<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.040> doing<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.159> little<00:02:05.310> bit<00:02:05.460> of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the shots and doing a little bit of

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.700 
the shots and doing a little bit of
testing<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.330> before<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> did<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.500> video

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
testing on this before I did this video

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.969 
testing on this before I did this video
I<00:02:08.100> want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> show<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.750> spin<00:02:10.350> rates<00:02:10.800> which

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
I want to show you the spin rates which

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.830 
I want to show you the spin rates which
we<00:02:11.190> generate<00:02:11.670> here<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.120> let's<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.600> we<00:02:12.690> can

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
we generate here so let's see if we can

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.809 
we generate here so let's see if we can
get<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.990> decent<00:02:13.230> strike<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:16.400> little<00:02:17.400> bit<00:02:17.490> pulled

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
get a decent strike a little bit pulled

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.090 
get a decent strike a little bit pulled
to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> left<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.840> had<00:02:18.990> turned<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.770> over<00:02:19.800> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
to the left you had turned it over a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.750 
to the left you had turned it over a
little<00:02:20.190> bit<00:02:20.930> his<00:02:21.930> hand<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:24.830> yardage<00:02:25.830> 109

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
little bit his hand that one yardage 109

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.030 
little bit his hand that one yardage 109
carry<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.780> tweaked<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.650> little<00:02:28.680> bit

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
carry I just tweaked it a little bit

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.690 
carry I just tweaked it a little bit
just<00:02:29.160> close<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.760> club<00:02:30.000> face<00:02:30.060> down<00:02:31.280> if<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.489> can

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
just close the club face down if we can

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.430 
just close the club face down if we can
just<00:02:32.910> keep<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.300> Club<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.569> little<00:02:33.840> bit<00:02:33.959> square

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
just keep it Club a little bit square

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:48.920 
just keep it Club a little bit square
through<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.069> one<00:02:46.010> 197<00:02:47.010> yards<00:02:47.070> carry<00:02:47.930> yeah

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
through this one 197 yards carry yeah

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.330 
through this one 197 yards carry yeah
we're<00:02:49.290> gonna<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> quick<00:02:49.830> look<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.160> that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
we're gonna have a quick look at that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.340 
we're gonna have a quick look at that
okay<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.850> didn't<00:02:51.180> quite<00:02:51.450> flush<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.050> but<00:02:52.320> I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
here so on the last shot 66 miles an

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.340 
here so on the last shot 66 miles an
hour<00:02:58.019> time<00:02:58.350> speed<00:02:59.630> thing<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.750> want<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.200> look

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
hour time speed thing I want you to look

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.680 
hour time speed thing I want you to look
at<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:01.980> total<00:03:02.640> spin<00:03:03.440> 84<00:03:04.819> 58,000<00:03:05.819> 450

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
at here is a total spin 84 58,000 450

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.620 
at here is a total spin 84 58,000 450
revs<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.380> spit<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.700> really<00:03:09.090> nail<00:03:09.299> wrong

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
revs of spit now so really nail wrong

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.970 
revs of spit now so really nail wrong
with<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.870> wedge<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.769> get<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
with this wedge on that I can get the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.710 
with this wedge on that I can get the
spin<00:03:11.310> right<00:03:11.489> up<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.880> nine<00:03:12.090> nine<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.690> half

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
spin right up to nine nine and a half

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.960 
spin right up to nine nine and a half
thousand<00:03:13.530> okay<00:03:13.860> that's<00:03:14.459> with<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> high

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
thousand okay that's with a high

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.500 
thousand okay that's with a high
performance<00:03:15.570> golf<00:03:15.900> ball<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:17.250> what<00:03:18.030> happens

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
performance golf ball so what happens

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.560 
performance golf ball so what happens
when<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:19.079> have<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.980> hit<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:20.670> fellow<00:03:21.239> here

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
when we have a hit with this fellow here

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.660 
when we have a hit with this fellow here
which<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.790> straight<00:03:23.790> away<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.540> do<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
which is going to straight away I do the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.360 
which is going to straight away I do the
your<00:03:26.670> bags<00:03:27.090> test<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.930> know<00:03:28.500> if<00:03:28.680> we'll<00:03:28.860> hear<00:03:29.190> this

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
your bags test I know if we'll hear this

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.509 
your bags test I know if we'll hear this
but<00:03:29.810> when<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> bounce<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.380> pro<00:03:31.620> mean<00:03:31.920> one<00:03:32.160> it

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
but when I bounce the pro mean one it

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.350 
but when I bounce the pro mean one it
feels<00:03:32.790> quite<00:03:33.150> soft<00:03:33.630> on<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.049> top<00:03:34.290> face<00:03:35.329> when<00:03:36.329> I

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
feels quite soft on the top face when I

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.850 
feels quite soft on the top face when I
bounce<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:38.220> dog<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.239> hear<00:03:39.860> the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
bounce the dog you can hear the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.920 
bounce the dog you can hear the
different<00:03:41.310> changing<00:03:41.820> pitch<00:03:42.120> there<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.690> see

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
different changing pitch there I can see

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.410 
different changing pitch there I can see
it<00:03:43.110> feel<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.440> on<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.829> public<00:03:44.100> feels<00:03:44.549> rock<00:03:45.030> hard

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it feel it on the public feels rock hard

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.349 
it feel it on the public feels rock hard
and<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.170> sounds<00:03:46.650> completely<00:03:46.829> different<00:03:47.359> so

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
and it sounds completely different so

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.310 
and it sounds completely different so
let's<00:03:48.570> give<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.959> little<00:03:49.170> hit<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:50.130> see<00:03:51.320> if

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
let's give it a little hit and see if

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.620 
let's give it a little hit and see if
the<00:03:52.560> numbers<00:03:53.040> change<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.820> much<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.510> I'm

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
the numbers change that much so I'm

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.199

pretty good watch this ball wrapped on
the<00:05:28.960> drink<00:05:29.850> one<00:05:30.850> bounced<00:05:32.760> check<00:05:33.840> spin<00:05:34.840> rate<00:05:35.050> on

that one's going to climb back up and

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.830 
that one's going to climb back up and
they<00:05:38.169> got<00:05:38.340> 8100<00:05:39.340> so<00:05:39.910> there<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.120> go<00:05:40.300> massive

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
they got 8100 so there you go massive

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.140 
they got 8100 so there you go massive
difference<00:05:41.229> in<00:05:41.410> speed<00:05:41.860> so<00:05:42.280> if<00:05:42.880> you're<00:05:43.120> a
