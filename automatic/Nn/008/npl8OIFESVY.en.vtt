newly published study so the exact same
thing<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.320> always<00:00:25.380> happens<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.430> happening

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
thing that always happens is happening

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
thing that always happens is happening
which<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.019> defenders<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> fracking<00:00:29.369> say

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
which is the defenders of fracking say

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.240 
which is the defenders of fracking say
this<00:00:30.359> has<00:00:30.630> nothing<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.199> do<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.590> fracking<00:00:31.980> as

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
this has nothing to do with fracking as

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.200 
this has nothing to do with fracking as
a<00:00:32.279> process<00:00:32.690> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:35.040> wells<00:00:35.370> were

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a process this is because the wells were

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
a process this is because the wells were
faulty<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.140> heard<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> past

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
faulty and we heard this in the past

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.010 
faulty and we heard this in the past
Louis<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.610> had<00:00:38.910> tainted<00:00:39.270> water<00:00:39.660> from

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
Louis when we had tainted water from

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
Louis when we had tainted water from
fracking<00:00:40.290> which<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.710> listen<00:00:40.980> there's<00:00:41.460> nothing

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
fracking which is listen there's nothing

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.240 
fracking which is listen there's nothing
wrong<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.420> process<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
wrong with the process it's that the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.389 
wrong with the process it's that the
wells<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:45.120> faulty<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.770> issue<00:00:47.039> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
wells are faulty it's just an issue that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.330 
wells are faulty it's just an issue that
we<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.640> easily<00:00:48.000> fix<00:00:48.530> yet<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> process<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
we can easily fix yet the process is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
we can easily fix yet the process is
what's<00:00:50.550> causing<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.300> earthquakes<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.260> uh

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
what's causing the earthquakes but uh

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439 
what's causing the earthquakes but uh
the<00:00:52.829> pollution<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> faulty<00:00:54.239> wells

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the pollution is from the faulty wells

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
the pollution is from the faulty wells
right<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.110> figured<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.129> two

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
right we figured that out so there's two

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
right we figured that out so there's two
two<00:00:56.760> layers<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.210> analysis<00:00:57.719> here<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.079> first

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
two layers of analysis here right first

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.279 
two layers of analysis here right first
layer<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.219> analysis<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.090> couldn't<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.230> be

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
layer of analysis is couldn't this be

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.100 
layer of analysis is couldn't this be
because<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.219> undocumented<00:01:03.059> leaks<00:01:03.690> just

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
because of undocumented leaks just

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
because of undocumented leaks just
because<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.650> haven't<00:01:04.860> been<00:01:05.070> announced

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
because there haven't been announced

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.270 
because there haven't been announced
leaks<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.780> doesn't<00:01:07.170> guarantee<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
leaks that doesn't guarantee that it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.980 
leaks that doesn't guarantee that it
must<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.670> from<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.970> faulty<00:01:09.360> well<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.840> could

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
must be from a faulty well there could

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
must be from a faulty well there could
be<00:01:10.049> leaks<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.650> been<00:01:10.890> covered<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.369> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
be leaks that have been covered up and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.149 
be leaks that have been covered up and
the<00:01:12.090> second<00:01:12.450> layer<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.900> even<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.799> true

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the second layer is even if it's true

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
the second layer is even if it's true
that<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> issue<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:15.299> integrity<00:01:15.689> rather

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that the issue is well integrity rather

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
that the issue is well integrity rather
than<00:01:16.650> something<00:01:17.340> inherent<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> fracking

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
than something inherent to the fracking

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
than something inherent to the fracking
process<00:01:19.070> shouldn't<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.430> worried<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
process shouldn't we be worried that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.090 
process shouldn't we be worried that
there<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.810> numerous<00:01:22.080> well<00:01:22.650> integrity

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
there are numerous well integrity

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
there are numerous well integrity
problems<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.119> are<00:01:24.240> leading<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.900> fracking

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
problems that are leading to fracking

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
problems that are leading to fracking
chemicals<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:26.009> drinking<00:01:26.340> water<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.790> don't<00:01:27.270> see

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
chemicals in drinking water I don't see

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.080 
chemicals in drinking water I don't see
how<00:01:27.630> saying<00:01:27.960> oh<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.130> fracking<00:01:29.820> it's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
how saying oh it's not fracking it's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
how saying oh it's not fracking it's
faulty<00:01:30.810> wells<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.560> are<00:01:31.590> leading<00:01:32.159> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
faulty wells that are leading to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370 
faulty wells that are leading to
fracking<00:01:32.820> chemicals<00:01:33.119> showing<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> our

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
fracking chemicals showing up in our

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410 
fracking chemicals showing up in our
drinking<00:01:34.710> water<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.490> still<00:01:35.850> seems<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
drinking water that still seems like a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.710 
drinking water that still seems like a
concern<00:01:37.340> yeah<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.579> mean<00:01:38.850> either<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.270> problem

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
concern yeah I mean either the problem

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.710 
concern yeah I mean either the problem
is<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> fracking<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.720> polluting

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
is that fracking is is polluting

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.230 
is that fracking is is polluting
drinking<00:01:43.110> water<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> total<00:01:45.030> lack<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
drinking water or a total lack of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.230 
drinking water or a total lack of
regulation<00:01:45.829> is<00:01:46.829> resulting<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.579> disaster

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
regulation is resulting in this disaster

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.410 
regulation is resulting in this disaster
and<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:49.380> mean<00:01:49.710> I'd<00:01:49.860> are<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.880> gonna<00:01:51.000> fix<00:01:51.210> either

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and I mean I'd are we gonna fix either

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
and I mean I'd are we gonna fix either
of<00:01:51.570> those<00:01:51.659> things<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.259> no<00:01:52.380> idea<00:01:52.439> remember

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
of those things I have no idea remember

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.440 
of those things I have no idea remember
that<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:53.490> need<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.970> doing<00:01:54.240> any<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that we don't need to be doing any of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.910 
that we don't need to be doing any of
this<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.869> could<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this we could just be going in the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.139 
this we could just be going in the

energy<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.159> there's<00:01:59.460> uh

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
energy but we're not and there's uh

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.050 
energy but we're not and there's uh
there's<00:02:00.110> there's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> key<00:02:01.469> there's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> um<00:02:02.130> uh<00:02:02.820> if

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
there's there's a key there's a um uh if

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240 
there's there's a key there's a um uh if
you<00:02:03.240> look<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> computer<00:02:04.110> keyboard<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.979> look

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you look at a computer keyboard and look

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.490 
you look at a computer keyboard and look
at<00:02:05.369> what's<00:02:05.579> above<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.149> number<00:02:06.509> four<00:02:06.810> you'll

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
at what's above the number four you'll

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619 
at what's above the number four you'll
know<00:02:07.710> exactly<00:02:07.860> what's<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.700> play<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:09.179> Louis<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
know exactly what's at play here Louis I

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.969 
know exactly what's at play here Louis I
think<00:02:09.840> people<00:02:09.989> will<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.349> able<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> figure<00:02:10.770> that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
think people will be able to figure that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.730 
think people will be able to figure that
one<00:02:11.039> out<00:02:11.160> pretty<00:02:11.430> quickly
