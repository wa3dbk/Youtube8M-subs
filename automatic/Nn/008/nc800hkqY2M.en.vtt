okay<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.690> ever<00:00:06.810> wonder<00:00:07.140> what<00:00:07.259> VTech<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:09.230> VTech

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
okay you ever wonder what VTech is VTech

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.759 
okay you ever wonder what VTech is VTech
is<00:00:11.450> variable<00:00:12.450> valve<00:00:12.690> timing<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.559> it's<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
is variable valve timing and it's a

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.490 
is variable valve timing and it's a
mechanical<00:00:14.040> variable<00:00:14.759> valve<00:00:14.969> timing<00:00:15.109> it<00:00:16.109> uses

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
mechanical variable valve timing it uses

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.920 
mechanical variable valve timing it uses
this<00:00:16.650> solenoid<00:00:17.090> which<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.330> really<00:00:18.690> funny

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
this solenoid which is really funny

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.109 
this solenoid which is really funny
because<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.560> looks<00:00:19.770> an<00:00:20.279> awful<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
because it looks an awful lot like the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.640 
because it looks an awful lot like the
same<00:00:21.480> solenoids<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
same solenoids that are on the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.279 
same solenoids that are on the
transmission<00:00:23.720> funny<00:00:24.720> isn't<00:00:24.900> it

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.750 

behind<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.439> solenoid<00:00:28.769> there<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> oil

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
behind this solenoid there is oil

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.930 
behind this solenoid there is oil

pressure at a certain rpm with a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.450 
pressure at a certain rpm with a
computer<00:00:33.329> deems<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.050> there<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> sensor

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
computer deems it so there is a sensor

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.209 
computer deems it so there is a sensor
that<00:00:35.489> says<00:00:35.880> okay<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.630> time<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:36.930> VTech<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that says okay it's time for VTech this

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
that says okay it's time for VTech this
solenoid<00:00:38.579> activates<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.570> sends<00:00:39.930> oil

these<00:00:52.020> two<00:00:52.320> rocker<00:00:52.620> arms<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.629> you're

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
these two rocker arms so when you're

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.240 
these two rocker arms so when you're
just<00:00:54.960> driving<00:00:55.199> around<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
just driving around and you're not in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000 
just driving around and you're not in
VTech<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.469> working<00:00:58.890> with

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
VTech it's just going to be working with

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
VTech it's just going to be working with
these<00:00:59.190> two<00:00:59.430> rocker<00:00:59.670> arms<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.239> one's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
these two rocker arms and this one's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900 
these two rocker arms and this one's
pretty<00:01:00.539> much<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> stay<00:01:01.910> doing

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
pretty much just going to stay doing

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.450 
pretty much just going to stay doing
nothing<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.449> still<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> cam<00:01:04.439> lobe<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.339> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
nothing it's still on a cam lobe so it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.219 
nothing it's still on a cam lobe so it's
still<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> move<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.110> going

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
still going to move but it's not going

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
still going to move but it's not going
to<00:01:07.320> move<00:01:07.439> these<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.369> cam<00:01:08.610> lobe<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
to move these this cam lobe that the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.140 
to move these this cam lobe that the
VTEC<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> higher<00:01:10.170> lift<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.619> duration

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
VTEC is on is a higher lift in duration

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.030 
VTEC is on is a higher lift in duration
than<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.390> than<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> other<00:01:13.140> lobes<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
than these than the other lobes that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.410 
than these than the other lobes that
these<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.580> normally<00:01:14.970> we're<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.150> off

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
these are normally we're going off

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
these are normally we're going off
running<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.290> normally<00:01:16.680> these<00:01:17.430> rocker

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
running off of so normally these rocker

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.160 
running off of so normally these rocker
arms<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.500> down<00:01:20.960> based<00:01:21.960> on

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
arms are just going up and down based on

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
arms are just going up and down based on
those<00:01:22.409> cam<00:01:22.740> lobes<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.759> pressurized<00:01:24.299> oil

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
those cam lobes but when pressurized oil

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.020 
those cam lobes but when pressurized oil
goes<00:01:24.869> through<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.320> rocker<00:01:25.619> shaft<00:01:26.030> what

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
goes through this rocker shaft what

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.690 
goes through this rocker shaft what
happens<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:28.229> oil<00:01:28.560> pressure<00:01:28.860> goes<00:01:29.159> into<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
happens is is oil pressure goes into the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
happens is is oil pressure goes into the
center<00:01:30.030> rocker<00:01:30.360> arm<00:01:30.630> there's<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.900> small<00:01:31.170> hole

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
center rocker arm there's a small hole

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.600 
center rocker arm there's a small hole
in<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> goes<00:01:32.970> through<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> passage<00:01:34.400> up<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
in here and goes through a passage up to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.780 
in here and goes through a passage up to
this<00:01:35.729> end<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.740> inside<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.070> special

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
this end here and inside this special

this end here and inside this special
rocker<00:01:39.030> arm<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.570> two<00:01:39.750> metal<00:01:40.259> pegs<00:01:40.740> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
rocker arm there are two metal pegs that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.749 
rocker arm there are two metal pegs that
come<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.350> go<00:01:43.350> into<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.250> other<00:01:44.430> rocker

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
come out and go into the other rocker

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
come out and go into the other rocker
arms<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.509> words<00:01:45.780> these<00:01:46.649> outer

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
arms so in other words these outer

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310 
arms so in other words these outer
rocker<00:01:47.310> arms<00:01:47.670> becomes<00:01:48.030> locked<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> center

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
rocker arms becomes locked to the center

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.060 
rocker arms becomes locked to the center
rocker<00:01:49.560> arm<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:51.240> result<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.439> works<00:01:52.680> off<00:01:52.890> this

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
rocker arm as a result it works off this

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.569 
rocker arm as a result it works off this
other<00:01:53.869> low<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.250> higher

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
other low what you can see is a higher

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.480 
other low what you can see is a higher
lift<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> duration<00:01:57.680> there<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:59.009> activating

VTEC so that is at least as far as a
honda<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.640> concerned<00:02:03.030> how<00:02:03.630> VTEC<00:02:04.110> works<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
honda is concerned how VTEC works so

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
honda is concerned how VTEC works so
normally<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:05.880> working<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.479> VTEC
