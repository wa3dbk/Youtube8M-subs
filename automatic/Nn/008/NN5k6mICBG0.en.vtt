00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.930
 when the olives are picked they are brought 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.150
 in the mill to be turned into 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.820
 extra virgin olive oil in a very short time 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.519
 time usually after three to four hours 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.679
 from the collection they are downloaded here 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.420
 in and beans to be weighed then 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.199
 and identified with the name of 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.330
 owner 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.730
 this to avoid the risk that 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.380
 be confused with other matches and for 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.360
 to have therefore the certainty that of the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.780
 our olives will get exactly the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.780
 our oil 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.649
 alda cassoni spills olives one 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.570
 hopper from which a tape the doors 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.820
 towards the first processing step 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.379
 the chin madness operated by a 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.379
 seeker and an aspirator 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.460
 immediately after our olives come 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.990
 transported to the washing machine after the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.240
 stream of running water 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.490
 the lips before the france tour to you 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.220
 through the cochlea come the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 grinder 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.450
 that shatters them into one 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.010
 fluid and fragrant paste that comes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.430
 poured into steel tanks 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.190
 inox tooth ge dog very low 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.890
 temperature is mixed for about 40 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.030
 minutes 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.100
 the next phase is that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.740
 of the oil extraction that takes place 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.350
 in the cards a centrifuge that straight 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 specific weight difference separates to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.940
 our noble extra virgin and cold 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.150
 from the other components of pasta delle 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.150
 olives 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.229
 Finally, the last step is that the 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.520
 vertical centrifugal separator which has 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.369
 the task of cleaning up completely 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.470
 the oil from residues of pomace and water of 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.890
 vegetation throughout the process 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.550
 occurs cold without any additives e 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.010
 with very little water this came 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.420
 thanks to the most modern technologies 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.269
 used at the mill where we can 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.099
 take care of and follow the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.099
 production of our extra virgin olive oil
