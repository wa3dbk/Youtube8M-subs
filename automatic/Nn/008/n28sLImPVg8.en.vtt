00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.400
 if the terra 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.340
 she should need a solid one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 The foundation for this must be the fertile soil 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 dug and filled with crushed stone 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 Rainwater can be used quickly 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.260
 the gravel must be derived 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.430
 naturally be compacted properly 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.590
 best to rent a jogger 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.240
 on the sealed gravel comes 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.730
 a layer finely split to 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.880
 height compensation and a level of the floor 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.070
 distribute the gravel evenly and with 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.190
 a fairly latte evenly pull off 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.670
 best then about two iron high then 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.010
 it certainly just the finished terraces 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.750
 height is marked with a string as 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.760
 to take foundation for the camp woods 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.220
 The easiest way to climb a concrete 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.230
 Align the concrete stones horizontally 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.390
 and again the height control 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.399
 the cover sheets must all 50 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.850
 centimeters from a wood bearing 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.130
 become 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.470
 lay out the concrete blocks accordingly 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.079
 so that the stones all in a curse 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:10.040
 we take a very latte and lie 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.930
 always stay level 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.540
 deflected stockholders too 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.610
 Concrete stones lay out wood sony directly 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.380
 on the stone stand suitable distance 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.660
 Slides made of rubber or plastic 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.580
 separate stone and wood then that stands 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.920
 lager wood even in rain never in the water 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.510
 Terrace boards are often not that long 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.130
 how the terrace should be 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.170
 where two terraces boards 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.510
 We have to be placed one behind the other 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.090
 two camps will look out as otherwise 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.619
 we screw too close to the beach and around 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.740
 unscrew the terraces weather 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.090
 we need a whole while with it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.490
 during this time not the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.670
 Fix substructure in place 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.680
 we use the lumber with a roof lath 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.350
 Now comes an important step that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.860
 first board must be laid accurately 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.130
 become 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 Wood swells with increasing moisture 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.979
 and disappears while drying 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.900
 when we have extremely dry wood 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.530
 So we need one screw 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.000
 For a wider joint, use 6 mm 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.310
 if you screw very damp wood 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.369
 Take a closer fugue of four 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.590
 millimeters 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.510
 the score points for a 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.460
 Clean optics must be a screw with 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.530
 lowers your head before lowering 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.780
 Otherwise , the wood around the one 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.960
 Splitting or splitting the scene 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.710
 Keep wooden should also be with 35 mm before 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.710
 be bored 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:34.100
 and on it goes the sawing edges 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.960
 naturally sanded off with it 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.880
 no splinters remain 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.780
 and always pay attention to the joints 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.000
 then everything stays in parallel right now 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:54.170
 See again why the offense two 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:57.580
 Stock heat need supernatant stock 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.050
 Bring heat to length with a saw 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.580
 now the overlapping boards have to be 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.030
 brought to a uniform length 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.030
 become 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.970
 to do this with the guidelines 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.890
 fix 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.920
 then we have a nice plant 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:19.560
 rail for the saw our terrace 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.690
 should lead at ground level in the lawn 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.730
 therefore we unscrew a sheet metal 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.810
 stainless steel or aluminum to the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.239
 Stock heat so the terrace is ready 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.239
 Now we can lay the lawn
