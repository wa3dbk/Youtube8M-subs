00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
we can do it late or whatnot you know

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.530 
we can do it late or whatnot you know
it'd<00:04:40.650> be<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.860> lot<00:04:40.980> easier<00:04:41.040> but<00:04:41.610> if<00:04:42.270> not

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
it'd be a lot easier but if not

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.340 
it'd be a lot easier but if not
hopefully<00:04:43.020> maybe<00:04:44.390> maybe<00:04:45.390> Wednesday<00:04:45.720> maybe

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350
