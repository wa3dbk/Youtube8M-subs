map there we go so you can see exactly

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
map there we go so you can see exactly
where<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> map<00:00:53.399> how<00:00:53.579> close<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
where it is on the map how close it is

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.530 
where it is on the map how close it is
to<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.860> spawn<00:00:55.860> point

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.050 

go<00:01:00.540> ahead<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.810> pick<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:01.700> you<00:01:02.700> can<00:01:02.880> do<00:01:03.030> it

move on to patch number three now patch
number<00:01:12.479> three<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.850> right<00:01:14.850> behind<00:01:15.090> door<00:01:15.960> number

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
number three is right behind door number

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.120 
number three is right behind door number
or<00:01:17.760> whatever<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:18.960> exactly<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:20.010> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
exactly where it is on the map it is to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800 
exactly where it is on the map it is to
the<00:01:22.320> left<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.160> spawn<00:01:23.430> point<00:01:23.810> towards

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the left side of the spawn point towards

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.740 
the left side of the spawn point towards
the<00:01:24.930> middle<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> map<00:01:25.590> where<00:01:26.160> all<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.750> like

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750

bungalows and stuff are at so you have

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.170 
bungalows and stuff are at so you have
to<00:01:33.090> lockpick<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:35.100> should<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.759> right

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to lockpick this and it should be right

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.480 
to lockpick this and it should be right
on<00:01:36.210> top<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.899> this<00:01:37.050> transformer<00:01:37.800> thingy<00:01:38.039> just

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
on top of this transformer thingy just

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.820 
on top of this transformer thingy just
sitting<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:41.479> come<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:43.410> we<00:01:43.649> go

building go right on the side and it's
right<00:03:01.040> there<00:03:01.070> inside<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.760> grate<00:03:02.060> there<00:03:04.000> we

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
right there inside of the grate there we

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.050 
right there inside of the grate there we
go<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:05.270> that's<00:03:05.360> number<00:03:05.570> six<00:03:07.390> now<00:03:08.390> number<00:03:08.810> seven

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.070 

come<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:14.180> number<00:03:14.330> seven<00:03:15.910> there<00:03:16.910> we<00:03:17.030> go<00:03:17.209> now

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
come on number seven there we go now

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.140 
come on number seven there we go now
number<00:03:18.380> seven<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.830> actually<00:03:19.220> really<00:03:19.760> really

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
number seven is actually really really

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.390 
number seven is actually really really
close<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:20.780> right<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.770> middle<00:03:21.800> of<00:03:22.220> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
close it's right in the middle of the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.810 
close it's right in the middle of the
helipad<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:23.540> actually<00:03:24.200> probably<00:03:25.100> one<00:03:25.760> of

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
helipad it's actually probably one of

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.310 
helipad it's actually probably one of
the<00:03:26.000> hardest<00:03:26.390> ones<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.630> actually<00:03:26.989> get<00:03:27.170> to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
the hardest ones to actually get to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.380 
the hardest ones to actually get to
without<00:03:27.560> getting<00:03:27.800> caught<00:03:28.060> it's<00:03:29.060> right<00:03:29.209> here

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
without getting caught it's right here

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.550 
without getting caught it's right here
in<00:03:29.480> this<00:03:29.600> puddle<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:29.959> just<00:03:30.230> turn<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.530> your

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
in this puddle you just turn on your

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.560 
in this puddle you just turn on your
night<00:03:30.830> vision<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.520> it's<00:03:32.239> right<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
night vision and it's right in the

night vision and it's right in the
middle<00:03:32.600> next<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.500> don't<00:03:33.799> know<00:03:33.950> what

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
middle next to that I don't know what

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.340 
middle next to that I don't know what
the<00:03:34.280> hell<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.430> thing<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:35.870> guess<00:03:36.200> I

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the hell that thing is but I guess I

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.229 
the hell that thing is but I guess I
spin<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.250> camera<00:03:37.430> around<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:37.940> can<00:03:38.060> kind

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
spin the camera around so you can kind

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.170 
spin the camera around so you can kind
of<00:03:38.299> get<00:03:38.540> an<00:03:38.630> idea<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:38.989> where<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.200> hell<00:03:39.380> it's<00:03:39.530> at

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
of get an idea of where the hell it's at

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.850 
of get an idea of where the hell it's at

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.869 
two guards over there snuggling pick up
that<00:03:42.950> patch<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.310> that's<00:03:43.430> patch<00:03:43.700> number<00:03:43.940> seven

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
patch number eight is actually right up

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.770 
patch number eight is actually right up
here<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.790> got<00:03:52.909> to<00:03:53.000> do<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> little<00:03:53.299> bit<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.540> a

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
here you got to do a little bit of a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.809 
here you got to do a little bit of a
parkour<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.680> get<00:03:54.830> up<00:03:54.950> there<00:03:55.129> you're<00:03:55.670> gonna

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
parkour to get up there you're gonna

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.649 
parkour to get up there you're gonna
want<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.030> hop<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.360> top<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.599> this

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
want to hop on top of this

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.660 
want to hop on top of this
air-conditioned<00:03:57.319> thing<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:58.129> think<00:03:58.519> that's

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
air-conditioned thing I think that's

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.880 
air-conditioned thing I think that's
what<00:03:58.879> it<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.000> here<00:03:59.659> it<00:03:59.750> is<00:03:59.780> on<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.170> map<00:04:00.379> it's

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
what it is here it is on the map it's

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.410 
what it is here it is on the map it's
