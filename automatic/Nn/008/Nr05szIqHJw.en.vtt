00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
so this is my class vector k10 obviously

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.510 
so this is my class vector k10 obviously
we've<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.390> gold<00:00:33.750> oops<00:00:34.620> yep<00:00:35.070> prestige

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
use fast mag obviously said so many

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.780 
use fast mag obviously said so many
times<00:00:40.680> before<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.070> can't<00:00:41.399> live<00:00:41.550> without

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
times before I can't live without

times before I can't live without
reloaded<00:00:42.390> faster<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.890> I've<00:00:44.340> I've

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
reloaded faster and this one I've I've

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
reloaded faster and this one I've I've
come<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> decision<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.930> laser<00:00:46.410> sight

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

isn't<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.100> helpful<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.149> I've<00:00:48.480> got

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
isn't actually that helpful so I've got

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.880 
isn't actually that helpful so I've got
ahead<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.930> used<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> foregrip<00:00:49.649> from<00:00:49.800> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
ahead and used the foregrip from this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.200 
ahead and used the foregrip from this
gun<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> know<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> tiny<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:51.059> more

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
gun because you know is a tiny bit more

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.959 
gun because you know is a tiny bit more
recoil<00:00:51.570> recoil<00:00:52.379> than<00:00:52.469> most<00:00:53.399> guns<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
recoil recoil than most guns the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.220 
recoil recoil than most guns the
foregrip<00:00:54.329> doesn't<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:54.780> help<00:00:54.960> too<00:00:55.199> much

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
foregrip doesn't really help too much

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.130 
foregrip doesn't really help too much
but<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.070> figured<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.960> well<00:00:58.109> I

long in this game I think if your tattoo
message<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.189> literally<00:01:41.610> prevents<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
message that literally prevents and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.270 
message that literally prevents and
completely<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> you've<00:01:43.920> gotta<00:01:44.130> rent

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
completely so you know you've gotta rent

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.740 
completely so you know you've gotta rent
optical<00:01:44.610> mouse<00:01:44.759> think<00:01:45.090> renewed<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
optical mouse think renewed and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440 
optical mouse think renewed and
concussion<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> no<00:01:46.920> pistol<00:01:47.430> normally<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
concussion and no pistol normally I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
concussion and no pistol normally I
would<00:01:48.630> use<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.290> flash<00:01:49.799> bangs<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.220> don't<00:01:50.369> game

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
would use a flash bangs but don't game

would use a flash bangs but don't game
yeah<00:01:50.759> my<00:01:51.210> conclusions<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.840> seem<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.079> work

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
yeah my conclusions don't seem to work

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.410 
yeah my conclusions don't seem to work
but<00:01:52.560> other<00:01:53.250> than<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.610> see<00:01:53.850> black<00:01:54.240> hats

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that might make video by that soon we'll

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
that might make video by that soon we'll
get<00:01:57.990> into<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.229> private<00:01:58.680> match<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.159> show<00:01:59.369> you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
get into a private match and show you

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030 
get into a private match and show you
what<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.670> looks<00:01:59.700> like<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:01.200> got<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.500> set<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.799> we

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
what it looks like we got one set up we

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.300 
what it looks like we got one set up we
don't<00:02:02.310> let's<00:02:02.820> put<00:02:02.939> me<00:02:03.030> set<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:04.310> vector<00:02:07.310> all

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
don't let's put me set one up vector all

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.270 
don't let's put me set one up vector all
right<00:02:08.539> let's<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.899> exchange<00:02:10.410> map<00:02:10.950> 2

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
right let's get in exchange map 2

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.130 
right let's get in exchange map 2
nuketown<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:13.110> very

and Scott and things got thirty six
bullets<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.260> magazine<00:02:31.290> which<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.069> which

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
bullets in the magazine which is which

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.250 
bullets in the magazine which is which
is<00:02:32.519> quite<00:02:32.700> good<00:02:32.910> for<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.090> submachine<00:02:33.540> gun<00:02:33.690> one

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
is quite good for a submachine gun one

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.509 
is quite good for a submachine gun one
of<00:02:34.379> them<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.860> actually<00:02:35.099> one<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> worst

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
of them it's actually one of the worst

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.890 
of them it's actually one of the worst
in<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.819> game<00:02:36.030> did<00:02:36.180> Amelia<00:02:36.569> most<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
in this game did Amelia most of the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.830 
in this game did Amelia most of the
games<00:02:37.080> probably<00:02:37.260> have<00:02:37.560> been<00:02:37.650> one<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> best

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
games probably have been one of the best

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.119 
games probably have been one of the best
so<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.019> what<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.290> looks<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.920> whole

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
so this is what it looks like the whole

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.410 
so this is what it looks like the whole
thing<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.400> gold<00:02:41.670> pretty<00:02:41.879> much<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> set<00:02:42.209> from<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
thing is gold pretty much a set from the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.960 
thing is gold pretty much a set from the
side<00:02:42.660> plate<00:02:42.989> when<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.099> aim<00:02:44.220> down<00:02:44.370> sight<00:02:44.640> all
