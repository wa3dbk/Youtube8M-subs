the<00:00:28.449> colder<00:00:28.810> it<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.109> the<00:00:29.170> more<00:00:30.039> likely<00:00:30.490> there

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
the colder it is the more likely there

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.890 
the colder it is the more likely there
is<00:00:31.119> for<00:00:31.689> ice<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:33.190> form<00:00:33.460> in<00:00:33.699> the<00:00:33.730> cloud<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.690> make

how<00:02:16.520> can<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:16.940> well<00:02:17.900> they<00:02:18.050> have<00:02:18.200> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
how can this be well they have a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.680 
how can this be well they have a
specific<00:02:18.890> protein<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.670> their<00:02:19.970> surface<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
specific protein on their surface and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.990 
specific protein on their surface and
they<00:02:20.959> make<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.320> when<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:21.650> cold<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.790> looks

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
they make it when it's cold and it looks

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.960 
they make it when it's cold and it looks
a<00:02:23.120> little<00:02:23.300> bit<00:02:23.540> like<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.730> water

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
a little bit like this and the water

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.870 
a little bit like this and the water
molecules<00:02:26.690> line<00:02:27.080> up<00:02:27.290> perfectly<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:28.340> they<00:02:28.730> are

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
molecules line up perfectly if they are

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.860 
molecules line up perfectly if they are
ice<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.350> protein<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.090> they<00:02:32.630> cause

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
ice with this protein and so they cause

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.460 
ice with this protein and so they cause
ice<00:02:33.140> formation

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.890 

it's<00:02:38.470> kind<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.890> hard<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.160> tell<00:02:39.400> what<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.390> does<00:02:40.600> I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it's kind of hard to tell what it does I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.550 
it's kind of hard to tell what it does I
think<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.710> works<00:02:43.080> there's<00:02:44.080> hard<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.380> have<00:02:44.530> a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
think it works there's hard to have a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.330 
think it works there's hard to have a
good<00:02:44.770> experiment<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.440> pseudomonas

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
good experiment so this is pseudomonas

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.430 
good experiment so this is pseudomonas

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.230 
syringae from highlight lake it's

growing on a media with all the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
nutrients it needs to grow put that in

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.030 
nutrients it needs to grow put that in
the<00:03:01.720> freezer<00:03:02.080> or<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.920> refrigerator<00:03:03.450> Adam

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the freezer or the refrigerator Adam

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.170 
the freezer or the refrigerator Adam
temperature<00:03:06.040> it's<00:03:06.190> think<00:03:06.670> four<00:03:06.940> degrees

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
temperature it's think four degrees

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.810 
temperature it's think four degrees
Celsius<00:03:07.690> or<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.050> just<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> get<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> bacteria

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
Celsius or so just to get the bacteria

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.760 
Celsius or so just to get the bacteria
to<00:03:09.940> express<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.660> ice<00:03:10.720> nucleation<00:03:11.140> proteins

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
to express the ice nucleation proteins

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.040 
to express the ice nucleation proteins
and<00:03:12.040> from<00:03:12.610> there<00:03:12.820> once<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.630> proteins<00:03:13.960> are

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
and from there once the proteins are
