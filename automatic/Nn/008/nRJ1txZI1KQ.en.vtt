00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello everyone today I want to show you a 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 very easy and homemade trick to avoid the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.780
 mode of the oldest books more 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.330
 old that we have at home you know 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.239
 that there are books whose covers and good 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.829
 on the outside they are highly aesthetic and 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:25.259
 they look great on a shelf but 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.599
 what happens when they get old and when they 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.930
 deteriorate the pages that were created as 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.540
 a kind of smell old old and in 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.480
 Sometimes a little mao as we are 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.460
 seeing in the parts especially in the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 corners of some central pages 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.520
 of the book as you see we have put a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.290
 little bit of talcum powder on the pages 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 because powder talcum because 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.740
 they have properties that make it 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.760
 eliminate mold and also the bad smell and 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.340
 that the books last us longer 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.650
 in good condition as you see we have 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.270
 sprinkled in the central area of ​​the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.270
 page a few drops of talcum powder 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 let's do the same in more or less 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 It depends on how big the book is 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.810
 but we will do it in different areas because 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.020
 If the book has about 300 pages, 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.229
 to do it five times spread over the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.110
 pages of the book we are going to close it and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.630
 let's let it rest so 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.790
 hours is worth two or three hours 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 then we will remove the dust from 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.890
 talcum that does not stain and is also 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.750
 practically painless and the result 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.119
 it will be quite remarkable this we can 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.720
 do it with all the books we see 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.060
 that are about to be invaded by 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.890
