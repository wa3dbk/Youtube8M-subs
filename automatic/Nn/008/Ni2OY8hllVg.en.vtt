00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 how do you know which city to increase as 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.080
 every day in this new be more beautiful 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.639
 is he and I are on a special day 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.780
 because we started a new series that 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.849
 I believe that it will last as two 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 maximum elements in which I will 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.619
 explain how they will get more elite will 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 they spend warfare and flying normal weapons 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699
 fig trees of the game or of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.140
 lower categories as a professional or 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.119
 cadet that are much easier than you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.300
 touch no and well we start with the vall 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.470
 27 we're going to match the ops and steve and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.060
 good here I leave the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.040
 characteristics of the two pallets of the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 usina in steve and the normal and good 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.250
 tell you that the first one before anything that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.820
 let's do it with the normal and with the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.500
 carbon 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.510
 if you have the 27 coal that is a mold 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.460
 of a cadet model well enough 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.290
 better because because it's going to stay 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.239
 quite our soul not like first 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.340
 we go with the normal good so here you see 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.980
 in that almost so special to this option 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.320
 strict that he gains two damage and loses 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.559
 a tiny dot of cadence precision and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.539
 driving and earn one of mobility for this 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.270
 it translates into that short distances and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.250
 half-distances were bushes of three 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.920
 bullets that is a real barbarity and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.659
 also the lack is not so bad and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.659
 far in four they live alone 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.220
 of this game and well then let's 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.110
 try to equal first and tactical with 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.930
 the normal value and then nothing goes there 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.910
 come here we have the class with the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.010
 hand and then well here you see the vall 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.140
 normal we put the base to say that 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.610
 what the game gives you and well it is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.290
 with we remember to wash instincts 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.690
 ivÃ¡n stipulates that I can let 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.190
 cattle of mobility damage 1 and already 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.770
 you know he loses that precision 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.210
 cadence and good handling with the damage 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.800
 let's start with more important with 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.200
 the damage can not be done at all or it is not 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.550
 There is no accessory that allows you 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.110
 increase the damage then on the coal itself 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.330
 that we can do it with the damage that already 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.340
 we will see it we tested with the good standard 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.290
 well here to gain mobility you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.210
 we had to put the butt and we had 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.450
 plus one more point of mobility than what 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.070
 follow steve is worth the cia that is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.530
 chalk when losing a decadence as you see 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
 here is going to less has no more 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.280
 precision because to have cadence pulls 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.160
 less bullets and the weapon has less than 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.200
 tropero then was the normal one goes 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.729
 very much by far it is very much because 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.080
 because to say that they have the same 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.450
 belief so I think it is 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.250
 indispensable to put a hilt 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.620
 this would also have three dots 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.060
 more accurately than steve and 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.220
 stop now 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.690
 to put something that does not over here 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.430
 so that we never run out of ammunition 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.530
 it is better that we put chargers 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.099
 great because that way we will not stay 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.810
 without ammunition with the vall and then you can 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.810
 shoot if you find two guys or 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.940
 more there then forever to load and good 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.620
 it is normal that we can not match 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.440
 those two points of damage but yes that with 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.540
 the cadence is therefore counteracted a little 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.980
 no then it's not like they did spinner 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.780
 as the chair in this error 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.000
 it is true that they were with this advisors 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.130
 with says very well and let's try with 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.680
 the coal of the consell good so here 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.319
 you see the characteristics of the vall 27 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.390
 carbon that adds a point of damage and 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.519
 Take a little bit of precision worth this 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.580
 weapon is very good because when adding that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.950
 speck of damage kills three bullets 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.660
 short distances then half yes 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.489
 it's true that it depends on how you bite them 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.410
 but it can be three to four bullets 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.120
 but the good thing about this weapon is that 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.760
 long distance we will always be 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.030
 from 4 to 2 is not like the normal 27 that 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.840
 you have to kill 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.819
 of 5 not so come as you see 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.380
 here wash 27 coal to earn that little dot 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.030
 of damage is like what I told you before 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.209
 we can do something with the year we already have 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.709
 the one that gives us that is the echo so 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.600
 we go with the transitions 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.550
 well you know here you see it then 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.950
 we have to put more or less 2 - 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.140
 accessories that before we would put the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.660
 silver to gain mobility you 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.080
 we would put the hilt because it was 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.209
 to the far away yes it is true that it goes and 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.010
 Even though he kills me from four sentry boxes, 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.239
 we put the handle so that it does not 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.700
 they are going to look at us to take for ass 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.800
 and we also put two chargers 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.709
 great and little this would be an endorsement 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.810
 27 very very good that is almost almost almost 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.300
 same as the one or follow that steve also with 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.580
 very good features because it 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.100
 they gain everything except the damage 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.260
 they win everything was at least in the damage and 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.819
 in the damage there will come a small dot that 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.350
 note only half distances because to 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.989
 long kills four bullets like the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.250
 chair in steve and nearby kills from 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.320
 three bullets with speed in style 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.680
 I wake up that half stays kills 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.600
 one more bullet 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.730
 later I think we were very 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.980
 well it 's almost the same as it did dress and 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.990
 well, nothing more, I hope that you 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.880
 have liked this when they did steve 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.220
 da laxe is adjusted subscribed if not 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.220
 you are and we will see you the next goodbye
