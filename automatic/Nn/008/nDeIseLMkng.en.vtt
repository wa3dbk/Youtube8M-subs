realize<00:00:31.740> there's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> huge<00:00:32.340> problem<00:00:32.759> with

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
realize there's a huge problem with

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.270 
realize there's a huge problem with
organic<00:00:33.270> waste<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:33.840> its<00:00:34.050> massive<00:00:34.980> amount

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
organic waste because its massive amount

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.510 
organic waste because its massive amount
of<00:00:35.370> food<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:37.410> fills<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> plan<00:00:38.040> pills<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
of food and it fills the plan pills and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
of food and it fills the plan pills and
why<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:40.520> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.760> our<00:00:41.969> bucket<00:00:42.360> system<00:00:42.570> we

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
why do that this is our bucket system we

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.529 
why do that this is our bucket system we
have<00:00:43.520> buckets<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> restaurants<00:00:45.360> and

have buckets at the restaurants and
Jeremih<00:00:46.320> takes<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> empty<00:00:47.820> buckets<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
Jeremih takes the empty buckets and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.720 
Jeremih takes the empty buckets and
takes<00:00:49.230> them<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.920> restaurants<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.520> picks

takes them to the restaurants and picks

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.080 
takes them to the restaurants and picks
up<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.090> buckets<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:52.079> full<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> city<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
up the buckets that are full the city of

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.700 
up the buckets that are full the city of
Eugene<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.600> lot<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> their<00:00:54.989> approaches<00:00:55.320> are

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
Eugene a lot of their approaches are

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189 
Eugene a lot of their approaches are
macro<00:00:56.460> approaches<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:57.960> we

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
macro approaches so it's kind of like we

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
macro approaches so it's kind of like we
got<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> big<00:00:58.649> trucks<00:00:58.949> take<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> huge

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
got a big trucks take it to a huge

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
got a big trucks take it to a huge
composting<00:01:00.359> facility<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.079> town<00:01:01.370> what's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
composting facility out of town what's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.490 
composting facility out of town what's
unique<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
unique about this is that the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
unique about this is that the
restaurants<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.189> very<00:01:05.309> local<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> it's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
restaurants that are very local so it's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.510 
restaurants that are very local so it's
a<00:01:06.299> decentralized<00:01:07.020> approach<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.680> taking<00:01:08.280> care

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
a decentralized approach to taking care

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820 
a decentralized approach to taking care
of<00:01:08.580> organic<00:01:09.450> waste<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.229> normally<00:01:10.650> put

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of organic waste which is normally put

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
of organic waste which is normally put
in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> landfill<00:01:11.510> we<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.750> left<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> farm

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
in the landfill we just left the farm

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440 
in the landfill we just left the farm
and<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:13.710> writing<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.220> campaign<00:01:14.729> typically

it's like inevitable pretty much so the
next<00:04:04.510> stop<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.379> into<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.069> bin<00:04:06.870> for<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.959> next

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
next stop is into the bin for the next

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.339 
next stop is into the bin for the next
three<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:10.120> five<00:04:10.450> weeks<00:04:10.510> probably<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:14.230> i'm

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
three to five weeks probably and i'm

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.460 
three to five weeks probably and i'm
trying<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.739> persuade<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.549> city<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:17.019> get

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
trying to persuade the city to get

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.159 
trying to persuade the city to get
involved<00:04:17.949> in<00:04:18.039> this<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.789> deeper<00:04:19.150> way<00:04:19.180> it's

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
involved in this in a deeper way it's

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.900 
involved in this in a deeper way it's
kind<00:04:20.349> of<00:04:20.470> tricky<00:04:20.709> because<00:04:21.010> it's<00:04:21.669> such<00:04:21.880> a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
kind of tricky because it's such a

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.719 
kind of tricky because it's such a
decentralized<00:04:22.690> small<00:04:23.020> scale<00:04:23.680> system<00:04:24.250> and

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
decentralized small scale system and

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.689 
decentralized small scale system and
they<00:04:25.389> usually<00:04:25.599> think<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:26.050> lot<00:04:26.229> bigger<00:04:26.500> but<00:04:27.099> the

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
they usually think a lot bigger but the

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.189 
they usually think a lot bigger but the
hope<00:04:27.940> would<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.570> other<00:04:28.720> community

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
hope would be that the other community

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.379 
hope would be that the other community
gardens<00:04:29.590> could<00:04:29.889> also<00:04:30.340> do<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.729> same<00:04:30.940> thing<00:04:31.180> so

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
gardens could also do the same thing so

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.460 
gardens could also do the same thing so
if<00:04:31.449> there<00:04:31.599> are<00:04:31.659> five<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> community

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
if there are five of the community

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.570 
if there are five of the community
gardens<00:04:32.860> they<00:04:32.949> could<00:04:33.070> connect<00:04:33.370> with<00:04:33.430> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
gardens they could connect with the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.250 
gardens they could connect with the
restaurants<00:04:34.090> in<00:04:34.210> their<00:04:34.449> their<00:04:34.810> neighborhood

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
restaurants in their their neighborhood

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.589 
restaurants in their their neighborhood
and<00:04:35.470> be<00:04:36.220> picking<00:04:36.699> up<00:04:36.789> from<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.120> restaurants

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
and be picking up from the restaurants

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.850 
and be picking up from the restaurants
right<00:04:37.659> where<00:04:37.870> they<00:04:37.990> are<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.349> using<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.770> in

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
right where they are and using it in

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.890 
right where they are and using it in
their<00:04:38.889> community<00:04:39.490> gardens<00:04:39.880> keep<00:04:40.449> it<00:04:40.659> from

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
their community gardens keep it from

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.020 
their community gardens keep it from
stinking<00:04:41.409> next<00:04:41.740> week<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.190> much<00:04:42.400> let<00:04:42.820> me<00:04:42.909> keep
