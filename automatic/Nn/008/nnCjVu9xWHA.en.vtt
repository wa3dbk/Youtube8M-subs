the NHL you played in Buffalo as well

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.979 
the NHL you played in Buffalo as well
where<00:00:43.379> he's<00:00:43.559> playing<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:44.100> did<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> ever<00:00:45.000> for

sure<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.260> met<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> ice<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.160> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
sure you met on the ice what do you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.920 
sure you met on the ice what do you
think<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:47.610> him<00:00:47.850> he's<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> great<00:00:48.600> player

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
think about him he's a great player

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.889 
think about him he's a great player
great<00:00:49.399> defender<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.640> very<00:00:51.149> offensive<00:00:51.510> with

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
great defender and very offensive with

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
great defender and very offensive with
with<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> big<00:00:52.739> shot<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.760> he<00:00:53.850> already<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
with a big shot I think he already has a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.720 
with a big shot I think he already has a
few<00:00:54.629> goals<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> DLLs<00:00:55.890> since<00:00:56.160> he<00:00:56.309> came<00:00:56.460> back

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
few goals in the DLLs since he came back

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.729 
few goals in the DLLs since he came back
so<00:00:56.760> he's<00:00:57.149> definitely<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.600> player<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.440> we'll

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so he's definitely a player that we'll

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.580 
so he's definitely a player that we'll
have<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> watch<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.789> for

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
have to watch out for

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.039 
have to watch out for

the<00:01:04.199> best<00:01:04.350> defender<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.850> Buffalo<00:01:06.150> Sabres

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
the best defender on the Buffalo Sabres

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.050 
the best defender on the Buffalo Sabres
I'm<00:01:07.500> sure<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.280> appreciate<00:01:08.760> him<00:01:08.880> there

I'm sure they they appreciate him there
it's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> great<00:01:09.810> city<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.860> hockey<00:01:11.150> will<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it's a great city for for hockey will it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.230 
it's a great city for for hockey will it
be<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.740> difficult<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.760> into

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
be a bit difficult to get back now into

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
be a bit difficult to get back now into
the<00:01:15.479> game<00:01:15.630> after<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.140> break<00:01:16.619> no<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> don't

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the game after that break no I don't

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.460 
the game after that break no I don't
think<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> little

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
think so I think when you have a little

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.840 
think so I think when you have a little
break<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.159> good<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> good<00:01:20.670> for

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
break like that it's good it's good for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.890 
break like that it's good it's good for
the<00:01:20.909> mine

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the mine

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.350 
the mine
everybody<00:01:22.710> has<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.369> chance<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.790> reenergize

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
everybody has the chance to reenergize
