00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:31.960
 Auchan Rochant to 30 euros I challenged 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.840
 in a carton is good for storage 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:41.530
 it seemed to me a sakho bag in chips 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.270
 Montreux and there is the thing is 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.010
 why not to make the loops a 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.010
 game for you go 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:11.030

 there are the hole here to return output 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:02:00.030
 like that and it'll look like that like 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:04.119
 that instead the plate I show you 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.950
 like that or otherwise 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.890
 I am like that there are two buttons 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.599
 chic you remove the plate on one side 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.290
 plates and next to make some 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.470

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.660
 dgo it's called left plate 30 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.310
 and there a normal plate well flatten the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:27.019
 things we are looking for that would be like that 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.790

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.620
