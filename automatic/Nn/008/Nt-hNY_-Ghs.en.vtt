00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
battlefield 3 so I was going to start

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.799

out<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> campaign<00:00:54.120> because<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.510> figured

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
out in the campaign because I figured

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
out in the campaign because I figured
that<00:00:54.930> it'd<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> good<00:00:55.260> place<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.649> start<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that it'd be a good place to start it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.830 
that it'd be a good place to start it
always<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.090> seems<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> good<00:00:57.600> place<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
always just seems like the good place to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.209 
always just seems like the good place to
start<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> single-player<00:00:58.739> mode<00:00:59.070> just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
of Suffolk that makes sense but it was a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
of Suffolk that makes sense but it was a
good<00:01:44.130> place<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.460> start<00:01:44.640> co-op<00:01:44.970> even<00:01:45.119> though<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
good place to start co-op even though I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.730 
good place to start co-op even though I
had<00:01:45.600> initially<00:01:45.990> wanted<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.470> start<00:01:46.649> with

had initially wanted to start with
campaign<00:01:47.159> co-op<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.030> did<00:01:48.210> enjoy<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> play<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
campaign co-op I did enjoy the play a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
campaign co-op I did enjoy the play a
lot<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.710> also<00:01:50.399> worth<00:01:50.700> mentioning<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
lot it's also worth mentioning with the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
lot it's also worth mentioning with the
co-op<00:01:51.720> stuff<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.290> normally<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.520> there's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
co-op stuff that normally if if there's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760 
co-op stuff that normally if if there's
co-op<00:01:54.270> advertised<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> game<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
co-op advertised in a game I like to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
co-op advertised in a game I like to
assume<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> its<00:01:56.460> campaign<00:01:56.909> co-op<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:58.140> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
assume that its campaign co-op so when I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.569 
assume that its campaign co-op so when I
found<00:01:58.380> out<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> wasn't<00:01:58.950> quite<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
found out that it wasn't quite the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.630 
found out that it wasn't quite the
campaign<00:02:00.000> co-op<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.420> was<00:02:01.159> initially<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.399> little

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
campaign co-op I was initially a little

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.249 
campaign co-op I was initially a little
disappointed<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.689> don't<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
disappointed but I don't think the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.929 
disappointed but I don't think the
campaign<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.950> wouldn't<00:02:05.460> work<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
campaign it just wouldn't work as a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.600 
campaign it just wouldn't work as a
totally<00:02:06.600> co-op<00:02:06.930> thing<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:08.129> nice<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.520> have

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
totally co-op thing so it's nice to have

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.130 
totally co-op thing so it's nice to have
the<00:02:08.759> co-op<00:02:08.970> missions<00:02:09.300> available<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> side

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the co-op missions available at the side

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.550 
the co-op missions available at the side
to<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> campaign<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.129> def

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
to the campaign so that's def

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
and I did enjoy it the way that story's

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.000 
and I did enjoy it the way that story's
kind<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.959> being<00:02:20.140> held<00:02:20.290> at<00:02:20.410> this<00:02:20.530> point<00:02:20.830> I'm<00:02:20.980> not

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
kind of being held at this point I'm not

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.380 
kind of being held at this point I'm not
sure<00:02:21.220> if<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.370> changes<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.790> future<00:02:22.150> because

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
sure if it changes in future because

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.350 
sure if it changes in future because
I've<00:02:22.510> only<00:02:22.599> done<00:02:22.830> maybe<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.220> few<00:02:24.910> hours<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
I've only done maybe a few hours of the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.059 
I've only done maybe a few hours of the
campaign<00:02:25.720> maybe<00:02:26.080> less<00:02:26.410> than<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.650> i'm<00:02:26.890> not

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
campaign maybe less than that i'm not

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.940 
campaign maybe less than that i'm not
i'm<00:02:27.459> not<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.209> far<00:02:28.510> into<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.810> but<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.739> way<00:02:29.830> that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
i'm not so far into it but the way that

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.470 
i'm not so far into it but the way that
it's<00:02:30.099> played<00:02:30.280> out<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.610> far<00:02:30.849> is<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.300> kind

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
it's played out so far is that it's kind

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.449 
it's played out so far is that it's kind
of<00:02:31.540> played<00:02:31.720> through<00:02:31.959> flashbacks<00:02:32.230> which<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
of played through flashbacks which is a

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.770 
of played through flashbacks which is a
nice<00:02:33.640> touch<00:02:33.910> because<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.390> means<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
nice touch because it means that you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.699 
nice touch because it means that you
don't<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.080> play<00:02:35.290> through<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.680> entire

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
don't have to play through the entire

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.030 
don't have to play through the entire
thing<00:02:36.750> completely<00:02:37.750> chronologically<00:02:38.739> if<00:02:38.890> that

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
thing completely chronologically if that

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.740 
thing completely chronologically if that
makes<00:02:39.220> probably<00:02:40.150> not<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.360> word<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.540> i'm

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
makes probably not the word that i'm

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.870 
makes probably not the word that i'm
after<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.590> means<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:42.700> jump

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
after but it means that you can jump

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.490 
after but it means that you can jump
around<00:02:43.030> from<00:02:43.239> different<00:02:43.900> periods<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:44.290> time

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
around from different periods of time

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.900 
around from different periods of time
and<00:02:44.739> play<00:02:44.920> as<00:02:44.980> different<00:02:45.370> characters<00:02:45.400> as<00:02:45.880> well

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
and play as different characters as well

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.699 
and play as different characters as well
which<00:02:46.120> i<00:02:46.209> really<00:02:46.450> enjoyed<00:02:46.780> one<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
which i really enjoyed one of the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.470 
which i really enjoyed one of the
favorite<00:02:48.130> machines<00:02:48.400> i've<00:02:48.519> played<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:48.940> far<00:02:49.000> was

favorite machines i've played so far was

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
for a bit before this video because i

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.520

towards<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.240> adds<00:04:22.389> a<00:04:22.479> new<00:04:22.629> player<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:22.870> not

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
towards it adds a new player and not

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.379 
towards it adds a new player and not
feel<00:04:23.319> completely<00:04:23.740> overwhelmed<00:04:23.860> by<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:25.120> point

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
feel completely overwhelmed by the point

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.179 
feel completely overwhelmed by the point
system<00:04:25.599> and<00:04:25.870> upgrades<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.289> everything<00:04:26.620> like

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:27.189 
system and upgrades and everything like

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:28.769 
system and upgrades and everything like
I<00:04:27.310> mentioned<00:04:27.370> before<00:04:27.699> the<00:04:28.180> game<00:04:28.389> can<00:04:28.629> get

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:28.779 
I mentioned before the game can get

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.089 
I mentioned before the game can get
really<00:04:28.930> immersive<00:04:29.469> at<00:04:29.560> some<00:04:29.770> points

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
really immersive at some points

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.159 
really immersive at some points
especially<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.210> campaign<00:04:31.599> and<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.900> got<00:04:32.080> it

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
especially in the campaign and I got it

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.290 
especially in the campaign and I got it
during<00:04:32.379> co-op<00:04:32.680> as<00:04:32.830> well<00:04:33.039> but<00:04:33.279> the<00:04:33.879> campaign

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
during co-op as well but the campaign

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.059 
during co-op as well but the campaign
particularly<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.289> think<00:04:35.499> one<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.860> big

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
particularly and I think one of the big

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.459 
particularly and I think one of the big
things<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.879> that<00:04:36.969> is<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.330> sound<00:04:37.569> there's<00:04:38.379> a

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469 
things so that is the sound there's a

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.159 
things so that is the sound there's a
lot<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:40.270> not<00:04:40.419> sound<00:04:40.900> it's<00:04:41.050> the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
lot of it's not sound it's the

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.019 
lot of it's not sound it's the
interaction<00:04:41.499> with<00:04:41.830> like<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.159> npcs<00:04:42.699> as<00:04:42.849> well

because I am really enjoying their

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.450 
because I am really enjoying their
company<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:10.900> that's<00:05:11.110> one<00:05:12.099> of<00:05:12.129> the<00:05:12.250> big<00:05:12.430> things

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
company so that's one of the big things

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.459 
company so that's one of the big things
I<00:05:12.789> think<00:05:13.029> it's<00:05:13.150> really<00:05:13.389> nice<00:05:13.659> to<00:05:13.719> have<00:05:14.020> that

I think it's really nice to have that

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.100 
I think it's really nice to have that
kind<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:15.360> companionship<00:05:16.360> even<00:05:16.870> in<00:05:16.990> the

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
kind of companionship even in the

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.869 
kind of companionship even in the
single-player<00:05:17.680> campaign<00:05:18.189> it's<00:05:18.400> kind<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:18.669> nice

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
single-player campaign it's kind of nice

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.269 
single-player campaign it's kind of nice
to<00:05:19.169> not<00:05:20.169> feel<00:05:20.379> isolated<00:05:20.589> when<00:05:21.099> you<00:05:21.189> are

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
to not feel isolated when you are

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.129 
to not feel isolated when you are
playing<00:05:21.460> single<00:05:21.909> player<00:05:21.939> if<00:05:22.330> that<00:05:22.960> makes

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
playing single player if that makes

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.350 
playing single player if that makes
sense<00:05:23.460> like<00:05:24.460> I<00:05:24.580> said<00:05:24.639> before<00:05:24.909> I'm<00:05:25.330> not

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
sense like I said before I'm not

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.869 
sense like I said before I'm not
completely<00:05:25.930> so<00:05:26.620> far<00:05:26.889> into<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.189> campaign<00:05:27.580> but

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
completely so far into the campaign but

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.579 
completely so far into the campaign but
I<00:05:27.909> do<00:05:28.000> my<00:05:28.270> housemate<00:05:28.629> who's<00:05:28.779> played<00:05:28.990> he<00:05:29.439> has

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:29.589 
I do my housemate who's played he has

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:30.990 
I do my housemate who's played he has
finished<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.949> campaign<00:05:30.099> and<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.610> think<00:05:30.819> most

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
finished the campaign and I think most

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.999 
finished the campaign and I think most
of<00:05:31.089> the<00:05:31.240> co-op<00:05:31.449> missions<00:05:31.719> as<00:05:31.839> well<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.229> he

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
of the co-op missions as well and he

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.890 
of the co-op missions as well and he
said<00:05:33.159> it's<00:05:33.310> not<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.729> spectacular<00:05:34.599> long

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
said it's not a spectacular long

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.019 
said it's not a spectacular long
campaign<00:05:35.409> but<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.460> does<00:05:36.580> give<00:05:36.729> you<00:05:36.819> a<00:05:36.849> good

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
campaign but it does give you a good

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.639 
campaign but it does give you a good
feel<00:05:37.240> for<00:05:37.360> battlefield<00:05:37.779> you<00:05:37.990> get<00:05:38.139> to<00:05:38.289> play

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:38.649 
feel for battlefield you get to play

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:40.649 
feel for battlefield you get to play
through<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:39.099> and<00:05:39.279> it's<00:05:39.460> very<00:05:39.849> sturdy<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.389> just

looking<00:05:55.839> for<00:05:55.990> single<00:05:56.319> player<00:05:56.969> you<00:05:57.969> probably

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
looking for single player you probably

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.360 
looking for single player you probably
wouldn't<00:05:58.689> enjoy<00:05:59.500> replaying<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.009> game<00:06:00.039> so

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
wouldn't enjoy replaying the game so

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.409 
wouldn't enjoy replaying the game so
much<00:06:00.550> because<00:06:00.759> it<00:06:00.909> is<00:06:01.000> just<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.270> same

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
much because it is just the same

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.540 
much because it is just the same
campaign<00:06:01.839> but<00:06:02.649> if<00:06:02.830> you<00:06:02.949> are<00:06:02.979> interested<00:06:03.310> in

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
campaign but if you are interested in

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.279 
campaign but if you are interested in
online<00:06:03.669> gaming<00:06:04.060> there'd<00:06:04.629> be<00:06:04.719> so<00:06:04.870> much<00:06:05.020> for<00:06:05.199> you

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
online gaming there'd be so much for you

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.110 
online gaming there'd be so much for you
to<00:06:05.319> do<00:06:05.469> online<00:06:05.680> over<00:06:06.490> and<00:06:06.610> over<00:06:06.699> again<00:06:06.909> it's

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
to do online over and over again it's

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.209 
to do online over and over again it's
like<00:06:07.270> there's<00:06:07.960> upgrades<00:06:08.469> and<00:06:08.649> unlocks<00:06:09.039> and

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
like there's upgrades and unlocks and

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.490 
like there's upgrades and unlocks and
you<00:06:09.310> upgrade<00:06:09.969> your<00:06:10.000> rank<00:06:10.960> as<00:06:11.169> a<00:06:11.199> soldier

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
you upgrade your rank as a soldier

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.920 
you upgrade your rank as a soldier
everything<00:06:12.009> it<00:06:12.099> is<00:06:12.250> it's<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.270> nice<00:06:13.419> rewarding

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
everything it is it's a nice rewarding

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.779 
everything it is it's a nice rewarding
system<00:06:14.319> so<00:06:14.500> that's<00:06:14.680> definitely<00:06:15.550> something

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
system so that's definitely something

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.700 
system so that's definitely something
worth<00:06:16.000> mentioning<00:06:16.509> for<00:06:16.960> replay<00:06:17.349> abilities

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
worth mentioning for replay abilities

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.679 
worth mentioning for replay abilities
value<00:06:18.009> like<00:06:18.729> I<00:06:18.849> mentioned<00:06:19.029> earlier<00:06:19.300> this

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:19.689 
value like I mentioned earlier this

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:20.879 
value like I mentioned earlier this
isn't<00:06:19.990> going<00:06:20.080> to<00:06:20.139> be<00:06:20.199> a<00:06:20.259> full<00:06:20.560> review<00:06:20.740> of

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889

like a number like a score in my final

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.959 
like a number like a score in my final

opinion battlefield and this is how I
think<00:06:33.159> because<00:06:33.490> I<00:06:33.729> haven't<00:06:34.419> played<00:06:34.629> enough<00:06:34.719> of

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
think because I haven't played enough of

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.589 
think because I haven't played enough of
it<00:06:35.229> it<00:06:35.409> is<00:06:35.529> a<00:06:35.819> the<00:06:36.819> campaign's<00:06:37.210> like<00:06:37.389> a<00:06:37.449> decent

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
it it is a the campaign's like a decent

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:38.999 
it it is a the campaign's like a decent
length<00:06:37.839> I'm<00:06:38.050> not<00:06:38.169> that<00:06:38.349> far<00:06:38.589> into<00:06:38.770> it<00:06:38.860> in<00:06:38.979> the

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
length I'm not that far into it in the

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.320 
length I'm not that far into it in the
on<00:06:39.189> lines<00:06:39.839> super<00:06:40.839> immersive<00:06:41.849> just<00:06:42.849> not<00:06:43.119> as<00:06:43.180> far

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330
