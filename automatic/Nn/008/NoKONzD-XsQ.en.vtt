00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
my name's Rodney Brooks I was professor

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.390 
my name's Rodney Brooks I was professor
at<00:00:13.020> MIT<00:00:13.320> from<00:00:13.710> 1984<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:15.260> 2010<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.500> long<00:00:17.190> way<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
at MIT from 1984 to 2010 a long way I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.460 
at MIT from 1984 to 2010 a long way I
saddled<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> company<00:00:18.240> called<00:00:18.420> iRobot<00:00:19.260> with

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
saddled a company called iRobot with

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.880 
saddled a company called iRobot with
some<00:00:20.010> students<00:00:20.640> from<00:00:20.730> MIT<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.449> then<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.289> 2008

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
some students from MIT and then in 2008

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.429 
some students from MIT and then in 2008
I<00:00:23.130> went<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.490> leave<00:00:23.640> from<00:00:23.820> MIT<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.420> stop<00:00:24.689> this

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
I went on leave from MIT to stop this

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.409 
I went on leave from MIT to stop this
new<00:00:25.740> company<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.580> called<00:00:26.849> rethink<00:00:27.269> robotics

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
new company now called rethink robotics

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.480 
new company now called rethink robotics
where<00:00:28.320> we're<00:00:28.650> trying<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.009> reinvent

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
where we're trying to reinvent

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.120 
where we're trying to reinvent
industrial<00:00:30.150> robots<00:00:30.589> I'd<00:00:31.589> spent<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.949> lot<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
industrial robots I'd spent a lot of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.380 
industrial robots I'd spent a lot of
time<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:33.170> Taiwan<00:00:34.170> Hong<00:00:34.800> Kong<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.040> China<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:35.700> we

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
time in Taiwan Hong Kong and China as we

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.260 
time in Taiwan Hong Kong and China as we
were<00:00:36.510> manufacturing<00:00:37.290> products<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.460> iRobot

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
were manufacturing products for iRobot

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.380 
were manufacturing products for iRobot
and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.050> realized<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:41.210> outsourcing<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.360> China

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and I realized that outsourcing to China

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
and I realized that outsourcing to China
was<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> stable<00:00:43.980> solution<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.550> long-term

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
was not a stable solution for long-term

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
was not a stable solution for long-term
manufacturing<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> started<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> think

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
manufacturing so I started to think

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220 
manufacturing so I started to think
about<00:00:46.949> how<00:00:47.280> could<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.489> make<00:00:47.820> robots<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.750> were

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
about how could we make robots that were

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.220 
about how could we make robots that were
easy<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.160> use<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.359> ordinary<00:00:51.600> factory

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
easy to use so that ordinary factory

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
easy to use so that ordinary factory
workers<00:00:52.590> could<00:00:52.800> program<00:00:53.250> them<00:00:53.430> ordinary

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
workers could program them ordinary

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.939 
workers could program them ordinary
factory<00:00:54.480> workers<00:00:54.870> could<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.649> do<00:00:55.769> new

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
factory workers could get them to do new

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.160 
factory workers could get them to do new
tasks<00:00:56.519> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.359> there<00:00:57.539> could<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.719> much<00:00:57.989> more

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
tasks and then there could be much more

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.250 
tasks and then there could be much more
productive<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.829> compete<00:00:59.250> with

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
productive and compete with

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.509 
productive and compete with
manufacturing<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.410> China<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.100> bring

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
manufacturing in China and bring

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.700 
manufacturing in China and bring
manufacturing<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> US<00:01:03.899> our<00:01:04.110> first

just do it that's in contrast with

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.170 
just do it that's in contrast with
current<00:01:36.930> industrial<00:01:37.410> robots<00:01:37.770> where<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:39.000> have

the robots aren't safe to be close to
and<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.330> how<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.540> do

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and you have to really know how to do

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.450 
and you have to really know how to do
programming<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.740> robot<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
programming to get the robot to do the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.120 
programming to get the robot to do the
simplest<00:01:50.850> sort<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> thing<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.290> interface<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
simplest sort of thing the interface the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.860 
simplest sort of thing the interface the
robot<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.640> through<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.390> looks<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.630> its

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
robot is through what looks like its

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.140 
robot is through what looks like its
face<00:01:55.050> in<00:01:55.560> its<00:01:55.740> face<00:01:55.920> position<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.400> it's<00:01:56.640> an<00:01:56.790> LCD

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
face in its face position so it's an LCD

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.000 
face in its face position so it's an LCD
screen<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.660> when<00:01:58.260> it's<00:01:58.410> working<00:01:58.650> or

screen and when it's working or

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.840 
screen and when it's working or
operating<00:01:59.520> normally

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
operating normally

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.050 
operating normally
it<00:01:59.970> actually<00:02:00.120> has<00:02:00.420> eyes<00:02:00.900> on<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> why<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it actually has eyes on it why I have a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.260 
it actually has eyes on it why I have a
robot<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.510> eyes<00:02:03.660> well<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.920> eyes<00:02:05.250> give<00:02:05.910> cues

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
robot with eyes well the eyes give cues

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.999 
robot with eyes well the eyes give cues
to<00:02:06.480> someone<00:02:06.780> about<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.470> robots<00:02:07.800> about

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to someone about what the robots about

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
to someone about what the robots about
to<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.550> about<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> reach<00:02:09.060> over<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
to do when it's about to reach over to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.690 
to do when it's about to reach over to
the<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:10.080> its<00:02:10.560> eyes<00:02:10.800> look<00:02:11.099> there<00:02:11.280> first<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the right its eyes look there first and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.309 
the right its eyes look there first and
then<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> reaches<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.780> come<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
then it reaches so as you come up the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.710 
then it reaches so as you come up the
robot<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.770> tell<00:02:14.160> what<00:02:14.849> it's<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.480> do

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
robot you can tell what it's going to do

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.589 
robot you can tell what it's going to do
next<00:02:15.989> every<00:02:16.739> joint<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.909> robot<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.299> able<00:02:18.390> to

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
next every joint in the robot is able to

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.619 
next every joint in the robot is able to
feel<00:02:18.810> force

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
feel force

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.360 
feel force
so<00:02:20.200> instead<00:02:20.409> of<00:02:20.469> being<00:02:20.620> position<00:02:21.040> control

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
so instead of being position control

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.759 
so instead of being position control
we're<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> force<00:02:22.090> control<00:02:22.510> robot<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.079> when<00:02:23.650> it

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
we're a force control robot and when it

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.399 
we're a force control robot and when it
puts<00:02:23.950> something<00:02:24.129> down<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.849> table<00:02:25.409> its

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
puts something down on a table its

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.199 
puts something down on a table its
feeling<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.859> force<00:02:27.069> as<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.400> puts<00:02:27.579> it<00:02:27.700> down<00:02:27.879> and

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
feeling the force as it puts it down and

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.629 
feeling the force as it puts it down and
then<00:02:28.420> oh<00:02:28.540> it's<00:02:28.810> down<00:02:28.989> oh<00:02:29.260> my<00:02:29.769> god<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.459> if<00:02:30.549> you

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
then oh it's down oh my god so if you

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.619 
then oh it's down oh my god so if you
actually<00:02:30.909> put<00:02:31.060> your<00:02:31.120> hand<00:02:31.329> underneath

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
actually put your hand underneath

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.479 
actually put your hand underneath
hazards<00:02:32.049> coming<00:02:32.290> down<00:02:32.439> okay<00:02:33.219> it's<00:02:33.370> on

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
hazards coming down okay it's on

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.789 
hazards coming down okay it's on
something<00:02:33.730> don't<00:02:34.030> let<00:02:34.090> go<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.329> it

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
something don't let go of it

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.809 
something don't let go of it

industrial robots have been around since
1961<00:02:37.629> when<00:02:38.349> they<00:02:38.469> were<00:02:38.560> first<00:02:38.769> put<00:02:38.950> into<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.340> by

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
1961 when they were first put into it by

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.550 
1961 when they were first put into it by
an<00:02:40.030> American<00:02:40.329> company<00:02:40.540> put<00:02:40.959> into<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.230> GM<00:02:41.530> plant

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560

in<00:02:42.040> New<00:02:42.250> Jersey<00:02:43.620> computation<00:02:44.620> was<00:02:44.739> expensive

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
in New Jersey computation was expensive

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.190 
in New Jersey computation was expensive
then<00:02:45.370> sensors<00:02:45.909> were<00:02:46.030> expensive<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.930> they<00:02:47.139> were

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
then sensors were expensive so they were

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.589 
then sensors were expensive so they were
built<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.950> do<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.459> same<00:02:48.669> thing<00:02:48.909> again<00:02:49.030> again

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599

factory worker to use I don't know
exactly<00:03:08.650> where<00:03:09.099> it's<00:03:09.189> gonna<00:03:09.280> go<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.489> know<00:03:09.639> it's

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
exactly where it's gonna go I know it's

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.979 
exactly where it's gonna go I know it's
going<00:03:09.969> to<00:03:10.030> be<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.180> revolution<00:03:10.780> in

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
going to be a revolution in

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.189 
going to be a revolution in
manufacturing<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:12.419> sort<00:03:13.419> of<00:03:13.449> like<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.870> up<00:03:14.079> to

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199 
manufacturing I sort of like it up to

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.869 
manufacturing I sort of like it up to
when<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.469> tractor<00:03:14.769> came<00:03:15.159> into<00:03:15.459> farming

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
when the tractor came into farming

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.879 
when the tractor came into farming
completely<00:03:16.629> changed<00:03:16.989> how<00:03:17.109> farming<00:03:17.530> was<00:03:17.650> done

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
completely changed how farming was done

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.839 
completely changed how farming was done
no<00:03:18.219> one<00:03:18.400> wants<00:03:18.639> to<00:03:18.699> go<00:03:18.879> back<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> hand<00:03:20.019> hoeing

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
no one wants to go back to hand hoeing

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.689 
no one wants to go back to hand hoeing
tractors<00:03:22.379> made<00:03:23.379> farming<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:24.069> much<00:03:24.459> better

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
tractors made farming a much better

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.490 
tractors made farming a much better
business<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.389> be<00:03:25.509> in<00:03:25.689> and<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.259> think<00:03:26.319> we're

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
business to be in and I think we're

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.199 
business to be in and I think we're
gonna<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.040> change<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.519> manufacturing

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
gonna see that change in manufacturing

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.969 
gonna see that change in manufacturing
when<00:03:28.870> people<00:03:29.199> hear<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.739> we're<00:03:29.829> building

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:29.979 
when people hear that we're building

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.740 
when people hear that we're building
industrial<00:03:30.519> robots<00:03:30.849> they<00:03:31.000> say<00:03:31.150> oh<00:03:31.269> isn't<00:03:31.629> that

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
industrial robots they say oh isn't that

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.159 
industrial robots they say oh isn't that
kind<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.019> take<00:03:32.169> away<00:03:32.199> jobs<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:34.019> do<00:03:35.019> not

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
kind of take away jobs and I do not

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.800 
kind of take away jobs and I do not
think<00:03:35.409> that<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.889> case<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.790> having<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
think that is the case the having the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.069 
think that is the case the having the
robot<00:03:38.199> do<00:03:38.470> simple<00:03:38.829> cases<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.280> simple<00:03:39.430> tasks<00:03:40.180> it

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
robot do simple cases of simple tasks it

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.530 
robot do simple cases of simple tasks it
makes<00:03:41.680> existing<00:03:42.549> workers<00:03:43.209> more<00:03:43.479> productive

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
makes existing workers more productive

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.990 
makes existing workers more productive
and<00:03:44.169> by<00:03:44.470> having<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.189> existing<00:03:45.579> workers<00:03:45.849> be

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
and by having the existing workers be

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.179 
and by having the existing workers be
able<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.299> program<00:03:46.689> the<00:03:46.900> robot<00:03:47.259> or<00:03:47.680> train<00:03:48.040> the

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
able to program the robot or train the

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.909 
able to program the robot or train the
robot<00:03:48.419> they<00:03:49.419> get<00:03:49.870> more<00:03:50.049> power<00:03:50.379> and<00:03:50.560> what<00:03:50.739> they

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
robot they get more power and what they

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.589 
robot they get more power and what they
can<00:03:51.159> do<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.549> think<00:03:52.030> we're<00:03:52.120> gonna<00:03:52.209> see<00:03:52.419> people

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
can do I think we're gonna see people

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.869 
can do I think we're gonna see people
take<00:03:53.109> this<00:03:53.290> robot<00:03:53.709> program<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.579> do<00:03:54.669> stuff

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
take this robot program it to do stuff

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.119 
take this robot program it to do stuff
that<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:55.269> never<00:03:55.540> thought<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.870> never<00:03:56.439> imagined

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
that we never thought of never imagined

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.369 
that we never thought of never imagined
and<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:58.209> lot<00:03:58.359> something<00:03:58.569> gonna<00:03:58.750> be<00:03:58.900> failures

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
and a lot something gonna be failures

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.899 
and a lot something gonna be failures
Lots<00:03:59.650> I'm<00:03:59.829> not<00:04:00.069> gonna<00:04:00.220> lead<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.459> real<00:04:00.759> stuff

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
Lots I'm not gonna lead to real stuff

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.580 
Lots I'm not gonna lead to real stuff
but<00:04:01.299> out<00:04:01.509> of<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.900> will<00:04:02.049> come<00:04:02.079> some<00:04:02.469> new

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
but out of that will come some new

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.259 
but out of that will come some new
applications<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.639> didn't<00:04:04.060> even

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
applications that we didn't even

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.270 
applications that we didn't even
consider<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.109> then<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.859> gets<00:04:06.040> really

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
consider and then it gets really

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.729 
consider and then it gets really
exciting
