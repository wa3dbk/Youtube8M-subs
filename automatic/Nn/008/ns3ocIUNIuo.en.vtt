00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
kind of watch me do it and then we'll

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
kind of watch me do it and then we'll
slow<00:00:49.289> down<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.070> me<00:00:50.190> watch<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
slow down so you can see me watch the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
slow down so you can see me watch the
actual<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.120> actual<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:52.230> I've<00:00:52.320> double

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
actual the actual and I've double

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.220 
actual the actual and I've double
counted<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> actual<00:00:53.480> 1000<00:00:54.480> crane<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
counted this the actual 1000 crane and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.479 
counted this the actual 1000 crane and
it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.410> big<00:00:55.530> deal<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.770> me<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's a big deal for me because it was a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's a big deal for me because it was a
little<00:00:56.699> hot<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.059> work<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.050> stuck<00:00:58.289> with
