00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:05.120
 I'll wait acrylic paint and that if the ten series mania a chorus like 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.990
 a declaration of love this story I find that African patients 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.130
 to go without it appreciated by these celebrities 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.560
 and that's because they are often compared to skaters 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.380
 eyi 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.329
 it was not counting with her but the other because she had 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.329
 she went to camp herself but not on acrylic 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 they have some opacity to be competitive and to create textures 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.080
 canton disagree 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.320
 his paints 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 but otherwise there is nothing they have nothing in common 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 for example bridges and opinion history full of beautiful paintings 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.510
 but in the face of the crisis and that it has only been fifty years since 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.830
 give what 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.670
 I can not compare 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.630
 moreover these oil paints m for some danger m 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.500
 some mysticism is associated with that chemicals used 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.580
 to use individuals 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.400
 acrylics his cell allo so they are not hungry 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.260
 and he knows it's ugly because art has gone on to criticize finds that 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.620
 even if it's the most modern media that does not mean it was 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.820
 it's better or worse he told me the other 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.340
 so I watched with the helmets it dries very quickly 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.810
 and I know it did not fail 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.610
 standing 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 good for everyone but I love it was happening 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.000
 I would like to be celebrated and snacks table with several layers 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.229
 separate 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.290
 and he hopes without waiting days and days 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.700
 a 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.320
 on the other hand while it is that the petaners explains are comforted 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.810
 bike because I find it very convenient 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 and in addition c when we do for 100 m 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.200
 when we actually make the bed 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.429
 acrylic paints to his victims 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:02.450
 m 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.159
 with more water nice thinning was on fire maybe the chart 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.759
 oil on the ground 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.859
 it serves to sink 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.919
 painting write formats like that 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:14.959
 disgust me 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.249
 and i love it i love the way m acrylic that m 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:25.119
 reacted with anger a lot of water and how 5% we can not control this 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.779
 that it's going to be better informed and a half she starts her sap 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.279
 how will it be 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.609
 and I love it with acrylics in acrylics we've 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.370
 we can shout very fascinating to control everything m it's inhuman a painting 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.819
 simple year easy to understand but at the same time she has everyone 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.159
 or subtlety and 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.889
 nuances to discover 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.649
 finally the canton 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:53.799
 not an impact for several years 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.370
 so for this is not yesterday that I will not say that yes 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.729
 oil paintings are 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.149
 but I mean and the acrylic pastels sense
