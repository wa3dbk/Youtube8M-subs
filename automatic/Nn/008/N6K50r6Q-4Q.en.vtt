00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
a few years ago I guess our big thing

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.880 
a few years ago I guess our big thing
now<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:41.010> into<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.460> cereal<00:00:41.790> rye<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
now is I'm really into the cereal rye I

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.790 
now is I'm really into the cereal rye I
see<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.340> benefits<00:00:44.789> from<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.559> into

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
see a lot of benefits from it going into

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.139 
see a lot of benefits from it going into
soybeans<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.489> next<00:00:47.760> year<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:50.850> could<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
soybeans the next year it could be a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.869 
soybeans the next year it could be a
little<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> challenge<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> Falls

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
little bit of a challenge with the Falls

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
little bit of a challenge with the Falls
that<00:00:54.059> we've<00:00:54.270> had<00:00:54.510> lately<00:00:54.840> trying<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that we've had lately trying to get it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.369 
that we've had lately trying to get it
established<00:00:58.190> but<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.899> challenge

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
established but you know that challenge

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.690 
established but you know that challenge
is<00:01:01.530> well<00:01:01.739> worth<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:04.430> everything<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.549> goes

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is well worth the everything that goes

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.770 
is well worth the everything that goes
along<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:08.689> probably<00:01:09.689> three<00:01:10.680> years<00:01:10.920> ago

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.380 
soybeans we've ever had
they<00:02:26.190> were<00:02:26.250> bared<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> yields<00:02:27.060> were<00:02:27.150> very

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
they were bared the yields were very

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.059 
they were bared the yields were very
consistent<00:02:27.840> across<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.830> field<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:32.040> was

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
consistent across the field it was

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.550 
consistent across the field it was
pretty<00:02:32.340> warm<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.849> dry<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.840> year<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.290> well

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
pretty warm and dry that year as well

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.569 
pretty warm and dry that year as well
and<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:36.000> think<00:02:36.269> having<00:02:36.690> all<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.310> residue<00:02:38.310> out

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
and I think having all that residue out

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.630 
and I think having all that residue out
there<00:02:39.000> from<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.480> cereal<00:02:39.810> rye<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:41.099> helps<00:02:41.430> shade

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
there from the cereal rye it helps shade

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.280 
there from the cereal rye it helps shade
out<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.970> soybeans<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.720> probably<00:02:43.019> kept<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
out the soybeans it probably kept the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.699 
out the soybeans it probably kept the
ground<00:02:43.590> temperature<00:02:44.069> cooler<00:02:45.530> conserve<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
ground temperature cooler conserve the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.449 
ground temperature cooler conserve the
moisture<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.989> just<00:02:48.989> knowing<00:02:49.379> on<00:02:50.010> these

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
moisture and just knowing on these

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.780 
moisture and just knowing on these
particular<00:02:50.819> fields<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.019> past<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
particular fields in the past on the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.940 
particular fields in the past on the
lighter<00:02:54.000> soils<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> yields<00:02:55.049> would<00:02:55.769> have

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
lighter soils the yields would have

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.339 
lighter soils the yields would have
normally<00:02:56.640> really<00:02:57.299> dropped<00:02:57.569> off<00:02:57.810> well<00:02:58.170> these

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
normally really dropped off well these

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.550 
normally really dropped off well these
was<00:02:58.560> very<00:02:58.859> consistent<00:02:59.690> going<00:03:00.690> across<00:03:00.930> you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
was very consistent going across you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140 
was very consistent going across you
know<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.680> lighter<00:03:01.950> soil<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.640> probably<00:03:02.909> with

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
know the lighter soil they probably with

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.680 
know the lighter soil they probably with
it<00:03:03.299> within<00:03:03.510> five<00:03:04.040> bushels<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:06.450> know<00:03:06.510> what

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
it within five bushels of you know what

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.250 
it within five bushels of you know what
the<00:03:06.780> whole<00:03:06.930> field<00:03:07.230> ended<00:03:08.069> up<00:03:08.190> yielding<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
the whole field ended up yielding so and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.940 
the whole field ended up yielding so and
then<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.590> same<00:03:10.829> year<00:03:11.069> we<00:03:11.280> had<00:03:12.530> we<00:03:13.530> had<00:03:13.620> winter

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
then that same year we had we had winter

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.720 
then that same year we had we had winter
peas<00:03:14.159> in<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.849> field<00:03:15.090> right<00:03:15.329> here<00:03:16.579> we<00:03:17.579> got

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
peas in this field right here we got

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.879 
peas in this field right here we got
them<00:03:17.849> established<00:03:18.389> in<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.599> fall<00:03:18.810> about<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
them established in the fall about the

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.420 
them established in the fall about the
third<00:03:20.549> week<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.910> September<00:03:21.859> when<00:03:22.859> we<00:03:23.010> planted

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
third week of September when we planted

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.030 
third week of September when we planted
them<00:03:23.549> they<00:03:24.299> didn't<00:03:24.690> look<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.139> great<00:03:25.410> but

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
them they didn't look that great but

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.710 
them they didn't look that great but
then<00:03:26.190> again<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.519> didn't<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.150> what<00:03:27.480> they<00:03:27.630> were

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
then again I didn't know what they were

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.940 
then again I didn't know what they were
supposed<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.049> look<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.859> had

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
supposed to look like because I had

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.430 
supposed to look like because I had
never<00:03:29.129> planted<00:03:29.519> them<00:03:29.669> for<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:31.079> then<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.349> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
never planted them for and then in the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.240 
never planted them for and then in the
spring<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:31.919> year<00:03:32.329> they<00:03:33.329> broke<00:03:33.540> dormancy

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
spring of the year they broke dormancy

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.409 
spring of the year they broke dormancy
and<00:03:35.250> then<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.430> kind<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.849> had<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> little<00:03:36.120> cold

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
and then we kind of had a little cold

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.780 
and then we kind of had a little cold
snap<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:37.109> kind<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.379> dinged<00:03:38.310> them<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.549> little

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
snap and it kind of dinged them a little

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.250 
snap and it kind of dinged them a little
bit<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.239> didn't<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.569> what<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.930> expect

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
bit and I didn't know what to expect

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.280 
bit and I didn't know what to expect
there<00:03:40.500> as<00:03:40.739> well<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.480> then<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.510> talking<00:03:43.139> with

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
there as well and then just talking with

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.949 
there as well and then just talking with
Jim<00:03:43.530> Orman<00:03:43.980> he<00:03:44.879> said<00:03:45.120> don't<00:03:45.269> worry<00:03:45.389> about<00:03:45.750> it

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
Jim Orman he said don't worry about it

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.199 
Jim Orman he said don't worry about it
when<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.440> warms<00:03:46.620> up<00:03:46.919> they'll<00:03:47.609> start<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.000> grow

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
when it warms up they'll start to grow

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.800 
when it warms up they'll start to grow
and<00:03:49.519> sure<00:03:50.519> enough<00:03:50.549> Jim<00:03:51.060> was<00:03:51.180> right<00:03:51.419> when<00:03:51.660> we

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
and sure enough Jim was right when we

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.509 
and sure enough Jim was right when we
started<00:03:52.079> getting<00:03:52.230> some<00:03:52.349> 60<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:52.919> 70<00:03:53.250> degree

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
started getting some 60 and 70 degree

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.150 
started getting some 60 and 70 degree
days<00:03:53.730> these<00:03:54.720> things<00:03:55.079> just<00:03:55.379> exploded<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
days these things just exploded and

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.490 
days these things just exploded and
before<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.910> knew<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.389> was<00:03:57.599> knee-high<00:03:57.930> and

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
before you knew it it was knee-high and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.619 
before you knew it it was knee-high and
we're<00:03:59.040> still<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.609> was<00:03:59.730> we<00:04:00.329> were<00:04:00.389> still

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
we're still that was we were still

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.449 
we're still that was we were still
having<00:04:00.870> too<00:04:01.379> much<00:04:01.530> wet<00:04:01.769> weather<00:04:01.980> we<00:04:02.190> couldn't

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
having too much wet weather we couldn't

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.960 
having too much wet weather we couldn't
get<00:04:02.549> corn<00:04:02.849> in<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.569> ground<00:04:04.519> so<00:04:05.519> then<00:04:05.669> finally

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
get corn in the ground so then finally

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.729 
get corn in the ground so then finally
when<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.419> did<00:04:06.569> get<00:04:07.049> to<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.230> point<00:04:07.440> where<00:04:07.620> we

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
when it did get to the point where we

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.680 
when it did get to the point where we
could<00:04:07.919> get<00:04:08.069> into<00:04:08.250> fields<00:04:08.819> we<00:04:09.209> sprayed<00:04:09.569> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
could get into fields we sprayed the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.740 
could get into fields we sprayed the
fields<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.579> two<00:04:11.579> days<00:04:11.760> later<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:12.239> went<00:04:12.389> in<00:04:12.599> we

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
fields and two days later we went in we

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.610 
fields and two days later we went in we
no<00:04:12.959> tilled<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.650> corn<00:04:14.220> into<00:04:14.430> it

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
no tilled the corn into it

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.310 
no tilled the corn into it
and<00:04:16.430> then<00:04:16.760> when<00:04:16.970> we<00:04:17.120> came<00:04:17.299> in<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:20.079> side<00:04:21.079> dress

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
and then when we came in to side dress

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.840 
and then when we came in to side dress
this<00:04:21.560> corn<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:23.060> want<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.630> say<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:23.960> was<00:04:24.729> five<00:04:25.729> or

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
this corn I want to say it was five or

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.120 
this corn I want to say it was five or
six<00:04:26.030> weeks<00:04:26.210> after<00:04:26.750> Dan<00:04:27.139> merged<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.800> was<00:04:28.010> this

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
six weeks after Dan merged it was this

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.409 
six weeks after Dan merged it was this
kind<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.490> same<00:04:28.669> way<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:28.940> know<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.210> corn
