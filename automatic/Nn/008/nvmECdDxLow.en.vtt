no big deal no big deal we are at the

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.860 
no big deal no big deal we are at the
fifth<00:02:30.379> set<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.760> all<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:31.970> stupid

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
fifth set so all that stupid

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.320 
fifth set so all that stupid
app<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.110> behind<00:02:33.379> us<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.400> last<00:02:34.610> four<00:02:34.909> sets<00:02:35.209> are

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
app is behind us the last four sets are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.699 
app is behind us the last four sets are
behind<00:02:35.540> us<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.870> looks<00:02:36.019> like<00:02:36.140> Massey's<00:02:36.500> going

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
behind us and looks like Massey's going

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.199 
behind us and looks like Massey's going
out<00:02:36.860> might<00:02:37.250> be<00:02:37.400> thinking<00:02:37.640> about<00:02:37.670> walling<00:02:38.090> off

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
out might be thinking about walling off

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.210 
out might be thinking about walling off
here<00:02:38.450> he<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.659> going<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.900> wall<00:02:39.049> off<00:02:39.080> at<00:02:39.470> his

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
here he is going to wall off at his

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.470 
here he is going to wall off at his
natural<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.890> looks<00:02:43.879> like<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.120> might<00:02:44.269> see<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
natural so looks like we might see a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.289 
natural so looks like we might see a
longer<00:02:44.840> game<00:02:44.989> from<00:02:45.379> both<00:02:45.590> players<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.299> Jae

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
longer game from both players and Jae

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.330 
longer game from both players and Jae
dong<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.780> spawning<00:02:48.409> his<00:02:48.590> Overlord<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.220> now

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
dong is spawning his Overlord right now

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.190 
dong is spawning his Overlord right now
so<00:02:49.610> he's<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.120> probably<00:02:50.360> go<00:02:50.629> over<00:02:50.659> pull

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
so he's going to probably go over pull

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.039 
so he's going to probably go over pull
my<00:02:51.230> guess<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:52.099> over<00:02:52.459> pool<00:02:52.700> Jae<00:02:52.970> dong<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.390> think

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
my guess is over pool Jae dong I think

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.259 
my guess is over pool Jae dong I think
he<00:02:54.170> senses<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:55.010> blood<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:56.000> water<00:02:56.030> right

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
he senses the blood in the water right

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.960 
he senses the blood in the water right
now<00:02:56.390> he<00:02:56.569> knows<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.230> fantasy<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:58.220> seems<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.879> be

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
now he knows that fantasy it seems to be

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.119 
now he knows that fantasy it seems to be
weak<00:02:59.239> against<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.870> early<00:03:00.200> attacks<00:03:00.530> early

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
weak against the early attacks early

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.979 
weak against the early attacks early
aggression<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:02.030> continued<00:03:02.540> aggression

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
aggression just continued aggression

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.050 
aggression just continued aggression
continued<00:03:03.950> aggression<00:03:04.340> from<00:03:04.489> jae<00:03:04.730> dong<00:03:04.879> in

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
continued aggression from jae dong in

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.170 
continued aggression from jae dong in
those<00:03:05.180> last<00:03:05.390> two<00:03:05.629> games<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.170> Jae<00:03:07.129> dong<00:03:07.250> this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
those last two games and Jae dong this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.940 
those last two games and Jae dong this
is<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.569> weird<00:03:08.930> matchup<00:03:09.440> because<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.709> thought

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
is a weird matchup because I thought

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.500 
is a weird matchup because I thought
these<00:03:10.160> games<00:03:10.430> would<00:03:10.670> go<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.849> late<00:03:11.060> game<00:03:11.299> and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
these games would go to late game and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.940 
these games would go to late game and
we'd<00:03:11.599> see<00:03:11.810> jaedong<00:03:12.200> show<00:03:12.440> off<00:03:12.560> his<00:03:12.709> late-game

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
we'd see jaedong show off his late-game

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.339 
we'd see jaedong show off his late-game
Defiler<00:03:13.459> tech<00:03:13.760> but<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.390> only<00:03:14.599> time<00:03:14.989> he<00:03:15.019> showed

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
Defiler tech but the only time he showed

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.990 
Defiler tech but the only time he showed
off<00:03:15.500> his<00:03:15.650> Defiler<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.430> first<00:03:16.640> game<00:03:16.819> and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000

I have a feeling he is I I predicted the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.110 
I have a feeling he is I I predicted the
