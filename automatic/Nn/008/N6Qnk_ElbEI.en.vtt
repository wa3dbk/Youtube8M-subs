00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
from the weight because it's she on the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.010 
from the weight because it's she on the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
top of the fork and so we're going to

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.430 
top of the fork and so we're going to
get<00:01:05.210> the
