 last Tuesday strange creatures came to the scene of the Atlanteans 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 objects come to life and seem to gang up against their masters 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.240
 it's a kind of quixotic gift battling in a dark law universe 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.199
 it's strange here no mills but the bodies two years on this is the 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.329
 playful pipes and debates the journey 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.940
 in the evening monsters actually we follow% of the characters 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.350
 there is a given moment of his life at a specific time not started to tip 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.200
 in a madness from where this stroke of pure madness where I know by a madness yesterday 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.050
 % and so we will follow this switch that will be progressive but inexorable 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.360
 so in fact it's a character who surrounded by old objects was all 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.500
 alone and who are friends 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.390
 and like everyone else who are bored the human brain sports not the boredom of which 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.230
 that creates situations even if a device serving things so 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.410

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.460
 his imagination 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.950
 he will be progressively overwhelmed by this imaginary and have a kind of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.570
 fight 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.690
 to try to return to his original reality for easter his imaginary 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.540
 boundless 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.230
 and life so also become more and more violent 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.930
 for that gradually 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.880
 he abandons himself completely his folly and that's what we'll show to 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.430
