00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.100
 scars

 each person has a process of 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.410
 scarring and does not depend on the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.890

 someone famous or you admire

 Let's now show how it's performed. 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.370
 mammoplasty the choice of technique 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.400
 adopted takes into account the 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.730
 size and degree of sagging of the breasts 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.160
 the incision can be around her 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.370
 which may extend to the portion 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.370
 the lower pole of the breast or as 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.600
 in most cases encompass almost all 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.020
 the bottom pole 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.870
 In this technique an incision is made to the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.880
 around the areola to reposition it and 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.420
 reduce its size if there is 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.200
 need the skin of the new place to give her 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.780
 and the lower pole of the breast is removed in 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.140
 then removes excess fabric 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.260
 glandular and greasy breast tissue 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:27.250

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.710
 is high and the incisions are approximate 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.040
 resulting in a vertical scar and 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.260
 a horizontal groove in breast 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.820
 removal of excess fat from the 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.550
 side of the thorax 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.690
 liposuction can be associated with 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.000
 surgery 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.360
 a small bore can also be 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.030
 recovery. 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.030
 be withdrawn in the days following the 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.030
 surgery in cases in which it is desired 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.840
 correct sagging and increase breasts 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.590
 it is possible to put a breast implant 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.510
 followed by removal of excess skin and 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.790
 repositioning of the areola due to 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.640
 incisions are performed in the 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.040
 lower the breast the patient may use 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.390
 necklines and vicky says no fear to show 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.180
 the scars 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.390
 over time the scars will 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.150
 maturing and becoming less visible 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.800
 the healing process can lead to 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.260
 up to a few months 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.870
 the reduction of breast volume and 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.880
 Correction of sagging brings many 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.180
 benefits in exchange for some 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.080
 scars whose size and shape depend on 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.080
 of each case 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.750
 It is very important to wear bra 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.510
 because it supports the breasts 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.940
 during the healing process 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.850
 the patient should also avoid lifting 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.400
 arms and sleep on the breasts 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.210
