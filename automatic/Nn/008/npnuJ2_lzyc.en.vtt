 I hope you like the recipe. 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.279
 Little kisses

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.649
 hot kiss town is a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 little girl 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:44.370
 so it's made with chocolate and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 I think you're going to like it because 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.770
 addicts a lot you want to do 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 today existed not come on I will use 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.010
 low fire in the pan plus goose two 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.710
 glass cups peeled into a field 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.239
 of common sugar crystallized half cup 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.210
 of powdered chocolate 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.299
 I used in that water filtered up to 15 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.659
 millions will be trade will form a 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.840
 Salsa I'll let it boil 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.930
 but leave more or less than 11 very 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.030
 It takes a while to boil. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 as it will be for sale 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.020
 getting thicker until then it goes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.729
 to start drying was for sale and how do they 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.920
 know darker 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.250
 At this point it is important to move well. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.560
 so that it does not over- 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.090
 some part or cable even burning 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.940
 to get burned 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.140
 It will get bitter and he accepts will not 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.240
 try to get down 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.729
 have to move when he heads for 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.670
 the world does not lose its shell because otherwise 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.840
 will not format the spine around 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.810
 bidding 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.780
 look when she goes surrounding the recipe 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.440
 looks ready but note that in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.920
 bottom of the pan has kind is a bran 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.649
 so it's a little that the shell formed 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 so now I'll fix that hunting in 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.580
 that the tail has formed now I will 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.300
 Pan girl leave that bran here. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.110
 the melting and turning into syrup 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.170
 again and then gently I do it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.290
 the boys until you see the tail and back with the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.959
 play this so the tail will achieve 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.190
 including sticking to it inform that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.230
 crispy shrimp that we used to 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.329
 when that bran is gone 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.110
 family background 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.420
 I'll turn off the fire and I'll have nothing 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.140
 Do not mess with it either. 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.769
 when I no longer have tail background 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.210
 The pot is ready and I'm going to 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.430

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.400
