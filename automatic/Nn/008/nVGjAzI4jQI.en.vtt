it's<00:00:16.409> a<00:00:16.679> 2.4<00:00:17.519> gigahertz<00:00:18.929> I<00:00:18.960> bought<00:00:19.349> it<00:00:19.499> for<00:00:19.819> as

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:20.819 
it's a 2.4 gigahertz I bought it for as

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.899 
it's a 2.4 gigahertz I bought it for as
nothing<00:00:21.329> is<00:00:21.569> peanuts

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:23.909 
nothing is peanuts

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:30.189 
nothing is peanuts
I<00:00:23.960> got<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.079> bundled<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.210> camera<00:00:27.210> so

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.619 

there's<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> camera<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.910> camera<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.449> run

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
there's the camera the camera can run

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.830 
there's the camera the camera can run
off<00:00:33.780> 9-volt<00:00:34.289> battery<00:00:34.679> or<00:00:35.129> it<00:00:36.120> also<00:00:36.269> comes<00:00:36.660> with

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
off 9-volt battery or it also comes with

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.590 
off 9-volt battery or it also comes with
a<00:00:37.969> power<00:00:38.969> supply<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.750> operate<00:00:40.109> it<00:00:40.289> and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
a power supply to operate it and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.569 
a power supply to operate it and
broadcasts<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.750> 2.4<00:00:43.350> gig<00:00:43.559> range<00:00:43.859> I<00:00:44.309> did

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
broadcasts on the 2.4 gig range I did

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
broadcasts on the 2.4 gig range I did
figure<00:00:44.879> out<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.449> PL<00:00:45.960> format<00:00:46.469> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
figure out it's the PL format so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.380 
figure out it's the PL format so
European<00:00:47.820> format<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.179> guess<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:50.390> kind

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
European format I guess that is and kind

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
European format I guess that is and kind

2.4<00:01:09.420> gig<00:01:09.750> video<00:01:10.649> as<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:12.180> here's<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
2.4 gig video as well but here's the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.260 
2.4 gig video as well but here's the
nifty<00:01:13.079> thing<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:14.280> things<00:01:14.520> pass<00:01:14.759> next<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
nifty thing these things pass next to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.520 
nifty thing these things pass next to
nothing<00:01:15.829> if<00:01:16.829> they<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.219> set<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:18.810> audio<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
nothing if they have a set of audio and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
nothing if they have a set of audio and
video<00:01:19.829> RCA<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.009> lot<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> people<00:01:24.030> look<00:01:24.360> at

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
video RCA in a a lot of people look at

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.719 
video RCA in a a lot of people look at
buying<00:01:24.719> the<00:01:24.990> USB<00:01:25.469> capture<00:01:26.009> devices<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.520> don't

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
buying the USB capture devices I don't

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.679 
buying the USB capture devices I don't
know<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:27.689> cost<00:01:28.170> now<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:29.149> this<00:01:30.149> thing<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
know what they cost now but this thing I

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.270 
know what they cost now but this thing I
think<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.530> around<00:01:31.799> 10<00:01:32.039> bucks<00:01:32.420> for<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.840> USB

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
think was around 10 bucks for just a USB

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.819 
think was around 10 bucks for just a USB
audio<00:01:35.280> video<00:01:35.789> in<00:01:36.149> I<00:01:36.539> think<00:01:37.020> that's<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.289> very

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
audio video in I think that's a very

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
audio video in I think that's a very
very<00:01:38.100> good<00:01:38.399> price<00:01:39.710> that's<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.100> guess<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:42.000> it's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
very good price that's I guess what it's

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.899 
very good price that's I guess what it's
designed<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.380> well<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.130> wireless<00:01:44.340> so

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
designed for as well as the wireless so

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.679 
designed for as well as the wireless so
anyway<00:01:46.609> that's<00:01:47.609> where<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.969> sits<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.539> whole

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
anyway that's where it sits the whole

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.580 
anyway that's where it sits the whole
bundle<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.469> was<00:01:49.649> 20<00:01:50.310> bucks<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
bundle I think was 20 bucks or so and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.139 
bundle I think was 20 bucks or so and
now<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> wireless<00:01:53.899> camera<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:56.149> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
now I have a wireless camera and you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.169 
now I have a wireless camera and you
could<00:01:57.299> use<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.920> scanning<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:59.280> cameras

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
could use it for scanning other cameras

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.770 
could use it for scanning other cameras
too<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.009> hence<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.219> made<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.570> for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
too but hence I made this not for

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.010 
too but hence I made this not for
scanning<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.009> made<00:02:05.609> this<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.329> preparation

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
scanning but I made this in preparation

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.270 
scanning but I made this in preparation
for<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.409> guy<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> her

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
for this guy to her

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.890 
for this guy to her
this<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.090> ex<00:02:09.300> tech<00:02:09.569> borescope<00:02:10.640> receiver

this is my ex tech borescope receiver

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.540 
this is my ex tech borescope receiver
you'll<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:14.010> another<00:02:14.250> video<00:02:14.520> on

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
little picture breakup I'm not sure that

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.470 
little picture breakup I'm not sure that
the<00:02:58.590> Wi-Fi<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:59.040> interfering<00:02:59.850> with<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.330> would

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
the Wi-Fi is interfering with it I would

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.559 
the Wi-Fi is interfering with it I would
expect<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:02.030> works<00:03:03.030> great<00:03:04.130> for<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> price

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
expect so but works great for the price

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.600 
expect so but works great for the price
