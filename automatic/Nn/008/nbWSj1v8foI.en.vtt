maybe<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.390> fair<00:00:45.570> comparison<00:00:45.750> maybe

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
maybe it's not a fair comparison maybe

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.830

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
two knobs I don't know if you can hear

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.160 
two knobs I don't know if you can hear
the<00:02:11.190> difference

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.170 

but<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.290> d700<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:17.980> feels<00:02:18.160> smoother<00:02:18.730> okay

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
but the d700 just feels smoother okay

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.750 
but the d700 just feels smoother okay
this<00:02:19.390> feels<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.750> little<00:02:19.870> clicky<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.770> little

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this feels a little clicky a little

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.170 
this feels a little clicky a little
looser<00:02:22.209> just<00:02:22.780> doesn't<00:02:23.410> feel<00:02:23.800> quite<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:24.610> solid

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
looser just doesn't feel quite as solid

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.890 
looser just doesn't feel quite as solid
as<00:02:25.630> my<00:02:26.530> d700<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.550> also<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.209> mean<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.660> little

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
as my d700 and also I mean just little

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.150 
as my d700 and also I mean just little
things<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.350> people<00:02:29.530> mind<00:02:30.180> here<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:36.069> me

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
things that people mind here that to me

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.890 
things that people mind here that to me
that<00:02:36.370> feels<00:02:36.550> cheap<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.270> open<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.810> you

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
that feels cheap you open that and you

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.530 
that feels cheap you open that and you
get<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:39.459> maybe<00:02:39.760> 700<00:02:42.300> did<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.390> hear

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
get that I maybe 700 did you hear

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.740 
get that I maybe 700 did you hear
anything<00:02:43.890> give<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.010> little<00:02:45.160> bit<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.660> mean<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
anything give it a little bit I mean the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.780 
anything give it a little bit I mean the
door<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.050> feels<00:02:47.319> more<00:02:47.470> solid<00:02:47.709> okay

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
door just feels more solid okay

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.539 
door just feels more solid okay
so<00:02:49.150> overall<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.930> feel<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.010> build<00:02:51.250> quality

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
so overall I feel like the build quality

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.710 
so overall I feel like the build quality
is<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.880> little<00:02:52.060> bit<00:02:52.150> better<00:02:52.299> than<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.540> older

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
is a little bit better than the older

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.710 
is a little bit better than the older

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
them side by side 1600 ISO and they both

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.930 
them side by side 1600 ISO and they both
look<00:04:12.819> very<00:04:13.090> good<00:04:13.239> let's<00:04:13.720> craft<00:04:14.260> these<00:04:14.410> in

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
look very good let's craft these in

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.370 
look very good let's craft these in
alright<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.630> looks<00:04:17.660> pretty<00:04:17.900> good<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.260> think

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
alright that looks pretty good I think

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.720 
alright that looks pretty good I think
the<00:04:18.590> color<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:18.980> a<00:04:19.010> little<00:04:19.070> bit<00:04:19.190> better<00:04:19.370> on<00:04:19.519> the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
the color is a little bit better on the

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.689 
the color is a little bit better on the
d800<00:04:20.389> as<00:04:21.019> far<00:04:21.230> as<00:04:21.320> noise<00:04:21.590> there's<00:04:22.100> not<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.520> whole

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
d800 as far as noise there's not a whole

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.430 
d800 as far as noise there's not a whole
lot<00:04:22.850> there<00:04:23.030> both<00:04:23.389> pictures<00:04:23.720> look<00:04:24.020> very<00:04:24.290> good

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
lot there both pictures look very good

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.219 
lot there both pictures look very good
and<00:04:24.680> sharpness<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.120> eye<00:04:26.240> is<00:04:26.479> very<00:04:26.990> good

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
and sharpness in that eye is very good

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.480 
and sharpness in that eye is very good
let's<00:04:28.130> go<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.340> 3200<00:04:29.300> ISO<00:04:29.560> both<00:04:30.560> cameras<00:04:31.130> side

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
let's go to 3200 ISO both cameras side

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.610 
let's go to 3200 ISO both cameras side
by<00:04:31.699> side<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:33.440> let's<00:04:33.830> zoom<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:35.440> here<00:04:36.440> we're

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
by side and let's zoom in here we're

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.060 
by side and let's zoom in here we're
starting<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:36.979> see<00:04:37.040> some<00:04:37.190> noise<00:04:37.870> on<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.729> d700<00:04:40.729> I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
starting to see some noise on the d700 I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.750 
starting to see some noise on the d700 I
think<00:04:43.070> a<00:04:43.190> little<00:04:43.580> more<00:04:43.760> noise<00:04:44.000> than<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.919> d800

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
think a little more noise than the d800

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.550 
think a little more noise than the d800
they<00:04:46.880> both<00:04:47.030> look<00:04:47.210> pretty<00:04:47.240> good<00:04:47.600> at<00:04:47.720> 3200<00:04:48.410> ISO

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
they both look pretty good at 3200 ISO

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.620 
they both look pretty good at 3200 ISO
they<00:04:48.979> both<00:04:49.130> look<00:04:49.310> very<00:04:49.340> good<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.820> can<00:04:50.330> see<00:04:50.540> on

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
they both look very good I can see on

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.680 
they both look very good I can see on
the<00:04:50.720> d700<00:04:51.350> we<00:04:51.470> are<00:04:51.590> starting<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.100> lose<00:04:52.250> quality

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
the d700 we are starting to lose quality

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.150 
the d700 we are starting to lose quality
but<00:04:53.690> again<00:04:54.290> that's<00:04:54.440> going<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.710> be<00:04:54.830> because<00:04:55.010> a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
but again that's going to be because a

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.420 
but again that's going to be because a
12.1<00:04:55.729> megapixel<00:04:56.419> sensor<00:04:56.750> compared<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.440> 36

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
12.1 megapixel sensor compared to a 36

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.030 
12.1 megapixel sensor compared to a 36
so<00:04:59.000> we're<00:04:59.120> going<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.270> start<00:04:59.680> losing<00:05:00.680> some

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
so we're going to start losing some

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.040 
so we're going to start losing some
sharpness<00:05:01.550> that<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:02.060> more<00:05:02.210> we<00:05:02.360> zoom<00:05:02.570> in<00:05:02.840> there

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
sharpness that the more we zoom in there

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.010 
sharpness that the more we zoom in there
but<00:05:03.830> overall<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.580> looks<00:05:04.790> pretty<00:05:05.000> good<00:05:05.150> let's

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
but overall that looks pretty good let's

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.620 
but overall that looks pretty good let's
move<00:05:06.440> on<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:08.139> 6400<00:05:09.139> ISO<00:05:10.300> side-by-side<00:05:11.300> there

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
move on to 6400 ISO side-by-side there

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.520 
move on to 6400 ISO side-by-side there
and<00:05:12.320> let's<00:05:13.220> zoom<00:05:13.789> in<00:05:14.030> this<00:05:15.020> is<00:05:15.080> where<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.410> think

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
and let's zoom in this is where I think

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.950 
and let's zoom in this is where I think
the<00:05:15.770> d800<00:05:16.580> really<00:05:17.000> gets<00:05:17.389> a<00:05:17.479> little<00:05:17.600> bit<00:05:17.810> better

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
the d800 really gets a little bit better

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.980 
the d800 really gets a little bit better
the<00:05:18.800> d700<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.580> see<00:05:19.970> a<00:05:20.000> lot<00:05:20.210> of<00:05:20.360> color<00:05:20.720> noise

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
the d700 I see a lot of color noise

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.850 
the d700 I see a lot of color noise
there<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.910> not<00:05:22.910> as<00:05:23.060> much<00:05:23.240> in<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.419> d800<00:05:24.110> around

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
there and not as much in the d800 around

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.830 
there and not as much in the d800 around
the<00:05:24.979> eyes<00:05:25.100> especially<00:05:25.340> on<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:25.970> d700<00:05:26.690> it's

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
the eyes especially on the d700 it's

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.050 
the eyes especially on the d700 it's
starting<00:05:27.169> to<00:05:27.229> get<00:05:27.320> kind<00:05:27.650> of<00:05:27.770> ugly<00:05:27.950> and<00:05:28.370> in<00:05:28.970> the

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
starting to get kind of ugly and in the

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.480 
starting to get kind of ugly and in the
d800<00:05:29.690> you're<00:05:30.110> holding<00:05:30.590> color<00:05:30.860> you're<00:05:31.190> holding

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
d800 you're holding color you're holding

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.100 
d800 you're holding color you're holding
sharpness<00:05:32.740> that's<00:05:33.740> really<00:05:34.430> good<00:05:34.610> for<00:05:35.110> 6400

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
sharpness that's really good for 6400

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.550 
sharpness that's really good for 6400
ISO<00:05:36.320> on<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:36.979> 36<00:05:37.580> megapixel<00:05:38.180> sensor<00:05:38.570> that's

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
ISO on a 36 megapixel sensor that's

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.339 
ISO on a 36 megapixel sensor that's
pretty<00:05:40.070> phenomenal<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:41.020> let's<00:05:42.020> zoom<00:05:42.050> in<00:05:42.320> a

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
pretty phenomenal and let's zoom in a

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.830 
pretty phenomenal and let's zoom in a
little<00:05:42.470> bit<00:05:42.620> more<00:05:42.860> let's<00:05:43.190> check<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.550> out<00:05:43.840> it's

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
little bit more let's check it out it's

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.830 
little bit more let's check it out it's
the<00:05:44.960> d700<00:05:45.590> on<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.740> left<00:05:45.889> hand<00:05:46.099> side<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.840> there

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
the d700 on the left hand side and there

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.120 
the d700 on the left hand side and there
is<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.020> lot<00:05:48.410> of<00:05:48.440> noise<00:05:48.770> there<00:05:48.919> are<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.010> lot<00:05:49.099> of

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
is a lot of noise there are a lot of

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.610 
is a lot of noise there are a lot of
color<00:05:49.370> noise<00:05:49.610> all<00:05:50.510> the<00:05:50.570> shadows<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:51.470> dark

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
color noise all the shadows and dark

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.800 
color noise all the shadows and dark
areas<00:05:52.010> look<00:05:52.190> really<00:05:52.970> bad<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:55.340> now<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:55.820> d800

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
areas look really bad and now the d800

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.020 
areas look really bad and now the d800
there<00:05:57.050> yeah<00:05:57.919> there's<00:05:58.160> a<00:05:58.250> lot<00:05:58.430> of<00:05:58.550> noise<00:05:58.700> there

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
there yeah there's a lot of noise there

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.180 
there yeah there's a lot of noise there
but<00:05:59.330> look<00:05:59.900> at<00:06:00.020> the<00:06:00.139> sharpness<00:06:00.500> on<00:06:00.770> that<00:06:00.979> thing

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
but look at the sharpness on that thing

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.219 
but look at the sharpness on that thing
those<00:06:01.370> 36<00:06:01.849> megapixels<00:06:02.150> make<00:06:02.720> a<00:06:02.750> big

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
those 36 megapixels make a big

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.150 
those 36 megapixels make a big
difference<00:06:03.910> at<00:06:04.910> 6400<00:06:05.780> ISO<00:06:05.900> with<00:06:06.680> a<00:06:06.710> little<00:06:07.039> bit

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
difference at 6400 ISO with a little bit

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.230 
difference at 6400 ISO with a little bit
of<00:06:07.310> smoothing<00:06:07.910> in<00:06:08.289> Photoshop<00:06:09.289> I<00:06:09.560> think<00:06:09.889> that

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
of smoothing in Photoshop I think that

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.360 
of smoothing in Photoshop I think that
the<00:06:11.240> 800<00:06:11.630> photo<00:06:11.930> is<00:06:12.260> very<00:06:12.440> useful<00:06:13.070> I<00:06:13.160> think

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
the 800 photo is very useful I think

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.610 
the 800 photo is very useful I think
it's<00:06:13.460> a<00:06:13.520> great<00:06:13.610> picture<00:06:13.900> so<00:06:14.900> just<00:06:15.169> to<00:06:15.320> sum<00:06:15.590> it

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
it's a great picture so just to sum it
