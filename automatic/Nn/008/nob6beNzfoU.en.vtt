awesome dude you actually already hinted
at<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> answer<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.350> question<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
at the answer in your question this is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.370 
at the answer in your question this is
making<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.720> feel<00:01:21.930> powerless

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
making you feel powerless

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.230 
making you feel powerless
that's<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.619> vibration<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.759> want<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that's the vibration that you want to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
that's the vibration that you want to
deal<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.450> sooner<00:01:28.110> rather<00:01:28.259> than<00:01:28.470> later<00:01:28.590> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
deal with sooner rather than later so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.649 
deal with sooner rather than later so
this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> coming<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.790> early<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.270> life<00:01:30.450> that's

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
this is coming up early in life that's

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
this is coming up early in life that's
actually<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.439> good<00:01:31.710> thing<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
actually a really good thing and the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.940 
actually a really good thing and the
reason<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.600> family<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> acting<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
reason that your family is acting the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
reason that your family is acting the
way<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.340> they<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.900> isn't<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.229> you're

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
way that they are isn't because you're

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
way that they are isn't because you're
not<00:01:37.470> focusing<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.400> positively<00:01:39.060> enough

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
not focusing on them positively enough

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.590 
not focusing on them positively enough
it's<00:01:39.900> because<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.560> holding<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.600> an

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it's because they are holding on to an

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
it's because they are holding on to an
even<00:01:42.810> stronger<00:01:43.439> version<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
even stronger version of this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.569 
even stronger version of this
powerlessness<00:01:45.180> they<00:01:46.049> feel<00:01:46.320> powerless<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
powerlessness they feel powerless to and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.080 
powerlessness they feel powerless to and
to<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> larger<00:01:48.600> degree<00:01:48.720> than<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
to a larger degree than you do and it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149 
to a larger degree than you do and it
feels<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.479> they're<00:01:51.689> wanting<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> pull<00:01:52.530> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
feels like they're wanting to pull you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.490 
feels like they're wanting to pull you
down<00:01:53.189> into<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.360> powerless<00:01:55.020> pit<00:01:55.320> while

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
down into that powerless pit while

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
down into that powerless pit while
you're<00:01:55.740> trying<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:56.939> to
