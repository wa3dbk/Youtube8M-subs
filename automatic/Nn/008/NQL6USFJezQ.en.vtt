00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
Valentin Serenata it's very rare for any

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.820 
Valentin Serenata it's very rare for any
college<00:04:54.060> or<00:04:54.360> school<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.930> be<00:04:55.080> able<00:04:55.169> to<00:04:55.290> learn

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
college or school to be able to learn

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.590 
college or school to be able to learn
Valentin's<00:04:56.340> pieces<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:57.030> then<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.150> have<00:04:57.419> the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
Valentin's pieces and then you have the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.950 
Valentin's pieces and then you have the
specific<00:04:58.140> Valentin<00:04:59.150> setters<00:05:00.150> who<00:05:00.330> come<00:05:00.570> in

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
specific Valentin setters who come in

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.749 
specific Valentin setters who come in
and<00:05:02.229> they<00:05:02.320> expect<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.800> lot<00:05:02.830> out<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.250> you<00:05:03.370> because

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
and they expect a lot out of you because

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.120 
and they expect a lot out of you because
the<00:05:03.850> bouncing<00:05:04.270> technique<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.990> one<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:05.800> itself

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
the bouncing technique is one in itself

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.770 
the bouncing technique is one in itself
and<00:05:06.520> so<00:05:06.639> you<00:05:06.729> kind<00:05:06.970> of<00:05:07.000> have<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.240> attack<00:05:07.570> to

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.980 
and so you kind of have to attack to
that<00:05:08.050> sometimes<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.949> big<00:05:09.729> challenge<00:05:10.030> but<00:05:10.479> it

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990
