00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
become a smooth motion you'll from one

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.170 
become a smooth motion you'll from one
side<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.550> other

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.390 

let's<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.330> better<00:02:49.080> started<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.830> open<00:02:49.920> up

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
let's go better started to open up

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.550 
let's go better started to open up
oh<00:02:50.430> yeah<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:52.050> if<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.410> this

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
oh yeah and then if you do this

oh yeah and then if you do this
consistently<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> couple<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.790> weeks<00:02:53.850> it'll

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
consistently for a couple of weeks it'll

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.340 
consistently for a couple of weeks it'll
make<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:54.930> amazing<00:02:55.710> different<00:02:57.350> everybody

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
make it just amazing different everybody

make it just amazing different everybody
do<00:02:58.530> windshield<00:02:59.010> wipers<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:13.290> but<00:03:13.830> raises

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
do windshield wipers do but raises

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:24.530 
do windshield wipers do but raises
basically<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.760> then<00:03:23.910> do<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.120> push<00:03:24.360> your

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
yes exactly open some strings yeah ten

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.550 
yes exactly open some strings yeah ten
fifteen<00:03:53.610> usually<00:03:54.060> people<00:03:55.050> do<00:03:55.170> these<00:03:55.380> as

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
fifteen usually people do these as

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.290 
fifteen usually people do these as
static<00:03:56.040> stretches<00:03:56.460> all<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.700> time<00:03:56.910> but<00:03:57.120> there

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
static stretches all the time but there

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.360 
static stretches all the time but there
are<00:03:57.390> reasons<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.990> avoid<00:03:58.110> static<00:03:58.770> stretching

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.650 

the<00:04:02.370> static<00:04:02.790> stretch<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:04.220> pardon<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.660> explain

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
the static stretch is pardon and explain

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.360 
the static stretch is pardon and explain
the<00:04:06.780> static<00:04:07.170> so<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.350> static<00:04:07.830> stretch<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.220> where

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
the static so a static stretch is where

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.190 
the static so a static stretch is where
someone<00:04:08.610> stretches<00:04:09.210> out<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> muscle<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.840> holds

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
someone stretches out a muscle and holds

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:21.350 
someone stretches out a muscle and holds
it<00:04:10.320> there

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.850 

well<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.420> can<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.810> often<00:04:23.260> do<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.410> separately

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
well I can I often do that separately

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.610 
well I can I often do that separately
focusing<00:04:24.820> on<00:04:24.970> again<00:04:25.660> activating<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.320> hip<00:04:26.470> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
focusing on again activating the hip to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.120 
focusing on again activating the hip to
pull<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:27.070> knees<00:04:27.250> out<00:04:28.410> what<00:04:29.410> you're<00:04:29.590> doing<00:04:29.620> now

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
pull the knees out what you're doing now

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.000 
pull the knees out what you're doing now
is<00:04:30.600> fully<00:04:31.600> shortening<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.350> glue<00:04:32.560> that's<00:04:32.890> an

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
is fully shortening the glue that's an

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.730 
is fully shortening the glue that's an
activation<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.900> that<00:04:35.050> when<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.170> go<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.560> do

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
activation so that when I go and do

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.830 
activation so that when I go and do
spots<00:04:36.130> my<00:04:36.370> glutes<00:04:36.640> are<00:04:36.790> firing<00:04:36.850> correctly<00:04:37.630> so

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
spots my glutes are firing correctly so

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.680 
spots my glutes are firing correctly so
for<00:04:38.050> me<00:04:38.280> for<00:04:39.280> whatever<00:04:39.460> reason<00:04:39.970> my<00:04:40.000> left<00:04:40.390> blue

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
for me for whatever reason my left blue

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.130 
for me for whatever reason my left blue
typically<00:04:41.380> doesn't<00:04:41.650> fire<00:04:42.180> correctly<00:04:43.180> and

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
typically doesn't fire correctly and

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.900 
typically doesn't fire correctly and
that's<00:04:44.470> obviously<00:04:44.890> problematic<00:04:45.340> for<00:04:45.640> squats

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
that's obviously problematic for squats

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.780 
that's obviously problematic for squats
in<00:04:46.090> terms<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.419> safety<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:47.590> it<00:04:47.740> makes<00:04:47.919> if<00:04:48.610> your

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
in terms of safety and it makes if your

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.130 
in terms of safety and it makes if your
glute<00:04:49.030> isn't<00:04:49.330> firing<00:04:49.540> you're<00:04:49.810> not<00:04:49.930> gonna<00:04:50.050> be

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
glute isn't firing you're not gonna be

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.630 
glute isn't firing you're not gonna be
able<00:04:50.200> to<00:04:50.290> move<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:51.070> same<00:04:51.250> amount<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.490> weight

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
able to move the same amount of weight

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.330 
able to move the same amount of weight
show<00:04:52.600> us<00:04:52.720> how<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.900> do<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.050> real<00:04:53.350> quick<00:04:53.470> right<00:04:53.950> so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
show us how to do it real quick right so

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.230 
show us how to do it real quick right so
you<00:04:55.240> can<00:04:55.390> do<00:04:55.540> this<00:04:55.720> with<00:04:56.020> any<00:04:56.770> muscle<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:58.060> just

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
you can do this with any muscle you just

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.220 
you can do this with any muscle you just
need<00:04:58.390> to<00:04:58.510> know<00:04:58.630> how<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.840> fully<00:04:59.110> shorten<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.680> so

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
need to know how to fully shorten it so

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.110 
need to know how to fully shorten it so
you<00:05:02.230> want<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:02.590> drive<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.310> leg<00:05:03.520> back<00:05:03.760> yeah

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
you want to just drive the leg back yeah

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.400 
you want to just drive the leg back yeah
so<00:05:04.630> I'll<00:05:04.720> do<00:05:04.840> my<00:05:04.930> left<00:05:05.140> glute<00:05:05.260> again<00:05:07.410> squeezing

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
so I'll do my left glute again squeezing

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:21.840 
so I'll do my left glute again squeezing
the<00:05:08.680> glute<00:05:08.890> and<00:05:19.740> then<00:05:20.740> from<00:05:20.950> here<00:05:21.130> on<00:05:21.310> out<00:05:21.460> this

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
the glute and then from here on out this

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.670 
the glute and then from here on out this
glute<00:05:22.210> aspiring<00:05:24.030> so<00:05:25.030> here's<00:05:25.210> basically<00:05:25.690> yeah

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
glute aspiring so here's basically yeah
