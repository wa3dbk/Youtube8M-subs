hey folks after all things show calm and
here's<00:00:03.510> an<00:00:03.689> example<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.350> sort<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.279> what

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
here's an example of sort of what

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.099 
here's an example of sort of what
happens<00:00:05.759> when<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.899> patient

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
happens when you have a patient

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.190 
happens when you have a patient
presenting<00:00:07.589> with<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.740> fractured<00:00:08.429> clasp<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:10.139> a

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
presenting with a fractured clasp on a

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.310 
presenting with a fractured clasp on a
relatively<00:00:10.980> new<00:00:11.660> rule<00:00:12.660> dental<00:00:13.049> prosthesis

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
relatively new rule dental prosthesis

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.300 
relatively new rule dental prosthesis
and<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.889> don't<00:00:14.070> intend<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
and you don't intend to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.279 
and you don't intend to
refabricate<00:00:17.310> relying<00:00:17.699> etc<00:00:18.180> etc<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.230> this

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
refabricate relying etc etc so in this

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.260 
refabricate relying etc etc so in this
case<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.619> already<00:00:19.880> established<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.119> had

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
case we already established that we had

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330 
case we already established that we had
stability<00:00:21.510> then<00:00:22.500> patient<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:22.890> satisfied

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
stability then patient was satisfied

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.939 
stability then patient was satisfied
with<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.580> mandibular<00:00:24.300> denture<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.769> went

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
with this mandibular denture so we went

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.519 
with this mandibular denture so we went
ahead<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.189> elected<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.080> just<00:00:28.080> give<00:00:28.260> him<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> new

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
ahead and elected to just give him a new

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.050 
ahead and elected to just give him a new
rot<00:00:28.740> wire<00:00:28.920> clasp<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.429> his<00:00:29.580> right<00:00:29.760> side<00:00:29.789> you

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
rot wire clasp on his right side you

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.900 
rot wire clasp on his right side you
could<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.210> here's<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.109> rot<00:00:31.529> wire<00:00:31.730> left<00:00:32.730> side

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
could see here's the rot wire left side

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.420 
could see here's the rot wire left side
you<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.120> here's<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.630> nub<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.430> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
you can see here's the little nub of the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.810 
you can see here's the little nub of the
fractured<00:00:35.910> wire<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:40.129> in<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> next<00:00:41.489> picture

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
fractured wire so in the next picture

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.389 
fractured wire so in the next picture
here<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.860> he<00:00:43.950> fractured

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
here you can see more so he fractured

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.880 
here you can see more so he fractured
off<00:00:44.550> we're<00:00:44.760> gonna<00:00:44.879> repair<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
off we're gonna repair so here it is

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.479 
off we're gonna repair so here it is
extra<00:00:47.160> orally<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.690> again<00:00:49.489> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
extra orally you can see again the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
extra orally you can see again the
fracture<00:00:50.879> wire<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> first<00:00:51.539> thing<00:00:51.660> we're

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
fracture wire so the first thing we're

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.590 
fracture wire so the first thing we're
gonna<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.730> like<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> said<00:00:53.850> established<00:00:54.480> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
gonna do is like I said established that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.090 
gonna do is like I said established that
we<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.780> stability<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.739> once<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.010> have

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
we have stability so once we have

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
we have stability so once we have
stability<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.579> good<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> go

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
stability are good to go

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
stability are good to go
this<00:00:57.960> denture<00:00:58.230> was<00:00:58.350> posing<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.070> max<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this denture was posing a max or a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.330 
this denture was posing a max or a
complete<00:00:59.850> denture<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.770> fit<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
complete denture so we're going to fit a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.609 
complete denture so we're going to fit a
tray<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.300> took<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> partial<00:01:04.350> denture

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
tray so I just took the partial denture

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
tray so I just took the partial denture
fit<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> elder<00:01:05.610> tree<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> make

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
fit it into the elder tree just to make

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.170 
fit it into the elder tree just to make
sure<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.770> had<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.920> right<00:01:08.100> size<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
sure that we had the right size and you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230 
sure that we had the right size and you
fit<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.479> into<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> patient<00:01:10.140> also<00:01:11.240> place

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
fit this into the patient also place

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.020 
fit this into the patient also place
your<00:01:12.479> alginate<00:01:13.380> adhesive<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.250> make<00:01:14.909> your

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
your alginate adhesive and make your

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
your alginate adhesive and make your
pickup<00:01:15.330> impression<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:18.229> things<00:01:19.229> were<00:01:19.380> looking

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
pickup impression so things were looking

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.690 
pickup impression so things were looking
for<00:01:19.770> make<00:01:20.009> sure<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:22.490> partial<00:01:23.490> denture

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
for make sure that the partial denture

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.560 
for make sure that the partial denture
is<00:01:23.759> fully<00:01:24.000> seated<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.130> it's<00:01:26.130> fully<00:01:26.700> seated<00:01:26.939> on

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
is fully seated and it's fully seated on

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.149 
is fully seated and it's fully seated on
the<00:01:27.780> teeth<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.770> when<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the teeth and then when you take the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
the teeth and then when you take the
impression<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.520 
types treated ice types tree stone
surveyed<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.729> did<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> quick<00:01:39.810> survey<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
surveyed it did a quick survey just to

surveyed it did a quick survey just to
see<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> height<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.130> contours<00:01:41.579> based<00:01:41.970> on

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
see what the height of contours based on

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
see what the height of contours based on
the<00:01:42.360> existing<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.409> here's<00:01:44.009> sort<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> line

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the existing and here's sort of the line

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.460

where<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.000> want<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.939> class<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.869> so

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
where we want the the class to go so

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.660 
where we want the the class to go so
based<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.579> went<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.090> lab<00:01:51.420> and

based on that we went to the lab and
destroyed<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.000> attention<00:01:54.869> tooth<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.979> intent

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
destroyed the attention tooth the intent

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.690 
destroyed the attention tooth the intent
was<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> flick<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.880> off<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:59.520> to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.139 
off and it was an egg hunt throughout
the<00:02:04.439> lab<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.009> gave<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.549> we're

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the lab so we just gave up and we're

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.789 
the lab so we just gave up and we're
gonna<00:02:06.240> place<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> new<00:02:06.780> denture<00:02:07.409> tooth<00:02:07.560> so

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
gonna place a new denture tooth so

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.979 
gonna place a new denture tooth so
remove<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.110> access<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.599> ability<00:02:12.599> to

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
remove that to get access to ability to

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.410 
remove that to get access to ability to
embed

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
embed

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.680 
embed
this<00:02:15.420> new<00:02:15.900> wrought<00:02:16.110> wire<00:02:16.349> into<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.690> existing

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
this new wrought wire into the existing

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.860 
this new wrought wire into the existing
acrylic<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.030> did<00:02:21.180> what<00:02:21.480> he<00:02:21.569> did<00:02:21.599> also

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
acrylic so what we did what he did also

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.899 
acrylic so what we did what he did also
was<00:02:22.140> from<00:02:22.319> cut<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.799> nub<00:02:23.099> off<00:02:23.280> right<00:02:23.640> about

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
was from cut this nub off right about

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.619 
was from cut this nub off right about
here<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:25.099> Cyprian<00:02:26.099> disc<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:27.360> give<00:02:27.540> him

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
here with a Cyprian disc to give him

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.570 
here with a Cyprian disc to give him
room<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.680> new<00:02:28.799> wire<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.370> come

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
room for that for the new wire to come

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.050 
room for that for the new wire to come
through<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.090> he<00:02:30.750> bent<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.049> wire<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.879> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
through so he bent the wire and this is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.180 
through so he bent the wire and this is
what<00:02:33.209> he's<00:02:33.329> going<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.690> place<00:02:33.989> these<00:02:34.950> are<00:02:35.099> some

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
what he's going to place these are some

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.530 
what he's going to place these are some
of<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> instrumentation<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.970> he<00:02:36.180> has

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.539 

essentially<00:02:39.540> what<00:02:39.720> he<00:02:39.780> did<00:02:39.900> was<00:02:40.049> he<00:02:40.430> bent<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
essentially what he did was he bent the

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.020 
essentially what he did was he bent the
wire<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.450> he<00:02:42.540> wanted<00:02:43.700> held<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.819> in<00:02:45.000> place

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
wire to what he wanted held it in place

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.170 
wire to what he wanted held it in place
with<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> little<00:02:45.510> bit<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.840> wax<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.849> then<00:02:47.849> we

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
with a little bit of wax and then we

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.119 
with a little bit of wax and then we
crazy<00:02:48.480> glued<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.959> he<00:02:49.319> wanted<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.650> use<00:02:49.769> ortho

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
crazy glued it he wanted to use ortho

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.300 
crazy glued it he wanted to use ortho
acrylic<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.390> didn't<00:02:51.720> work

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
acrylic but it just didn't work

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.830 
acrylic but it just didn't work
suggest<00:02:53.310> us<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.700> use<00:02:53.879> Krazy<00:02:54.120> Glue<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:54.569> Krazy

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
suggest us just use Krazy Glue so Krazy

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.949 
suggest us just use Krazy Glue so Krazy
glued<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.290> place<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.120> buccal

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
glued it in place here on the buccal

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.180 
glued it in place here on the buccal
surface<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.030> canine<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.209> then<00:03:01.190> removed

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
surface of the canine and then removed

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.979 
surface of the canine and then removed
all<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.489> wax<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:03.269> started<00:03:03.569> embedding

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
all the wax and then started embedding

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.869 
all the wax and then started embedding
with<00:03:04.500> acrylic<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.400> see<00:03:05.579> here

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
with acrylic so you can see here

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.180 
with acrylic so you can see here
starting<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> embed<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.349> trying<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.680> match<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
starting to embed it trying to match the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.920 
starting to embed it trying to match the
acrylic<00:03:08.579> colors<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.480> one's<00:03:09.629> just<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.900> little

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
acrylic colors so one's just a little

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.349 
acrylic colors so one's just a little
bit<00:03:10.230> light<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:13.829> rot<00:03:14.159> wire<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:14.909> glued

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
bit light so the rot wire is now glued

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.300 
bit light so the rot wire is now glued
to<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.900> buckle<00:03:16.440> portion<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.099> tooth

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
to the buckle portion of the tooth

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.849 
to the buckle portion of the tooth
removed<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.030> wax<00:03:18.299> here<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:19.440> held<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.769> in

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
removed the wax here that held it in

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.330 
removed the wax here that held it in
place<00:03:19.889> for<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.389> be<00:03:21.540> glued<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:22.190> now<00:03:23.190> we're

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
place for it to be glued in now we're

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.530 
place for it to be glued in now we're
going<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.639> start<00:03:24.859> embedding<00:03:25.859> with<00:03:26.329> resin<00:03:27.329> and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
going to start embedding with resin and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.900 
going to start embedding with resin and
now<00:03:27.900> he's<00:03:28.260> got<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.739> tooth<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:29.609> figured

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
now he's got the tooth that we figured

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.210 
now he's got the tooth that we figured
out<00:03:30.049> we<00:03:31.049> used<00:03:31.260> monoplane<00:03:31.739> occlusion

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
out we used monoplane occlusion

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.890 
out we used monoplane occlusion
legalised<00:03:32.609> monoplane<00:03:33.180> occlusion<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:33.780> we'll

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
legalised monoplane occlusion so we'll

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.530 
legalised monoplane occlusion so we'll
make<00:03:33.989> sure<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.349> we're<00:03:35.220> flat<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.639> that<00:03:35.849> you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
make sure that we're flat like that you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.659 
make sure that we're flat like that you
can<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:36.810> there's<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.950> little<00:03:38.400> bit<00:03:38.549> of

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
can see there's just a little bit of

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:44.210 
can see there's just a little bit of
difference<00:03:39.169> between<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.940> shade<00:03:42.949> they<00:03:43.949> place

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
difference between the shade they place

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.470 
difference between the shade they place
in<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.459> pressure<00:03:44.699> pot<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:46.410> let<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.650> cure<00:03:46.919> and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
in a pressure pot to let it cure and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.349 
in a pressure pot to let it cure and
then<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.099> out<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.489> pressure<00:03:50.699> pot<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
then this is out of the pressure pot and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.259 
then this is out of the pressure pot and
partially<00:03:51.959> finished<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.549> can<00:03:53.790> see<00:03:54.060> now

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
partially finished so you can see now

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.860 
partially finished so you can see now
we've<00:03:54.449> got<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.780> acrylic<00:03:55.970> tooth<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.750> new

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
we've got the acrylic tooth and the new

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.150 
we've got the acrylic tooth and the new
runt<00:03:58.109> wire<00:03:59.060> there's<00:04:00.060> another<00:04:00.239> shot<00:04:00.629> so<00:04:01.160> after

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
runt wire there's another shot so after

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.580 
runt wire there's another shot so after
some<00:04:02.370> reduction<00:04:02.940> smoothing<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:03.720> out<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:04.440> is

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
some reduction smoothing it out this is

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.000 
some reduction smoothing it out this is
it<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.069> like<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.120> had<00:04:06.419> like<00:04:06.690> dr.<00:04:07.290> Dre<00:04:07.410> suggested

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
it so like I had like dr. Dre suggested

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.470 
it so like I had like dr. Dre suggested
it's<00:04:08.129> they<00:04:08.400> usually<00:04:08.579> place<00:04:08.910> him<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.359> bit

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it's they usually place him a little bit

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.990 
it's they usually place him a little bit
high<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.500> he<00:04:10.590> just<00:04:10.739> needed<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.160> bend<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.549> in<00:04:11.699> I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
high so he just needed to bend it in I
