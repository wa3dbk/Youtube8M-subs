00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.420
 originally from the Canary Islands the cineraria 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.179
 It is a beautiful and very decorative plant 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.139
 that stands out for its abundant 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.999
 inflorescences of different colors 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.999
 that resemble daisies 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.829
 money this plant is native to 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.800
 the Canary Islands its scientific name 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:33.850
 It is stubbornly stupid belongs to the family 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.820
 of the composers this plant is more or 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.089
 less than about 20 to 40 centimeters is a 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.620
 plant that lasts its flowering 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.750
 about a year as long as 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.220
 have good management has a stem 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.110
 Central and South are never scattered 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.540
 to have a good flowering 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.149
 requires that it has good light but never 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.879
 must be direct always to be in 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.660
 Semi shade or shade we find it 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.760
 white color pink blue and violet 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.429
 I repeat we are clear that it is of use 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.679
 inside its leaves are soft colored 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:11.679
 green your leaf shape that hunch 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:14.200
 and we found some little essences 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.960
 that is normal in them but they are not very 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.600
 ductile can not withstand frost 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.460
 it behaves better in average climate and requires 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.409
 of good ventilation the greatest 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.740
 characteristic of this plant is its 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.970
 flowering a flowering 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.930
 and colorful and the flowers are smaller 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.930
 that a daisy 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.420
 to plant the cnr area 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.310
 we need cineraria seeds 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.329
 compost that is composed of manure 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.289
 of cow husk hen and lime bag 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.289
 or vessel 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.420
 the propagation of the cnr arias is done 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.460
 by means of seeds it is important 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.310
 acquire in a location other than the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.430
 can certify we must also have 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.160
 with a greenhouse to regulate the 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.810
 Watering temperature and light 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.820
 substrates that we must use for 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.000
 sowing of the seeds should be very 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.150
 permeable we can use peat cisco 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.300
 sand or coal there we sow 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.150
 we the little seed here remain 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.430
 around two months to then to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.680
 third month to be transplanted to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.780
 bags after the plants have 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.480
 stayed for three months in the place 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.170
 of germination and have a size 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.380
 We are going to transplant them 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.890
 have a very permeable soil two 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.580
 earth parts two parts of cisco 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.800
 rice and a part of organic matter at 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.230
 transplant of the cash I recommend 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.300
 do a watering with water hopefully we can 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.480
 append some product that has been 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.740
 rooted in order and accelerate its 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.520
 increase 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.940
 and then we are going to plant the materials 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.940
 plastic 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.890
 the ph is a very characteristic 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.590
 important that all lands have 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.220
 the substrates for planter pots 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.230
 etcetera and the irrigation waters the ph is 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.890
 express with a number and you can be 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.520
 between 1 and 14 but in 99% 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.920
 of the cases will be between 3 and 9 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.340
 so if we say this soil has a 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.490
 ph 6 means that it is acid or this soil 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.580
 has a ph 82 means that it is basic or 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.160
 alkaline the neutral ph although it is indicated 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.330
 7 as a theoretical value is usually 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.950
 consider neutral if it is between 6 5 and 7 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.330
 the best ph for most of the 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.700
 plants ranges between 6 5 and 7 that is 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.340
 neutral some calls acid rows what 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.010
 prefer less than 6 and others calcic 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.010
 they are happy with a ph higher than 7 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.210
 the money is very demanding in 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.610
 maintenance when they are going to grow 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.910
 on a large scale I recommend the advice of 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.180
 an agronomist when it is small scale 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.660
 at least take into account cultivate them 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.870
 in the shade or semi shade never water 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.530
 the leaves and yes less the flowers 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.940
 make watering every other day prunings 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.150
 remove leaves and flowers 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.139
 impaired perform fertilization 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.630
 Foliar every 20 days and granulate every month 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.539
 this plant is very susceptible to pests 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.660
 and diseases can catch almost all 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.940
 those existing in a greenhouse between 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.310
 the main pests the aphid the 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.530
 whitefly illuminators between 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.870
 diseases the main botrytis 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.539
 that's why I recommend the advice of a 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.180
 agronomist with the purpose of a plan 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.630
 preventive or curative in case 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.630
 exist 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.800
 the subject of plant nutrition is very 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.169
 important the plants need 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.750
 essential elements to live and those 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.500
 they take mainly from the ground these are 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.710
 the three most important elements 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:40.590
 micronutrients nitrogen phosphorus 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:45.780
 potassium calcium magnesium sulfur iron 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.820
 zinc manganese boron copper molybdenum 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.740
 chlorine the macronutrients absorb 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.690
 in large quantities while the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.180
 micronutrients do so in lower 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.270
 proportion equally are both 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.270
 required 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.300
 the cineraria is a very striking plant 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.310
 and ornamental that in any of its 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.710
 fluorescence like white pink purple 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.199
 or red is ideal to decorate our 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.150
 home so we come to the end of the subject of 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.430
 today we hope you have spent a while 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.289
 nice and learned from the different 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.690
 sections we invite you to tell us 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:21.470
 accompany in an upcoming issue in the 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.470
 garden of your house
