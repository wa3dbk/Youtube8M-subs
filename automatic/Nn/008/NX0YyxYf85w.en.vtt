00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.689 

you

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:15.699 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.550 

that's<00:00:16.699> a<00:00:16.970> really<00:00:17.480> important<00:00:17.960> question<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.500> I

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
that's a really important question and I

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.320 
that's a really important question and I
think<00:00:18.590> there's<00:00:19.160> a<00:00:19.250> Chinese<00:00:19.699> proverb<00:00:20.029> that

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
think there's a Chinese proverb that

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.650 
think there's a Chinese proverb that
gives<00:00:20.810> us<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:21.259> answer<00:00:21.619> to<00:00:21.860> that<00:00:22.039> is<00:00:22.279> is<00:00:23.000> that<00:00:23.420> a

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
gives us the answer to that is is that a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.630 
gives us the answer to that is is that a
person<00:00:23.900> is<00:00:24.320> rich<00:00:24.740> when<00:00:25.009> they<00:00:25.130> know<00:00:25.369> they<00:00:25.610> have

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
person is rich when they know they have

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.870 
person is rich when they know they have
enough<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.390> what<00:00:27.320> really<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:27.980> sad<00:00:28.310> tragedy

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
enough and what really is a sad tragedy

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.939 
enough and what really is a sad tragedy
that<00:00:29.000> played<00:00:29.480> out<00:00:29.509> over<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:30.140> last<00:00:30.380> year<00:00:30.770> or<00:00:30.800> so

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
that played out over the last year or so

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.569 
that played out over the last year or so
is<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.700> a<00:00:31.880> lot<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.360> very<00:00:32.570> wealthy<00:00:32.899> people<00:00:33.739> so

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
is that a lot of very wealthy people so

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.549 
is that a lot of very wealthy people so
a<00:00:34.610> lot<00:00:34.910> of<00:00:34.940> their<00:00:35.270> wealth<00:00:35.530> deteriorate<00:00:36.530> or

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
a lot of their wealth deteriorate or

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.190 
a lot of their wealth deteriorate or
disappear<00:00:37.430> because<00:00:37.879> they<00:00:38.210> didn't<00:00:38.600> answer

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
disappear because they didn't answer

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.740 
disappear because they didn't answer
that<00:00:39.440> question<00:00:40.010> for<00:00:40.040> themselves<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:40.910> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
that question for themselves and the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.930 
that question for themselves and the
best<00:00:41.989> way<00:00:42.170> I<00:00:42.200> can<00:00:42.410> illustrate<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:43.219> point<00:00:43.640> is

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
best way I can illustrate that point is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.170 
best way I can illustrate that point is
to<00:00:44.420> relate<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.719> story<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.309> trip<00:00:46.700> I<00:00:46.850> took<00:00:46.910> to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
to relate a story of a trip I took to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.639 
to relate a story of a trip I took to
Minnesota<00:00:47.899> in<00:00:48.489> 2002<00:00:49.899> during<00:00:50.899> that<00:00:51.050> trip<00:00:51.289> I<00:00:51.469> met

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
Minnesota in 2002 during that trip I met

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.160 
Minnesota in 2002 during that trip I met
with<00:00:51.859> a<00:00:51.890> 71<00:00:52.550> year<00:00:52.579> old<00:00:52.789> couple<00:00:53.359> who<00:00:53.569> had<00:00:53.839> at<00:00:54.079> the

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
with a 71 year old couple who had at the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.079 
with a 71 year old couple who had at the
time<00:00:54.199> three<00:00:54.829> million<00:00:55.159> dollars<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:55.670> obviously

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
time three million dollars so obviously

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.489 
time three million dollars so obviously
they<00:00:56.359> were<00:00:56.420> doing<00:00:56.780> better<00:00:57.109> than<00:00:57.350> about

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
they were doing better than about

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.619 
they were doing better than about
ninety-nine<00:00:58.280> point<00:00:58.760> nine<00:00:58.909> percent<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.569> the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
ninety-nine point nine percent of the

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.290 
ninety-nine point nine percent of the
population<00:01:00.760> unfortunately<00:01:01.760> three<00:01:02.059> years

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
population unfortunately three years

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.049 
population unfortunately three years
earlier<00:01:02.749> they<00:01:03.019> had<00:01:03.050> 13<00:01:03.679> million<00:01:03.920> dollars<00:01:04.430> now

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
earlier they had 13 million dollars now

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.610 
earlier they had 13 million dollars now
it's<00:01:05.239> obvious<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.020> only<00:01:06.170> way<00:01:06.409> they

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
it's obvious that the only way they

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.350 
it's obvious that the only way they
could<00:01:06.680> have<00:01:06.830> lost<00:01:07.159> that<00:01:07.400> much<00:01:07.640> money<00:01:07.880> as<00:01:08.060> if

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
could have lost that much money as if

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.910 
could have lost that much money as if
they<00:01:08.510> had<00:01:08.720> basically<00:01:09.080> in<00:01:09.320> oil<00:01:09.530> equity

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
they had basically in oil equity

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.190 
they had basically in oil equity
portfolio<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.850> not<00:01:11.300> only<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:11.750> was

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
portfolio and not only that but was

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.410 
portfolio and not only that but was
loaded<00:01:12.680> up<00:01:13.030> concentrated<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.210> high

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
loaded up concentrated in high

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.020 
loaded up concentrated in high
technology<00:01:14.750> stocks<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.370> asked<00:01:16.640> them<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
technology stocks so I asked them the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.380 
technology stocks so I asked them the
question<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.430> had<00:01:20.120> been<00:01:20.150> an

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
question that if that had been an

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.870 
question that if that had been an
alternative<00:01:21.350> universe<00:01:21.560> had<00:01:22.100> shown<00:01:22.340> up<00:01:22.370> to<00:01:22.730> use

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
alternative universe had shown up to use

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.660 
alternative universe had shown up to use
a<00:01:22.910> saw<00:01:23.240> tractor<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.020> instead<00:01:24.860> of<00:01:24.890> watching

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
a saw tractor and instead of watching

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.330 
a saw tractor and instead of watching
their<00:01:25.820> portfolio<00:01:26.480> deterioration<00:01:27.380> 13<00:01:27.950> 23

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
their portfolio deterioration 13 23

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.370 
their portfolio deterioration 13 23
million<00:01:28.670> they<00:01:29.300> had<00:01:29.420> actually<00:01:29.810> doubled<00:01:30.230> their

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
million they had actually doubled their

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.120 
million they had actually doubled their
money<00:01:30.410> from<00:01:30.980> 13<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.580> 26<00:01:32.740> would<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.920> have

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
money from 13 to 26 would that have

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.010 
money from 13 to 26 would that have
changed<00:01:34.160> their<00:01:34.670> life<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.120> any<00:01:35.270> meaningful<00:01:35.630> way

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
changed their life in any meaningful way

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.190 
changed their life in any meaningful way
and<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.950> response<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.610> got<00:01:37.640> was<00:01:37.880> no<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.690> then<00:01:39.170> I

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
and the response I got was no and then I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.530 
and the response I got was no and then I
asked<00:01:39.710> them<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.950> question<00:01:39.980> well<00:01:40.490> since<00:01:41.210> the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
asked them the question well since the

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.870 
asked them the question well since the
value<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.440> upside<00:01:42.830> potential<00:01:43.310> was<00:01:43.670> worth

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
value of the upside potential was worth

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.960 
value of the upside potential was worth
very<00:01:44.180> little<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.050> and<00:01:45.280> obviously<00:01:46.280> i<00:01:46.550> can

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
very little to you and obviously i can

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.820 
very little to you and obviously i can
assume<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.540> pain<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.260> last<00:01:48.470> three<00:01:48.620> years

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
assume the pain of the last three years

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.000 
assume the pain of the last three years
was<00:01:49.360> literally<00:01:50.360> unbearable<00:01:51.110> as<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.770> watch

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
was literally unbearable as you watch

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.370 
was literally unbearable as you watch
that<00:01:52.040> money<00:01:52.880> deteriorate<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.780> lost<00:01:54.080> sleep

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
that money deteriorate you lost sleep

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.790 
that money deteriorate you lost sleep
you<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:54.860> probably<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:56.000> no<00:01:56.150> longer<00:01:56.590> put<00:01:57.590> your

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
you now probably can no longer put your

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.560 
you now probably can no longer put your
grandkids<00:01:58.490> through<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.730> Harvard<00:01:59.120> education

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
grandkids through a Harvard education

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.780 
grandkids through a Harvard education
you<00:01:59.900> can't<00:02:00.140> leave<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.380> large<00:02:00.770> donation<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
you can't leave a large donation to the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.510 
you can't leave a large donation to the
church<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.230> couple<00:02:03.440> wanted<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.070> do<00:02:04.250> and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
church that this couple wanted to do and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.310 
church that this couple wanted to do and
they<00:02:04.910> would<00:02:05.060> obviously<00:02:05.330> have<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.660> cut<00:02:05.840> back<00:02:05.870> on

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
they would obviously have to cut back on

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.460 
they would obviously have to cut back on
certain<00:02:06.530> expenditures<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.810> asked<00:02:09.050> them<00:02:09.259> why

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
certain expenditures so I asked them why

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.309 
certain expenditures so I asked them why
did<00:02:09.709> they<00:02:09.830> take<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.280> risk<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:11.050> they<00:02:12.050> had<00:02:12.200> to

to<00:03:24.319> be<00:03:24.590> wrong<00:03:24.799> you're<00:03:25.400> damned<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.969> burn<00:03:26.180> in

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
to be wrong you're damned to burn in

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.929 
hell for eternity and the consequences
there<00:03:29.090> are<00:03:29.359> two<00:03:29.599> great<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.049> contemplate<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
there are two great to contemplate and

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.119 
there are two great to contemplate and
therefore<00:03:31.939> you<00:03:32.419> should<00:03:32.689> act<00:03:33.019> as<00:03:33.349> if<00:03:33.769> there<00:03:33.979> is

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
therefore you should act as if there is

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.979 
therefore you should act as if there is
a<00:03:34.159> God<00:03:34.489> whether<00:03:34.849> you<00:03:35.000> believe<00:03:35.359> there<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.750> one

a God whether you believe there is one

a God whether you believe there is one
or<00:03:36.199> not<00:03:36.409> because<00:03:36.949> you<00:03:37.250> could<00:03:37.459> be<00:03:37.639> wrong<00:03:37.849> the

or not because you could be wrong the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.000 
or not because you could be wrong the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
same thing is true when it comes to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.789

the worst thing that happened is they

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.050 
the worst thing that happened is they
