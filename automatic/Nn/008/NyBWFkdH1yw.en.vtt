for new generations it's really

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.340 
for new generations it's really

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
important to have cultural icons that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
speak to that legacy was the original

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.890 
speak to that legacy was the original
