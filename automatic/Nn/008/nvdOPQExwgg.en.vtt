ferns<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.730> everything<00:01:56.120> are<00:01:56.210> growing<00:01:56.570> right

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
ferns that everything are growing right

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.430 
ferns that everything are growing right
over<00:01:57.080> it

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
over it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.850 
over it
it's<00:01:57.770> been<00:01:57.950> there<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.160> while<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.590> I'm<00:02:00.590> almost

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
it's been there a while so I'm almost

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.130 
it's been there a while so I'm almost
positive<00:02:01.250> that's<00:02:01.700> from<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.000> coyote<00:02:02.330> or<00:02:02.450> Fox<00:02:02.840> or

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
positive that's from a coyote or Fox or

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.840 
positive that's from a coyote or Fox or
raccoon<00:02:03.530> or<00:02:03.860> something<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.720> anyway<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:07.130> that

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
raccoon or something so anyway that that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.490 
raccoon or something so anyway that that
is<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.000> good<00:02:08.240> spot<00:02:08.479> first<00:02:08.720> set<00:02:08.990> but<00:02:09.020> right<00:02:09.350> up

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
is a good spot first set but right up

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.710 
is a good spot first set but right up
the<00:02:09.619> trail<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> little<00:02:10.220> bit<00:02:10.399> there's<00:02:11.240> another

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the trail a little bit there's another

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.450 
the trail a little bit there's another
one<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.290> think<00:02:12.350> that's<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.830> better<00:02:12.980> spot<00:02:13.430> for

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
one and I think that's a better spot for

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.090 
one and I think that's a better spot for
a<00:02:13.730> set<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.420> because<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.350> way<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.620> ground<00:02:15.890> is

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
a set just because the way the ground is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.680 
a set just because the way the ground is
and<00:02:16.310> everything<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.820> how<00:02:16.910> well<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.330> blocked

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and everything and how well it's blocked

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.110 
and everything and how well it's blocked
off<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.770> I'm<00:02:18.860> gonna<00:02:18.980> make<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.610> blind<00:02:19.790> set

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
off so I'm gonna make just a blind set

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.360 
off so I'm gonna make just a blind set
there<00:02:20.360> I'm<00:02:20.930> not<00:02:21.110> gonna<00:02:21.260> use<00:02:21.410> any<00:02:21.680> bait<00:02:21.980> or<00:02:22.160> lure

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
there I'm not gonna use any bait or lure

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.060 
there I'm not gonna use any bait or lure
because<00:02:23.209> when<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:23.930> use<00:02:24.110> bait<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.560> war<00:02:24.770> and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
because when you use bait in war and

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.890 
because when you use bait in war and
make<00:02:25.550> something<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.240> dirt<00:02:26.390> hole<00:02:26.600> set

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
make something I can dirt hole set

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.740 
make something I can dirt hole set
they'll<00:02:27.470> come<00:02:27.740> in<00:02:27.920> their<00:02:28.459> sniffing<00:02:29.000> they're

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
they'll come in their sniffing they're

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.130 
they'll come in their sniffing they're
working<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.320> carefully<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.840> there's<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.930> good

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
working it carefully and there's a good

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.480 
working it carefully and there's a good
chance<00:02:33.380> they're<00:02:33.620> gonna<00:02:33.709> smell<00:02:34.040> your<00:02:34.250> scent

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
chance they're gonna smell your scent

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.920 
chance they're gonna smell your scent
but<00:02:34.940> if<00:02:35.090> they're<00:02:35.240> just<00:02:35.360> running<00:02:35.720> through<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
but if they're just running through a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.350 
but if they're just running through a
trail<00:02:36.260> there's<00:02:37.220> not<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.580> very<00:02:37.730> good<00:02:38.060> chance

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
trail there's not a very good chance

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.259 
trail there's not a very good chance
that<00:02:38.690> they're<00:02:39.410> gonna<00:02:39.500> pick<00:02:39.770> up<00:02:39.920> your<00:02:39.950> scent<00:02:40.400> so
