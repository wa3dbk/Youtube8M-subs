00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello, every car owner knows 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.010
 what for normal engine operation 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.040
 engine oil needed 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.870
 but it lubricates all the details 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 from erasing corrosion and rust and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.190
 pollution but the automotive oil market 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 in crowded with various brands and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.090
 understand this diversity happens 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
 very difficult we present to you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 line of high quality oils in 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 indigo produced germany by 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.310
 unique technology innovation 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.140
 the composition of the bendigo oils are the smallest 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.120
 nanoparticles which are significantly 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.430
 increase lubricity 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.340
 and antifriction properties of the motor 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.500
 oils how it works you ask if 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 examine the engine under the microscope we 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 see that the surface seemed 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.149
 smooth in fact more like mountain 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.250
 landscape 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.379
 precisely because of this unevenness all 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.870
 moving parts wear in the process 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.000
 work and edges are moving towards each other 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.860
 creating tremendous friction temperatures 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.690
 at which parts fragments are constantly 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.149
 weld together for a short 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 time and break off forming chips 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.400
 surfaces are getting bigger 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 rough wear increases 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.700
 regular oil slightly reduces friction but 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.040
 does not remove the problem simply 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 nanoparticles contained in the oil windigo 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.369
 enter into a chemical reaction with 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.200
 metal surface as a result 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 surface aligned on top 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 creates the finest mono molecular 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.720
 protective layer that provides 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.600
 sliding engine parts practically 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.490
 frictionless technology efficiency and and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.920
 anti-friction properties proven 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.430
 confirmed by many 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.590
 research institutes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.509
 Germany and Russia are usually the main 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.909
 considers motor oil characteristic 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.290
 its viscosity is her point to 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.900
 packaging all manufacturers 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.909
 but the oils of the Vindigo line have the same 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.130
 viscosity values significantly 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.960
 superior to its competitors in the sake of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.030
 what engine oil is used a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.159
 it is in protecting engine parts from 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 wear due to significant 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.299
 the introduction of motor oil Vindigo 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.939
 increase resource power and efficiency 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.159
 engine and at the same time reduces noise and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.869
 vibration from his work test 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.359
 showed that when using oil 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.729
 winddigo fuel consumption reduced by 15 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.469
 percent so choose a 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.390
 nice degas you save 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.849
 because your car runs longer 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.400
 it requires less fuel and change 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.410
 oil can now only rarely after 25 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.420
 thousand kilometers purchase oil 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.650
 Vindigo can be in retail outlets and through 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.480
 official representatives 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.340
 a complete list of which is on our 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.200
 site only in this case you can 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 be confident in the quality of each 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.920
 packaging sold to you if you 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.840
 you always doubt at our booth 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.819
 can do the free test and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.010
 compare your motor oil with 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.709
