be<00:00:41.340> doing<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.760> my<00:00:42.000> opinion<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.480> game<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.899> go

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
be doing now my opinion this game can go

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.150 
be doing now my opinion this game can go
either<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> two<00:00:45.090> ways<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:46.680> failure<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
either one of two ways the failure of it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
either one of two ways the failure of it
really<00:00:47.489> depends<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> result<00:00:48.510> between

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
really depends on the result between

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
really depends on the result between
Everton<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> Man<00:00:49.530> City<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.070> Saturday<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Everton and Man City on Saturday of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
Everton and Man City on Saturday of
course<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.910> Man<00:00:51.090> City<00:00:51.329> win<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.289> we've

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
course in Man City win there then we've

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.110 
course in Man City win there then we've
already<00:00:52.559> secured<00:00:53.010> top<00:00:53.219> before<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.670> play<00:00:53.879> West

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
already secured top before we play West

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.220 
already secured top before we play West
Brom<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.570> might<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:54.960> laid<00:00:55.199> back

Brom so you might have a more laid back
approach<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.850> wants<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> go

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
approach to it but I really wants to go

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.819

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
noble maybe we played them earlier on
the<00:01:28.770> season<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.700> 1-1<00:01:29.909> tour<00:01:30.210> actually<00:01:30.390> they

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the season in a 1-1 tour actually they

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.880 
the season in a 1-1 tour actually they
were<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:30.960> impressive<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.650> time<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
were really impressive at that time I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.870 
were really impressive at that time I
mean<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.340> they<00:01:32.430> were<00:01:32.520> under<00:01:32.729> their

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
mean that's when they were under their

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.090 
mean that's when they were under their
previous<00:01:33.299> manager<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
previous manager but now I'm the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
previous manager but now I'm the
Peppermill<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.299> they're<00:01:36.509> still

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
Peppermill I think what they're still

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
Peppermill I think what they're still
struggling<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> moment<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.250> how<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.340> mean

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
struggling at the moment is how I mean

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
struggling at the moment is how I mean
they<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.759> still<00:01:38.970> relegation<00:01:39.509> candidates<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
they are still relegation candidates and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.170 
they are still relegation candidates and
they<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:41.130> gonna<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.340> fine<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.759> alive<00:01:42.000> in

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
they are gonna be fine for it alive in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.460 
they are gonna be fine for it alive in
this<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> under<00:01:43.079> mean<00:01:43.259> them

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this one I don't want to under mean them

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.920 
this one I don't want to under mean them
by<00:01:43.590> still<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> capabilities

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
by still think we have the capabilities

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.440 
by still think we have the capabilities
and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.320> confidence<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> beat

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and the confidence to go there and beat

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
and the confidence to go there and beat
them<00:01:48.689> anyway<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.770> saying<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.250> game

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
them anyway like I was saying the game

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.910 
them anyway like I was saying the game
going<00:01:50.670> over<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.149> two<00:01:51.299> ways<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
going over one or two ways and like I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.380 
going over one or two ways and like I
said<00:01:52.979> we've<00:01:53.159> got<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> laid-back<00:01:53.579> approach<00:01:54.000> or

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
said we've got the laid-back approach or

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
said we've got the laid-back approach or
of<00:01:54.869> course<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.500> haven't<00:01:55.799> secured<00:01:56.100> top<00:01:56.310> four

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
of course if we haven't secured top four

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.389 
of course if we haven't secured top four
yet<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.750> go<00:01:57.899> into<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.829> go<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> we

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
yet we go into it and we go and we

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.010 
yet we go into it and we go and we
really<00:01:59.820> go<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.899> done

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
really go up with from like we have done

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539 
really go up with from like we have done
in<00:02:01.110> our<00:02:01.200> prudent<00:02:01.740> thing<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> case<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> being

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
in our prudent thing is a case of being

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.590 
in our prudent thing is a case of being
patient<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.149> don't<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.420> we're<00:02:03.509> gonna

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
patient but I don't think we're gonna

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.999 
patient but I don't think we're gonna
have<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> bring<00:02:04.020> them<00:02:04.170> down<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.590> much<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.950> think

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
have to bring them down so much I think

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.139 
have to bring them down so much I think
