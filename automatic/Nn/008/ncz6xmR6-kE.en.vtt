00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 it seems that all I want is for the relationship between you and the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:04.830
 education 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.150
 This was the fourth 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.990
 What I was worried about, I searched for class Gusev 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.139
 not much state circulation 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.330
 I realized that it was very common for teachers and all areas to use 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.590
 in 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.369
 movies are cool 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.999
 once in a pedagogical meeting a biological process or feels trapped 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.529
 peaceful and told me that he had 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.060
 and neither cared 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 but they present something 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.210
 this is significant for them is a way 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 if you search before you start 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.350
 and then I realized that 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.640
 adson the illustration that the film takes to the classroom 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.590
 it's not always like this, stay uncle paulo 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.660
 so that got me more attention that's when I did the project and it came 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.400
 to the beach 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.200
 the cycle 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.480
 Do you listen to the couple's conversation? 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.549
 in general the mayor and I signed 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.839
 much of his dissertation the case few history teachers this my 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.589
 formation is history so I thought it would be more appropriate to go into an era 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.740
 that I knew a little more deeply 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.200
 theoretically inclusive 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.380
 because this is very common in all circuits but my focus was one 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.500
 fire story 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.080
 and this is also very frequent areas increasingly frequent 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 because technological much more accessible to people 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.460
 when we started talking about it for example 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.659
 in formal format here at least in curitiba was fair 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.460
 whatever there is left 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.900
 best in the state after that was why it is federal too 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.790
 and he already studies in the 60's and 50's the possibility of taking the cinema 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.480
 for the classroom in he speaks instead in the 50's to what is possible today 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.180
 so the whole classroom has to have a white screen that projection it 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.380
 I thought clearly in the designed device I did not think of home is to be very afraid 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.080
 to lose and much less a television was of class thing that today exists 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.610
 both schools 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.380
 municipal schools and in state schools 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.100
 and look at the research at the time I told you I started a little before 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.050
 to do a master's degree in state public and municipal schools television room 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.419
 of class is already a reality 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.299
 quite a long time at least a decade 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.769
 and in municipal schools in the state school lectures in super an 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.259
 recent reality 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.999
 not that there was no such prediction in the schools before but in the 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.599
 class and everyone is safe. 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.639
 This is a reality. 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:32.159
 of the government has now begun to buy that 7 million televisions 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.289
 oranges and places in the classroom so this is a reality all schools 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.579
 public in curitiba is the selection
