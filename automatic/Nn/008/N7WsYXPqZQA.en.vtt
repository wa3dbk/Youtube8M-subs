 delirium when the new collection arrives at 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.370
 Brazilian does not like much in March 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.600
 fashion is much in this direction now 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.789
 people have some pictures that people 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.399
 may already show that some 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.039
 Brazilian celebrities who usually 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.170
 wore smaller bikinis but 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.600
 are using larger then this has 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.689
 system it kills two major trends 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.110
 this panties wider and paint 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.409
 Continent continues but also prints 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.360
 of foliage is of gindi element as well 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.860
 And this is very cool for you. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.750
 image will also show another type 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.170
 of pantyhose plus neon color 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.880
 schools and that of our changes 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.189
 celebrities are also showing the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.070
 panties even though there is so 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.649
 only if joaquim is wider than 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.200
 who is so high school with a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.960
 Color is very strong 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.360
 the size of the cahia also continues the hand 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.979
 great option for those who do not have much breast 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.320
 careful about it 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.659
 op to panties also wider is not 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.820
 cool this laguna panties was very 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.820
 nice to talk to the woman who 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.149
 has the widest hip so we have 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.060
 many Brazilian women who are the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.710
 guitar body antoinette body that at 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.080
 Sometimes you have a little difficulty. 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.270
 Do not you want to show that much your hip? 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.550
 so wide so this is a good option 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.240
 cool in this case then another 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.880
 Brazilian celebrity showing a 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.350
 type of pattern is also very 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.450
 high to list 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.580
 The floral ballpoint board also cleans 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.120
 stayed in panties is called panties 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.430
 heart and in the middle of the panties he has 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.980
 so they have a novel a record the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.770
 differential record the transit 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.440
 differentiates and makes the one clip and 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.110
 stay a great option also for those who 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.970
 want to value that part to rise in 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.330
 capital showing another trend 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.480
 combining and then it is 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.090
 part already signals more the same time in 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.820
 one car color was underneath 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.070
 in this case how she is wearing is great 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.980
 for example without the hip 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.800
 but is smaller than the top one 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.660
 inverted triangle only from lists in 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.480
 bottom to draw attention 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.970
 the thong on the bow then continue 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.370
 super strong is more like we are 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.070
 Seeing the widest panties there is nothing 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.970
 tanguinha and for the chubby ones too 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.140
 we have options and one of the great options and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.080
 great options 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.340
 Is this bra back a little? 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.200
 this bra or acacia this from the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.110
 first black and white and look different 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.380
 of the same half kaka model in the half cup 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.870
 so it is not half edu fee he he 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.450
 It's very nice, and it stays that way. 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.930
 panties three fingers wider than it is 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.810
 normal or else on the side that is well come 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.520
 stamped what we call feeling 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.040
 and it's also very cool that they can 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.610
 use for those who are overweight and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.170
 Abiquim wants to use the ideal is greater than 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.090
 we can show another program 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.170
 but in this case then there are two models 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.690
 very cool 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.900
 the wide pants also holds up very well 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.900
 like this 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.349
 metals would be super 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:34.800
 always use the locations of your 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:37.469
 body you really want is to increase 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.150
 how to draw attention in this case 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:42.150
 we have the project is an element 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.060
 very high now in sensation 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.020
 and here is using a main point 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.090
 would be the bra on the top and that will 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.400
 cause it to increase the shapes then 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.740
 be careful also with this excellent 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.770
 seeing with orange then we saw the 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.129
 pink color is very strong paint pink 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.029
 grandson pink well leon the yellow too 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.340
 mark text plus an image of crochet and 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:11.580
 really, how can we see people? 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.430
 have as various machined models 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.469
 It is also a great option with 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.580
 Metalized we are well minded 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.699
 discreet 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.069
 not to fight so much with the sun, then 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.039
 in addition to the metallic ones, 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:31.770
 we have a range that are elements 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:53.550
 What are the ways you can use your 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:55.889
 Careful looking more towards the 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.229
 who is a better environment and the 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.089
 color because it's too tan 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.159
 very white, still fighting for 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.589
 the table number in the future exactly 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:11.490
 this issue is very important to be 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:13.560
 one thing according to your image 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.669
 even though I'm not well I know that the 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.669
 women will continue 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:22.409
 It's true thank you Carol, that week. 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.789
 then comes we speak of children already 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.979
 that we get in the middle of them is 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.519
 just do not talk all children's fashion 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.519
 be good until next week 

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:31.519
 ah
