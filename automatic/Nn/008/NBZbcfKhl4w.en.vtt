00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.950
 hello good to all 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.200
 we are here again a boxing video 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.840
 review here I have the plate to me the new 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.230
 plate that the jewel of the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.230
 crown is a rock of londes and texting 3 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.460
 and after a lot of looking different 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.689
 plates I decided on this one because I think 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 that was one of the most complete 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.040
 most important features has 12 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.370
 power phases of agreement 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.370
 he has 8 ports sata has a port 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 an esata express port has a port 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 m2 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.730
 we have purity shawn that what he does is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.420
 expand the sound of those of the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.770
 hearing aids headphones hearing aids and giving 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.030
 better sound quality then 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.629
 we have an ethernet network intel gb 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.760
 and then they allow us the slide and the 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.949
 crossfire 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.630
 we will proceed to see the box we have the 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.329
 quick instruction manual 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.840
 according to fast manual solutions 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.229
 extensive instructions together with our 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.229
 trailers 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.409
 in this back life 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.680
 two sata ports 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.780
 that's for an adapter to give it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.980
 current to the hard drives through 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.100
 motherboard 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.660
 after the adapters in 2004 in total and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.550
 the screw in case we put a 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:42.670
 hard drive m2 a hard drive m2 that 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.290
 because it does not do a good thing 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.610
 this goat and here we must have 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.610
 the bridge of children 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.760
 I spent a moment I'm going to stop the video and 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.760
 now we continue 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:11.069
 we continue the camera also focused and 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.280
 well here we have the plate how is it going 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.280
 saying 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.110
 to see if it's here 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.710
 she is not the water box 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:31.060
 we began to describe their little 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:34.720
 characteristics we have 2 4 5 6 6 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.880
 ports to connect fans 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.520
 which 2 are 4 pins and the rest 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.980
 4 are 13 - pin 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.650
 that we have here somewhere 12 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.470
 phases of power as you can see 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.330
 6 and 6 phases of power dissipators 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.280
 the four memory banks 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.690
 the front usb3 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.450
 here we can see the 8 sata ports 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.780
 and these three become the sata 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.780
 express 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.750
 here we have 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.750
 the cable that I mentioned before 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.590
 the bus cable I commented before to catch 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.460
 current of the plate towards the discs 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.010
 hard 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.620
 we have two ways the switch of change 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.290
 of God 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.190
 we have a power button and a button 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.960
 reset 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.790
 and you can see us 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.480
 then we have him 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.650
 the button to erase lips in case 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.620
 the overclock fails 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.400
 and then we have the numeric panel with 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.980
 the states of the motherboard 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.480
 is this I like a lot in the 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.599
 case of always that six are the lovers 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.110
 of the overclock are pretty functions 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.920
 pretty fixed 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.140
 here we have the for connectors 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.210
 On and off reset lighting 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.210
 from tower 2 usb is 2 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.629
 a com port 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.049
 that should be the sound port not 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.540
 sorry here is sound port 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.650
 here we have in the port m2 for 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.650
 place the hard drives 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.210
 in agreement we continue on this side of the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.440
 plate we have the politice to a 2 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.530
 and you can see it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.330
 agree and the lateral one because we have the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.210
 ethernet network 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.529
 gb that commented we have 6 usb ports 3 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.069
 2 usb ports 2 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:46.459
 the output of hdmi sorry the output of h 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:50.460
 of port display measurements you see here 

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:52.740
 the dibise and the sheep 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.160
 in the middle of a plate we have to 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.600
 feed graphics cards 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.360
 remember that allows is live or 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.330
 crossfire 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.310
 here we have a 4 pin port of 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.849
 supplementary feeding 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.340
 two ports pci express 3 the first of 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.939
 16 and if we put a second graph happens 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.370
 from 2 to 8 and 3 ports pci here 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.340
 we have the chipset 4 memory banks 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.529
 Well, in principle you have already seen 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.749
 the plate 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:27.030
 now I will proceed to assemble them in 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:30.170
 the tower that you see I already have with him 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.170
 with the processor 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.100
 although they have made me say my position to 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.630
 plate because there are mainly plates a 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.120
 a little cheaper or from other brands 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.669
 how scary to comment that to broken three 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.530
 years of warranty on this plate is a 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.130
 important detail three years warranty 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.880
 to comment that there are other plates as 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.880
 asus gigabyte 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.099
 ms and what it has done to me for 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:00.099
 example the lliga dance the gaming 3 is 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.099
 very similar to this one 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.099
 have 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.280
 both sata ports and a data express 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.860
 it also has ports m2 of a port of 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.510
 2 gb and then it also has both 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.640
 crossfire as slide 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.280
 and the price is very similar has been 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.000
 agreement between the diva has just 797 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.830
 gaming 3 and this there is approximately 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.870
 I started components there are two euros of 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.610
 difference and 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.280
 but I think it has made me say to me 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.660
 tonight it has two sata ports 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.409
 plus two ports this rate is three more 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.319
 then he has you 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.629
 the theme of this track is the double 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.749
 god the ignited off through a 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:50.849
 button of agreement and then have more phases 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:54.209
 of power the gigabyte has eight phases of 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.860
 power and the and this one has 12 agree 

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:58.370
 then this is going to allow us a 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.040
 overclock more 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.020
 1 the most stable club 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.610
 These main features are 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.950
 those that have made me sing more 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.980
 by the rou then in to your there's no 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.700
 plate in the price margin that bad 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:16.370
 we are driving that is about 130 euros 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.560
 125 zero for euros that has so many 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.490
 characteristics like rice like coconut 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.440
 like gb matters to have a plate 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:28.200
 Check express and with m2 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.060
 if we have to go to 140 150 euros 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.310
 good 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:36.260
 then this plate has been and I think 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.320
 that did not leave me anything else simply because 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.480
 I 'm going to steal it and well, I hope 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.060
 that you liked the video if it has 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.470
 you already know you give to the elect to 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.540
 up to like and if you did not like it 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.810
 you give it down there is no 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:54.520
 problem then nothing guys a greeting and 

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.520
 until the next video chao chao
