00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.910
 hello there is a picnic with you and today I 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 doing a video about such a nice derek from 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.969
 butterfly field etc. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:22.680
 on the VKontakte network, I think it's one 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:27.210
 of the best games in VKontakte and now I 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.660
 I'll show you what's there, I'll create my 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.660
 server 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:57.020
 next time write something 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:13.740
 recorded here booted i did burn out 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:24.350
 to make it easier for you to go for example 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:24.350
 on red well or blue 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.229
 here you can buy weapons for money 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.390
 which you get like after the fight 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.840
 if you win you will get a lot 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.159
 more money if you lose then you 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.320
 get less money everything is logical now 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.320
 we have an automatic pistol and knife 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:58.399
 It is such a graphic 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:00.220
 now made fullscreen now 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:06.409
 came up 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.380
 the game represents this than you are true 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.230
 sometimes reminiscent of batterfield 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.930
 but this is unfortunately not that map see u 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.459
 I'm already a weighty butcher 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:24.470
 or I have a computer 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:27.470
 Now I will show you the map on which 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:34.640
 say about which there are or helicopters 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:39.170
 and everything like that I load it seems like 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.170
 I do not remember this card yesterday, perk 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.680
 on game devices as not interrupted 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.079
 Opportunity. I think they thought the way. 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.070
 don't hear now wait 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:59.720
 make it quieter the name of the computer even 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:05.650
 a bit so here in this tour and go 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.720
 for example for blue join and here we have 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.850
 yes, now I’ll make a screen 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.980
 it was more convenient for you here 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.989
 tanks 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.410
 something like a battery and of course 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.780
 helicopter I do not know whether you can sit in 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.350
 the plane and some moments mean 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:36.900
 control 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:41.730
 and does it fly forward like there with back and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 turn around and friend 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:52.360
 well go turn around too sweep away 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.930
 sweeps a gap like yes 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:05.940
 take off the gap 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:05.940
 you can shoot and go down on you 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:29.920
 so here but this is my first video 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:32.500
 I hope I hope I hope now 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.810
 the map will not disappear as it has been many times 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.590
 Here, for example, I do not know you 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:42.960
 general machine on the rocket is very all 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:50.920
 good machine gun every such a tank 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:54.690
 there is a lot of well and the most powerful explosion 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.690
 World's fastest flight 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:05.009
 even somehow not realistic make-up 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:10.680
 maybe because of this I will have you lagging 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:18.669
 I promise the right mouse button 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:20.199
 shoot 0 we all win logically immediately 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:25.659
 I want to say 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:32.250
 vkontakte leader this game is very much it 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:37.389
 the game is a bit like the American spirit 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.030
 2003 let's say the map is over I 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.199
 I think the sea ​​is human 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.969
 my review can already be finished by everyone 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:50.310
