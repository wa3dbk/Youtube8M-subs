00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
here now these are all the lettuces that

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.760 
here now these are all the lettuces that
I<00:00:13.620> had<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.580> recently<00:00:14.880> put<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I had just recently put in to the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220 
I had just recently put in to the
riverbed<00:00:17.220> system<00:00:17.990> some<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> these<00:00:19.170> are

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
riverbed system some of these are

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.510 
riverbed system some of these are
brand-new<00:00:19.650> some<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.220> just

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
brand-new some of them I'm just

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
brand-new some of them I'm just
transplanted<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.480> took<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.810> tomato

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
transplanted and I took the tomato

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.670 
transplanted and I took the tomato
seedlings<00:00:22.980> out<00:00:23.840> these<00:00:24.840> were<00:00:25.080> just<00:00:25.350> put<00:00:25.650> in

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
seedlings out these were just put in

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.210 
seedlings out these were just put in
about<00:00:26.550> four<00:00:27.150> days<00:00:27.180> ago<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.680> see<00:00:28.920> I've<00:00:29.010> already

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
about four days ago you see I've already

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
about four days ago you see I've already
got<00:00:29.519> root<00:00:29.760> system<00:00:30.240> starting<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
got root system starting but the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.530 
got root system starting but the
interesting<00:00:31.949> thing<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.120> ones<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> have

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
interesting thing is the ones that have

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.430 
interesting thing is the ones that have
been<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> little<00:00:34.350> while<00:00:36.260> get<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
been in here for a little while get a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520 
been in here for a little while get a
load<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.489> root<00:00:39.360> mass<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.809> can't<00:00:40.110> even<00:00:40.230> get

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
load of that root mass I can't even get

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.410 
load of that root mass I can't even get
the<00:00:40.800> container<00:00:41.250> out<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:41.879> without<00:00:41.969> having

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the container out of here without having

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.700 
the container out of here without having
it<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.809> fight<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.760> ah<00:00:45.710> then

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it really fight to get that out ah then

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I've got this one here and see these are

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.510 
I've got this one here and see these are
roughly<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:51.239> three<00:00:51.539> weeks<00:00:51.750> old<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.520> same

roughly about three weeks old and same
thing<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> root<00:00:54.300> mass<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.379> huge<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
thing as the root mass is just so huge I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.119 
thing as the root mass is just so huge I
had<00:00:56.430> trimmed<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.910> back<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.300> strawberries

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
had trimmed to back the strawberries

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
had trimmed to back the strawberries
quite<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> lot<00:00:59.609> just<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> couple<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.960> leads

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
quite a lot just to a couple of leads

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.410 
quite a lot just to a couple of leads

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
pump on a timer and when the timer kicks

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
pump on a timer and when the timer kicks
in<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.930> pumps<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> water<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.159> of
