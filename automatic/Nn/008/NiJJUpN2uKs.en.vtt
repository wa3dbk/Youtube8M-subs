 hello welcome to mobile techno 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.410
 dotcom your web page 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.219
 technology spy articles and gifts to 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.550
 good price today we present the new 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.080
 Die cutting machine for cutting 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.100
 sim cards 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.910
 of the new nano format but that is the 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.590
 little girl who takes for example the new 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.160
 iphone 5 and some more models of 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.160
 new phones 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.730
 its use is very simple here we have a 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.730
 card without normal size 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.100
 we insert it into the slot 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.520
 corresponding with the top corner 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.040
 right cut as shown 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.320
 Here below shows us the drawing 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.239
 we already see the chip here 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.370
 and once we have placed it well the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.700
 we have introduced to the bottom so 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.390
 we just have to press hard 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 the die cutter 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.070
 and let's see how 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.870
 we have the card already cut to size 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.870
 of the nano sim 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.710
 with a perfect cut that always with 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.540
 a scissor would stay would stay more 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.230
 less precise let's say that in this way 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.010
 now 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.810
 thanks to the sandpaper that we incorporate 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.840
 we must iron out a little what are the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.320
 edges and we go a little bit the edges to 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.320
 give him 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.820
 a better finish 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.130
 lime we also share a bit 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.080
 back is the one that does not carry the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.390
 golden contact the back where 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.520
 are the letters the letters of the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 card we filed it a bit 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.530
 for example supporting the envelope on a 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.530
 surface 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.730
 and moving it we filed it a bit because 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.900
 the new card is a little thinner 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.150
 than normal sim cards 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.640
 the final result would be this already 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.280
 we have here cut that for the part 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.959
 we have sanded it a bit and it has been 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.700
 totally flat, they have been 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.640
 erased let's say what the letters are 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.579
 that it takes from the factory and that's much more 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.420
 Delgada to fit the good in 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.420
 the iphone5 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.659
 we sell the complete equipment what 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.760
 which is the die cutting machine with its 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.760
 daughter and two adapters 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:03.590
 for later if we want the card that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.590
 we have cut the we can insert 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.379
 in this adapter and we return it to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.380
 convert to a standard sim card 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:16.360
 to be able to put it on any phone 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.820
 and another adapter for the micro sims that 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.390
 would be the cards that carry the iphone 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.850
 4 for example or the ipad 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.550
 we put the card inside the 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.220
 micro sim adapter that would be this 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.860
 and this and what it does is convert it 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.860
 in the size of iphone 4 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.930
 as always a great invention novelty of
