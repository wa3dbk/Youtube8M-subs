screen that I reviewed as a while back

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.710 
screen that I reviewed as a while back
and<00:00:19.310> I've<00:00:19.520> been<00:00:19.700> using<00:00:19.939> it<00:00:20.150> quite<00:00:20.599> a<00:00:20.660> bit

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
and I've been using it quite a bit

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.359 
and I've been using it quite a bit
orphan<00:00:21.110> on<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:21.619> gets<00:00:21.830> reasonable<00:00:22.189> quality

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
orphan on it gets reasonable quality

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.159 
orphan on it gets reasonable quality
video<00:00:22.730> there<00:00:23.540> are<00:00:23.660> better<00:00:23.779> ones<00:00:23.900> on<00:00:24.110> the

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
video there are better ones on the

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.530 
video there are better ones on the
market<00:00:24.230> now<00:00:24.590> high<00:00:24.770> resolution<00:00:25.460> but<00:00:26.270> this<00:00:26.419> is

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
market now high resolution but this is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.530 
market now high resolution but this is
adequate<00:00:26.899> for<00:00:26.930> what<00:00:27.200> I<00:00:27.349> use<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.489> for<00:00:28.520> one<00:00:29.360> thing

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
adequate for what I use it for one thing

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.790 
adequate for what I use it for one thing
I<00:00:29.660> did<00:00:29.840> find<00:00:30.020> that<00:00:30.050> was<00:00:30.200> been<00:00:30.320> annoying<00:00:30.590> though

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
I did find that was been annoying though

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560 
I did find that was been annoying though
was<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.160> lack<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.340> an<00:00:31.550> external<00:00:32.029> antenna<00:00:32.149> just

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
was the lack of an external antenna just

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.389 
was the lack of an external antenna just
this<00:00:32.689> little<00:00:32.840> fold<00:00:33.350> up<00:00:33.500> whip<00:00:33.649> thing<00:00:33.860> here<00:00:34.040> it's

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
this little fold up whip thing here it's

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.100 
this little fold up whip thing here it's
not<00:00:34.520> that<00:00:34.579> good<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.329> know<00:00:35.720> if<00:00:35.780> you<00:00:35.840> get<00:00:35.960> any

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
not that good you know if you get any

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.900 
not that good you know if you get any
distance<00:00:36.350> away<00:00:36.530> from<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.920> model<00:00:37.160> then<00:00:37.700> you

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
distance away from the model then you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.180 
distance away from the model then you
start<00:00:38.149> getting<00:00:38.239> snow<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.290> picture<00:00:39.829> fades

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
start getting snow and the picture fades

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.529 
start getting snow and the picture fades
quite<00:00:40.429> quickly<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:40.879> it's<00:00:41.149> fairly<00:00:41.329> limited

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
quite quickly so it's fairly limited

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.599 
quite quickly so it's fairly limited
because<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:41.989> can<00:00:42.170> plug<00:00:42.379> it<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.620> V<00:00:42.949> signal<00:00:43.460> in

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
because you can plug it a V signal in

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.329 
because you can plug it a V signal in
and<00:00:43.879> record<00:00:44.510> on<00:00:44.780> here<00:00:44.989> from<00:00:45.440> your<00:00:45.620> pole<00:00:46.100> type

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
and record on here from your pole type

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.099 
and record on here from your pole type
if<00:00:46.699> Peavy<00:00:47.120> receive<00:00:47.420> which<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:47.750> fine<00:00:47.929> but

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
if Peavy receive which is fine but

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.930 
if Peavy receive which is fine but
sometimes<00:00:48.859> you<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.219> want<00:00:49.519> to<00:00:49.609> have<00:00:49.910> a

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
sometimes you just want to have a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.819 
sometimes you just want to have a
standalone<00:00:50.359> recording<00:00:50.839> system<00:00:51.109> in<00:00:51.320> which

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
standalone recording system in which

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.529 
standalone recording system in which
case<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.280> don't<00:00:52.760> know<00:00:52.850> if<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:52.999> realize<00:00:53.179> it<00:00:53.329> but

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
case I don't know if you realize it but

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.110 
case I don't know if you realize it but
you<00:00:53.660> can<00:00:53.780> actually<00:00:53.899> unplug<00:00:54.589> this<00:00:54.769> little

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
you can actually unplug this little

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.040 
you can actually unplug this little
antenna<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.329> antenna<00:00:56.359> that<00:00:56.660> comes<00:00:56.839> with<00:00:56.989> it

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
antenna the antenna that comes with it

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.099 
antenna the antenna that comes with it
just<00:00:57.620> pulls<00:00:58.100> out<00:00:58.339> and<00:00:58.609> it<00:00:58.999> leaves<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.269> little<00:00:59.390> RF

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
just pulls out and it leaves a little RF

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.200 
just pulls out and it leaves a little RF
connector<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.620> there<00:01:00.769> now<00:01:01.309> that<00:01:01.489> RF<00:01:01.789> connector

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
connector in there now that RF connector

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.390 
connector in there now that RF connector
takes<00:01:02.800> anything<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.949> want<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.129> put<00:01:04.220> in<00:01:04.309> there

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
takes anything you want to put in there

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.770 
takes anything you want to put in there
if<00:01:04.519> you've<00:01:04.640> got<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:04.879> matching<00:01:05.120> connector<00:01:05.659> you

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
if you've got a matching connector you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.370 
if you've got a matching connector you
can<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:06.080> plug<00:01:06.260> in<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.880> lead<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.240> pigtail<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.050> on

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
can just plug in a lead a pigtail and on

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.480 
can just plug in a lead a pigtail and on
the<00:01:09.470> end<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.830> put<00:01:09.980> something<00:01:10.159> like<00:01:10.280> this

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
the end you can put something like this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.120 
the end you can put something like this
this<00:01:10.670> is<00:01:10.730> the<00:01:10.940> circular<00:01:11.390> wireless<00:01:12.130> helical

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
this is the circular wireless helical

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.770 
this is the circular wireless helical
antenna<00:01:13.220> there's<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.210> give<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.450> heap

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
antenna there's going to give you a heap

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.359 
antenna there's going to give you a heap
more<00:01:14.810> range<00:01:15.259> providing<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:15.799> keep<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.070> pointed

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
more range providing you keep it pointed

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.520 
more range providing you keep it pointed
in<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.520> rough<00:01:16.640> direction<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.659> model<00:01:17.990> or

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
in the rough direction of the model or

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.980 
in the rough direction of the model or
we<00:01:18.649> can<00:01:18.799> plug<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.130> cloverleaf<00:01:19.460> because<00:01:20.329> this

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
we can plug in a cloverleaf because this

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.300 
we can plug in a cloverleaf because this
is<00:01:21.110> all<00:01:21.259> plumbing<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.770> course<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.159> can

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
is all plumbing of course so you can

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.389 
is all plumbing of course so you can
unscrew<00:01:22.640> butts<00:01:23.119> from<00:01:23.270> here<00:01:23.719> and<00:01:24.250> screw<00:01:25.250> in

unscrew butts from here and screw in
bits<00:01:25.909> from<00:01:26.420> elsewhere<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.170> I've<00:01:28.159> got<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.670> sort

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090

little<00:02:33.710> DVRs<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.730> flew<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.390> limit<00:02:36.110> of

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
little DVRs I flew this to the limit of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:49.200 
little DVRs I flew this to the limit of
comfortable<00:02:36.890> visual<00:02:37.370> line<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.970> sight

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:04:32.529 

you

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.550 

so<00:04:33.539> there<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.840> go<00:04:33.930> they<00:04:34.199> were<00:04:34.259> still<00:04:34.440> the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
so there you go they were still the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.930 
so there you go they were still the
occasional<00:04:34.770> drop<00:04:35.160> out<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.370> always<00:04:35.580> get<00:04:35.819> that

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
occasional drop out you always get that

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.790 
occasional drop out you always get that
with<00:04:36.060> fpv<00:04:36.449> because<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:37.169> some<00:04:37.380> stage<00:04:37.590> you'll

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
with fpv because it's some stage you'll

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.020 
with fpv because it's some stage you'll

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
antenna that you're using but there is

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.620 
antenna that you're using but there is
also<00:04:41.009> pretty<00:04:41.280> remarkable<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.000> flew<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.300> model

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
also pretty remarkable I flew that model

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.089 
also pretty remarkable I flew that model
the<00:04:42.840> ax<00:04:43.110> in<00:04:43.259> here<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.680> limits<00:04:43.979> of

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
the ax in here to the limits of

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.279 
the ax in here to the limits of
visibility<00:04:44.970> because<00:04:45.509> I<00:04:45.690> was<00:04:45.780> flying<00:04:45.930> visual

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
visibility because I was flying visual

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.740 
visibility because I was flying visual
line<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.560> sight<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.970> generally<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.060> image<00:04:48.630> is

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
line of sight and generally the image is

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.300 
line of sight and generally the image is
pretty<00:04:48.960> damn<00:04:49.139> solid<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.740> think<00:04:50.099> that's<00:04:50.220> quite

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
pretty damn solid I think that's quite

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.559 
pretty damn solid I think that's quite
impressive<00:04:50.520> certainly<00:04:51.030> I<00:04:51.060> wouldn't<00:04:51.300> got<00:04:51.419> that

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
impressive certainly I wouldn't got that

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.089 
impressive certainly I wouldn't got that

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
kind of performance using the standard

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.400 
kind of performance using the standard

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
little fold up whip certainly no chance
