00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 james asia belgian that this year 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.299
 failed to score so high 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.820
 remains a new addition deep in the rush hour 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.740
 I sit on the couch at every start 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.519
 rear left alexander corijn for it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.469
 first 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.230
 through but each extreme she comes to the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 kick off in place of Ivan Leko 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.310
 the referee is sebastian 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 delferiÃ¨re through but something with one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 Angle scope for luring 16 minutes 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.429
 2nd corner played by strand him in this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.910
 match did go to it and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.910
 then the construction 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.469
 cow person ahead 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 sporting lokeren 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.190
 first minutes of play of this match 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 were for lierse but then came block 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.520
 put it on and the scorepatch also on 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.530
 by mahatma reach and then person 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.079
 didn't even stand a chance 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.129
 competition goal for cooper's us and 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.129
 lead for lokeren 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.019
 keep your brain disaster before irish ball goes 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.030
 swinkels to the second post there 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.439
 achievements remain in the box but are ahead 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
 to lure 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.409
 but something is weird 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.909
 the brazilian or foil has it is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.890
 held by a new pole 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.619
 benefit of course lose there and there 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.560
 gas is on it and sure you can still 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.140
 Continue the ball back and forth 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.799
 saved what an opportunity that was for daylon 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.350
 claasen benefits loaded by the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.020
 referee and then one really came 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.729
 pure opportunity for whoever they are classing 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 cabbage that doesn't turn into a goal 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.470
 Josh with places that quickly hit the ball 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.060
 trying to get into the pope plays 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.759
 then but behind my bourabia is there 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 between also refer her or show 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.070
 wait in the center 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.869
 that ball comes to my arm seems to me 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:00.299
 but not whistled by the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.619
 umpire the annoyance of everything 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.619
 what sympathizes with lierse 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.820
 bourabia 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.380
 the new man who has been a 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.460
 at the start of the second half 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.380
 bidaoui 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.120
 he does that well paul goes wrong 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.190
 for him 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.410
 first chance for i-series second half 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.240
 with the newcomer bidaoui 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.270
 replaced the Egyptians 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.950
 as you will see how you 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.020
 who is now with the urge for it 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.770
 the cross 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.990
 in the box who o who who o who is up 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.220
 Judge and finds , however, but also 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.590
 that shot 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.330
 insufficient direction call for call 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.330
 shock but you don't get it 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.570
 after fifteen minutes in the second half 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.550
 every pass taken to the side then 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.170
 we get from the neighborhood and irish from 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.790
 crucial cake 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.790
 camerooner rented from ohio 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.810
 would you be that burqa 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.680
 what then becomes the target mine for us 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.960
 lierse now lost slightly the ball through the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.920
 peacock with the gear is trying 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.630
 beyond you 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.630
 to clear buddies across the Rhine 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.180
 now you with a red card 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.830
 see what happens there 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.390
 mild paul with the ball over the line and 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.640
 which then goes through all stages than currently 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.990
 indeed from hi um that's good considering 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.910
 by the referee 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.510
 that's absolutely what he needs for nothing 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.930
 there is still a red card look 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.930
 justly 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:02.240
 That means he's the last 22 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.240
 only ten more minutes later 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.519
 and there we do weird after one 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.829
 tough tackle 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.139
 the will but also red and do kick 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.139
 gets yellow and is booked 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.889
 Bourabia with the free kicks and there is 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.280
 then those who make her rich on the 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.590
 Bulgarians with a man less can do it too 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.300
 even as you put a fire and 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.300
 then everything is possible 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.300
 week in the competition is based on 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.370
 as if 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.199
 and with just over fifteen minutes left 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.199
 stand it again like a one 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.310
 Bourabia puts a perfect and then there is 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.310
 as hour or 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.210
 a little bit with the tap is not there 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.800
 quite a big deal but I think 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.599
 so he hit that ball 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.599
 by point is for the bulgarian 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:16.939
 Mokulu there happens some another blow 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.169
 I and Mukuru thought, heal himself 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:22.870
 momentarily there 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.870
 revanched and what does delferiÃ¨re do now 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.669
 not an easy match for one 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.669
 referee so much is clear 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:37.129
 what does delferiÃ¨re do ? 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.210
 yellow for sage and the red for him too 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.919
 cool 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.500
 That means they turn 10 by 10 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.500
 stand with 13 minutes to go 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.639
 neco corijn 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.830
 all the time to see where he got that ball 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.430
 can respond 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.199
 Overmeire Overmeire with the shot 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.129
 ball in corner you now by what 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.629
 even just over five minutes from it 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:09.560
 end of the competition 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:12.410
 tempt tom to set up more class 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.780
 and then the red card is over 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.960
 both sides scored on both sides 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.950
 and all in all a fair draw 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.950
 preferably a one
