00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.180
 hi guys this video if 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.580
 great addition to whom comparison 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.010
 which I have already done, I compared in it 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.019
 digger and maynkravt despite the fact that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.780
 In the previous comparison, everything is clear and 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.910
 clearly said angry comments but 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.720
 like digger gavno minekravt taxis you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.119
 stupid schoolboy 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.769
 this video is not even less 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.840
 comparison appeal to authors like 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.789
 comments i treat you with 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
 understanding on guys you love my craft 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.199
 but answer me one simple question 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.360
 you are not seriously licensed 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.280
 licensed version of the game is ready to argue 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.850
 that half the authors of these angry 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.579
 comments 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.170
 even the concept of a license in my head there and you 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.660
 knew that minecraft licenses are worth 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.110
 about 1 thousand rubles and you bought it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 aim doubting prefer all authors 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.629
 the author of these comments and 13 years old no 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.850
 I do not want to offend anyone friends and me 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.250
 still the fact that these very 13-year-olds 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.620
 Minecraft fans called me names myself 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.039
 I love maynkavt but I love not a digger 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.590
 less 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.809
 let's speculate for full 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.510
 comfortable prices for the license you need 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.580
 spend thousands of rubles on pirates as you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 will have to avoid most of the privileges 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.430
 daisy rock is really good on 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.490
 pirate mom 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.680
 once that on separate launcher and how many 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.560
 you pay money to go to the digger 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.960
 up somewhat because the game 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 shareware please note 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.020
 shareware meaning you can 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 play without introducing money but if you 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.570
 you will be thrown there at least a little 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 to take advantage of these I want to say 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.750
 that the fact that all the blocks in the collector need 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.939
 buy there is a reason that is what you 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 you will be that will play 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.659
 a pirated version of minecraft tormented with 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.430
 servers and against either you cast 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.799
 there one thousand rubles be full 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.780
 happy also in the digger can play 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.840
 and without entering money receive 100 coins per 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 day and save up for good stuff either 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.619
 throw it 100 300 rubles and have it all 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 what is possible 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.790
 I hope that after watching this video 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.649
 you will have less daytime comments 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.649
 thanks for watching everyone bye
