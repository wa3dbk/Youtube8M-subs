00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:41.149

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.660
 very cool and such a creature I even 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.930
 built a corral for for one that's it to me 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:57.750
 going to show here let 's go 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.420
 directly notifications here it is 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.299
 the body itself 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:12.500

 belly and this too while here I am shot 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.009
 and shaded became possible here such 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.490
 hatched what was smaller 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.950
 you can see the emotion cells as I am no longer with him 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.200
 the edges of the slot are glued together I think that everything 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.409
 understandable here draw and scan 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.409
 redraw I think already sketched 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:46.700
 Now Iâ€™ll look at it 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.720
 Dark- crotch sit down 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 he defended the green take a still frame 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.270
 hectic rosette with drawing right here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.290
 take one pixel from each 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.720
 side and draw such a rectangle 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:15.239
 here then again about whether you still glue 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.209

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.319
 one more block, but here it will be from below 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:31.650
 here is gluing the chip like this 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:34.980
 I have shown here I think already 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:45.600
 I will make him let's say he was already sitting 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:50.090
 farther to the head here it is head head here 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:54.090

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.489
 places to paint with black marker like this 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.019
 it's like a meiser is a little bit 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:17.900
 I think let's do this last 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:17.900
 parts this muzzle is about to 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.380
 click freeze frame copy at all 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.640
 tired here too draw black 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:36.359
 glue as usual is too nerdy 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.540
 2 ears here you need to agree with Alex to 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.670
 the same winter to click stop frame 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:48.410
 stick out glue at one time 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:50.250
 the main thing is apply so now this is lava 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.790
 here are paws too 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.549
 sweep sketch cut everything in 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.290
 one time bize glue applied and 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.769

 5-nok and date it will be tail in general 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:23.060
 models are pretty complex on her 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:26.120
 making it took two hours that's not 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.889
 I advise how to make this model if 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.880
 he was not done the same as the previous one 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.610
 because it is difficult here 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.910
