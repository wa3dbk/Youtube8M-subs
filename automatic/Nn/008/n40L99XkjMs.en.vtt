this<00:00:27.539> change<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:29.869> first<00:00:30.869> thing<00:00:31.260> you're<00:00:31.830> gonna

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040

this change so first thing you're gonna
need<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.329 

I<00:00:46.510> had<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.410> know<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:48.800> I<00:00:48.859> could<00:00:49.100> just

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
I had this you know so I could just

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.299 
I had this you know so I could just
switch<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.030> unscrew<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:51.649> think<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:52.159> is

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
switch and unscrew but I think this is

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.819 
switch and unscrew but I think this is
like<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.460> tour<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:53.390> think<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.469> don't<00:00:54.710> know<00:00:55.329> but

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
like a tour I think I don't know but

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.530 
like a tour I think I don't know but
it's<00:00:57.829> like<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:57.979> torque<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.729> will<00:00:58.940> fit<00:00:59.149> into<00:00:59.390> the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
it's like a torque it will fit into the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.520 
it's like a torque it will fit into the
screws<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:01.729> you<00:01:01.850> want<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.089> do<00:01:02.239> is<00:01:02.530> you

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
screws so what you want to do is you
want<00:01:05.020> unscrew

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:23.240 

you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:14.010> sure<00:01:14.190> they<00:01:14.400> unscrew

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.360
