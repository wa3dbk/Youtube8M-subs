00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
but I'm going back over the tools that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.770 
but I'm going back over the tools that
I've<00:00:14.519> reviewed<00:00:14.700> over<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> past<00:00:15.480> few<00:00:15.719> months

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.380 
I've reviewed over the past few months
to<00:00:16.260> basically<00:00:16.980> report<00:00:17.340> my<00:00:17.490> progress<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.210> see

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
to basically report my progress and see

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.939 
to basically report my progress and see
if<00:00:18.480> my<00:00:18.630> opinions<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.230> those<00:00:19.350> tools<00:00:19.680> have

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
if my opinions of those tools have

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.310 
if my opinions of those tools have
changed<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.180> some<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.539> them<00:00:21.689> may<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
changed and on some of them may have and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
on some of them they haven't so why

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.550 
on some of them they haven't so why
don't<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.539> started<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.199> first

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
don't we get started with the first

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.360 
it does what it's supposed to do in fact
you<00:00:41.670> probably<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.329> me<00:00:42.450> use<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.370> several

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you probably see me use it in several

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
you probably see me use it in several
videos<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.570> skeptical

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
videos so I was a little bit skeptical

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.190 
videos so I was a little bit skeptical
skeptical<00:00:46.649> about<00:00:46.980> ACDelco<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.660> start<00:00:49.020> with

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
skeptical about ACDelco to start with

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.049 
skeptical about ACDelco to start with
but<00:00:49.559> since<00:00:50.190> I've<00:00:50.340> been<00:00:50.489> using<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.000> I've

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
but since I've been using it and I've

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.810 
but since I've been using it and I've
got<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.329> say<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> I'm

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
got to say I I like it I like it I'm

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.470 
got to say I I like it I like it I'm
happy<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.239> I

happy with it I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.119 
happy with it I
I<00:00:54.510> had<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> snap-on<00:00:55.379> version<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.039> these

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I had a snap-on version of one of these

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
I had a snap-on version of one of these
that<00:00:56.370> might<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:57.000> smaller<00:00:57.469> but

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that might be a little bit smaller but

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860 
that might be a little bit smaller but
you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.129> what<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.670> like<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> serviceability

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you know what I like the serviceability

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
you know what I like the serviceability
the<00:01:01.230> brushes<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.129> like<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.000> tool

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the brushes on this I like this tool

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
the brushes on this I like this tool
very<00:01:03.480> much<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:04.409> long<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
very much as long as we're on the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.310 
very much as long as we're on the
subject<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.670> impacts<00:01:06.210> why<00:01:06.930> don't<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.140> talk

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
subject of impacts why don't we talk

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.850 
subject of impacts why don't we talk
about<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.299> 18-volt<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.869> wall<00:01:10.049> since<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.740> got

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
about the 18-volt the wall since I got

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.800 
about the 18-volt the wall since I got
the<00:01:11.010> 18-volt<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:12.030> happier<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.510> don't

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the 18-volt I'm much happier I don't

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.630 
the 18-volt I'm much happier I don't
have<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> 12<00:01:13.439> volt<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> sent<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> one

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
have the 12 volt here I sent that one

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
have the 12 volt here I sent that one
back<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.210> wasn't<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:15.990> happy<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
back I wasn't really happy with the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.020 
back I wasn't really happy with the
performance<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> 12<00:01:17.460> volt<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
performance of the 12 volt there was a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.480 
performance of the 12 volt there was a
lot<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.720> contention<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.830> whether<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.400> not

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
lot of contention about whether or not

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.100 
lot of contention about whether or not
the<00:01:20.670> 12<00:01:20.939> volt<00:01:21.119> tool<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.720> got<00:01:21.869> was

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the 12 volt tool that I got was

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
the 12 volt tool that I got was
defective<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:24.119> couldn't<00:01:24.420> do

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
defective because it really couldn't do

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
defective because it really couldn't do
all<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.960> much<00:01:25.229> we'll<00:01:25.740> never<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
all that much we'll never know because I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
all that much we'll never know because I
I<00:01:27.000> never<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.689> never<00:01:27.810> presented<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
I never I never presented it that way I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490 
I never I never presented it that way I
just<00:01:29.130> went<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.790> got<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.119> 18<00:01:30.509> volt<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.140> have

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
just went and got this 18 volt I do have

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
just went and got this 18 volt I do have
a<00:01:31.530> regret<00:01:31.950> however<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.180> regret<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.900> not

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
a regret however and that regret is not

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140 
a regret however and that regret is not
going<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> 20<00:01:35.009> volt<00:01:35.130> version<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
going for the 20 volt version of this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.690 
going for the 20 volt version of this
same<00:01:36.450> gun<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:38.310> thinking<00:01:38.640> about

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
same gun so if you're thinking about

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.789 
same gun so if you're thinking about
doing<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.659> might<00:01:39.930> consider<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.530> 20

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
doing this you might consider the 20

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.060 
doing this you might consider the 20
volt

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
volt

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
volt
well<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.700> let's<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.180> say<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.990> our

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
well it's let's just say that in our

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.080 
well it's let's just say that in our
experience<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.920> these<00:01:44.100> types<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.549> tools<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
experience with these types of tools it

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090 
experience with these types of tools it
seems<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.380> voltage<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.920> better

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
seems that the more voltage the better

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.179 
seems that the more voltage the better
so<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.210> couple<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:48.810> volts<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.890> may<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
so a couple more volts that may be

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
so a couple more volts that may be
something<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.729> definitely<00:01:51.240> consider<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
something to definitely consider and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.800 
something to definitely consider and
also<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.399> tool<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.790> balanced<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.479> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
also I the tool is balanced but this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200 
also I the tool is balanced but this
this<00:01:55.590> giant<00:01:55.979> battery<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> bottom<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.090> this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
this giant battery on the bottom of this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.690 
this giant battery on the bottom of this
thing<00:01:57.450> has<00:01:57.689> always<00:01:57.869> been<00:01:58.110> sort<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
thing has always been sort of a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
thing has always been sort of a
contention<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> mine<00:02:00.030> next<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.680> tight

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
contention of mine next up the tight

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.969 
contention of mine next up the tight
reach<00:02:02.100> tools<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:03.259> actually<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.439> seem<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
reach tools these actually you seem to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.889 
reach tools these actually you seem to
really<00:02:05.009> enjoy<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.700> review<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.299> haven't

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
really enjoy this review I haven't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.540 
really enjoy this review I haven't
really<00:02:07.079> had<00:02:07.200> too<00:02:07.409> much<00:02:07.560> cause<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.340> these

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
really had too much cause to use these

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.729 
really had too much cause to use these
lately<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> am<00:02:10.140> looking<00:02:10.410> forward<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
lately but but I am looking forward to

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.559 
lately but but I am looking forward to
opportunities<00:02:11.400> when<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.940> use<00:02:12.180> them

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
opportunities when I can use them

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.539 
opportunities when I can use them
I<00:02:12.629> am<00:02:12.959> gonna<00:02:13.230> gonna<00:02:13.859> use<00:02:14.069> them<00:02:14.249> into<00:02:14.430> those

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
I am gonna gonna use them into those

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.849 
I am gonna gonna use them into those
tight<00:02:14.879> spaces<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.540> almost<00:02:15.810> almost<00:02:16.379> forget<00:02:16.709> that

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
tight spaces I almost almost forget that

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.739 
tight spaces I almost almost forget that
they're<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.280> there<00:02:17.849> sometimes<00:02:18.359> but<00:02:18.480> these

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:18.749 
they're in there sometimes but these

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.319 
they're in there sometimes but these
tight<00:02:18.989> reach<00:02:19.200> tools<00:02:19.969> it's<00:02:20.969> an<00:02:21.150> interesting

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
tight reach tools it's an interesting

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.879 
tight reach tools it's an interesting
concept<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:21.989> I'm<00:02:22.139> looking<00:02:22.560> forward<00:02:22.829> to

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
concept that I'm looking forward to

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.890 
concept that I'm looking forward to
trying<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.219> more<00:02:23.400> many<00:02:23.969> of<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.209> asked<00:02:24.689> if<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
trying it more many of you asked if I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.509 
trying it more many of you asked if I
could<00:02:25.079> open<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.340> could<00:02:26.489> see

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
could open this up and you could see

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.759 
could open this up and you could see
what's<00:02:26.819> inside<00:02:26.999> was<00:02:27.840> actually<00:02:28.170> specifically

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
what's inside was actually specifically

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.890 
what's inside was actually specifically
requested<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.579> not<00:02:29.879> do<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.629> if<00:02:30.750> you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
requested that I not do that so if you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.959 
requested that I not do that so if you
want<00:02:31.139> to<00:02:31.230> see<00:02:31.439> what's<00:02:31.620> inside<00:02:31.799> these<00:02:32.159> you

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
want to see what's inside these you

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.089 
want to see what's inside these you
gotta<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.269> buy<00:02:33.389> some<00:02:33.599> for<00:02:33.750> yourself

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
gotta go buy some for yourself

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.819 
gotta go buy some for yourself
next<00:02:35.549> up<00:02:35.700> diamond<00:02:36.510> grip<00:02:36.810> gloves<00:02:37.170> they<00:02:37.680> have

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
next up diamond grip gloves they have

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.500 
next up diamond grip gloves they have
been<00:02:37.950> using<00:02:38.159> these<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.760> years<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.269> years<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
been using these for years and years and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.720 
been using these for years and years and
years<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.349> review<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.799> did<00:02:41.040> was<00:02:41.250> spot-on

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
years the review that I did was spot-on

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.659 
years the review that I did was spot-on
I<00:02:42.090> mean<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.389> covers<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:44.010> use<00:02:44.459> these

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669 
I mean it covers it I I use these

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.879 
I mean it covers it I I use these
however<00:02:44.939> there<00:02:45.719> are<00:02:45.870> several<00:02:46.319> other<00:02:46.799> options

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
however there are several other options

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.050 
however there are several other options
that<00:02:47.430> are<00:02:47.579> out<00:02:47.760> there

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that are out there

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.030 
that are out there
these<00:02:48.780> are<00:02:48.900> latex<00:02:49.319> gloves<00:02:49.620> if<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:49.889> have<00:02:50.010> a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
these are latex gloves if you have a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.220 
these are latex gloves if you have a
latex<00:02:50.400> allergy<00:02:50.659> you<00:02:51.659> don't<00:02:51.870> want<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.169> get

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
latex allergy you don't want to get

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.589 
latex allergy you don't want to get
latex<00:02:52.650> gloves<00:02:52.949> they<00:02:53.609> have<00:02:53.730> other<00:02:53.939> options<00:02:54.389> for

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
latex gloves they have other options for

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.539 
latex gloves they have other options for
you<00:02:54.780> in<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.109> case<00:02:55.379> choose<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:56.250> works<00:02:56.370> for

have bought a pretty decent like regular

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.990 
have bought a pretty decent like regular
scanner<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.430> only<00:04:41.580> difference

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
scanner so the and the only difference

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.400 
scanner so the and the only difference
would<00:04:42.090> be<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:42.450> one's<00:04:42.690> bluetooth<00:04:43.110> also

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
would be is this one's bluetooth also

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.740 
would be is this one's bluetooth also

rich<00:05:14.460> I'm<00:05:15.210> gonna<00:05:15.330> say<00:05:15.660> that<00:05:16.020> this<00:05:16.290> is<00:05:16.440> probably

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
rich I'm gonna say that this is probably

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.650 
rich I'm gonna say that this is probably
this<00:05:17.100> is<00:05:17.160> actually<00:05:17.880> one<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.180> main<00:05:18.330> reasons

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
this is actually one of the main reasons

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.710 
this is actually one of the main reasons
I<00:05:18.780> did<00:05:18.960> this<00:05:19.050> review<00:05:19.260> I<00:05:20.000> have<00:05:21.000> come<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.480> not

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
I did this review I have come to not

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.630 
I did this review I have come to not
like<00:05:21.990> these<00:05:22.230> so<00:05:22.470> much<00:05:22.680> I'm<00:05:23.070> not<00:05:23.130> going<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.460> say

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
like these so much I'm not going to say

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.340 
like these so much I'm not going to say
because<00:05:23.970> they're<00:05:24.180> made<00:05:24.330> in<00:05:24.420> China<00:05:24.690> but<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.110> will

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
because they're made in China but I will

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.670 
because they're made in China but I will
say<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:26.370> using<00:05:26.910> these<00:05:27.180> tools<00:05:27.570> in<00:05:27.990> practice

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
say that using these tools in practice

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.680 
say that using these tools in practice
has<00:05:28.980> become<00:05:29.190> light<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.120> can<00:05:30.270> see<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:30.540> right

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
has become light you can see it right

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.920 
has become light you can see it right
there

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
there

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.600 
there
especially<00:05:31.770> on<00:05:31.890> this<00:05:31.980> fourteen<00:05:32.400> millimeter

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
especially on this fourteen millimeter

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.160 
especially on this fourteen millimeter
the<00:05:32.940> minute<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.270> go<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.450> put<00:05:33.630> torque<00:05:33.900> on<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
the minute you go to put torque on the

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.130 
the minute you go to put torque on the
on<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.920> wrench<00:05:35.160> there<00:05:35.970> are<00:05:36.240> times<00:05:36.630> when<00:05:36.990> it

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
on the wrench there are times when it

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.810 
on the wrench there are times when it
will<00:05:37.230> suddenly<00:05:37.530> change<00:05:37.980> direction<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:38.610> flip

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
will suddenly change direction and flip

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.220 
will suddenly change direction and flip
back<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:39.030> other<00:05:39.300> way<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.690> I've<00:05:39.840> got<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.080> tell

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
back the other way and I've got to tell

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.160 
back the other way and I've got to tell
you<00:05:40.350> this<00:05:40.620> is<00:05:40.830> extremely<00:05:41.700> frustrating<00:05:42.180> when

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
you this is extremely frustrating when

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.420 
you this is extremely frustrating when
you're<00:05:43.290> trying<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.620> use<00:05:43.740> these<00:05:43.950> tools<00:05:44.220> now<00:05:44.400> I

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
you're trying to use these tools now I

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.680 
you're trying to use these tools now I
haven't<00:05:44.730> used<00:05:44.880> them<00:05:45.030> much<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.420> part<00:05:45.510> of<00:05:45.630> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
haven't used them much and part of the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.090 
haven't used them much and part of the
reason<00:05:45.930> is<00:05:46.050> is<00:05:46.230> because<00:05:46.380> when<00:05:46.710> I<00:05:46.740> started

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
reason is is because when I started

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.340 
reason is is because when I started
using<00:05:47.280> them<00:05:47.580> this<00:05:48.210> started<00:05:48.540> there<00:05:48.900> it<00:05:49.140> just

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
using them this started there it just

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.300 
using them this started there it just
happened<00:05:49.710> again<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:51.750> is<00:05:52.080> really<00:05:52.950> really

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
happened again and that is really really

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.010 
happened again and that is really really
frustrating<00:05:53.550> now<00:05:54.120> gearwrench<00:05:54.480> does<00:05:54.840> make<00:05:54.990> a

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
frustrating now gearwrench does make a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.050 
frustrating now gearwrench does make a
different<00:05:55.410> type<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:56.130> does<00:05:56.310> not<00:05:56.460> have<00:05:56.760> the

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
different type that does not have the

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.090 
different type that does not have the
the<00:05:57.360> switch<00:05:57.720> on<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.200> wrench<00:05:58.500> maybe<00:05:58.860> those

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
the switch on the wrench maybe those

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.310 
the switch on the wrench maybe those
work<00:05:59.340> better<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.270> I've<00:06:00.420> got<00:06:00.570> to<00:06:00.690> be<00:06:00.750> honest<00:06:01.140> I

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
work better but I've got to be honest I
