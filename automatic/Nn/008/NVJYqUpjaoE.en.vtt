00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello everyone, I want to spend today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.259
 small test 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.330
 these are the heads here once I am on my own 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.429
 channel review did them Chernigov 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 tool factory chernihiv those 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.660
 what seemed to me like you know how 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.199
 Soviet quality still heads why and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.710
 how are we going to experience but have appeared 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.430
 I have a small problem 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.410
 so that's all you know balloon key 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.410
 Now it is used on tire 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.930
 Lada 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:46.920
 19 and here mercedes balonnik 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 how were the bolts 17 key 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.730
 seemingly universal but see everything 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.829
 for some reason when they long ago they unscrew 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.949
 although this side did not unscrew anything 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.640
 never but the edges slip 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.510
 slip on the wheel bolts 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.689
 so im i twist not let go not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.869
 unscrew the wheels on mercedes vito 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.930
 so I have no other choice 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.810
 unscrew them so you decided to collect 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:26.570
 Here is such a design head for 17 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.570
 farther farther we take the knob 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.770
 dress up 1 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:47.710
 then put on the adapter 2 under the crank 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.340
 we dress 3 well and the knob itself 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.049
 which we will rotate and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.020
 Here we are 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.810
 the design is clear that with this crank I 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.220
 I think that I will not do 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.209
 piece of pipe this i think leverage 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.610
 should be enough 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:13.959
 try right on the front left wheel well 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:19.720
 there further it will be visible that so 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:24.000
 head well side to bolt 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.000
 so the wheel will begin 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.069
 as you can see everything wriggles all bends 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:42.879
 mate there is one there 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.750
 so it was there 2 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.170
 there are no bodies and shots 3 pack full pack 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.170
 everything is whole 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.430
 let's not let 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:34.200
 nehily so 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:41.159
 I fooled into place that is twisted 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:47.909
 loosened the screw and knocked 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:54.120
 the bolt that does not want us 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:57.599
 unscrew well and try again 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.599
 next and second 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.280
 is coming 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.750
 not and again 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:40.030
 and we have clothes 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:42.670
 I'm already here everything should be so well and the conclusion is that 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:51.070
 I can say everything you saw visually 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:55.060
 everything is whole and not bent and not a drop here 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:59.940
 everything is all right head whole 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:03.220
 they won't burst and the geeks too 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.760
 Well, as you know with a fool you can and 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.200
 one place to break but here you see what 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:16.210
 share attached heads seemingly like 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.420
 remained intact and I think that this them it 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.530
 tool on on our time but 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.110
 worthy quality do not think for 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.260
 advertising is just what I bought 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.700
 then I feel and I show you 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.410
 today all subscribe to my channel 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.310
