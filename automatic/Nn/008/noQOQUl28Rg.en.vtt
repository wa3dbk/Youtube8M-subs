00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

dry<00:00:54.840> after<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> used<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> started<00:00:57.120> doing

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
dry after I used it so I started doing

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.849 
dry after I used it so I started doing
some<00:00:57.600> research<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.199> things<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.739> have

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
some research and things and I have

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.950 
some research and things and I have
noticed<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.430> sulfates<00:01:00.149> were<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.480> good<00:01:00.780> for

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
noticed that sulfates were not good for

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.609 
noticed that sulfates were not good for
your<00:01:01.109> hair<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.239> I<00:01:03.239> looked<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.409> is

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
your hair and I looked and that is

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
your hair and I looked and that is
exactly<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.790> says<00:01:06.000> water<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
exactly what it has it says water and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.910 
exactly what it has it says water and
then<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> says<00:01:06.960> sodium<00:01:07.610> lathering<00:01:08.610> sulfates

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
then it says sodium lathering sulfates

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
then it says sodium lathering sulfates
so<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.790> pretty<00:01:12.420> sure<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:12.720> why<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.020> was

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
so I'm pretty sure that's why it was

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.750 
so I'm pretty sure that's why it was
drying<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:13.770> hair<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.430> hair<00:01:14.460> wasn't

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
drying out my hair and my hair wasn't

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.170 
drying out my hair and my hair wasn't
feeling<00:01:15.180> um<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:17.280> wasn't<00:01:17.460> feeling<00:01:17.759> nursed<00:01:17.970> at

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
feeling um it wasn't feeling nursed at

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
feeling um it wasn't feeling nursed at
all<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:19.170> didn't<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.860> shine

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
all and I didn't really see the shine

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.969 
all and I didn't really see the shine
boosting<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.790> all<00:01:21.090> really

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
boosting at all really

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
boosting at all really
so<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:24.570> says<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.710> revives<00:01:26.159> dull<00:01:26.850> dry<00:01:27.450> frizzy

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
so it says it revives dull dry frizzy

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.330 
so it says it revives dull dry frizzy
hair<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:29.159> also<00:01:29.400> paraben<00:01:30.000> free

definitely did leave my hair feeling
moisturized<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:38.360> was<00:02:38.480> really<00:02:38.630> hard<00:02:38.960> to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
moisturized but it was really hard to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.080 
moisturized but it was really hard to
feel<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.380> moisture<00:02:39.680> after<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.430> use<00:02:40.940> this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
feel the moisture after I use this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.910 
feel the moisture after I use this
shampoo<00:02:41.330> because<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.900> how<00:02:42.020> dry<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.560> with<00:02:42.740> my

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
shampoo because of how dry it with my

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.300 
shampoo because of how dry it with my
hair

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
hair

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.600 
hair
the<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.120> conditioner<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:46.100> didn't<00:02:46.520> really

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
the the conditioner it didn't really

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.540 
the the conditioner it didn't really
like<00:02:46.880> leave<00:02:47.450> my<00:02:47.600> hair<00:02:47.780> extra<00:02:48.200> soft<00:02:48.440> after<00:02:48.710> how

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
like leave my hair extra soft after how

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.710 
like leave my hair extra soft after how
rough<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.000> with<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.480> shampoo<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:52.540> I'm<00:02:53.540> not

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
rough it was with the shampoo so I'm not

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.360 
rough it was with the shampoo so I'm not
sure<00:02:53.780> if<00:02:54.020> it's<00:02:54.290> because<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.800> shampoo<00:02:55.040> why

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
sure if it's because of the shampoo why

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.860 
sure if it's because of the shampoo why
this<00:02:55.610> didn't<00:02:55.940> really<00:02:56.000> worked<00:02:56.420> really<00:02:56.630> good

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
this didn't really worked really good

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.080 
this didn't really worked really good
but<00:02:57.470> when<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.650> did<00:02:57.920> use<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.340> its<00:02:58.520> own<00:02:58.670> my<00:02:58.880> hair

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
but when I did use it on its own my hair

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.570 
but when I did use it on its own my hair
was<00:02:59.240> soft<00:02:59.480> but<00:02:59.780> not<00:02:59.990> as<00:03:00.320> soft<00:03:00.590> as<00:03:00.770> it's<00:03:01.340> been

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
was soft but not as soft as it's been

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.580 
was soft but not as soft as it's been
with<00:03:01.730> other<00:03:01.970> shame<00:03:02.330> with<00:03:02.750> other<00:03:02.960> conditioners

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
with other shame with other conditioners

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.130 
with other shame with other conditioners
so<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.640> would<00:03:05.150> definitely<00:03:05.480> say<00:03:05.570> this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.870> good

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
so I would definitely say this is a good

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.260 
so I would definitely say this is a good
conditioner<00:03:06.770> if<00:03:06.980> you're<00:03:07.640> starting<00:03:08.030> out<00:03:08.090> on

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.380 
in all aspects like I've used a better
hair<00:04:00.830> mask<00:04:01.330> before<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:03.620> mask<00:04:04.120> when<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.150> would

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
hair mask before this mask when I would

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.840 
hair mask before this mask when I would

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
use it like I guess it's kind of a

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.640 
use it like I guess it's kind of a
protein<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:08.480> like<00:04:08.630> strengthen<00:04:09.110> your<00:04:09.230> hair<00:04:09.440> but

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
protein to like strengthen your hair but

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
it didn't really help what really helped

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.820 
it didn't really help what really helped
me<00:04:12.560> was<00:04:12.680> when<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:12.920> use<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.460> UM<00:04:14.260> black<00:04:15.260> tirant

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.490 
me was when I use the UM black tirant
that<00:04:16.489> helped<00:04:16.850> way<00:04:17.060> more<00:04:17.330> than<00:04:17.540> even<00:04:18.410> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
that helped way more than even the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.300 
that helped way more than even the
restorative<00:04:18.980> hair<00:04:19.160> masks<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.020> um
