00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.849
 it will be time to bake again 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.340
 the user called that I can not 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.740
 resist the noises do 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.719
 I'm sorry the mine years work too 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.410
 I can absolutely give it away 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.400
 on such an idea can come and then whether 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.470
 in the sun but window to further 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 sweaty and then quickly and then 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.660
 the culprit is me here on vision that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.969
 We were also a liquid because of that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.630
 Great background noise you have yes 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.149
 not every day and we do 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.500
 an apple quangel that is so 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 American and I like those 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.010
 i have done american system 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.420
 I never tend to me that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.379
 I will not succeed somehow 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.199
 the feeling but you can try it yes 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.649
 then I tell you what ingredients you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.649
 need 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.630
 you need us to need it 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.790
 mail history and the columns 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.230
 cut apples now there's always 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.230
 laugh out loud again 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.070
 Well, in the window pierced sugar 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.070
 and we will probably be the window 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:31.850
 too and the temperature rises by 50 degrees 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:35.690
 to the juice of a lemon and something are 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.170
 So not so many look what you 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.660
 So now the recipe says so 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.100
 I should go with the apple slices 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.540
 Drizzle lemon juice 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.540
 Of course I will do that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:02.920
 Of course, I want to be stronger too 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:06.460
 lemon also come from all sides and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:13.600
 the hands of course nice what before 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.100
 not afterwards but also everybody should now 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.820
 what about lemon juice 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.860
 let's see how it goes on like that 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.780
 Casserole dish here is not like that 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.630
 difficult duties did not wash 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.550
 I greased the recipe 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.570
 warned to do that and I always do 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.330
 Here's what the recipe I did that too 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.330
 and therefore just served 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.370
 there is not that one now 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.980
 especially to lie down or where so 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:53.970
 without one arrives and then can distribute 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.970
 one so that everything is covered 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.330
 yes that was not so difficult now 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.590
 what is now so out comes the goal 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:16.650
 is here in the bowl 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:23.720
 to the sugar comes in there is the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:26.940
 butter and that is now with the hands 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.519
 kneaded it is supposed to be a dispute 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.420
 be kneaded so i have never 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.420
 in dispute 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.209
 that must be a bit clunky I hope 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.209
 that I am here now 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.540
 as you can see is the dough 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.540
 really puny 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.500
 but actually that much is clear 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.870
 stronger than it was then eick changes 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.430
 just something cinnamon 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.550
 who there is absolutely no cinnamon market there 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.350
 can you count on four of us 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.540
 then mixed with the tank again 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.440
 if you wrestled with the casserole again 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.850
 the apples and spread the strew 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.850
 just shown on it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.819
 so the apples are complete with the 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:43.050
 sprinkle and cover and then that comes 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:47.360
 just as it is for about 30 minutes at 200 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.360
 Grad upper bottom heat in the preheated 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.539
 I should have read that on the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.789
 Best there are a bit of vanilla 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:07.050
 ice but we fall there too he will 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:09.150
 there you exactly want to imitate it 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.189
 then look at graviano de finds that 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.800
 your recipe and the right one 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:16.110
 Details of the ingredients also small 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.639
 reviews of Peter and me and then 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.900
 Have fun while copying 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.900
 and a good appetite
