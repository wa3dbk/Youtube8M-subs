just put it over this like like a hanger
pretty<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.360> only<00:00:48.570> doing<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.440> so

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
pretty much we are only doing this so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.610 
pretty much we are only doing this so
that<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.309> don't<00:00:50.610> cut<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.449> front<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
that we don't cut the front of the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.830 
that we don't cut the front of the
t-shirt<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.850> take<00:00:53.969> your<00:00:54.539> paper

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
t-shirt now you just take your paper

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.439 
t-shirt now you just take your paper
cutter<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:56.190> under<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> collar<00:00:57.000> like

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
cutter and right under the collar like

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.150 
cutter and right under the collar like
this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.719> all<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:58.020> approximation<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
this is all an approximation so you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.729 
this is all an approximation so you
don't<00:00:59.399> need<00:00:59.550> measurements<00:01:00.020> make<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> slit<00:01:01.500> on

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
don't need measurements make a slit on

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
don't need measurements make a slit on
the<00:01:01.800> t-shirt<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.609> under<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> collar<00:01:03.480> there

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the t-shirt right under the collar there

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
the t-shirt right under the collar there
are<00:01:04.260> no<00:01:04.409> real<00:01:04.710> measurements<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.180> can

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
are no real measurements here so you can

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
are no real measurements here so you can
go<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.720> approximations<00:01:07.350> I've<00:01:08.040> made<00:01:08.310> about

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
go with approximations I've made about

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760 
go with approximations I've made about
this<00:01:08.790> much<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.330> slit<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.990> obviously<00:01:10.470> go

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this much of a slit you can obviously go

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
this much of a slit you can obviously go
wider<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> want<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.030> means<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
wider if you want but that just means it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.539 
wider if you want but that just means it
will<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.350> ill<00:01:13.619> show<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.340> back
