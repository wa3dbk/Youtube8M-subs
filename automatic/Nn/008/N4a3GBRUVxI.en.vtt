00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.000 

with<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.280> level<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:41.240> I<00:02:41.270> know<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:42.010> these

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
with this level now I know that these

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.850 
with this level now I know that these
two<00:02:43.280> cinder<00:02:43.550> blocks<00:02:43.880> are<00:02:44.540> level<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:45.650> each

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
two cinder blocks are level with each

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.190 
two cinder blocks are level with each
other<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.370> can<00:02:46.400> lay<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:47.060> pond<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.870> top<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.200> this

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.290 

okay<00:02:55.200> what<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.530> here<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.459> drain<00:02:56.819> for

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
okay what we have here is the drain for

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300 
okay what we have here is the drain for
the<00:02:57.360> pond<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:59.780> see<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.959> right<00:03:01.170> here<00:03:01.380> that's

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
the pond and see this right here that's

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.930 
the pond and see this right here that's
just<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:03.200> spigot<00:03:04.310> okay<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:05.610> easy<00:03:05.790> to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
just the spigot okay so it's easy to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.910 
just the spigot okay so it's easy to
clean<00:03:06.060> when<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.930> want<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.230> drain<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> plow

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
clean when I want to drain the plow

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.370 
clean when I want to drain the plow
turn<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.610> spigot<00:03:08.819> on<00:03:09.060> while<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> flushes<00:03:10.200> out

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
turn the spigot on while the flushes out

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.140 
turn the spigot on while the flushes out
close<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.860> spigot<00:03:11.610> fill<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.090> up<00:03:12.180> again

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.420 

once<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.870> got<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.140> two<00:03:19.319> cinder<00:03:19.620> blocks<00:03:19.920> level

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
once you got the two cinder blocks level

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.510 
once you got the two cinder blocks level
all<00:03:21.270> you<00:03:21.420> got<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.660> do<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.340> latest<00:03:23.340> on

tilting<00:04:30.509> to<00:04:30.750> one<00:04:30.930> side<00:04:31.229> is<00:04:31.710> because<00:04:32.570> when<00:04:33.570> I

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
tilting to one side is because when I

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.420 
tilting to one side is because when I
put<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:33.990> cinder<00:04:34.440> blocks<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:34.860> there<00:04:35.009> I<00:04:35.070> use

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
you get a nice level palm with the water

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.390 
you get a nice level palm with the water
rising<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.630> top<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.680> stays<00:04:52.949> nice<00:04:53.370> and
