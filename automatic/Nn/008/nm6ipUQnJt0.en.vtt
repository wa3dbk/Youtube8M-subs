00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
delve into all that and more so let's

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.389 
delve into all that and more so let's
draw<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:33.410> there's<00:00:33.829> this<00:00:33.920> whole<00:00:34.160> argument

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
draw so there's this whole argument

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.220 
draw so there's this whole argument
going<00:00:34.850> around<00:00:35.059> over<00:00:35.360> wine<00:00:35.629> on<00:00:35.870> creature

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
going around over wine on creature

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.209 
going around over wine on creature
spells<00:00:36.469> are<00:00:36.590> getting<00:00:36.800> nerfed<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.160> why

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
spells are getting nerfed and why

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.650 
spells are getting nerfed and why
creatures<00:00:37.489> are<00:00:37.790> getting<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.149> much<00:00:38.270> better<00:00:38.480> of

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
creatures are getting so much better of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.420 
creatures are getting so much better of
a<00:00:38.719> boost<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:39.140> thus<00:00:39.410> why<00:00:39.649> blue<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:39.950> getting<00:00:40.280> so

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
a boost and thus why blue is getting so

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.739 
a boost and thus why blue is getting so
much<00:00:40.550> worse<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:40.940> why<00:00:41.030> white<00:00:41.210> is<00:00:41.359> getting<00:00:41.600> so

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:41.749 
much worse and why white is getting so

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:43.329 
much worse and why white is getting so
much<00:00:41.870> better<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:42.440> let's<00:00:42.859> look<00:00:43.010> at<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.160> non

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339
