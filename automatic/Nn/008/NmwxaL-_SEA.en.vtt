00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
I looked in the rocks and I found this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.979

GoPro<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> GoPro<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:33.180> his<00:00:33.420> phone<00:00:33.630> number

files<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> computer<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.600> when

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
