warlords of draenor video this time I'm

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.970 
warlords of draenor video this time I'm
going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.720> be<00:00:03.840> taking<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.200> look<00:00:04.380> at<00:00:04.560> some<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
going to be taking a look at some of the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.740 
going to be taking a look at some of the
crafted<00:00:05.430> gear<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.819> we're<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.150> find<00:00:06.450> in

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
crafted gear that we're going to find in

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.870 
crafted gear that we're going to find in
the<00:00:06.899> expansion<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:08.010> I've<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.460> say<00:00:08.610> some

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
the expansion and I've got to say some

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.310 
the expansion and I've got to say some
of<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.030> graphic<00:00:09.389> gear<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.750> really<00:00:10.170> looking

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
of this graphic gear is really looking

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.830 
of this graphic gear is really looking
kind<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.010> great<00:00:11.250> actually<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:12.389> fact<00:00:12.570> some<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
kind of great actually in fact some of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.810 
kind of great actually in fact some of
it<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.230> looking<00:00:13.950> nearly<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> quality<00:00:14.730> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
it is looking nearly on the quality of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.090 
it is looking nearly on the quality of
tier<00:00:15.059> gear<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.599> kind<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.289> better<00:00:16.529> than<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.070> I

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
tier gear and kind of better than that I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.460 
tier gear and kind of better than that I
love<00:00:17.400> our<00:00:17.520> stuff<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.090> saw<00:00:18.270> data<00:00:19.020> mine<00:00:19.230> so

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
love our stuff that we saw data mine so

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.620 
love our stuff that we saw data mine so
first<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.789> cloth<00:00:21.300> set<00:00:21.570> i

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
first of all this is the cloth set i

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.259 
first of all this is the cloth set i
think<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:21.990> recolor<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.650> pretty<00:00:23.430> okay<00:00:23.880> i<00:00:23.910> get

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
think this recolor is pretty okay i get

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.570 
think this recolor is pretty okay i get
yeah<00:00:24.630> whatever<00:00:25.050> let's<00:00:25.470> go<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.890> general<00:00:26.490> though

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
yeah whatever let's go in general though

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.130 
yeah whatever let's go in general though
with<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.760> set<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.330> shoulders<00:00:27.779> are

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
with the set i think the shoulders are

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
with the set i think the shoulders are
yesterday<00:00:28.830> baked<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.580> actual<00:00:29.820> design<00:00:30.179> on

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
yesterday baked but the actual design on

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.849 
yesterday baked but the actual design on
them<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.570> pretty<00:00:30.810> cool<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:31.830> they've

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
them is pretty cool I like what they've

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.400 
them is pretty cool I like what they've
got<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> crystals<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.899> think

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
got going on with the crystals I think

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.270 
got going on with the crystals I think
we're<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:34.770> quite<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> lot<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we're going to see quite a lot of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.160 
we're going to see quite a lot of
crystalline<00:00:35.760> armor<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.270> expansion<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
crystalline armor in the expansion and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.530 
crystalline armor in the expansion and
overall<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> really<00:00:38.760> solid<00:00:39.120> set

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
overall it's just a really solid set

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.750 
overall it's just a really solid set
also<00:00:39.750> i<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.559> particular<00:00:40.950> recolor<00:00:41.550> with

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
also i like this particular recolor with

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.450 
also i like this particular recolor with
the<00:00:41.879> gold<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.559> yeah<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.920> kind<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> gold

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the gold and yeah the kind of gold

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.889 
the gold and yeah the kind of gold
purple<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.360> blue<00:00:45.510> highlights

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
purple then with the blue highlights

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.299 
purple then with the blue highlights
that<00:00:46.110> i<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.350> would<00:00:46.559> look<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:47.070> alliance

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
that i think would look well an alliance

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.220 
that i think would look well an alliance
themed<00:00:47.640> character<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:48.840> pretty<00:00:49.050> nice

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
themed character so that's pretty nice

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.720 
themed character so that's pretty nice
and<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.340> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> back

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and then there's this thing at the back

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.279 
and then there's this thing at the back
I'm<00:00:50.969> not<00:00:51.180> too<00:00:51.449> sure<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> they're<00:00:52.170> not

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
I'm not too sure like that they're not

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
I'm not too sure like that they're not
really<00:00:52.530> something<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.860> particularly<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.820> but

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
really something I particularly like but

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
really something I particularly like but
I<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.719> people<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.530> them<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.070> i

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
I know a lot of people do like them so i

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.599 
I know a lot of people do like them so i
suppose<00:00:57.059> fair<00:00:57.510> enough<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.219> also<00:00:59.370> at

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
suppose fair enough there and also at

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
suppose fair enough there and also at
the<00:00:59.699> helm<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.180> don't<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> helmet<00:01:01.440> self

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the helm I don't think the helmet self

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.000 
the helm I don't think the helmet self
is<00:01:01.890> particularly<00:01:02.579> great<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:04.010> that's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is particularly great but that's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.649 
is particularly great but that's
probably<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> personal

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
probably just down to personal

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
probably just down to personal
preference<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
preference really and then I think this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.359 
preference really and then I think this
red<00:01:09.540> recolor<00:01:10.049> once<00:01:10.409> again<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.010> pretty

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
red recolor once again it it's pretty

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
red recolor once again it it's pretty
okay<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.360> bit<00:01:12.479> weaker<00:01:12.720> than<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
okay it's a little bit weaker than the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.580 
okay it's a little bit weaker than the
other<00:01:13.170> two<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.680> me<00:01:13.799> though<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.590> part

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
other two for me though because the part

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.350 
other two for me though because the part
that<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.189> been<00:01:17.310> gold<00:01:17.610> gilded<00:01:18.210> which

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that would have been gold gilded which

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780 
that would have been gold gilded which
really<00:01:18.570> brought<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> color<00:01:19.530> into<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
really brought a lot of color into the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.359 
really brought a lot of color into the
piece<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> armor<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:22.650> kind<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> coppery

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
piece of armor is now kind of a coppery

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
piece of armor is now kind of a coppery
color<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.119> makes<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> look<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
color and that just makes it look a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.060 
color and that just makes it look a
little<00:01:24.810> bit<00:01:25.049> washed<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.530> devoid<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
little bit washed out and devoid of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.340 
little bit washed out and devoid of
color<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.360> too<00:01:27.509> much<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.869> my<00:01:27.960> tastes

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
color just a bit too much for my tastes

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.780 
color just a bit too much for my tastes
I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.340> slightly<00:01:29.610> better

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I think this one does a slightly better

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.399 
I think this one does a slightly better
job<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> shine<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.720> comes<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
job with the shine that comes off the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.950 
job with the shine that comes off the
shoulders<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.979> overall<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:33.060> pretty<00:01:33.750> decent

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
shoulders and overall is pretty decent

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.399 
shoulders and overall is pretty decent
so<00:01:34.590> yeah<00:01:35.369> well<00:01:35.670> done<00:01:35.850> recolor<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.479> yeah

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so yeah well done recolor and yeah

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
so yeah well done recolor and yeah
here's<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> final<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.180> does

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
here's the final one what this one does

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.100 
here's the final one what this one does
well<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.759> contrast<00:01:42.390> between<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
well is and the contrast between the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
well is and the contrast between the
shininess<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.280> metal<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.210> then

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
shininess of this like metal and then

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.980 
shininess of this like metal and then
the<00:01:46.079> dark<00:01:46.409> green<00:01:47.220> material<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.720> kind

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the dark green material that just kind

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.590 
the dark green material that just kind
of<00:01:49.159> really<00:01:50.159> draws<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.820> light<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
of really draws a lot of light and the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.780 
of really draws a lot of light and the
kind<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.140> eye<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.369> armory

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
kind of your eye to the more armory

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
kind of your eye to the more armory
parts<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.570> thing<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.530> I

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
parts now one thing actually that I

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.080 
parts now one thing actually that I
should<00:01:55.829> probably<00:01:55.920> imagine<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.790> does

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
should probably imagine is this does

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.969 
should probably imagine is this does
look<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.600> cloth<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.439> me<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> haven't<00:01:58.890> really

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
look like cloth to me I haven't really

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.530 
look like cloth to me I haven't really
seen<00:01:59.189> cloth<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.579> looks<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
seen cloth that looks like that so a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.709 
seen cloth that looks like that so a
little<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:00.899> odd<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.860> suppose<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.090> top<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
little bit odd and I suppose the top of

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.830 
little bit odd and I suppose the top of
this<00:02:03.960> nearly<00:02:04.259> looks<00:02:04.530> like

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
this nearly looks like

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840 
this nearly looks like
I<00:02:06.020> don't<00:02:06.590> know<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.859> just<00:02:06.890> looks<00:02:07.219> like<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.579> part

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
I don't know it just looks like a part

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.869 
I don't know it just looks like a part
of<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.259> mm-hmm<00:02:09.259> it's<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.489> top<00:02:10.670> half

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
of the mm-hmm it's like the top half

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.070 
of the mm-hmm it's like the top half
doesn't<00:02:11.209> flow<00:02:11.390> into<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.690> bottom<00:02:12.050> half

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
doesn't flow into the bottom half

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.920 
doesn't flow into the bottom half
particularly<00:02:12.980> well<00:02:13.340> I'm<00:02:13.819> not<00:02:14.599> too<00:02:14.750> sure

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
particularly well I'm not too sure

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.710 
particularly well I'm not too sure
exactly<00:02:15.260> hmm<00:02:16.190> yeah<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.970> know<00:02:17.090> what<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.480> think

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
exactly hmm yeah you know what I think

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.270 
exactly hmm yeah you know what I think
it's<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> pretty<00:02:18.080> cool<00:02:18.260> piece<00:02:18.470> let's<00:02:18.769> just<00:02:18.890> move

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
it's a pretty cool piece let's just move

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.210 
it's a pretty cool piece let's just move
on<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.269> which<00:02:20.690> i<00:02:21.050> think<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.530> maybe<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
on to this which i think is maybe the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.970 
on to this which i think is maybe the
weakest<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> bits<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.049> I've<00:02:24.260> seen<00:02:24.680> for

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
weakest of the bits that I've seen for

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.460 
weakest of the bits that I've seen for
this<00:02:25.069> crafted<00:02:25.519> gear<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.940> mean<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.599> okay<00:02:27.019> but

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
this crafted gear I mean it's okay but

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.400 
this crafted gear I mean it's okay but
it's<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:29.090> not<00:02:29.150> particularly<00:02:29.750> exciting<00:02:30.230> it

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
it's just not particularly exciting it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.140 
it's just not particularly exciting it
looks<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.860> it's<00:02:31.069> missing<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.640> few<00:02:31.730> details

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
looks like it's missing a few details

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.780 
looks like it's missing a few details
honestly<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.680> think<00:02:33.890> because<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.370> it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
honestly and I think because of that it

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.539 
honestly and I think because of that it
could<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.569> be<00:02:35.750> unfinished<00:02:36.549> there's

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
could just be unfinished there's

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.819 
could just be unfinished there's
something<00:02:37.790> about<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.120> though<00:02:38.269> it<00:02:38.569> just<00:02:39.260> it

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
something about it though it just it

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.759 
something about it though it just it
like<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.880> like<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.180> lacks<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.769> finishing

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
like it's like it lacks the finishing

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.770 
like it's like it lacks the finishing
touches<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.400> then<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.329> polish<00:02:44.630> should

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
touches and then the polish should

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.330 
touches and then the polish should
really<00:02:45.019> bring<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.319> up<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.620> make<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.769> look<00:02:45.920> like

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
really bring it up to make it look like

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.910 
really bring it up to make it look like
a<00:02:46.370> really<00:02:46.549> cool<00:02:46.790> piece<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:48.290> one<00:02:48.530> here<00:02:48.799> though

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
a really cool piece this one here though

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.199 
a really cool piece this one here though
i<00:02:48.950> think<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:49.340> pretty<00:02:49.519> decent-looking<00:02:49.910> it's

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
i think is pretty decent-looking it's

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.150 
i think is pretty decent-looking it's
the<00:02:50.329> more<00:02:50.450> Alliance<00:02:50.720> eteamz<00:02:51.019> one<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.470> suppose

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
the more Alliance eteamz one I suppose

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.670 
the more Alliance eteamz one I suppose
it's<00:02:52.459> once<00:02:52.790> again<00:02:52.879> got<00:02:53.450> blue<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.079> gold<00:02:54.410> which

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's once again got blue and gold which

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.670 
it's once again got blue and gold which
I<00:02:54.799> think<00:02:54.980> looks<00:02:55.040> really<00:02:55.579> really<00:02:56.060> well<00:02:56.239> and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
I think looks really really well and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.220 
I think looks really really well and
once<00:02:57.680> again<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:58.129> doesn't<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:59.230> overall

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
once again it doesn't this so overall

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.740 
once again it doesn't this so overall
nice<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.709> nice<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.220> good<00:03:01.400> then<00:03:02.000> next<00:03:02.269> this

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
nice and nice and good then next this

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.850 
nice and nice and good then next this
one<00:03:03.019> is<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:04.099> it's<00:03:04.489> okay<00:03:04.970> i<00:03:05.000> guess<00:03:05.690> maybe<00:03:06.440> I

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
one is is it's okay i guess maybe I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.699 
one is is it's okay i guess maybe I
don't<00:03:07.459> know<00:03:07.760> I'm<00:03:08.120> just<00:03:08.480> not<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.989> biggest<00:03:09.620> fan

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
don't know I'm just not the biggest fan

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.059 
don't know I'm just not the biggest fan
of<00:03:10.069> these<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.510> these<00:03:11.780> leather<00:03:12.049> sets<00:03:12.500> honestly

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
of these and these leather sets honestly

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.729 
of these and these leather sets honestly
but<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:14.600> have<00:03:14.690> good<00:03:14.870> news<00:03:15.049> because<00:03:15.290> here's<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
but we have good news because here's the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.250 
but we have good news because here's the
mail<00:03:15.920> now<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:16.609> think<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.569> let's<00:03:17.930> just<00:03:18.079> forget

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
mail now I think that let's just forget

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.140 
mail now I think that let's just forget
about<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.560> helm<00:03:18.739> for<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.010> second<00:03:19.400> without<00:03:19.970> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.479 
about the helm for a second without the
helm<00:03:20.389> this<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.049> fantastic<00:03:21.470> bit<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.310> mail

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
helm this is a fantastic bit of mail

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.759 
helm this is a fantastic bit of mail
armor<00:03:22.849> because<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.480> looks<00:03:23.690> like<00:03:23.840> mail<00:03:24.260> armor

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
armor because it looks like mail armor

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.099 
armor because it looks like mail armor
it<00:03:25.010> doesn't<00:03:25.609> look<00:03:25.670> crazy<00:03:26.269> with<00:03:26.599> a<00:03:26.630> light<00:03:26.840> bulb

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
it doesn't look crazy with a light bulb

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.800 
it doesn't look crazy with a light bulb
like<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.530> tier<00:03:27.769> 16<00:03:28.459> hunter<00:03:28.849> I<00:03:29.030> just<00:03:29.660> think

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
like the tier 16 hunter I just think

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.199 
like the tier 16 hunter I just think
this<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.049> fantastic<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.859> really<00:03:31.489> really<00:03:32.030> like

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
this is fantastic I really really like

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.750 
this is fantastic I really really like
it<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.569> then<00:03:33.200> as<00:03:33.349> for<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.769> crystalline<00:03:34.340> stuff

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
it and then as for the crystalline stuff

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.920 
it and then as for the crystalline stuff
going<00:03:35.000> on<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.239> shoulders<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.630> think<00:03:35.780> that's

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
going on the shoulders I think that's

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.009 
going on the shoulders I think that's
pretty<00:03:36.109> cool<00:03:36.319> as<00:03:36.470> well<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:36.980> fair<00:03:37.340> enough<00:03:37.549> there

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
pretty cool as well so fair enough there

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.530 
pretty cool as well so fair enough there
but<00:03:39.019> overall<00:03:39.139> just<00:03:39.889> a<00:03:40.010> really<00:03:40.400> nice<00:03:40.669> set<00:03:41.060> and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
but overall just a really nice set and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.379 
but overall just a really nice set and
now<00:03:42.079> as<00:03:42.349> for<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.650> helm<00:03:42.889> I<00:03:43.190> maybe<00:03:43.940> not<00:03:44.359> a

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
now as for the helm I maybe not a

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.140 
now as for the helm I maybe not a
hundred<00:03:44.690> percent<00:03:44.840> sold<00:03:45.440> on<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.370> horns<00:03:46.819> on<00:03:46.970> it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
hundred percent sold on the horns on it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.199 
hundred percent sold on the horns on it
they<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.630> look<00:03:48.079> kind<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.650> random<00:03:49.160> really<00:03:49.459> so

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
they just look kind of random really so

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.390 
they just look kind of random really so
not<00:03:50.810> particularly<00:03:51.380> sure<00:03:51.560> about<00:03:51.799> that<00:03:52.069> but

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
not particularly sure about that but

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.729 
not particularly sure about that but
overall<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.540> really<00:03:53.870> really<00:03:54.169> nice<00:03:54.380> set

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
overall just a really really nice set

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.460 
overall just a really really nice set
and<00:03:55.040> then<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.700> Horde<00:03:55.880> one<00:03:56.060> unfortunately<00:03:57.049> I

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
and then the Horde one unfortunately I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.319 
and then the Horde one unfortunately I
think<00:03:57.769> suffers<00:03:58.430> from<00:03:58.579> being<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.910> little<00:03:59.120> bit

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
think suffers from being a little bit

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.670 
think suffers from being a little bit
washed<00:03:59.540> out<00:03:59.810> in<00:03:59.930> terms<00:04:00.139> of<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.260> color<00:04:00.440> palette

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
washed out in terms of the color palette

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.530 
washed out in terms of the color palette
you<00:04:01.160> just<00:04:01.340> look<00:04:01.459> around<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.760> chest<00:04:02.000> area<00:04:02.239> it's

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
you just look around the chest area it's

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.210 
you just look around the chest area it's
all<00:04:02.690> kind<00:04:03.049> of<00:04:03.139> the<00:04:03.260> same<00:04:03.440> color<00:04:03.739> at<00:04:03.980> least<00:04:04.160> very

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
all kind of the same color at least very

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.729 
all kind of the same color at least very
close<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:05.030> whereas<00:04:05.989> with<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:06.260> Alliance<00:04:06.590> one

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
close and whereas with the Alliance one

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.140 
close and whereas with the Alliance one
there<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:06.980> little<00:04:07.099> bit<00:04:07.280> more<00:04:07.459> different<00:04:07.940> so

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
there a little bit more different so

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.000 
there a little bit more different so
that's<00:04:08.359> where<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.079> think<00:04:09.109> things<00:04:09.620> are<00:04:09.739> just<00:04:09.799> a

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
that's where I think things are just a

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.490 
that's where I think things are just a
little<00:04:10.040> bit<00:04:10.370> unfortunate<00:04:11.030> for<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.419> I<00:04:11.870> say<00:04:12.349> the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
little bit unfortunate for the I say the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.020 
little bit unfortunate for the I say the
Horde<00:04:12.680> version<00:04:13.069> look<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.609> more<00:04:13.760> horde

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
Horde version look the more horde

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.670 
Horde version look the more horde
colored<00:04:14.480> version

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
colored version

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.400 
colored version
still<00:04:16.489> though<00:04:16.699> a<00:04:16.910> nice<00:04:17.209> bit<00:04:17.479> of<00:04:17.509> armor<00:04:17.900> one

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
still though a nice bit of armor one

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.719 
still though a nice bit of armor one
that<00:04:18.650> one<00:04:18.739> interesting<00:04:19.190> thing<00:04:19.220> though<00:04:19.370> if<00:04:19.609> you

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
that one interesting thing though if you

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.430 
that one interesting thing though if you
just<00:04:20.060> look<00:04:20.209> at<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.389> legs<00:04:20.630> there<00:04:20.930> has<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.169> lot<00:04:21.410> of

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
just look at the legs there has a lot of

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.469 
just look at the legs there has a lot of
depth<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:22.130> every<00:04:22.940> well<00:04:23.060> it's<00:04:23.240> just<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
depth and every well it's just the

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.450 
depth and every well it's just the
shading<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.410> well<00:04:24.830> done<00:04:25.009> when<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.250> move<00:04:25.370> to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
shading is is well done when you move to

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.469 
shading is is well done when you move to
the<00:04:25.550> side<00:04:25.729> though<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:26.030> course<00:04:26.060> that's<00:04:26.419> just

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
the side though of course that's just

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.270 
the side though of course that's just
the<00:04:26.630> painted<00:04:26.930> on<00:04:27.020> texture<00:04:27.560> but<00:04:27.770> they

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
the painted on texture but they

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.800 
the painted on texture but they
certainly<00:04:28.490> do<00:04:28.759> a<00:04:28.789> good<00:04:29.030> job<00:04:29.090> with<00:04:29.419> what<00:04:29.630> they

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
certainly do a good job with what they

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.439 
certainly do a good job with what they
have<00:04:30.020> with<00:04:30.889> these<00:04:31.070> pieces<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.490> gear<00:04:31.759> another

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
have with these pieces of gear another

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.879 
have with these pieces of gear another
thing<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.750> just<00:04:33.139> want<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.410> say<00:04:33.560> is<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.710> i<00:04:33.860> think

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
thing I just want to say is that i think

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.100 
thing I just want to say is that i think
the<00:04:34.130> boots<00:04:34.370> are<00:04:34.669> looking<00:04:34.940> quite<00:04:35.090> good<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.720> the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
the boots are looking quite good and the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.150 
the boots are looking quite good and the
belt<00:04:36.350> is<00:04:36.710> not<00:04:36.789> a<00:04:37.789> complete<00:04:38.300> WWE<00:04:39.199> belt<00:04:39.410> it<00:04:39.830> is

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
belt is not a complete WWE belt it is

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.719 
belt is not a complete WWE belt it is
partially<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.759> WWE<00:04:41.539> belt<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.590> still<00:04:43.220> not<00:04:43.490> as

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
partially a WWE belt so still not as

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.969 
partially a WWE belt so still not as
small<00:04:44.060> as<00:04:44.270> I'd<00:04:44.419> like<00:04:44.600> it<00:04:44.840> but<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.470> think<00:04:45.830> it

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
small as I'd like it but I think it

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.110 
small as I'd like it but I think it
works<00:04:46.250> for<00:04:46.520> what<00:04:46.699> it<00:04:46.820> is<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.889> yeah<00:04:48.889> good<00:04:49.820> going

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
works for what it is and yeah good going

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.330 
works for what it is and yeah good going

think<00:05:00.680> one<00:05:01.190> of<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.370> things<00:05:01.400> that's<00:05:01.729> really

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
think one of the things that's really

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.120 
think one of the things that's really
well<00:05:02.120> done<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.690> helm<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.500> that<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.979> hell

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
well done is the helm and that the hell

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.100 
well done is the helm and that the hell
makes<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.669> head<00:05:04.849> look<00:05:05.090> quite<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.360> lot<00:05:05.630> larger

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
makes the head look quite a lot larger

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.870 
makes the head look quite a lot larger
this<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:06.919> actually<00:05:07.190> something<00:05:07.310> that<00:05:07.460> was<00:05:07.639> used

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
this is actually something that was used

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.120 
this is actually something that was used
in<00:05:08.150> was<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.930> corinthian<00:05:09.500> or<00:05:09.590> Hellenistic

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
in was a corinthian or Hellenistic

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.450 
in was a corinthian or Hellenistic
period<00:05:10.340> helmets<00:05:11.300> or<00:05:11.840> maybe<00:05:12.050> i'm<00:05:12.250> mixing<00:05:13.250> up<00:05:13.370> my

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
period helmets or maybe i'm mixing up my

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.310 
period helmets or maybe i'm mixing up my
name<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.729> about<00:05:13.880> ancient<00:05:14.270> greece<00:05:14.330> time<00:05:14.720> some

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
name is about ancient greece time some

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.629 
name is about ancient greece time some
of<00:05:15.349> the<00:05:15.440> helmets<00:05:15.740> they<00:05:15.860> used<00:05:16.070> would<00:05:16.340> make<00:05:16.490> the

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
of the helmets they used would make the

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.990 
of the helmets they used would make the
head<00:05:16.789> your<00:05:17.000> head<00:05:17.030> look<00:05:17.389> a<00:05:17.479> bit<00:05:17.630> longer<00:05:17.870> and

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
head your head look a bit longer and

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.950 
head your head look a bit longer and
they're<00:05:20.000> talking<00:05:20.270> about<00:05:20.300> that<00:05:20.570> look<00:05:20.780> really

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
they're talking about that look really

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.810 
they're talking about that look really
imposing<00:05:21.349> and<00:05:21.650> i<00:05:21.680> think<00:05:21.889> it<00:05:22.010> transfers<00:05:22.520> like

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
imposing and i think it transfers like

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.760 
imposing and i think it transfers like
the<00:05:23.030> same<00:05:23.180> principle<00:05:23.599> on<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:24.139> this<00:05:24.260> really

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
the same principle on to this really

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.830 
the same principle on to this really
well<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:25.190> looks<00:05:25.430> imposing<00:05:25.880> i<00:05:26.180> like<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.659> kind

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
well it looks imposing i like the kind

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.659 
well it looks imposing i like the kind
of<00:05:26.900> little<00:05:27.110> breathing<00:05:27.530> slots<00:05:28.099> that<00:05:28.280> there<00:05:28.520> are

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
of little breathing slots that there are

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.420 
of little breathing slots that there are
and<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.659> eyes<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.409> are<00:05:30.470> glowing<00:05:30.770> rad<00:05:31.130> that's

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
and the eyes that are glowing rad that's

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.089 
and the eyes that are glowing rad that's
awesome<00:05:31.940> as<00:05:32.060> well<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:33.080> then<00:05:33.349> of<00:05:33.530> course<00:05:33.560> what

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
awesome as well and then of course what

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.070 
awesome as well and then of course what
I<00:05:34.130> another<00:05:34.909> thing<00:05:35.120> I<00:05:35.240> love<00:05:35.389> about<00:05:35.449> this<00:05:35.720> armor

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
I another thing I love about this armor

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.710 
I another thing I love about this armor
if<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.710> just<00:05:36.740> look<00:05:37.130> at<00:05:37.280> the<00:05:37.430> actual<00:05:37.820> sheets<00:05:38.419> of

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
if you just look at the actual sheets of

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.439 
if you just look at the actual sheets of
metal<00:05:39.020> or<00:05:39.380> plates<00:05:40.010> of<00:05:40.190> metal<00:05:40.340> they're<00:05:41.150> not

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
metal or plates of metal they're not

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.270 
metal or plates of metal they're not
crazy<00:05:41.930> in<00:05:42.260> terms<00:05:42.470> of<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.710> amount<00:05:42.770> of<00:05:42.919> designs

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
crazy in terms of the amount of designs

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.219 
crazy in terms of the amount of designs
going<00:05:43.610> on<00:05:43.760> they<00:05:44.180> just<00:05:44.539> look<00:05:44.780> like<00:05:44.810> they're

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
going on they just look like they're

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.649 
going on they just look like they're
actual<00:05:45.500> solid<00:05:45.919> lumps<00:05:46.220> of<00:05:46.370> Steel<00:05:46.610> I<00:05:46.820> think<00:05:47.479> that

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
actual solid lumps of Steel I think that

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.390 
actual solid lumps of Steel I think that
really<00:05:47.900> is<00:05:48.110> nice<00:05:48.320> it's<00:05:48.560> a<00:05:48.620> nice<00:05:48.770> change<00:05:48.830> and

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
really is nice it's a nice change and

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.540 
really is nice it's a nice change and
you<00:05:49.789> do<00:05:49.970> look<00:05:50.240> like<00:05:50.300> a<00:05:50.870> kind<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:51.800> night<00:05:52.190> is<00:05:52.400> all

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
you do look like a kind of night is all

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.330 
you do look like a kind of night is all
suited<00:05:52.970> up<00:05:53.060> in<00:05:53.210> armor<00:05:53.630> which<00:05:53.900> is<00:05:53.930> great<00:05:54.380> now

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
suited up in armor which is great now

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.770 
suited up in armor which is great now
one<00:05:55.550> thing<00:05:55.580> that's<00:05:56.000> probably<00:05:56.300> worth<00:05:56.479> saying

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
one thing that's probably worth saying

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.320 
one thing that's probably worth saying
though<00:05:57.020> is<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.770> shoulders<00:05:58.220> at<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.639> back<00:05:59.000> and

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
though is the shoulders at the back and

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.659 
though is the shoulders at the back and
you<00:05:59.680> couldn't<00:06:00.680> really<00:06:00.860> kind<00:06:01.159> of<00:06:01.220> hunch<00:06:01.430> your

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
you couldn't really kind of hunch your

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.120 
you couldn't really kind of hunch your
shoulders<00:06:01.699> and<00:06:02.330> at<00:06:03.289> all<00:06:03.470> with<00:06:03.740> these<00:06:03.919> because

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
shoulders and at all with these because

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.939 
shoulders and at all with these because
you're<00:06:04.789> you<00:06:05.270> know<00:06:05.449> you're<00:06:05.720> like<00:06:06.259> plates<00:06:06.830> would

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
you're you know you're like plates would

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.710 
you're you know you're like plates would
kind<00:06:07.159> of<00:06:07.250> crash<00:06:07.580> into<00:06:07.880> each<00:06:07.970> other<00:06:08.090> so<00:06:08.630> that's

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
kind of crash into each other so that's

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.749 
kind of crash into each other so that's
a<00:06:08.870> little<00:06:08.960> bit<00:06:09.110> bizarre<00:06:09.349> but<00:06:10.070> I'm<00:06:10.340> anyway<00:06:10.610> yes

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
a little bit bizarre but I'm anyway yes

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.969 
a little bit bizarre but I'm anyway yes
this<00:06:11.180> is<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.300> Alliance<00:06:11.720> version<00:06:12.080> I<00:06:12.199> once

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
this is the Alliance version I once

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.439 
this is the Alliance version I once
again<00:06:13.280> think<00:06:13.520> it<00:06:13.610> looks<00:06:13.789> really<00:06:13.880> cool<00:06:14.270> because

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
again think it looks really cool because

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.180 
again think it looks really cool because
it's<00:06:14.690> got<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:14.930> gold<00:06:15.110> gilding<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.889> the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
it's got the gold gilding and the the

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.610 
it's got the gold gilding and the the
silver<00:06:16.610> or<00:06:16.880> you<00:06:17.419> know<00:06:17.539> metal<00:06:17.810> color<00:06:18.050> whatever

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
silver or you know metal color whatever

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.189 
silver or you know metal color whatever
which<00:06:19.250> is<00:06:19.400> great<00:06:19.639> and<00:06:19.849> I<00:06:20.300> think<00:06:20.330> that<00:06:20.690> the<00:06:20.900> helm

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
which is great and I think that the helm

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.480 
which is great and I think that the helm
also<00:06:21.650> looks<00:06:21.830> better<00:06:22.039> for<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.280> Alliance

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
also looks better for the Alliance

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.820 
also looks better for the Alliance
because<00:06:22.820> it's<00:06:23.150> got<00:06:23.330> gold<00:06:24.020> with<00:06:24.560> the<00:06:24.650> orange

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
because it's got gold with the orange

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.600 
because it's got gold with the orange
eyes<00:06:25.279> the<00:06:25.760> blue<00:06:26.180> crystal<00:06:26.389> thingy<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:27.050> think

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
eyes the blue crystal thingy I think

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.260 
eyes the blue crystal thingy I think
that's<00:06:27.729> really<00:06:27.939> nice<00:06:28.120> as<00:06:28.330> well<00:06:28.360> and<00:06:29.879> yeah<00:06:30.879> this

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
that's really nice as well and yeah this

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.820 
that's really nice as well and yeah this
is<00:06:31.539> it<00:06:31.599> this<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:32.020> a<00:06:32.139> piece<00:06:32.289> of<00:06:32.319> gear<00:06:32.590> that<00:06:32.650> i

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
is it this is a piece of gear that i

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.469 
is it this is a piece of gear that i
really<00:06:33.430> like<00:06:33.580> i<00:06:33.759> might<00:06:33.909> actually<00:06:34.240> just

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
really like i might actually just

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.700 
really like i might actually just
transmog<00:06:35.020> this<00:06:35.169> onto<00:06:35.409> one<00:06:35.500> of<00:06:35.530> my<00:06:35.650> characters

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
transmog this onto one of my characters
