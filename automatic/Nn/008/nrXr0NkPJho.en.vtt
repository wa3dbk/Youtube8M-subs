the<00:00:02.230> computer<00:00:02.710> is<00:00:02.800> running<00:00:02.920> slow<00:00:03.070> it<00:00:03.370> could<00:00:03.610> be

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:03.730 
the computer is running slow it could be

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.150 
the computer is running slow it could be
one<00:00:03.880> of<00:00:03.909> many<00:00:04.210> things<00:00:04.390> but<00:00:05.230> one<00:00:05.410> common<00:00:05.710> one<00:00:06.040> is

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.160 
one of many things but one common one is

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.769 
one of many things but one common one is
that<00:00:06.189> your<00:00:06.430> files<00:00:06.700> are<00:00:06.939> fragmented<00:00:07.299> all<00:00:07.600> over

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:07.779 
that your files are fragmented all over

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.050 
that your files are fragmented all over
your<00:00:07.990> hard<00:00:08.200> drive<00:00:08.530> that<00:00:08.770> means<00:00:09.370> a<00:00:09.610> father

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.060 
your hard drive that means a father

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.940 
your hard drive that means a father
you've<00:00:10.330> created<00:00:10.570> which<00:00:11.050> might<00:00:11.260> be<00:00:11.410> a<00:00:11.440> picture

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
you've created which might be a picture

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.010 
you've created which might be a picture
or<00:00:12.160> word<00:00:12.400> document<00:00:13.000> might<00:00:13.360> actually<00:00:13.540> be<00:00:13.750> split

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
or word document might actually be split

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.750 
or word document might actually be split
over<00:00:14.290> the<00:00:14.530> hard<00:00:14.770> drive<00:00:15.010> in<00:00:15.160> many<00:00:15.340> different

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
over the hard drive in many different

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.060 
over the hard drive in many different
places<00:00:15.940> that<00:00:16.439> suppose<00:00:17.439> the<00:00:17.620> computer

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
places that suppose the computer

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.290 
places that suppose the computer
downloads<00:00:18.430> you<00:00:18.550> can<00:00:18.610> imagine<00:00:19.060> because<00:00:19.150> the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
downloads you can imagine because the

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.580 
downloads you can imagine because the
hard<00:00:19.480> drives<00:00:19.750> having<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.140> work<00:00:20.320> how<00:00:20.530> to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
hard drives having to work how to

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.160 
hard drives having to work how to
actually<00:00:20.860> find<00:00:21.039> all<00:00:21.430> those<00:00:21.670> files<00:00:22.050> thing<00:00:23.050> you

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
actually find all those files thing you

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.770 
actually find all those files thing you
can<00:00:23.320> do<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.710> a<00:00:23.740> process<00:00:24.190> called<00:00:24.340> defragmenting

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
can do is a process called defragmenting

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.970 
can do is a process called defragmenting
what<00:00:25.780> that<00:00:25.930> does<00:00:26.140> is<00:00:26.350> it<00:00:26.470> moves<00:00:26.650> all<00:00:26.830> those

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
what that does is it moves all those

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.460 
what that does is it moves all those
fragmented<00:00:27.550> files<00:00:27.699> that<00:00:27.910> belong<00:00:28.180> together

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
fragmented files that belong together

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.900 
fragmented files that belong together
into<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.590> same<00:00:29.770> spot<00:00:30.190> so<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.520> hard<00:00:30.699> drive

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
into the same spot so the hard drive

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.910 
into the same spot so the hard drive
doesn't<00:00:31.119> have<00:00:31.330> to<00:00:31.449> work<00:00:31.660> that<00:00:31.840> hard<00:00:31.900> so<00:00:32.860> if

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
doesn't have to work that hard so if

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.229 
doesn't have to work that hard so if
you've<00:00:33.039> had<00:00:33.070> your<00:00:33.219> computer<00:00:33.760> for<00:00:33.969> a<00:00:33.999> while

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
you've had your computer for a while

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.819 
you've had your computer for a while
then<00:00:34.870> this<00:00:35.019> is<00:00:35.170> something<00:00:35.350> that<00:00:35.649> you<00:00:35.800> should

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
then this is something that you should

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.470 
then this is something that you should
do<00:00:36.190> particularly<00:00:36.670> if<00:00:36.850> you've<00:00:36.999> been<00:00:37.179> creating

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
do particularly if you've been creating

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.840 
do particularly if you've been creating
and<00:00:37.899> deleting<00:00:38.170> lots<00:00:38.589> of<00:00:38.739> files<00:00:39.039> documents

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
and deleting lots of files documents

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.869 
and deleting lots of files documents
photos<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:41.079> kind<00:00:41.409> of<00:00:41.530> thing<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.399> way<00:00:42.519> to<00:00:42.579> do

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
photos that kind of thing the way to do

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.939 
photos that kind of thing the way to do
this<00:00:43.089> is<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.690> just<00:00:43.719> simply<00:00:44.229> open<00:00:44.440> up<00:00:44.739> my

a graphic here showing you what's going

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.050 
a graphic here showing you what's going
on<00:01:26.109> and<00:01:26.350> anything<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.189> red<00:01:27.520> would<00:01:27.759> indicate

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
on and anything in red would indicate

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.940 
on and anything in red would indicate
that<00:01:28.240> you've<00:01:28.479> got<00:01:28.659> fragmented<00:01:29.500> files<00:01:29.710> now

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
that you've got fragmented files now

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.469 
that you've got fragmented files now
this<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.219> a<00:01:30.250> fairly<00:01:30.520> new<00:01:30.609> computer<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.450> I

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
this is a fairly new computer so I

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.630 
this is a fairly new computer so I
haven't<00:01:31.780> got<00:01:32.049> any<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:32.560> can<00:01:33.189> see<00:01:33.369> red

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
haven't got any and you can see red

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.099 
haven't got any and you can see red
indicates<00:01:34.119> here<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.539> there<00:01:34.689> would<00:01:34.780> be<00:01:34.810> some

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
indicates here that there would be some

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.069 
indicates here that there would be some
fragmented<00:01:35.740> ones<00:01:35.950> if<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.700> do<00:01:37.119> then<00:01:37.869> what<00:01:38.049> I

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
fragmented ones if you do then what I

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.270 
fragmented ones if you do then what I
suggest<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.710> just<00:01:38.859> click<00:01:38.979> on<00:01:39.159> this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
suggest is you just click on this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.660 
suggest is you just click on this
defragment<00:01:39.969> button<00:01:40.329> and<00:01:40.859> it<00:01:41.859> will<00:01:41.950> analyze<00:01:42.310> it

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
defragment button and it will analyze it

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.940 
defragment button and it will analyze it
again<00:01:42.939> and<00:01:43.179> it<00:01:44.170> will<00:01:44.289> go<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.799> actually

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
again and it will go to and actually

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.260 
again and it will go to and actually
start<00:01:45.369> doing<00:01:45.609> that<00:01:45.729> you'll<00:01:45.850> see<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.149> it's

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
start doing that you'll see that it's

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.940 
start doing that you'll see that it's
moving<00:01:46.479> files<00:01:47.020> here<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.469> actually<00:01:47.740> doing<00:01:47.890> a

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
moving files here it is actually doing a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.800 
moving files here it is actually doing a
little<00:01:48.070> bit<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.340> defragmenting<00:01:49.149> because

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
little bit of defragmenting because

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.359 
little bit of defragmenting because
there<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:50.109> always<00:01:50.289> something<00:01:50.499> that<00:01:50.920> needs<00:01:51.070> to

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
there is always something that needs to

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.510 
there is always something that needs to
be<00:01:51.490> done<00:01:51.820> now<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.869> lot<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.469> people<00:01:53.770> do<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:54.100> very

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
be done now a lot of people do this very

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.730 
be done now a lot of people do this very
regularly<00:01:55.060> once<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.479> month<00:01:55.689> I<00:01:55.990> would<00:01:56.229> say<00:01:56.560> that

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
regularly once a month I would say that

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.749 
regularly once a month I would say that
that's<00:01:56.829> probably<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.219> little<00:01:57.460> bit<00:01:57.729> too

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
that's probably a little bit too

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's probably a little bit too
frequent<00:01:58.509> you<00:01:58.600> probably<00:01:58.869> need<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.319> do<00:01:59.439> it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
frequent you probably need to do it

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.349 
frequent you probably need to do it
every<00:01:59.649> few<00:02:00.039> months<00:02:00.399> maybe<00:02:00.579> a<00:02:00.729> couple<00:02:00.999> of<00:02:01.119> times

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
every few months maybe a couple of times

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.450 
every few months maybe a couple of times
a<00:02:01.600> year<00:02:01.710> depends<00:02:02.710> on<00:02:02.799> how<00:02:02.950> often<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.340> are

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
a year depends on how often you are

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.179 
a year depends on how often you are
using<00:02:03.729> your<00:02:03.969> hard<00:02:04.210> drive<00:02:04.509> if<00:02:05.439> you're<00:02:05.829> finding

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
using your hard drive if you're finding

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.430 
using your hard drive if you're finding
that<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.819> is<00:02:06.999> slowing<00:02:07.240> down<00:02:07.420> quite<00:02:07.869> regularly

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
that it is slowing down quite regularly

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.130 
that it is slowing down quite regularly
then<00:02:09.009> do<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.460> often<00:02:09.910> but<00:02:10.390> really<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.960> is

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
then do this often but really this is

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.300 
then do this often but really this is
something<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.620> don't<00:02:11.770> need<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.070> do

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
something that you don't need to do

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.110 
something that you don't need to do
every<00:02:13.030> single<00:02:13.240> day<00:02:13.450> week

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
every single day week

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.030 
every single day week
if<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:15.900> were<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.019> lot<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.349> files<00:02:16.590> here<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:16.950> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
if there were a lot of files here if I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.460 
if there were a lot of files here if I
had<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> lot<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.400> red<00:02:17.640> spaces<00:02:18.209> here<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.660> would<00:02:19.440> say

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
had a lot of red spaces here I would say

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.750 
had a lot of red spaces here I would say
that<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:19.980> going<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.190> take<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> while

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that this was going to take a while

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.130 
that this was going to take a while

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
some work but the hard drive is working

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.860 
some work but the hard drive is working
quite<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> lot<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.300> slow<00:02:27.540> things<00:02:27.780> down

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
quite a lot and it will slow things down

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.199 
quite a lot and it will slow things down
for<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.319> anyway<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.709> good<00:02:29.519> times<00:02:29.730> do<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.090> at

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
for you anyway so good times do this at

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.780 
for you anyway so good times do this at
the<00:02:30.300> end<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.750> day<00:02:31.160> weekend<00:02:32.160> something

the end of the day weekend something

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.869 
the end of the day weekend something
like<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.510> get<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.590> running<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.190> just

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
like that and get it running and just

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.479 
like that and get it running and just
leave<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.239> until<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:36.959> done<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.220> haven't

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
leave it until it's done if you haven't

leave it until it's done if you haven't
done<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.970> long<00:02:39.120> time<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.540> could<00:02:39.810> take

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
done this for a long time it could take

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.700 
done this for a long time it could take
a<00:02:40.019> couple<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.500> hours<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.069> not<00:02:41.430> longer
