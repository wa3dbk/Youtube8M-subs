hit these touch sensitive keys and it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
hit these touch sensitive keys and it's
a<00:00:58.890> very<00:00:59.309> light<00:00:59.670> touch<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> activate<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:00.870> of

showed<00:02:21.880> earlier<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:25.090> course<00:02:25.300> they<00:02:25.450> will

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
showed earlier and of course they will

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.190 
showed earlier and of course they will
also<00:02:26.430> reduce<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.640> CPU<00:02:28.330> power<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.080> will

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
also reduce the CPU power and it will

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.900 
also reduce the CPU power and it will
dim<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.500> screen<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.250> normal<00:02:30.670> battery

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
dim the screen like a normal battery

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.400 
dim the screen like a normal battery
saving<00:02:31.300> option<00:02:31.690> would<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.170> battery

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
saving option would do the battery

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.800 
saving option would do the battery
saving<00:02:32.709> would<00:02:32.950> not<00:02:33.130> control<00:02:33.610> these<00:02:33.850> these

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
saving would not control these these

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.940 
saving would not control these these
accent<00:02:35.620> lights<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.130> they<00:02:36.160> use<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.660> now<00:02:38.620> of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
accent lights that they use so now of

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.920 
accent lights that they use so now of
course<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.190> Eco<00:02:39.550> mode<00:02:39.760> button<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.209> not<00:02:40.510> lit<00:02:40.900> up

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
course the Eco mode button is not lit up

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.270 
course the Eco mode button is not lit up
right<00:02:41.350> now<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.220> if<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.400> hit<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.799> Eco<00:02:45.100> mode

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
right now so if I hit that the Eco mode

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.979 
right now so if I hit that the Eco mode
turned<00:02:45.640> on<00:02:45.820> now<00:02:46.060> all<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.390> lights<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:46.810> turned

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
turned on now all the lights are turned

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.009 
turned on now all the lights are turned
off<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.730> has<00:02:48.850> dimmed<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.330> screen<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.959> of

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
off and it has dimmed the screen and of

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.560 
off and it has dimmed the screen and of
course<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.380> changed<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.830> around<00:02:50.920> now<00:02:51.570> now

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
course it's changed it around now now

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.810 
course it's changed it around now now
normally<00:02:53.260> when<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:53.920> hit<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> eco<00:02:54.580> mode

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
normally when you hit the eco mode

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.080 
normally when you hit the eco mode
button<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.900> will<00:02:56.110> bring<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.709> graph<00:02:57.160> let<00:02:58.000> me

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
button it will bring up a graph let me

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.009 
button it will bring up a graph let me
see<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.420> can<00:02:58.570> clean<00:02:58.810> up<00:02:59.320> here<00:03:00.840> there's<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
see if I can clean up here there's the

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.870 
see if I can clean up here there's the
graph<00:03:02.549> now<00:03:03.549> this<00:03:04.049> colored<00:03:05.049> line<00:03:05.530> here<00:03:06.160> was

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
graph now this colored line here was

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.500 
graph now this colored line here was
showing<00:03:07.299> power<00:03:07.600> usage<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.470> laptop<00:03:09.510> before

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510

it's running on Eco mode I've got a

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.310 
it's running on Eco mode I've got a
separately<00:03:15.610> colored<00:03:16.060> line<00:03:16.299> after<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.110> and

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
separately colored line after that and

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.100 
separately colored line after that and
it's<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.220> little<00:03:18.370> bit<00:03:18.640> lower<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.750> speaks

it's a little bit lower and it speaks

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.470 
it's a little bit lower and it speaks
and<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:21.220> indicates<00:03:21.700> how<00:03:21.970> much<00:03:22.150> power

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
and that indicates how much power

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.650 
and that indicates how much power
consumption<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.280> laptop<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.519> using<00:03:25.000> under

off AC power it's a laptop this big with

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.880 
off AC power it's a laptop this big with
the<00:03:35.799> battery<00:03:36.190> in<00:03:36.310> there<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.519> will<00:03:36.790> tell<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:37.890> you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
the battery in there I will tell you you

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.979 
the battery in there I will tell you you
will<00:03:39.010> probably<00:03:39.190> average<00:03:39.730> about<00:03:40.000> an<00:03:40.299> hour<00:03:40.570> to

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
will probably average about an hour to

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.560 
will probably average about an hour to
an<00:03:41.110> hour<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.500> half<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:41.950> battery<00:03:42.370> life<00:03:42.570> using

this on high performance because like

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.640 
this on high performance because like
any<00:03:45.940> big<00:03:46.239> desktop<00:03:46.600> replacement<00:03:47.320> don't<00:03:47.500> look

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
any big desktop replacement don't look

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.180 
any big desktop replacement don't look
like<00:03:47.859> this<00:03:48.100> it's<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.549> real<00:03:48.760> battery<00:03:49.239> hog<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
like this it's a real battery hog the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.460 
like this it's a real battery hog the
Eco<00:03:51.489> mode<00:03:51.639> can<00:03:51.910> coming

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
Eco mode can coming

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.580 
Eco mode can coming
when<00:03:52.800> you're<00:03:53.010> trying<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.150> extend<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.930> life

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
when you're trying to extend that life

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.070 
when you're trying to extend that life
on<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.160> battery<00:03:56.580> when<00:03:57.000> you're<00:03:57.240> not<00:03:57.600> connected

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
on the battery when you're not connected

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.020 
on the battery when you're not connected
up<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.230> AC<00:03:58.440> power<00:04:00.590> yeah

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
up to AC power yeah

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.570 
up to AC power yeah
also<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.450> side<00:04:03.720> bar<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.770> side<00:04:05.040> bar<00:04:05.070> shows

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
also on the side bar the side bar shows

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.120 
also on the side bar the side bar shows
this<00:04:05.820> little<00:04:06.200> gadget<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:07.590> that's<00:04:07.740> part<00:04:08.010> of

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
this little gadget and that's part of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.900 
this little gadget and that's part of
Eco<00:04:08.520> mode<00:04:08.700> as<00:04:08.940> well<00:04:09.260> has<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.910> mirror

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
Eco mode as well has a little mirror

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.350 
Eco mode as well has a little mirror
that<00:04:12.540> lights<00:04:12.600> up<00:04:13.370> circles<00:04:14.370> as<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.700> power

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
that lights up circles as the power

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.560 
that lights up circles as the power
consumption<00:04:15.900> varies<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.040> higher<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:18.239> is

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
consumption varies so the higher this is

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.400 
consumption varies so the higher this is
clockwise<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:21.019> greater<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.170> power

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
clockwise the greater the power

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.960 
clockwise the greater the power
consumption<00:04:22.980> of<00:04:23.010> laptops<00:04:23.490> will<00:04:23.640> give<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:23.940> a

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
consumption of laptops will give you a

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.380 
consumption of laptops will give you a
quick<00:04:24.300> reference<00:04:24.510> see<00:04:25.550> how<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.700> will<00:04:27.150> turn

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
quick reference see how it will turn

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.920 
quick reference see how it will turn
this<00:04:27.570> back<00:04:27.840> off<00:04:29.360> let's<00:04:30.360> see<00:04:30.480> if<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.660> could<00:04:30.810> take

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
this back off let's see if I could take

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.500 
this back off let's see if I could take
a<00:04:30.990> look<00:04:31.170> at<00:04:31.350> our<00:04:31.530> experience<00:04:32.250> index<00:04:32.850> scores<00:04:33.300> to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
a look at our experience index scores to

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
it stalled it that way the heads are

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.350 
it stalled it that way the heads are
parked<00:06:48.690> so<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:49.050> does<00:06:49.229> not<00:06:49.620> hit<00:06:50.610> the<00:06:50.640> hard<00:06:51.030> drive

and<00:06:51.630> cause<00:06:51.870> it<00:06:52.110> to<00:06:52.140> cause<00:06:52.680> a<00:06:52.710> head<00:06:53.040> crash

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 
about this thing I think that that's

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:22.979 
about this thing I think that that's
pretty<00:07:17.589> much<00:07:17.679> it<00:07:17.949> for<00:07:18.129> the<00:07:18.219> p5<00:07:18.699> or<00:07:18.939> 5d<00:07:21.869> see<00:07:22.869> you

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:22.989 
pretty much it for the p5 or 5d see you

00:07:22.989 --> 00:07:25.379 
pretty much it for the p5 or 5d see you
next<00:07:23.259> time
