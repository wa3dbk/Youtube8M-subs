 james bond nightfire this game up 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.030
 early gray felt and I thought so 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.679
 I just don't do it for a long time 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 new beginning again we are going on a tip 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.029

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.920
 then I was all the way in one go 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.080
 I'm going to save it unfortunately very particular about 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.410
 because it is a story that really hurts 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 showering to your ears okay so let's 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.510

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.510
 some 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.830
 so walk down and you get 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.830
 my head shot 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.680
 you can die so die 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.920

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.350
 on shirt audio 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.300

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.830
