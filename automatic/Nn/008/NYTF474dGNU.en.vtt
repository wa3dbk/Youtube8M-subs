00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
Marcus Aldridge the one thing i don't

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
Marcus Aldridge the one thing i don't
like<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.400> LaMarcus<00:01:15.150> Aldridge<00:01:15.299> game<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
like about LaMarcus Aldridge game is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.499 
like about LaMarcus Aldridge game is
that<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.189> doesn't<00:01:17.310> play<00:01:17.880> close<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> basket

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that he doesn't play close to the basket

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.620 
that he doesn't play close to the basket
I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.439> enough<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> he<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.150> true

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I think enough and he is not a true

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.990 
I think enough and he is not a true
rebounder<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.530> size<00:01:22.770> 611<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.670> loves<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
rebounder for the size 611 he loves to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
rebounder for the size 611 he loves to
shoot<00:01:24.150> jump<00:01:24.450> shots<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.840> he<00:01:24.900> has<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> tremendous

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
shoot jump shots and he has a tremendous

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.340 
shoot jump shots and he has a tremendous
jump<00:01:26.070> shot<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.150> markers<00:01:27.509> altars<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.020> my

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
jump shot the markers altars in my

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
jump shot the markers altars in my
opinion<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:29.430> falls<00:01:29.759> under<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> rock<00:01:30.329> sheet

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
opinion he falls under the rock sheet
