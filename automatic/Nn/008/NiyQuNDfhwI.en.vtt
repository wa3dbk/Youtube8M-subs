00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.490 

off-road<00:00:51.340> wise<00:00:51.610> I<00:00:52.030> would<00:00:52.809> say<00:00:52.989> it's<00:00:53.170> about<00:00:53.350> the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
off-road wise I would say it's about the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.799 
off-road wise I would say it's about the
same<00:00:53.710> as<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.040> Durango<00:00:54.640> now<00:00:55.269> they<00:00:55.420> both<00:00:55.570> have

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
same as the Durango now they both have

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.209 
same as the Durango now they both have
approximately<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.589> same<00:00:56.769> amount<00:00:56.829> of<00:00:57.010> ground

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
approximately the same amount of ground

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.689 
approximately the same amount of ground

this<00:00:58.120> has<00:00:58.420> no<00:00:58.629> button<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:58.989> push<00:00:59.079> nope<00:00:59.649> nothing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
this has no button to push nope nothing

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
this has no button to push nope nothing
right<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:00.699> it's<00:01:00.879> mainly<00:01:01.180> front-wheel<00:01:01.629> drive

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
right so it's mainly front-wheel drive

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.219 
right so it's mainly front-wheel drive
and<00:01:02.890> if<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.970> front<00:01:04.479> wheels<00:01:04.690> started<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.080> lose

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
and if the front wheels started to lose

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.230 
and if the front wheels started to lose
traction<00:01:05.590> then<00:01:06.009> all<00:01:06.190> of<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.310> sudden<00:01:06.340> it<00:01:06.970> sends

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
traction then all of a sudden it sends

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.760 
traction then all of a sudden it sends
power<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.630> back<00:01:07.780> you<00:01:08.170> do<00:01:08.290> have<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.500> button

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
power to the back you do have a button

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.620

quiet<00:01:18.160> and<00:01:18.429> I<00:01:18.550> think<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.149> a<00:01:19.270> little<00:01:19.420> bit<00:01:19.720> I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
quiet and I think it's a little bit I

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.960 
quiet and I think it's a little bit I
don't<00:01:20.410> know<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.500> little<00:01:20.830> smoother<00:01:21.280> inside<00:01:21.729> than

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
don't know a little smoother inside than

don't know a little smoother inside than

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
the Dodge was this is front-wheel drive

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.190 
the Dodge was this is front-wheel drive
biased<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.450> Dodge<00:01:25.600> is<00:01:25.840> rear-wheel<00:01:26.050> drive

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
biased the Dodge is rear-wheel drive

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.779 
biased the Dodge is rear-wheel drive
bias<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:27.070> think<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.369> they<00:01:27.490> have<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.640> different

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
bias I think that they have a different

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.130 
bias I think that they have a different
engine<00:01:28.300> note<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:28.660> think<00:01:28.929> that<00:01:29.020> this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
engine note and I think that this

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.469 
engine note and I think that this
particular<00:01:29.440> one<00:01:29.740> is<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:30.399> little<00:01:31.030> bit<00:01:31.119> softer

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
particular one is a little bit softer

yeah<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.549> does<00:01:42.850> still<00:01:43.060> bit<00:01:43.240> softer<00:01:43.600> actually

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929

off-road<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:45.130> softer<00:01:45.460> suspension<00:01:45.609> does

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
off-road the softer suspension does

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.090 
off-road the softer suspension does
better<00:01:46.420> because<00:01:46.810> it's<00:01:47.020> more<00:01:47.079> compliant<00:01:47.679> and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
better because it's more compliant and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.529 
better because it's more compliant and
it<00:01:48.250> seems<00:01:48.429> to<00:01:48.460> be<00:01:48.549> soaking<00:01:48.969> up<00:01:49.030> these<00:01:49.210> bumps

little<00:01:49.689> bit<00:01:49.780> better<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.530> there's<00:01:50.829> a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
little bit better and there's a

but<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:36.040> know<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.400> don't<00:02:36.519> want<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.849> bottom<00:02:37.060> this

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
but you know I don't want to bottom this

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.420 
but you know I don't want to bottom this
thing<00:02:37.360> out<00:02:37.480> there's<00:02:37.660> not<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> lot<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.440> ground

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
thing out there's not a lot of ground

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.550 
thing out there's not a lot of ground
clearance<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.030> approach<00:02:40.450> angles<00:02:40.870> suck<00:02:41.110> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
clearance the approach angles suck and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.050 
clearance the approach angles suck and
let's<00:02:41.680> face<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.890> most<00:02:42.220> people<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:42.730> not<00:02:42.879> be

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
let's face it most people will not be

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.490 
let's face it most people will not be
taking<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.569> off<00:02:43.720> road<00:02:43.989> like<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
taking it off road like this in the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500 
taking it off road like this in the
Colorado<00:02:44.860> mountains<00:02:44.920> yeah<00:02:45.850> that's<00:02:46.090> true<00:02:46.269> but

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
Colorado mountains yeah that's true but

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
Colorado mountains yeah that's true but
you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.660> once<00:02:47.079> again<00:02:47.230> guys<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.799> reason<00:02:47.920> we

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
you know once again guys the reason we

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.319 
you know once again guys the reason we
do<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.370> aside<00:02:48.819> from<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.030> fact<00:02:49.120> that's

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
do this aside from the fact that's

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.840 
do this aside from the fact that's
really<00:02:49.569> fun<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:50.260> because<00:02:50.829> if<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.370> does<00:02:51.549> well

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
really fun is because if it does well

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.849 
really fun is because if it does well
here<00:02:52.239> it's<00:02:52.420> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.600> do<00:02:52.690> really<00:02:52.720> well<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.560> the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
here it's going to do really well in the

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.160 
here it's going to do really well in the
snow<00:02:54.130> or<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.700> dirt<00:02:54.940> road<00:02:54.970> yeah<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:55.959> real

snow or on a dirt road yeah it's real
world<00:02:56.440> testing<00:02:56.920> against<00:02:57.100> its<00:02:57.310> look<00:02:58.030> we<00:02:58.299> just

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
world testing against its look we just

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.990 
world testing against its look we just
hit<00:02:58.600> something<00:02:58.780> there

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
hit something there

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.629 
hit something there
it's<00:03:01.510> serious<00:03:01.989> offroading<00:03:02.290> out<00:03:02.620> here<00:03:02.829> yeah

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
it's serious offroading out here yeah

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.009 
it's serious offroading out here yeah
the<00:03:03.760> higher<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.090> go<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.239> harder<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.600> gets

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
the higher we go the harder it gets

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.960 
the higher we go the harder it gets
with<00:03:05.350> crossovers<00:03:06.069> we<00:03:06.190> only<00:03:06.400> go<00:03:06.579> up<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.880> this

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
with crossovers we only go up to this

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.699 
with crossovers we only go up to this
area<00:03:07.120> we<00:03:07.359> like<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.630> call<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.870> mud<00:03:08.049> pit<00:03:08.290> because

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
area we like to call the mud pit because

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.009 
area we like to call the mud pit because
well<00:03:09.160> frankly<00:03:09.519> it's<00:03:09.639> a<00:03:09.700> mud<00:03:09.880> pit<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.239> also

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
if this had more ground clearance I

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.360 
if this had more ground clearance I
would<00:03:26.139> say<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.380> would<00:03:26.560> be<00:03:26.590> quite<00:03:26.950> offering

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
obviously they doing all these dirt

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.810 
obviously they doing all these dirt
bikes<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.840> jeeps<00:04:08.470> out<00:04:08.650> here<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.550> know<00:04:09.670> we're

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
bikes and jeeps out here you know we're

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.940 
bikes and jeeps out here you know we're
into<00:04:09.970> some<00:04:10.150> pretty<00:04:10.270> heavy<00:04:10.410> Colorado<00:04:11.410> off-road

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
into some pretty heavy Colorado off-road

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.290 
into some pretty heavy Colorado off-road
I<00:04:12.130> think<00:04:12.370> these<00:04:12.490> cars<00:04:12.790> are<00:04:13.000> at<00:04:13.090> their<00:04:13.180> limit

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
I think these cars are at their limit

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.030 
I think these cars are at their limit
yeah<00:04:13.930> we<00:04:14.080> took<00:04:14.320> them<00:04:14.470> as<00:04:14.530> high<00:04:14.680> as<00:04:14.740> they<00:04:14.980> should

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
