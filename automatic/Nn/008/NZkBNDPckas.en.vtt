you if you ever want to identify a Hemi
fast<00:01:56.069> just<00:01:56.549> look<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:56.909> spark<00:01:57.179> plug<00:01:57.390> Mars

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
fast just look for the spark plug Mars

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
fast just look for the spark plug Mars
will<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.289> located<00:01:58.590> right<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> center<00:01:59.489> of

like<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.619> had<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.799> put<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.250> two

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
like this I had to put in two

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.180 
like this I had to put in two
four-barrel<00:02:09.259> carburetors<00:02:10.259> which<00:02:10.769> makes<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.099> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
four-barrel carburetors which makes it a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
horsepower now let me show you how we

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.600 
horsepower now let me show you how we
put<00:02:31.769> all<00:02:31.859> that<00:02:31.889> horsepower<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.790> pavement

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.920 

now<00:02:39.610> what<00:02:39.790> good<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.090> all<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.360> horsepower<00:02:40.630> if

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
now what good is all that horsepower if

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.000 
now what good is all that horsepower if
you<00:02:40.990> don't<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> proper<00:02:41.560> traction

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010
