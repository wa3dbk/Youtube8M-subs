just don't get that racket and drop so
what<00:00:28.550> I've<00:00:28.670> developed<00:00:29.090> is<00:00:29.510> a<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.900> serve

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
what I've developed is a a serve

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.000 
what I've developed is a a serve
developer<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:32.650> actually<00:00:33.650> I<00:00:33.710> didn't<00:00:33.920> develop

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
developer and actually I didn't develop

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.610 
developer and actually I didn't develop
it<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.059> can<00:00:35.210> use<00:00:35.360> anything<00:00:35.659> I<00:00:35.930> got<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.350> fly

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
it you can use anything I got a fly

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.560 
it you can use anything I got a fly
swatter<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:38.440> you<00:00:39.440> can<00:00:39.589> use<00:00:39.769> a<00:00:39.800> straw<00:00:40.790> any<00:00:41.180> any

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
type of law object and what this does if

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.350 
type of law object and what this does if
you<00:00:44.600> can<00:00:44.750> have<00:00:44.960> them<00:00:45.170> hold<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:46.670> racket<00:00:47.180> and

you can have them hold the racket and
the<00:00:47.420> fly<00:00:48.080> swatter<00:00:48.370> it<00:00:49.370> kind<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.670> gives<00:00:49.909> them

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
the fly swatter it kind of gives them

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.360 
the fly swatter it kind of gives them
the<00:00:50.479> when<00:00:50.750> when<00:00:50.930> they<00:00:51.049> do<00:00:51.110> their<00:00:51.379> gravity<00:00:52.070> drop

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the when when they do their gravity drop

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.910 
the when when they do their gravity drop
to<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.089> trophy<00:00:53.390> position<00:00:54.019> it<00:00:54.440> kind<00:00:54.650> of<00:00:54.710> lets

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
to the trophy position it kind of lets

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.820 
to the trophy position it kind of lets
them<00:00:55.159> know<00:00:55.449> where<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.600> rackets<00:00:57.019> out<00:00:57.199> here<00:00:57.650> and

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
them know where the rackets out here and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.090 
them know where the rackets out here and
then<00:00:58.790> when<00:00:59.000> they<00:00:59.089> bring<00:00:59.299> that<00:00:59.479> elbow<00:00:59.809> up<00:01:00.170> they

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
then when they bring that elbow up they

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.920 
then when they bring that elbow up they
can<00:01:01.309> really<00:01:01.640> see<00:01:01.940> where<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.330> the<00:01:02.510> rackets

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
can really see where that the rackets

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.109 
can really see where that the rackets
dropped<00:01:03.229> once<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:04.129> elbow<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.790> up<00:01:04.909> on<00:01:05.059> the

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
dropped once that elbow is up on the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.910 
dropped once that elbow is up on the
butt<00:01:05.299> of<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.479> rackets<00:01:05.900> there<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.590> can<00:01:06.770> make

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
butt of the rackets there you can make

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.219 
butt of the rackets there you can make
that<00:01:07.130> see<00:01:07.549> or<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:08.000> hitting<00:01:08.450> up<00:01:08.570> motion<00:01:09.049> and

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
that see or that hitting up motion and

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.649 
that see or that hitting up motion and
rotate<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:10.219> forearm<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:10.909> loosen<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:11.329> wrist

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
rotate the forearm and loosen that wrist

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.109 
rotate the forearm and loosen that wrist
and<00:01:12.109> follow-through<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.039> that<00:01:13.579> if<00:01:13.759> they<00:01:13.909> have

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
and follow-through so that if they have

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.919 
and follow-through so that if they have
no<00:01:14.329> clue<00:01:14.659> they<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:15.829> clue<00:01:16.299> with<00:01:17.299> the

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
no clue they have a clue with the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.740 
no clue they have a clue with the
flyswatter<00:01:18.200> because<00:01:18.770> they<00:01:18.920> can<00:01:19.100> see

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
flyswatter because they can see

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.149 
flyswatter because they can see
physically<00:01:20.750> see<00:01:20.990> where<00:01:21.200> their<00:01:21.380> racket<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:21.950> and

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
physically see where their racket is and

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.109 
physically see where their racket is and
then<00:01:22.549> they<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:23.210> actually<00:01:23.359> graduate<00:01:24.079> in<00:01:24.259> to

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
then they can actually graduate in to

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.999 
then they can actually graduate in to
see<00:01:26.119> where<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.960> feeling<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:27.859> that's

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
see where it is and feeling that that's

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.469 
see where it is and feeling that that's
most<00:01:28.310> important<00:01:28.729> thing<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.000> they<00:01:29.119> can't<00:01:29.329> see

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
most important thing is they can't see

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.480 
most important thing is they can't see
it<00:01:29.539> so<00:01:29.630> at<00:01:29.719> least<00:01:29.750> they<00:01:30.500> can<00:01:30.530> feel<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.280> and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
it so at least they can feel it and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.480 
it so at least they can feel it and
their<00:01:31.609> wrist<00:01:31.880> starts<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.390> make<00:01:32.509> more

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
their wrist starts to make more

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.520 
their wrist starts to make more
rotation<00:01:34.330> up<00:01:34.420> here<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.720> get<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:34.990> butt<00:01:35.260> up<00:01:35.290> to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
rotation up here to get that butt up to

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.950 
rotation up here to get that butt up to
the<00:01:35.650> ball<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.400> acceleration<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.570> lift

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the ball the acceleration and the lift

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.800 
the ball the acceleration and the lift
so<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.909> couple<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.330> times<00:01:40.600> when

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
so do that a couple of times when

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.950 
so do that a couple of times when
they're<00:01:40.960> having<00:01:41.140> trouble<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:43.690> really

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
they're having trouble and it really

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.810 
they're having trouble and it really
gives<00:01:44.200> them<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.890> feel<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.430> shot<00:01:45.640> and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
gives them the feel of the shot and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.430 
gives them the feel of the shot and
again<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.210> just<00:01:47.050> happen<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.290> use<00:01:47.409> a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
again you just happen to use a

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.010 
again you just happen to use a
flyswatter<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:48.220> can<00:01:48.340> use<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.520> straw<00:01:49.420> chopstick

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
flyswatter you can use a straw chopstick

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.600 
flyswatter you can use a straw chopstick
anything<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:51.960> spend<00:01:52.960> two<00:01:53.140> bucks<00:01:53.409> and<00:01:53.800> improve

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
anything so spend two bucks and improve
