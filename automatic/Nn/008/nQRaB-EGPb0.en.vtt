00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
facebook page that i had a little time

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.570 
facebook page that i had a little time
to<00:00:09.150> make<00:00:09.450> some<00:00:09.480> videos<00:00:09.750> today<00:00:10.230> my<00:00:11.160> house<00:00:11.370> is

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
to make some videos today my house is

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.299 
to make some videos today my house is
relatively<00:00:12.090> clean<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.710> mascara<00:00:14.160> on

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
relatively clean and i have mascara on

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.849 
relatively clean and i have mascara on
so<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> combination<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.619> does<00:00:16.770> not

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
so that is a combination that does not

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.010 
so that is a combination that does not
happen<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.460> often<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:18.150> four<00:00:18.420> kids<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
happen all that often with four kids and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
happen all that often with four kids and
a<00:00:19.109> home<00:00:19.260> business<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.010> figured<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.670> might<00:00:20.789> as

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
a home business so I figured I might as

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.220 
a home business so I figured I might as
well<00:00:20.910> take<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.210> opportunity<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:22.050> some

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
well take the opportunity to make some

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.470

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.179 
anyway and Callie and I got to talking
about<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.930> said<00:01:16.170> why<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.040> create

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
about it we kind of said why not create

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.130 
about it we kind of said why not create
an<00:01:17.520> option<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.119> apply<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.720> oils<00:01:18.990> with

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
an option to apply your oils with

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
an option to apply your oils with
leather<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:20.189> know<00:01:20.369> from<00:01:20.909> our

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
leather which we know from our

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.859 
leather which we know from our
experience<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> over<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> last<00:01:22.619> year

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
experience with it over the last year

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.690 
experience with it over the last year
holds<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> oil<00:01:25.140> longer<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.400> provide

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
holds the oil longer and can provide

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.569 
holds the oil longer and can provide
aromatic<00:01:27.299> benefits<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.140> days<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.159> topical

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
aromatic benefits for days and topical

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
aromatic benefits for days and topical
benefits<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.090> well<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.930> thought<00:01:31.110> not

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
benefits as well and so we thought not

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
benefits as well and so we thought not
only<00:01:31.829> does<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.100> provide<00:01:32.610> topical<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
only does it provide topical and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.149 
only does it provide topical and
aromatic<00:01:34.049> benefits<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> gives<00:01:34.829> us<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
aromatic benefits but it gives us a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
aromatic benefits but it gives us a
bigger<00:01:35.369> range<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.970> design<00:01:36.450> options<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> know

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
bigger range of design options you know

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929
