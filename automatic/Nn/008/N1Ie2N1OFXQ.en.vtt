 first this one good I think that here there 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.020
 a lot of trouble in crafter I know it's a 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.879
 game that is very played and you have already 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.520

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.559
 teach or I was very excited to see the 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.239

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.520
 of adventure 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.600
 I'm going to try to upload a bit of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.580
 minecraft to the channel 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.049
 remains the same or rather I think it is 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.509
 something better because I'm going to add a little 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.340
 of variety usually tell me hey 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.290
 open another channel where you upload 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.820
 minecraft another in this is not the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.830
 I really can not be in this channel going to 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.210
 upload everything what I fancy and 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.490
 well someday I have time to open 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.990
 another channel as I will open it opens to barry 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.869
 network but at the moment I do not have eggs 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.270
 of eggs there are the eggs ok this 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.009
 it's flower and what you put this gives you more 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 eggs and those eggs you can use them 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.550
 for other things we're going to put two here 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.350
 let's put here three is very difficult 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.360

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:47.409
 let me like you and see you in another 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.699
 adventure would not want our 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.319
 next adventure maybe for not 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.960
 However, the subject in back maybe 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:55.800
 like-minded people or maybe plaintiff up 

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.800
