00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.099
 the smartest creatures on the planet are behind 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.640
 except for people it's big 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.050
 humanoid monkeys 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.900
 sensational this statement can not be called 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.430
 because they are our closest relatives 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.230
 however, how to prove such a point 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.300
 view of the extraordinary mind can talk 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.040
 on the ability of animals to learn a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.580
 also by the ability to find a way out 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.449
 different situations this female orangutan 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.360
 started washing clothes 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.940
 nobody taught her how to do it like 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.799
 she just likes this question question 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 tom is a manifestation of high intelligence 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.580
 or simply imitation unequivocally 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.040
 can not answer this question yet 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.510
 Anyone can come help scientists in 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.339
 exploring these noble giants even 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.510
 in the local zoo you can watch 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.090
 our moon monozhsky 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.330
 these chimps are forced to solve a problem 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.950
 how to get a banana 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.650
 it looks like a plan appeared in one of the monkeys 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.450
 she coped with the task it is 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.789
 It indicates a high level of intelligence view 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.649
 chimps had to think about the problem and 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.240
 use imagination to think 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.240
 present possible solutions 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 last effort and a banana she has it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.810
 The following test checks awareness 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.610
 about your appearance 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 very few animals are smart enough 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:56.170
 to know yourself in the mirror 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.880
 chimpanzee number language seems this female with 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.890
 pleasure to use the mirror to 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.140
 keep your body clean and tidy 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.020
 but how to prove that they find out in 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.320
 reflecting exactly yourself this test passes 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.850
 only children from one and a half years however for 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.160
 one of our closest 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.160
 Relatives Bonobo is not a problem 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.850
 one of the reasons for high mental 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.440
 development lies in their sociability 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.090
 seems like a humanoid monkey all 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.490
 aware of feelings and intentions 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.490
 and they can play 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.820
 bonobos allow their fun and 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.040
 other species 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:53.090
 this is very unusual only for 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:56.870
 the smartest animals are all big 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.430
 monkeys are very caring parents they 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.420
 should not only look after their 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.340
 kids but also teach them a lot like 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.510
 dedication and tenderness are attracted to these 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.340
 animals many tourists to 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.080
 meet with mountain gorillas will have 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.650
 heading to the heart of african 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.650
 continent 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.660
 however, one of the most controversial issues 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.730
 is whether 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.520
 apes use and 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.390
 understand human for some 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.030
 believe that up 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.670
 maybe they are not capable of speaking but bonobos 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.500
 it does not interfere with talking to female people 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.950
 talked since childhood and taught 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.700
 respond using symbols instead of words 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.410
 researcher asking bonobos 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.730
 perform an unusual task to 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 test her ability to understand 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:50.200
 please bring pine needles 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.200
 Amy in the fridge 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.450
 thank you very much now let's see where 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.069
 you can watch how wild 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.439
 monkeys realize their mental 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.120
 potential 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.189
 they all inhabit fairly remote 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.870
 corners of the planet perhaps the easiest 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.090
 arrange chimpanzee meeting 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.440
 this species lives in large families many 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.569
 of which are under steadfast 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.519
 observation of scientists in the territory 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.530
 gambi national park in tanzania 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.329
 chimpanzees are accustomed to man 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.300
 animals and there are already several 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.010
 dozens need to be a real lovers 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.960
 adventures to venture on such 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.550
 journey 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.930
 besides, you need a good one 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.630
 physical training 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.729
 you have to move quickly through 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.550
 jungle to keep up with the object 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.030
 Observations here is the first time scientists 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.400
 learned about using chimps 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.669
 elementary tools for example 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.560
 termite twigs since 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.180
 range of tools used 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.180
 will expand significantly 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.010
 no doubt humanlike 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.320
 monkeys are very mind in them we see many 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.599
 the qualities inherent in man are their family 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.710
 bonds very durable animals love 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.800
 have fun and make art 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.980
 monkey use in their activities 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.320
 instruments 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.170
 and some of the individuals can even talk 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.760
 these creatures are not easy to track down however 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.290
 if meeting with the closest wild 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.490
 Relatives still happen you 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.490
 never forget it 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.800
