00:00:00.805 --> 00:00:03.153
 This is why I got this conclusion 

00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:09.928
 Because elephants surpass orangutans in terms of weight, size, and strength. 

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:15.692
 Thank you~ Any questions? 

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:16.850
 Mr. Alexander 

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:18.918
 Is the orangutan not very strong? 

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:25.444
 According to our survey, I must say yes, but in any case, no stronger than an elephant. Mrs. Kane 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.833
 They may be karate 

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:32.221
 The data shows that this does not have a big impact 

00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:34.621
 Jiu Jitsu, if it is Jiu Jitsu? 

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:40.491
 This is not a way to deal with elephants ever. 

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:44.104
 Let us assume that these orangutans have been trained in Bushido. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.235
 This will change the data 

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.665
 Let me shrink the data 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.606
 According to the data, Bushido will fill the favorite list of orangutans. 

00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:06.132
 Miss Art, I don't understand what caused the change. 

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:07.004
 The factors that cause change are 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.311
 Cut first and then stab 

00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:11.793
 Will let it cut the elephant 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.038
 Anyway, I have to tell you, 

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:21.454
 Let the stars accept the price of training the Bushido, whether it is money or working hours. 

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.046
 Astronomical figures 

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:26.299
 I have a question 

00:01:26.693 --> 00:01:27.262
 Excuse me 

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:32.918
 What is the relationship between the above mentioned and the brand cola sold by the company? 

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:36.209
 clam? 

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.753
 As the president and founder of an executive company, I want to know 

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:45.836
 His x elephant fights with the orangutan 

00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:48.841
 What is the relationship with the bubble company water? 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.126
 I think I am not interested in this matter. 

00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:00.288
 not interested 

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:05.342
 Joe rolled, went to clean up the cockroaches, took it all away, cleaned the table and rolled it. 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.423
 You don't want to look at the computer simulation? 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.014
 Fast roll 

00:02:11.747 --> 00:02:12.214
 just now 

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:20.315
 Does anyone have any idea about how to sell the company's cola to more fast food restaurants? 

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:25.452
 .... 

00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:26.139
 nobody 

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:27.915
 Any idea 

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.469
 Yes~ I think we can repackage the product... 

00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:34.217
 Repackage 

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:37.270
 This is what you think of repackaging 

00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:38.730
 What are you doing? 

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:41.878
 I miss the topic about elephants. 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.815
 Right, and samurai orangutan 

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:49.572
 Yes, itâ€™s fun, not like stupid bubble water 

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:53.724
 You guys have heard it clearly. 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.107
 I have been involved in this game for a long time. 

00:02:57.762 --> 00:02:58.846
 It may be fun 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.798
 Waste the company's precious time and money 

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:06.655
 Events in samurai orangutans and elephants 

00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:10.778
 Will not increase the performance of the carbonated beverage market, believe me 

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:13.361
 speak 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.634
 Mr. Wilson, I am Carlo. 

00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:19.748
 I am on the floor of the factory 

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:23.314
 The elephants working here are out of control. 

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.307
 Carlo 

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:26.367
 What did the elephant do? 

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:30.645
 God, ruin everything, my God, this is terrible. 

00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:33.816
 Carlo... 

00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:38.190
 Release the orangutan 

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:41.083
 be quiet 

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:43.243
 Don't forget the meeting just now. 

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:48.038
 Carlo, you better give the orangutan samurai sword 

00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:49.579
 good luck 

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:52.725
 I think it's best to let Joe come back.
