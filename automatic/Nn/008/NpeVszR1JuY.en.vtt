00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.009
 hi friends so today I have 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.649
 great pleasure to find you on 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.120
 facbook line to make a recipe 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.950
 for a person who still counts 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 not bad for me since it's my friend 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.910
 and life and she challenged me to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.230
 to make a frappuccino as at 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.359
 starbucks so let's go I 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.920
 shows how for that you will need to 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.800
 vanilla extract 2 tablespoons 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.260
 sweetened condensed milk a big glass 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.429
 coffee a little smaller is a small 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.140
 little whipped cream and ice cubes 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.989
 in the first step you will do 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.410
 your coffee and then we'll put it to 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.930
 fridge 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.050
 and now that the coffee is fresh 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 you will need a mixer then in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.780
 the blender you will put the milk 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.980
 concentrated sugar and ice cubes 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.399
 then lift the vanilla extract and 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.280
 of course the coffee and there we come all 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.489
 just mix that's where we come 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 to mix the preparation to watch one has 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.000
 a beautiful texture 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.920
 it's rather pleasant it makes you want and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 there we will simply decorate with a 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.720
