00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.910
 So how all punishment for me is little. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.160
 not all the problems that the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.160
 car has now look what happened 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.340
 Water 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.970
 now along with oil 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 the car is a writer and then the tremor joins 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.809
 the head and now I have to open the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 Head to change the gasket I'm going 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.730
 take advantage and give the whole engine to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.019
 to solve the oil leak as well who 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.019
 Send me an old car 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.360
 So how did I say that you live with the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.270
 head of my car there I dismounted 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.830
 All of us today took the head off and I 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.590
 I'll show you how it was. 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.220
 actually we're thinking the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.120
 problem is that the grinder guy made a 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:10.970
 great favor of not tightening the right 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:14.300
 head and looks only you can see here 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:21.229
 the piston heads here 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:27.890
 anne halila and here's william passing 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:30.800
 already willian and here you can see that this 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.710
 they were dirtier than oil 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.080
 even because here in the back is where 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.009
 has more oil pressure work 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.670
 works with an expression is then by 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.320
 this match was leaking through the board and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.030
 entering here who sends along with a 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.030
 with the fuel and the head 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:05.660
 It's fine here and look, I do not know if it's going 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.070
 give right to see the video but 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.550
 signs that the joint has burned is this 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.550
 here o 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.080
 The water flowed from this 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.170
 here was starting here picture together 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:28.190
 on this side and here too you can see here 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.430
 You can also see in the video, you can not 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.780
 put so show it right but it gives 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.770
 to see that the board was already 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.590
 Burning 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.810
 I tried to write it here to see if Dodo 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.209
 the other side you could see better but she 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.040
 is the finishing of the joint getting 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.440
 here is not showing right 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.250
 so now this is it we'll change the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.360
 together tighten right head and let's 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.950
 see how it is 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.170
 we are even finding with the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.019
 ugly oil leak that my car has 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.269
 it was from there that it also passed through the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.580
 valve cap but I think that too 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.570
 I was talking about the board so we're 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.570
 running around so much 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.920
 Only he kicked hard to make xote 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.110
 the money 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.110
 only 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.299
 I squashed mainly to the protein japan
