not<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.850> believe<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:22.930> found<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.409> right<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
not I believe I found it right in this

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.600 
not I believe I found it right in this
patch<00:01:25.050> no<00:01:26.050> it's<00:01:26.470> because<00:01:26.649> i<00:01:26.770> had<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.070> repel<00:01:27.369> on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
patch no it's because i had to repel on

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.740 
patch no it's because i had to repel on
I<00:01:27.850> think<00:01:28.300> that's<00:01:28.479> why<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.060> there's<00:01:31.240> mental<00:01:31.630> or

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
I think that's why and there's mental or

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.420 
I think that's why and there's mental or
right<00:01:31.960> there<00:01:32.200> for<00:01:32.619> anyone<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:33.070> actually

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
right there for anyone that actually

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.020 
right there for anyone that actually
cares<00:01:33.750> all<00:01:34.750> right<00:01:34.899> here<00:01:35.110> we<00:01:35.140> go<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:36.490> right

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
cares all right here we go it's right

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.400 
cares all right here we go it's right
here<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:39.759> it<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.149> latios<00:01:41.050> so<00:01:43.170> blocky<00:01:44.170> O's

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
here and here it is latios so blocky O's

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.340 
here and here it is latios so blocky O's
is<00:01:44.649> harder<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.250> capture<00:01:45.789> than<00:01:46.000> latias<00:01:46.450> which

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
is harder to capture than latias which

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.980 
is harder to capture than latias which
you<00:01:47.530> cannot<00:01:48.130> receive<00:01:48.759> in<00:01:49.149> pokemon<00:01:49.720> soulsilver

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
you cannot receive in pokemon soulsilver

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.359 
you cannot receive in pokemon soulsilver

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
you'll be getting lawdy else unless you

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.969 
you'll be getting lawdy else unless you
did<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.759> Enigma<00:01:55.240> stone<00:01:55.509> event<00:01:55.869> which<00:01:56.289> was<00:01:56.920> a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
did the Enigma stone event which was a

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.540 
did the Enigma stone event which was a
long<00:01:57.460> time<00:01:57.729> ago<00:01:58.110> actually<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.259> been<00:01:59.890> about<00:01:59.920> a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
long time ago actually it's been about a

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.240 
long time ago actually it's been about a
little<00:02:00.880> over<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.240> year<00:02:01.300> i<00:02:01.450> think<00:02:01.899> but<00:02:02.710> uh<00:02:02.770> yeah

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
little over a year i think but uh yeah

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.020 
little over a year i think but uh yeah
i'm<00:02:04.239> sure<00:02:04.539> there's<00:02:05.020> something<00:02:05.250> wacky<00:02:06.250> as<00:02:06.610> she

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
i'm sure there's something wacky as she

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.660 
i'm sure there's something wacky as she
could<00:02:07.209> out<00:02:07.390> there<00:02:07.599> to<00:02:07.720> do<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.959> so<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:09.069> also

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
could out there to do it so it also

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.630 
could out there to do it so it also
knows<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.270> protects<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.590> what<00:02:12.340> else<00:02:12.489> does

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
knows that protects and what else does

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.800 
knows that protects and what else does
it<00:02:12.670> go

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
it go

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.290 
it go
I<00:02:13.890> know<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> owes<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.330> protects<00:02:16.330> maybe<00:02:18.300> I'm

breath<00:02:33.640> that's<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.150> move<00:02:34.300> up<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.569> fig<00:02:34.750> II<00:02:34.780> of

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
breath that's the move up in fig II of

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.839 
breath that's the move up in fig II of
this<00:02:35.170> whole<00:02:35.319> time<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.190> basically<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.580> got

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
this whole time so basically I got

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.729 
this whole time so basically I got
trapped<00:02:37.239> in<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.480> infinity<00:02:38.200> loop<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.680> I

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
trapped in this infinity loop and I

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.199 
trapped in this infinity loop and I
probably<00:02:38.980> shouldn't<00:02:39.340> have<00:02:39.430> saved<00:02:39.640> stated<00:02:40.150> at

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
probably shouldn't have saved stated at

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.490 
probably shouldn't have saved stated at
the<00:02:40.269> beginning<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.780> battle<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.290> should

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
the beginning of this battle that should

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.270 
the beginning of this battle that should
really<00:02:41.709> kind<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.069> hurt<00:02:42.250> me<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:44.099> first<00:02:45.099> thing

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
really kind of hurt me so first thing

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.039 
really kind of hurt me so first thing
you're<00:02:45.430> going<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.580> want<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> do<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.180> mean<00:02:46.569> look

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
you're going to want to do is mean look

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.039 
you're going to want to do is mean look
this<00:02:47.410> or<00:02:47.709> somehow<00:02:48.100> trap<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.120> in<00:02:49.330> battle<00:02:49.750> put<00:02:49.959> it

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
this or somehow trap it in battle put it

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.130 
this or somehow trap it in battle put it
to<00:02:50.170> sleep<00:02:50.410> whatever<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.480> can't<00:02:52.780> run<00:02:53.019> away

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
to sleep whatever so it can't run away

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.960 
to sleep whatever so it can't run away
because<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.739> will<00:02:53.950> run<00:02:54.220> away<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.670> first

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
because it will run away on the first

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.479 
because it will run away on the first
opportunity<00:02:55.390> gets<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:57.010> will<00:02:57.160> not<00:02:57.280> be

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
opportunity gets and you will not be

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.940 
opportunity gets and you will not be
able<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.760> capture<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.540> until<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.530> find<00:02:59.799> it

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
able to capture it and until you find it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.589 
able to capture it and until you find it
on<00:03:00.069> another<00:03:00.280> route<00:03:00.640> which<00:03:00.910> will<00:03:01.090> take<00:03:01.269> forever

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
on another route which will take forever

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.490 
on another route which will take forever
so<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.530> basically<00:03:02.799> just<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.370> waste

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
so it's basically just a waste

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.200 
so it's basically just a waste
so<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.640> just<00:03:06.670> hit<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.150> hard<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.340> what<00:03:10.180> I

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
so you just hit it hard but and what I

so you just hit it hard but and what I
failed<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:11.160> remember<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.580> that<00:03:12.910> uh<00:03:13.890> what<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.010> it

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
failed to remember is that uh what is it

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.130 
failed to remember is that uh what is it

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.260 
a mean look mean look can be baton past
and<00:03:21.470> 4th<00:03:21.770> gen<00:03:22.070> but<00:03:22.490> you<00:03:22.640> can't<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:22.970> switch

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
and 4th gen but you can't just switch

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.660 
and 4th gen but you can't just switch
out<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:24.410> 5th<00:03:24.770> gen<00:03:25.010> black<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.520> white<00:03:25.640> I
