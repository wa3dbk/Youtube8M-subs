00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
is basically the cage the cage doesn't

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.160 
is basically the cage the cage doesn't
have<00:02:44.700> overly<00:02:45.120> too<00:02:45.270> much<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.750> want<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.050> get

might<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:51.000> that

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
might do that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.190 
might do that
but<00:02:52.500> eventually<00:02:52.860> they'll<00:02:53.520> be<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.790> into

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
but eventually they'll be going into

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.990
