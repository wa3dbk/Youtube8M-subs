we decided to get an annuity Jie because

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.610 
we decided to get an annuity Jie because
the<00:02:24.069> old<00:02:24.220> one<00:02:24.490> had<00:02:24.940> we're<00:02:25.900> still<00:02:26.080> working<00:02:26.440> well

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
people actually seeing the machinery it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.449 
people actually seeing the machinery it
was<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:35.110> battered<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:35.830> we<00:02:35.920> decided<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.370> get

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
was a bit battered so we decided to get

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.890 
was a bit battered so we decided to get
a<00:02:36.520> new<00:02:36.580> one

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
a new one

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.330 
a new one
