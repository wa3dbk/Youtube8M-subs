have<00:03:23.630> bicolor<00:03:24.530> lighting<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.069> don't<00:03:25.220> know<00:03:25.280> how

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
have bicolor lighting I don't know how

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.319 
have bicolor lighting I don't know how
well<00:03:25.519> they'll<00:03:25.639> come<00:03:25.790> through<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.120> video

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
well they'll come through on the video

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.789 
well they'll come through on the video
but<00:03:26.629> that<00:03:26.660> lets<00:03:27.019> me<00:03:27.109> do<00:03:27.290> both<00:03:27.500> white<00:03:27.769> and

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
but that lets me do both white and

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.530 
but that lets me do both white and
yellow<00:03:28.190> light<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:28.669> I<00:03:28.700> can<00:03:28.730> balance<00:03:29.090> them<00:03:29.389> to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
yellow light so I can balance them to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.539 
yellow light so I can balance them to
match<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.870> other<00:03:30.019> lighting<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.099> room<00:03:31.129> i

it's<00:03:40.010> not<00:03:40.220> an<00:03:40.430> ideal<00:03:40.849> setup<00:03:41.180> because<00:03:41.449> i'm

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
it's not an ideal setup because i'm

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.990

looking<00:03:42.199> through<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.949> camera<00:03:42.980> which<00:03:43.970> can

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
looking through the camera which can

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.970 
looking through the camera which can
give<00:03:44.269> me<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.419> lot<00:03:44.599> of<00:03:44.720> eye<00:03:44.870> strain<00:03:45.169> later<00:03:45.440> so

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
give me a lot of eye strain later so

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.009 
give me a lot of eye strain later so
