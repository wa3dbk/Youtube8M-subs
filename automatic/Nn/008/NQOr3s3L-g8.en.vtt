00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.670 

today<00:00:00.750> we'll<00:00:00.960> be<00:00:00.989> reviewing<00:00:01.190> Hexbug<00:00:02.190> Aquabot

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.799 

so<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:08.010> says<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.519> smart<00:00:08.910> fish<00:00:09.120> technology

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
so it says it's smart fish technology

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.520 
so it says it's smart fish technology
the<00:00:09.929> robotic<00:00:10.469> fish<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.950> really<00:00:11.519> swims<00:00:12.139> so<00:00:13.139> it

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
the robotic fish that really swims so it

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.210 
the robotic fish that really swims so it
dives<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.280> changes<00:00:14.730> direction<00:00:15.389> so

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
dives and changes direction so

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.890 
dives and changes direction so
supposedly<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.970> put<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.510> water<00:00:18.539> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
supposedly it's you put it in water and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.260 
supposedly it's you put it in water and
it<00:00:19.560> comes<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.980> life<00:00:20.130> by<00:00:20.340> swimming<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.090> diving

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it comes to life by swimming and diving

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.140 
it comes to life by swimming and diving
and<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:21.810> sorts<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.230> stuff<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.859> says<00:00:23.150> water

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
and all sorts of stuff it says water

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.870 
and all sorts of stuff it says water
brings<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> life<00:00:24.869> includes<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.859> fish<00:00:26.250> one

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
brings it to life includes one fish one

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
brings it to life includes one fish one
tank<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.330> batteries<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.109> included<00:00:28.340> so

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
tank and batteries are included so

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.669 
tank and batteries are included so
there's<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.090> fish<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> tank

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
there's some fish and this is the tank

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.819 
there's some fish and this is the tank
so<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> they<00:00:34.170> come<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.469> different<00:00:34.649> colors

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
so and they come in different colors

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.250 
so and they come in different colors
this<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.700> green<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.600> orange<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this is a green one they have orange and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.119 
this is a green one they have orange and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
batteries and which batteries to get for

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
batteries and which batteries to get for
your<00:01:06.720> fish<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.650> swims<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.920> five

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
your fish and so if you swims for five

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.210 
your fish and so if you swims for five
minutes<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.939> then<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.229> stop<00:01:14.040> i

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
minutes and then it will like stop i

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.289 
minutes and then it will like stop i
guess<00:01:14.400> i<00:01:14.549> don't<00:01:14.610> know<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.000> float<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
guess i don't know if it will float to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
guess i don't know if it will float to
the<00:01:15.330> top<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:15.750> sinker<00:01:16.110> yeah<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the top or sinker yeah I don't know you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
the top or sinker yeah I don't know you
just<00:01:17.490> take<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.030> by<00:01:18.299> its<00:01:18.479> fin<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.200> like

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just take it out by its fin and you like

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.920 
just take it out by its fin and you like
shake<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.189> dry<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.659> put<00:01:21.900> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
shake it so it's dry then you put it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.960 
shake it so it's dry then you put it
back<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.439> water<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.549> suppose

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
back in the water and it will suppose

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
back in the water and it will suppose
the<00:01:24.180> comebacks<00:01:25.080> life<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> good<00:01:27.119> thing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
