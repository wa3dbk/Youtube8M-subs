00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
to the Armin Cantus so you get it a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920 
to the Armin Cantus so you get it a
little<00:00:16.980> bit<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.220> both<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.760> if<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> don't<00:00:18.779> try

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
little bit of both but if you don't try

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.300 
little bit of both but if you don't try
it<00:00:18.960> out<00:00:19.080> beast<00:00:19.230> mode<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.130> couple

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it out beast mode and you have a couple

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.529 
it out beast mode and you have a couple
of<00:00:20.400> players<00:00:20.550> lying<00:00:20.970> around<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.240> can't<00:00:21.390> really

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
of players lying around you can't really

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.179 
of players lying around you can't really
do<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> solo<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.410> really<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.010> difficult

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
do it solo it's really really difficult

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.370 
do it solo it's really really difficult
but<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> recommend<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.840> giving<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> try<00:00:25.260> if

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
but I recommend you giving it a try if

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.859 
but I recommend you giving it a try if
you<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.560> two<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.130> four<00:00:26.160> players<00:00:26.630> maybe<00:00:27.630> five

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you have two to four players maybe five

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.410 
you have two to four players maybe five
even<00:00:28.140> better<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.529> basically<00:00:29.090> it's<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.390> of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
even better but basically it's kind of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
even better but basically it's kind of
an<00:00:30.539> elimination<00:00:31.080> stop<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.650> you've<00:00:32.099> gotta

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
an elimination stop in you've gotta

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.220 
an elimination stop in you've gotta
eliminate<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> heroes<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> humans

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
eliminate all the heroes and the humans

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.889 
eliminate all the heroes and the humans
and<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:36.090> maybe<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> gamers

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and or I think maybe just all the gamers

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.590 
and or I think maybe just all the gamers
I'm<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.230> really<00:00:37.350> sure<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:39.300> basically

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I'm not really sure but I but basically

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
I'm not really sure but I but basically
just<00:00:39.719> eliminated<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> people<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> see

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
just eliminated the people if you see

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.470 
just eliminated the people if you see
the<00:00:41.940> cops<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:43.910> that's<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.270> gonna

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the cops and that's it you're just gonna

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
the cops and that's it you're just gonna
run<00:00:45.840> around<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.079> destroy<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:46.559> dupes

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
video was mentioning that I used the as

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.580 
video was mentioning that I used the as
I<00:01:32.759> try<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.150> through<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.540> thing

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.920 

that's<00:01:37.400> that's<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.790> pretty<00:01:38.000> powerful<00:01:38.510> labor

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.750 
that's that's a pretty powerful labor
they<00:01:39.170> definitely<00:01:39.380> know<00:01:39.590> six<00:01:39.890> or<00:01:40.040> seven<00:01:40.640> a

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
they definitely know six or seven a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.330 
they definitely know six or seven a
barrier<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:42.260> these<00:01:42.440> guys<00:01:42.650> have<00:01:42.830> up<00:01:43.010> all<00:01:43.190> over

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
barrier that these guys have up all over

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.220 
barrier that these guys have up all over
the<00:01:43.490> place<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:44.000> it's<00:01:44.120> pretty<00:01:44.270> wild<00:01:44.960> how<00:01:45.050> much

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
the place so it's pretty wild how much
