00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.430
 it is already almost twelve o'clock and that against england that is clearly what one 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.710
 whining I say yes I was taken by scoring one more time 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.720
 that number of weeks ago that I had with rtl ns and the entire week the 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.550
 broadcasts in the repeat 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.630
 and so there came 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 about joe kinnear i hope this is the best there images and put after the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.500
 long-term all album I have I have where I have even more 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.559
 received from the record companies 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.200
 so i'm going to be a very strong year the cameraman 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.940
 I'm only going one 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.070
 for customers 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.420
 one of them just absent 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.950
 these and other questions if you are if you congratulate that fraud according to it 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:55.969
 klpd 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 how often do you have hands 9 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.130
 and I think the man has been fed up in recent years 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.940
 a very quick and thunderstorm and this biennial event is now going 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.010
 I have to replace a signature a few girls was a series in itself 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 import is just a newspaper with in the back and 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.060
 because the singer herself at so 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.710
 He died we must be the members of the association year 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.770
 beijing anp the grain as well as producer 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.539
 and this week the definitive end of a personal title 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.390
 but I'm not going in either 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 the female and figured out with options so we wait 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.700
 A better proof is to have waited the rest of your life throughout 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.470
 very shocking actually that you are satisfied with your own problems 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.910
 but I am satisfied with the answer that it works in addition to racing director 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.090
 all year ago, the world bank said that there was chaos in meteren enne 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.790
 new and he relocated to ajax wanting to let everyone know really 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.500
 again about mine and if you have not made this public then you earn 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.600
 with both hands 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.399
 then I think so 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.399
 all eyes focused 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.959
 after the incident, I think none of the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.840
 how much the base measures 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.390
 for that it has an interesting be the plans before it is black 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.629
 they worked 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.579
 nijmegen 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.899
 we have it once and not even a year old 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.689
 I knew here is still possible is already leaked 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.469
 fc twente, however 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.349
 blacks 4 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.539
 Jamaica 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.219
 once much too small 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.989
 the rest of the year 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.920
 living and doing business where necessary 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.449
 and then and another 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.399
 has also been able to think for a moment and how many of the people have and another 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:53.109
 year and the overclocking idea are how many types of women in the 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.679
 has bracket 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:55.510
 anp 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.159
 now I have been there that unfortunately unfortunately did not 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.269
 connect an overview 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.290
 to the kids 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.929
 and we must avoid that 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:07.499
 therapy 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:11.759
 He says I'm going to get out of thank you I'm going to have to do it on your own 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.599
 you must now afterwards the last time we have much longer 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.739
 yes that matters it is me on the other hand 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.899
 I wish you a performance 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 all principle immediate neighbor not happy 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:31.839
