00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.789 
same like together as you can see it's
now<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.159> eight<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:48.229> David<00:01:49.229> zoom<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> same

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
now at eight now David zoom the same

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.100 
now at eight now David zoom the same
thing<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:51.119> throw<00:01:52.110> some<00:01:53.070> more<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> ground

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
thing if I throw some more on the ground

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
thing if I throw some more on the ground

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
this also works for armor and all that

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.749 
this also works for armor and all that
stuff<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.350> moving<00:01:58.710> together<00:01:58.860> pick<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> up

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
stuff so it's moving together pick it up

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.459 
stuff so it's moving together pick it up
now<00:02:00.210> these<00:02:00.390> will<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.810> different<00:02:01.170> stacks

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
now these will be in different stacks

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.010 
now these will be in different stacks
and<00:02:01.799> as<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.329> throw<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.899> like

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and as you can see if you throw it like

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.359 
and as you can see if you throw it like
that<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.729> oh<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:07.229> shouldn't<00:02:07.710> yeah<00:02:08.099> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that it will not oh it shouldn't yeah it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639 
that it will not oh it shouldn't yeah it
won't<00:02:08.640> actually<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.660> together<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.560> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
won't actually go together so what you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280 
won't actually go together so what you
want<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.160> pick<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.670> up

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
want to do is pick it up

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.069 
want to do is pick it up
get<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.680> your<00:02:13.709> other<00:02:14.040> stack<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:14.909> you<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.540> one

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079
