00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.033
 This video will show you how to download and play 

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:05.011
 The Hardware Diagnostic utility. 

00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:06.089
 This will benefit you if you need help identifying 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.044
 Whether your HP printer is working fine. 

00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:11.067
 The first thing you do is 

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.000
 Visit HP 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.056
 To download the Hardware Diagnostic utility. 

00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:18.044
 From the computer Open the Web browser 

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:20.067
 Which you normally use to access the Internet. 

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.044
 In this video we use Internet Explorer 

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:24.083
 However, the steps in it will be similar in any other browser. 

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:30.061
 In the address bar, type www.hp.com/support 

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:33.000
 Then click the arrow to the right of the title bar, 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.078
 Or press Enter from the keyboard. 

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:36.094
 The HP Support page will appear. 

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:39.094
 Click on your place of residence from the map. 

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:42.006
 In this video we chose North America 

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.094
 Choose your country of residence 

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.011
 And your language from the list displayed. 

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.017
 We chose this model in the United States and English. 

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:50.050
 Because we want to download the software 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.028
 Click the "Drivers and Software" option. 

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.089
 Then look for the place 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.083
 Where you can enter printer information. 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.094
 In the "Enter product name / number" text box, 

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:01.050
 Type the appropriate model number. 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.089
 In this video we use the C309a. 

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:07.022
 After entering the model number 

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:09.089
 Press the Search button or press Enter from the keyboard. 

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.089
 Note that if you enter part of the model number 

00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:15.072
 Eg c309 instead of c309a, 

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:17.078
 You'll need to select your product from a list of products. 

00:01:17.078 --> 00:01:19.039
 If you enter the entire model number 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.072
 You'll be directed directly to the software page for your product. 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.089
 Open the "Select your operating system" drop-down menu. 

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:28.039
 Select your operating system to see it. 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.061
 In this video 

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.089
 We chose Windows 7. 

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:34.067
 After selecting your operating system, click Next. 

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.072
 A new step will appear that lets you choose 

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:38.089
 The type of download you are looking for. 

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:40.067
 Because we want the Hardware Diagnostic utility, 

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:41.078
 We must click the plus icon 

00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:44.044
 Next to "Utility - Diagnostic Tools". 

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:47.000
 Find Hardware Diagnostic utility. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Click the link to the download page. 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.022
 Click the "Download" button to start downloading the file. 

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:53.033
 A window will pop up asking you 

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.061
 What to do with the file. 

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:55.067
 Choose Save. 

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.050
 Select where you want to save the file. 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.028
 Be sure to save the file somewhere. 

00:02:00.028 --> 00:02:02.033
 It's easy to remember where you will be able to install it later. 

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.011
 For example, we saved the file to the desktop. 

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:06.044
 Now that you have located the saved tool on your computer, 

00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:08.094
 The file will be downloaded to the selected folder. 

00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:11.028
 At this point, it has successfully downloaded 

00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:12.083
 The Hardware Diagnostic utility, 

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:15.011
 We can use them to look for potential problems. 

00:02:16.028 --> 00:02:18.061
 And to find the file you downloaded the moment 

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:21.050
 Click the Open Folder button or navigate to the folder 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.017
 To which I downloaded the file. 

00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:25.067
 Look for the installation file inside the folder 

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:28.056
 This file is in exe format. 

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:30.078
 Double click on the file to open the tool. 

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.094
 You may be asked 

00:02:32.094 --> 00:02:34.039
 Agree to open file. 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.061
 Click "OK", "Yes" or "Continue" to allow the tool to open. 

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.094
 The program will then be extracted and opened automatically. 

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:43.011
 After you open the program you will have to choose 

00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.006
 Any HP printer that wants to fix its problems. 

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:47.011
 Installed HP and if you have more than one printer 

00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.067
 Click the desired printer, and then click Diagnostics. 

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:51.056
 The tool will then start scanning the printer 

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.044
 To verify that it is working fine, 

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.006
 If the tool detects any problems 

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.000
 Will display 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.094
 In the right window of the tool 

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:59.078
 The tool will also try to explain 

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:02.011
 About the problem and solve it. 

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:03.072
 And from this stage 

00:03:03.072 --> 00:03:05.050
 The steps vary depending on your printer 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.011
 Given the myriad of forms in which these steps may appear, 

00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:10.033
 The remaining steps are not explained in this video. 

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:12.072
 To use the tool, follow the instructions 

00:03:12.072 --> 00:03:13.067
 On the screen 

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.094
 Will lead to diagnosis.
