00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.370 

that's<00:01:55.870> gonna<00:01:56.050> go<00:01:56.200> through<00:01:56.410> F

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.440 

but<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.130> second<00:02:04.580> time<00:02:04.610> an<00:02:04.909> F<00:02:05.030> is<00:02:05.150> gonna<00:02:05.299> be<00:02:05.420> a

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
but the second time an F is gonna be a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.340 
but the second time an F is gonna be a
little<00:02:05.750> different

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
little different

when you come back the second time in a
half<00:02:08.270> instead<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.630> standing<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.020> this

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.260 

it's<00:02:14.660> gonna<00:02:14.810> sound<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.200> this

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.760

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
I'll show that to you again the F is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.930 
I'll show that to you again the F is
gonna<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.250> this

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.880 

so<00:02:35.940> f<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.840> going<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.170> met<00:02:37.680> with<00:02:37.709> pinkie<00:02:38.250> a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
so f is going to be met with pinkie a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.290 
so f is going to be met with pinkie a
flat<00:02:40.890> up<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:42.569> finger<00:02:43.160> then<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.580> see

the<00:02:45.450> pointer<00:02:45.720> finger

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
the pointer finger

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.110 
the pointer finger
then<00:02:47.950> deal<00:02:48.670> with<00:02:48.820> thumb<00:02:49.410> up<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.470> E<00:02:51.370> flat<00:02:51.520> with

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
then deal with thumb up to E flat with

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.450 
then deal with thumb up to E flat with
them<00:02:52.950> back<00:02:53.950> down<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.370> D<00:02:55.330> with<00:02:55.600> them<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.190> C

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
them back down to D with them then to C

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.260 
them back down to D with them then to C
with<00:02:57.640> corner<00:02:57.940> finger<00:02:58.830> then<00:02:59.830> back<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.520> flat<00:03:01.000> a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
then D then back to F

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.720 
then D then back to F
the<00:03:11.350> second<00:03:11.830> time<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> net<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.400> going<00:03:12.520> to<00:03:12.640> look

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
the second time the net is going to look

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.440 
the second time the net is going to look
like<00:03:12.880> this<00:03:13.320> see<00:03:14.320> twice<00:03:15.130> our<00:03:15.700> sorry<00:03:16.060> F<00:03:16.300> twice

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
like this see twice our sorry F twice

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.810 
like this see twice our sorry F twice
then<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.870> flattened<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.760> with<00:03:21.760> middle<00:03:22.030> finger

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820

and<00:03:50.599> then<00:03:51.290> you're<00:03:51.440> ready<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.680> go<00:03:51.800> back<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.099> see

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
and then you're ready to go back to see

and then you're ready to go back to see
I<00:03:54.160> know<00:03:55.160> it's<00:03:55.400> really<00:03:55.580> confusing<00:03:56.140> I'll<00:03:57.140> just

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
I know it's really confusing I'll just

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.020 
I know it's really confusing I'll just
play<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.800> for<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.040> once<00:03:58.190> in<00:03:58.310> slow<00:03:58.520> motion<00:03:58.880> so

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
play it for you once in slow motion so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.760 
play it for you once in slow motion so
you<00:03:59.120> can<00:03:59.270> see<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.870> then<00:04:00.110> I'll<00:04:00.230> play<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.620> a

you can see it and then I'll play it a

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.140 
you can see it and then I'll play it a
little<00:04:00.980> bit<00:04:01.190> faster<00:04:01.580> so<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:01.760> can<00:04:01.850> hear<00:04:02.060> what

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
little bit faster so you can hear what

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.730 
little bit faster so you can hear what
it<00:04:02.210> sounds<00:04:02.480> like<00:04:02.540> here's<00:04:03.380> what<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.590> whole

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
it sounds like here's what the whole

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.320 
it sounds like here's what the whole
thing<00:04:04.040> is<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.310> slow<00:04:04.610> motion<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:05.120> know<00:04:05.210> what

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
thing is a slow motion you know what

00:04:05.330 --> 00:05:04.380 
thing is a slow motion you know what
geniune<00:04:05.660> there

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.280 

so<00:05:05.390> that's<00:05:05.570> what<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.750> whole<00:05:05.870> thing<00:05:06.140> is<00:05:06.170> gonna

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
so that's what the whole thing is gonna

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.410 
so that's what the whole thing is gonna
look<00:05:06.500> like<00:05:06.710> now<00:05:07.550> I'm<00:05:07.610> gonna<00:05:07.760> play<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.060> for<00:05:08.090> you

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
a little bit faster just so you can hear

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.930 
a little bit faster just so you can hear
what<00:05:09.950> it<00:05:10.040> sounds<00:05:10.340> like<00:05:10.370> when<00:05:10.580> it's<00:05:10.730> up<00:05:10.850> the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
what it sounds like when it's up the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:36.779 
what it sounds like when it's up the
tempo<00:05:11.330> here<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:11.960> guys

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:40.570 

so<00:05:37.789> even<00:05:37.939> livers<00:05:38.419> is<00:05:38.569> not<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:38.960> best<00:05:39.169> but<00:05:39.979> you

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
so even livers is not the best but you

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.679 
so even livers is not the best but you
get<00:05:40.699> the<00:05:40.819> gist<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.180> it

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:41.689 
get the gist of it

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.240 
get the gist of it
you<00:05:41.960> can<00:05:42.110> watch<00:05:42.259> the<00:05:42.409> slow<00:05:42.590> motion<00:05:42.770> version

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
you can watch the slow motion version

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.189 
you can watch the slow motion version
all<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.460> want<00:05:43.729> even<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.629> need<00:05:44.780> some<00:05:44.900> practice

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
all you want even I need some practice

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.689 
all you want even I need some practice

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
with this one it's pretty tough but I

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:47.740 
with this one it's pretty tough but I
thought<00:05:46.849> I'd<00:05:47.000> show<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.270> you<00:05:47.330> guys<00:05:47.449> anyway
