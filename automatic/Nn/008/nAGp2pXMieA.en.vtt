use to develop our MMA game we're going
to<00:00:32.669> introduce<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.210> series<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> techniques<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to introduce a series of techniques and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.689 
to introduce a series of techniques and
while<00:00:34.710> you're<00:00:34.860> working<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> home

while you're working on in the home

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.400 
while you're working on in the home
we'll<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.300> working<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.660> them<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:36.989> at<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> gym

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
we'll be working on them here at the gym

we'll be working on them here at the gym
no<00:00:38.100> technique<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.640> perfect<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.210> everything's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
no technique is perfect and everything's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.210 
no technique is perfect and everything's
got<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> counter<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.769> run<00:00:40.920> into

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
got a counter so if you run into

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.860 
got a counter so if you run into
challenges<00:00:41.699> at<00:00:41.820> home<00:00:41.940> we're<00:00:42.449> bound<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> run

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
challenges at home we're bound to run

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.630 
challenges at home we're bound to run
into<00:00:42.899> our<00:00:43.199> own<00:00:43.320> set<00:00:43.589> of<00:00:43.620> problems<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.250> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
into our own set of problems here and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
into our own set of problems here and
we're<00:00:44.760> gonna<00:00:44.850> come<00:00:45.089> up<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.480> solution<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
we're gonna come up with the solution to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.540 
we're gonna come up with the solution to
those<00:00:46.199> problems<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.010> share<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> with

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
those problems and then share that with

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.899 
those problems and then share that with
you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
let's get started what we'd like to work

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
let's get started what we'd like to work
on<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.710> day<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.040> basic<00:01:38.580> technique<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
on the day is a basic technique from the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.940 
on the day is a basic technique from the
closed<00:01:39.390> guard<00:01:39.630> position<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:40.830> trying

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
closed guard position all we're trying

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.860 
closed guard position all we're trying
to<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.640> break<00:01:41.970> our<00:01:42.150> opponents<00:01:42.540> posture

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
to do is break our opponents posture

to do is break our opponents posture
down<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.290> minimize<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.979> amount<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.280> damage

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
now that that was a little bit of an

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.230 
now that that was a little bit of an
exaggeration<00:04:24.740> but<00:04:24.920> at<00:04:25.130> least<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.730> you<00:04:26.060> got

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
exaggeration but at least you you got

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.210 
exaggeration but at least you you got
the<00:04:26.360> point<00:04:26.630> here<00:04:27.170> it<00:04:27.230> is<00:04:27.320> again<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:31.010> that's

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
the point here it is again and that's

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.830 
the point here it is again and that's
just<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.520> great<00:04:31.640> indicator<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:32.630> are

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
just a great indicator that you are

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.750 
just a great indicator that you are
actually<00:04:33.440> affecting<00:04:33.980> their<00:04:34.100> posture<00:04:34.580> and

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
actually affecting their posture and
