you can switch it with the other elites
that<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.060> get<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.140> buying

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660

and the two shoulder pads come off just

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.410 
and the two shoulder pads come off just
like<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> multiplayer

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
like they would with the multiplayer

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.919 
like they would with the multiplayer
figure<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.550> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.660> tan<00:00:30.900> or

the red one or whatever color you can
switch<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.390> armor<00:00:33.660> around<00:00:34.399> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.579> so

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
switch the armor around if you so

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.360 
switch the armor around if you so
desired<00:00:36.120> he<00:00:36.660> does<00:00:36.899> come<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.380> two<00:00:37.680> plasma

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
desired he does come with two plasma

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.639 
desired he does come with two plasma
rifles<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:39.210> here

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
rifles right here

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.049 
rifles right here
I<00:00:40.680> don't<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> other<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.700> his<00:00:41.820> hand

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I don't have the other one in his hand

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.049 
I don't have the other one in his hand
and<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:44.149> wouldn't<00:00:45.149> recommend<00:00:46.670> really<00:00:47.670> trying

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and I wouldn't recommend really trying

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.369 
and I wouldn't recommend really trying
to<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.420> too<00:00:48.539> many<00:00:48.600> weapons<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.050> their<00:00:49.170> hands

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to put too many weapons in their hands

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
to put too many weapons in their hands
because<00:00:49.950> their<00:00:50.129> fingers<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.700> probably

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
because their fingers will probably

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.160 
because their fingers will probably
break<00:00:52.850> what<00:00:53.850> I've<00:00:53.940> been<00:00:54.120> doing<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> using

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
break what I've been doing is and using

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.130 
break what I've been doing is and using
a<00:00:55.230> blow<00:00:55.440> dryer<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.949> heat<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:57.239> their<00:00:57.510> hand<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
a blow dryer to heat up their hand and

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.529 
a blow dryer to heat up their hand and
then<00:00:58.530> opening<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> fingers<00:00:59.520> because<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
then opening the fingers because it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.229 
then opening the fingers because it
makes<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> plastic<00:01:01.199> more<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:02.059> guess<00:01:03.059> you'd<00:01:03.210> say

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
makes the plastic more I guess you'd say

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.179 
makes the plastic more I guess you'd say
bendable<00:01:03.840> temporarily<00:01:04.350> while<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.739> warm<00:01:05.010> or

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
bendable temporarily while it's warm or

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.399 
bendable temporarily while it's warm or
hot<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.659> things<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.229> out<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
hot so you can get things in and out of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.410 
hot so you can get things in and out of
the<00:01:07.470> hands<00:01:07.710> easier<00:01:08.070> without<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.000> much<00:01:09.119> fear<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the hands easier without so much fear of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.070 
the hands easier without so much fear of
breaking<00:01:09.600> things<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:11.479> he<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.689> hold<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
breaking things but he can hold the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.280 
breaking things but he can hold the
plasma<00:01:13.500> sword<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.610> plasma<00:01:14.790> rifle<00:01:16.340> and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
plasma sword and the plasma rifle and

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
plasma sword and the plasma rifle and
I've<00:01:19.290> been<00:01:19.470> able<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.950> them<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.340> hold<00:01:20.549> well

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I've been able to get them to hold well

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.789 
I've been able to get them to hold well
the<00:01:21.360> other<00:01:21.540> elite<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.350> battle<00:01:22.770> rifles<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:24.799> they

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the other elite a battle rifles so they

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
the other elite a battle rifles so they
can<00:01:25.950> hold<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.189> couple<00:01:26.369> different<00:01:26.729> weapons<00:01:27.030> but

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
can hold a couple different weapons but

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.920 
can hold a couple different weapons but
not<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> whole<00:01:28.200> lot<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.930> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
not a whole lot because they have this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
not a whole lot because they have this
part<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.130> their<00:01:32.280> two

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
part right here what they have their two

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310 
part right here what they have their two
thumbs<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.659> difficult<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> get

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
thumbs so it's very difficult to get

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.340 
thumbs so it's very difficult to get
much<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:36.680> as<00:01:37.680> far<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.930> poseability<00:01:39.930> goes

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
much in there as far as poseability goes

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080 
much in there as far as poseability goes
this<00:01:40.740> figure<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.460> pretty<00:01:41.850> good<00:01:42.030> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this figure is actually pretty good I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.770 
this figure is actually pretty good I
like<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:44.090> now<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.119> gotta<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.420> careful<00:01:45.600> because

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
like it now you gotta be careful because

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.350 
like it now you gotta be careful because
the<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.920> shoulder<00:01:47.520> pads<00:01:47.700> will<00:01:47.880> come<00:01:48.000> off<00:01:48.149> if

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the the shoulder pads will come off if

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.940 
the the shoulder pads will come off if
you<00:01:48.479> move<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> arms<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.460> too<00:01:50.659> far<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.799> mean

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you move the arms and too far but I mean

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.120 
you move the arms and too far but I mean
that's<00:01:53.100> pretty<00:01:53.759> good<00:01:54.500> heat<00:01:55.500> rate<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that's pretty good heat rate there and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.429 
that's pretty good heat rate there and
he<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.369> reach<00:01:56.899> kind<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.049> front<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.320> himself

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
he can reach kind of in front of himself

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.440 
he can reach kind of in front of himself
you<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> mess<00:01:59.579> with<00:01:59.700> his<00:01:59.850> arms<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.180> bit<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you have to mess with his arms a bit to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.950 
you have to mess with his arms a bit to
be<00:02:00.540> able<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:00.840> him

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
be able to get him

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.010 
be able to get him
posing<00:02:02.960> around<00:02:03.230> but<00:02:03.440> that's<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.490> gist<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.820> it

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
posing around but that's the gist of it

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.830 
posing around but that's the gist of it
for<00:02:06.020> his<00:02:06.140> arms<00:02:06.460> his<00:02:07.460> head<00:02:07.700> I'm<00:02:08.240> very<00:02:08.510> glad<00:02:08.630> they

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
for his arms his head I'm very glad they

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.510 
for his arms his head I'm very glad they
put<00:02:08.960> articulation<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:09.650> the<00:02:09.710> head<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.100> really

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
put articulation in the head that really

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.720 
put articulation in the head that really
has<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.240> plus<00:02:11.600> in<00:02:11.750> my<00:02:11.870> opinion<00:02:12.170> me<00:02:12.310> go<00:02:13.310> down<00:02:13.520> that

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
has a plus in my opinion me go down that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.870 
has a plus in my opinion me go down that
far<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:14.630> he<00:02:14.750> can<00:02:14.900> look<00:02:15.460> pretty<00:02:16.460> high<00:02:16.640> up

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
far and then he can look pretty high up

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.430 
far and then he can look pretty high up
it's<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.360> pretty<00:02:17.540> big<00:02:17.750> difference<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.260> it's

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
it's a pretty big difference and it's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.530 
it's a pretty big difference and it's
got<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.890> pretty<00:02:19.790> good<00:02:19.970> range<00:02:20.210> of<00:02:22.420> looking<00:02:23.420> to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
got a pretty good range of looking to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.670 
got a pretty good range of looking to
the<00:02:23.630> left<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.110> right<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.350> mean<00:02:24.470> it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
the left and to the right I mean it's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830 
the left and to the right I mean it's
not<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.120> Spartans<00:02:26.540> where<00:02:26.630> they<00:02:26.690> could

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
not like the Spartans where they could

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.720 
not like the Spartans where they could
turn<00:02:26.990> their<00:02:27.110> heads<00:02:27.260> further<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:27.830> they<00:02:28.550> could

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
turn their heads further but they could

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.550 
turn their heads further but they could
have<00:02:28.820> left<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.240> like<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.810> jackal<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.350> when<00:02:30.470> you

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
have left it like the jackal so when you

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.200 
have left it like the jackal so when you
started<00:02:30.860> turning<00:02:31.100> its<00:02:31.250> head<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.460> was<00:02:31.520> like<00:02:31.580> you

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
started turning its head it was like you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.140 
started turning its head it was like you
know<00:02:32.300> what's<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.700> instead<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
know what's going on instead of just to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.690 
know what's going on instead of just to
the<00:02:35.240> side<00:02:35.480> his<00:02:36.400> legs

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
the side his legs

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.030 
the side his legs
oh<00:02:37.850> there<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:38.870> no<00:02:39.050> articulation<00:02:39.500> here<00:02:39.950> in

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
oh there is like no articulation here in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.060 
oh there is like no articulation here in
the<00:02:40.160> chest<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:41.030> mean<00:02:41.180> that's<00:02:42.080> that's<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.860> pretty

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the chest I mean that's that's it pretty

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.700 
the chest I mean that's that's it pretty
much<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.460> can't<00:02:43.670> twist<00:02:43.910> them<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.710> it's

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
much you can't twist them so it's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.080 
much you can't twist them so it's
because<00:02:45.980> they<00:02:46.160> put<00:02:46.310> some<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.670> head<00:02:46.850> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
because they put some in the head and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.910 
because they put some in the head and
the<00:02:47.300> neck<00:02:47.330> really<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.650> can<00:02:48.800> actually

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the neck really so that you can actually

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.740 
the neck really so that you can actually
turn<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:50.120> legs<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.070> pretty<00:02:52.340> good

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
turn it the legs can have a pretty good

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.240 
turn it the legs can have a pretty good
range<00:02:53.750> now<00:02:54.350> when<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.740> do<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:54.980> legs<00:02:55.160> you're

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
range now when you do the legs you're

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.870 
range now when you do the legs you're
gonna<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.700> also<00:02:55.850> reposition<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:57.230> knee

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
gonna have to also reposition the knee

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.910 
gonna have to also reposition the knee
but<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.000> not<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.120> big<00:02:59.390> deal<00:02:59.570> it<00:03:00.500> makes<00:03:00.709> it<00:03:00.830> kind

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
but it's not a big deal it makes it kind

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.070 
but it's not a big deal it makes it kind
of<00:03:01.010> cool<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.459> mean<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.480> go<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:02.720> far<00:03:02.900> back

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
of cool the mean can go that far back

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.550 
of cool the mean can go that far back
and<00:03:03.350> then<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.620> far<00:03:03.830> forward<00:03:05.530> which<00:03:06.530> is

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
and then that far forward which is

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.229 
and then that far forward which is
better<00:03:06.830> than<00:03:07.040> some<00:03:07.250> figures<00:03:07.610> it's<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
better than some figures it's not the

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.610 
better than some figures it's not the
greatest<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.810> would<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.050> liked<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.380> if<00:03:09.470> they

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
greatest I would have liked it if they

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.600 
greatest I would have liked it if they
could<00:03:09.830> do<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:11.030> couple<00:03:11.570> different<00:03:12.400> poses<00:03:13.400> if<00:03:13.520> you

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
could do a couple different poses if you

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.650 
could do a couple different poses if you
know<00:03:13.700> if<00:03:13.760> they<00:03:13.850> had<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:13.970> little<00:03:14.180> bit<00:03:14.390> further

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
know if they had a little bit further

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.380 
know if they had a little bit further
range<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.170> articulation<00:03:15.800> but<00:03:15.920> it's<00:03:16.070> not<00:03:16.390> that

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
range of articulation but it's not that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.390 
range of articulation but it's not that
bad<00:03:17.600> it's<00:03:17.780> actually<00:03:17.900> pretty<00:03:18.230> good<00:03:18.440> I'm<00:03:18.620> still

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
bad it's actually pretty good I'm still

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.650 
bad it's actually pretty good I'm still
very<00:03:19.820> impressed<00:03:20.239> with<00:03:20.390> these<00:03:20.510> figures<00:03:22.660> so

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
very impressed with these figures so

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.930 
very impressed with these figures so
they<00:03:23.780> can<00:03:23.959> do<00:03:24.140> some<00:03:24.920> pretty<00:03:25.070> good<00:03:25.280> some<00:03:25.790> pretty

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
they can do some pretty good some pretty

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.080 
they can do some pretty good some pretty
cool<00:03:26.180> poses<00:03:26.630> which<00:03:26.959> will<00:03:27.320> be<00:03:27.410> included<00:03:28.090> after

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
cool poses which will be included after

but yeah the paint job on this figure I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.630 
but yeah the paint job on this figure I
like<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:35.330> keeping<00:03:35.810> with<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.140> whole<00:03:36.640> like

combat Evolved so yeah it's a it's a
pretty<00:03:50.840> cool<00:03:51.050> figure<00:03:51.290> overall<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.459> doesn't

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
pretty cool figure overall it doesn't

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.350 
pretty cool figure overall it doesn't
have<00:03:53.300> a<00:03:53.980> pole<00:03:54.980> for<00:03:55.459> putting<00:03:55.730> weapons<00:03:56.060> like<00:03:56.269> if

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
leg it does have one on the back though

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.870 
leg it does have one on the back though
right

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
right

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.770 
right
oops<00:04:02.420> right<00:04:02.780> here<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.110> back<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:04.780> is

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
oops right here in the back so that is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.660 
oops right here in the back so that is
it<00:04:06.260> is<00:04:06.410> good<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:06.709> they<00:04:06.800> did<00:04:06.860> put<00:04:07.130> one<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:07.580> like

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
it is good that they did put one so like

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.699 
it is good that they did put one so like
if<00:04:07.820> you're<00:04:07.970> doing<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.360> diorama<00:04:08.959> or<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.620> know

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
if you're doing a diorama or you know

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.500 
if you're doing a diorama or you know
like<00:04:09.889> for<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.160> collection<00:04:10.489> collector<00:04:11.299> if<00:04:11.389> you

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
like for a collection collector if you

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.000 
like for a collection collector if you
haven't

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
haven't

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.500 
haven't
that<00:04:12.159> you<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.489> have<00:04:12.819> him<00:04:12.939> holding<00:04:13.209> different

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
that you can have him holding different

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.990 
that you can have him holding different
weapons<00:04:13.780> on<00:04:13.959> his<00:04:14.140> back<00:04:14.319> instead<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:15.000> nothing

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
weapons on his back instead of nothing

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.770 
weapons on his back instead of nothing
so<00:04:17.430> overall<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.549> would<00:04:18.729> give<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:19.150> figure<00:04:19.510> a

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
so overall I would give this figure a

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.740 
so overall I would give this figure a
four<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.560> half<00:04:20.590> out<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:20.949> five<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:22.090> if<00:04:22.600> it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
four and a half out of five it if it

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.810 
four and a half out of five it if it
just<00:04:22.930> had<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> little<00:04:23.620> bit<00:04:24.040> more<00:04:24.100> articulation

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
just had a little bit more articulation

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.480 
just had a little bit more articulation
and<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.570> hands<00:04:25.810> could<00:04:26.110> actually<00:04:26.340> hold<00:04:27.340> a

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
and the hands could actually hold a

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.490 
and the hands could actually hold a
couple<00:04:27.760> different<00:04:28.090> guns<00:04:28.270> they<00:04:29.199> made<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
couple different guns they made the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.529 
couple different guns they made the
improvement<00:04:29.919> with<00:04:30.010> series<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:31.060> elites<00:04:31.360> but

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
improvement with series for elites but

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.090 
improvement with series for elites but
with<00:04:31.630> series<00:04:31.930> three<00:04:32.229> they<00:04:32.530> had<00:04:32.740> their<00:04:32.889> hands

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
with series three they had their hands

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.640 
with series three they had their hands
and<00:04:33.310> they<00:04:33.400> they<00:04:33.789> couldn't<00:04:34.090> open<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.389> fingers

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
and they they couldn't open the fingers

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.110 
and they they couldn't open the fingers
series<00:04:35.650> for<00:04:35.830> elites<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.280> I'm<00:04:36.370> sure<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.090> rest

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
series for elites and I'm sure the rest

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.340 
series for elites and I'm sure the rest
of<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.539> elites<00:04:37.720> coming<00:04:37.990> out<00:04:38.139> have<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:39.280> hinge

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
of the elites coming out have a hinge

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.650 
of the elites coming out have a hinge
rake<00:04:41.350> here<00:04:41.830> made<00:04:42.580> around<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:42.850> thumb<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.510> that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
rake here made around the thumb so that

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.000 
rake here made around the thumb so that
these<00:04:43.780> fingers<00:04:44.289> are<00:04:44.440> actually<00:04:44.530> right<00:04:44.889> here

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
these fingers are actually right here

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.890 
these fingers are actually right here
with<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.190> fingers<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.150> fingers<00:04:46.449> can<00:04:46.600> open

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
with the fingers so the fingers can open

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.740 
with the fingers so the fingers can open
up<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.440> close<00:04:48.090> instead<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:49.360> being<00:04:49.510> a

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
up and close instead of just being a

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.770 
up and close instead of just being a
piece<00:04:50.080> of<00:04:50.110> plastic<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:51.300> he's<00:04:52.300> still<00:04:52.479> part<00:04:52.660> of

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
piece of plastic so he's still part of

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.560 
piece of plastic so he's still part of
the<00:04:52.900> older<00:04:53.770> waves<00:04:54.070> that<00:04:54.820> didn't<00:04:55.180> have<00:04:55.360> that

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
the older waves that didn't have that

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.469 
the older waves that didn't have that
ability<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:56.169> that's<00:04:56.350> if<00:04:57.190> he<00:04:57.400> had<00:04:57.639> that<00:04:57.850> he'd<00:04:58.360> be

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
ability so that's if he had that he'd be

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.730 
ability so that's if he had that he'd be
able<00:04:58.539> to<00:04:58.690> hold<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.050> plasma<00:04:59.350> right<00:04:59.470> from<00:04:59.620> the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
able to hold the plasma right from the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.640 
able to hold the plasma right from the
plasma<00:05:00.010> sword<00:05:00.400> very<00:05:00.880> easily<00:05:01.180> and<00:05:01.650> probably

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
plasma sword very easily and probably

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.219 
plasma sword very easily and probably
other<00:05:02.800> weapons<00:05:03.330> just<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:04.449> know<00:05:04.570> really<00:05:04.960> quick

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
other weapons just you know really quick

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.520 
other weapons just you know really quick
which<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:05.979> good<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:08.080> yeah<00:05:08.199> that's<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.500> only

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
which is good so yeah that's the only

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.980 
which is good so yeah that's the only
thing<00:05:08.979> that's<00:05:09.460> kind<00:05:09.729> of<00:05:09.789> a<00:05:09.880> downside<00:05:10.060> four<00:05:10.900> and

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
thing that's kind of a downside four and

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.300 
thing that's kind of a downside four and
a<00:05:11.020> half<00:05:11.080> out<00:05:11.320> of<00:05:11.350> five<00:05:11.470> though<00:05:11.770> it's<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.280> pretty

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
a half out of five though it's a pretty

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.940 
a half out of five though it's a pretty
good<00:05:12.610> figure

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.010 

you
