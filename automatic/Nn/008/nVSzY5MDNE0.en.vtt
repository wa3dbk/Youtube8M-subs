00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
kill people so this game here what am I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.900 
kill people so this game here what am I
using<00:00:30.720> um<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:32.669> f-16<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.170> red<00:00:34.380> dot<00:00:34.559> sight

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
using um the f-16 with the red dot sight

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.490 
using um the f-16 with the red dot sight
um<00:00:35.910> there's<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.480> much<00:00:36.960> else<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.320> could

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
um there's not really much else I could

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040 
um there's not really much else I could
use<00:00:37.739> besides<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.340> red<00:00:38.489> dot<00:00:38.640> sight<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.120> mean<00:00:39.930> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
use besides a red dot sight I mean I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
use besides a red dot sight I mean I
guess<00:00:40.200> fine<00:00:40.440> throw<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> grenade<00:00:40.890> launcher<00:00:41.370> but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
guess fine throw a grenade launcher but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.010 
guess fine throw a grenade launcher but
i<00:00:41.730> don't<00:00:42.059> i<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.390> more<00:00:42.570> accurate<00:00:42.750> um<00:00:45.020> I'd

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
i don't i like be more accurate um I'd

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
i don't i like be more accurate um I'd
like<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.620> map<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.129> seems<00:00:47.399> pretty<00:00:47.700> linear

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
like this map that seems pretty linear

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.439 
like this map that seems pretty linear
that's<00:00:48.600> cuz<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> very<00:00:49.469> linear<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.700> like

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that's cuz it is very linear but I like

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.790 
that's cuz it is very linear but I like
it<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.660> um<00:00:53.180> definitely<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.600> good<00:00:55.289> strategy

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it here um definitely a good strategy

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.580 
it here um definitely a good strategy
for<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.309> map<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:57.600> course<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.989> all<00:00:58.109> probably

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
for this map of course you all probably

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.840 
for this map of course you all probably
know<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.609> just<00:01:00.109> control<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> middle

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
know this is to just control the middle

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.810 
know this is to just control the middle
because<00:01:02.850> that's<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> high<00:01:03.390> ground<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.820> but

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
because that's the high ground and but

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.270 
because that's the high ground and but
all<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> baby<00:01:06.240> Buffalo<00:01:06.750> come<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:08.130> the

all the baby Buffalo come to you on the
first<00:01:08.460> part<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.760> match<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.479> see

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

do want you at this time just cuz this

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.570 
do want you at this time just cuz this
is<00:03:44.330> very<00:03:44.630> easily<00:03:45.350> I'm<00:03:45.920> going<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.190> be<00:03:46.280> inside

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
is very easily I'm going to be inside

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.060 
is very easily I'm going to be inside
map<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.300> they<00:03:47.510> just<00:03:47.540> like<00:03:47.900> hop<00:03:48.110> hop<00:03:48.769> inside

pretty quickly but it kills people
pretty<00:03:51.620> quick<00:03:51.830> i<00:03:51.950> think<00:03:52.130> kill<00:03:52.310> streaks<00:03:52.519> are<00:03:52.640> a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670
