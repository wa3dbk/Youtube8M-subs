malaria programs in Tanzania but one of
the<00:00:08.069> biggest<00:00:08.280> challenge<00:00:08.760> has<00:00:08.940> always<00:00:09.150> been

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the biggest challenge has always been

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.509 
the biggest challenge has always been
the<00:00:09.570> last<00:00:09.780> mile<00:00:10.110> how<00:00:10.530> do<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.800> get<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> drugs

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the last mile how do you get the drugs

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.100 
the last mile how do you get the drugs
and<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> commodities<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> remote

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
and the commodities to the remote

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.200 
and the commodities to the remote
villages<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.769> Tanzania<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.849> requires

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
villages in Tanzania and that requires

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.240 
villages in Tanzania and that requires
more<00:00:15.450> than<00:00:15.630> money<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.320> requires<00:00:16.800> particular

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
more than money that requires particular

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.300 
more than money that requires particular
expertise<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.380> myself<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.830> worked<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
expertise I myself have worked as a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.450 
expertise I myself have worked as a
doctor<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:22.109> remote<00:00:22.380> areas<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.920> Tanzania

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
doctor in the remote areas of Tanzania

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.550 
doctor in the remote areas of Tanzania
so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.699> could<00:00:24.390> see<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.660> there<00:00:25.080> are<00:00:25.140> coca-cola

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
so I could see that there are coca-cola

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
so I could see that there are coca-cola
bottles<00:00:26.099> everywhere<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.119> always

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
bottles everywhere and it was always

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.679 
bottles everywhere and it was always
intriguing<00:00:27.750> why<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.010> Coca<00:00:29.490> Cola<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.359> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
intriguing why and Coca Cola do that and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:43.479 
intriguing why and Coca Cola do that and
we<00:00:31.019> cannot<00:00:31.320> get<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> drugs<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.250> places

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.010 

initially<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.760> told<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> Coca

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
initially when I was told about the Coca

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.490 
initially when I was told about the Coca
Cola<00:00:46.230> works<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.770> Dentistry<00:00:47.340> obviously<00:00:48.500> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
Cola works in the Dentistry obviously to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
Cola works in the Dentistry obviously to
be<00:00:49.620> honest<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.730> puzzled<00:00:50.910> because

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
be honest you get a bit puzzled because

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.299 
be honest you get a bit puzzled because
we<00:00:51.840> are<00:00:51.930> dealing<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.230> medicines<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.219> are

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
we are dealing with medicines they are

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.910 
we are dealing with medicines they are
dealing<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.610> beverages<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.710> as

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
dealing with beverages but I think as

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
dealing with beverages but I think as
more<00:00:56.250> things<00:00:56.760> more<00:00:57.600> discussion<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> place

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
more things more discussion to the place

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.160 
more things more discussion to the place
you<00:00:58.739> started<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.370> some<00:00:59.719> syllogism<00:01:00.719> how<00:01:01.109> we

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you started to see some syllogism how we

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.399 
you started to see some syllogism how we
can<00:01:01.620> work<00:01:01.949> together<00:01:02.420> as<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> corporate<00:01:04.170> citizen

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
can work together as a corporate citizen

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
can work together as a corporate citizen
it<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.519> our<00:01:05.700> interest<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:07.400> ensure<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> the

it is in our interest to ensure that the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.340 
it is in our interest to ensure that the
communities<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.990> serve

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
communities that we serve

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.070 
communities that we serve
first<00:01:10.950> part<00:01:11.340> alongside<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.030> business<00:01:12.450> there

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
first part alongside the business there

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920 
first part alongside the business there
is<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.229> need<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.890> miss<00:01:14.520> Dina<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.479> 500

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
is a need for miss Dina to go from 500

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
is a need for miss Dina to go from 500
distribution<00:01:16.770> points<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.909> 5000<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
distribution points to 5000 so the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
distribution points to 5000 so the
reason<00:01:20.310> there<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> need<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.390> at

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
reason there is a need to look at

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.910 
reason there is a need to look at
logistically<00:01:22.470> how<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.159> be

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
logistically how can this be

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.160 
logistically how can this be
the<00:01:24.009> additional<00:01:24.729> requirement

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.230 

why<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.800> it<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.159> sometimes<00:01:34.370> are<00:01:34.760> available

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
why is it that sometimes are available

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.580 
why is it that sometimes are available
we<00:01:35.330> have<00:01:35.479> stock<00:01:35.690> available<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.229> essential

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
we have stock available of essential

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.870 
we have stock available of essential
medicines<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.130> sometimes<00:01:37.460> we're<00:01:37.640> stocked

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
medicines and sometimes we're stocked

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.940 
medicines and sometimes we're stocked
out<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.810> real<00:01:38.960> root<00:01:39.229> cause<00:01:39.260> for<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.830> was

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
out and the real root cause for that was

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.530 
out and the real root cause for that was
around<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.280> sword<00:01:40.460> proactive<00:01:40.970> planning<00:01:41.420> and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
around the sword proactive planning and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.219 
around the sword proactive planning and
management

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229

I<00:01:42.260> think<00:01:43.070> these<00:01:43.220> skills<00:01:43.550> are<00:01:43.850> infused<00:01:44.479> even<00:01:44.810> in

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
I think these skills are infused even in

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.950 
I think these skills are infused even in
the<00:01:45.050> public<00:01:45.409> sector<00:01:45.800> they<00:01:46.460> will<00:01:46.640> enable<00:01:47.630> them

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
the public sector they will enable them

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.170 
the public sector they will enable them
