00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 according to the eu data last year iran 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.480
 lost about 40 billion dollars 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.849
 because of the ban on the purchase of its oil 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.860
 but there is good news conditions 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.780
 harsh economic sanctions export 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.030
 non-oil goods 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.630
 increased by 30 percent compared to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.760
 2011 is what seems like a problem at first 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.439
 It could eventually turn into a blessing we have 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.390
 long been trying to make sure that you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.939
 the government reduced the share of oil in total 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.680
 export at least up to 50 percent on 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.470
 oil and accounted for about 80 percent 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.840
 it's too much it made our 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 the economy is vulnerable some believe that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.200
 now we have a unique 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 opportunity to get rid of this pernicious 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.399
 dependencies and Iran has 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.040
 alternative sources of income and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.530
 famous carpets and dates to minerals 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 and gems but one industry and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.910
 this production is especially flourishing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.860
 Pistachios last couple of years famous 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 walnut had a hard time 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.590
 frosts and droughts destroyed a considerable part 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.329
 harvest 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.399
 but this year despite tough 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.890
 economic sanctions are going like 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.439
 never smooth 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.170
 our currency is real in October 2012 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.000
 fell almost 40 percent but I 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 I sell pistachios in Iran and for its 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 beyond 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.810
 and from the price increase I only won my 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.000
 profits rose iran export 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.710
 pistachios in more than a hundred countries of the world 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.049
 even if this channel is closed 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 farmers sure they will stay afloat 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.310
 thousands of industry workers are also in 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.570
 winning such an industry success helps them 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.869
 survive the highest inflation 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.790
 recent decades, the volume of production 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.420
 and the cost of pistachios affect our 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.909
 earnings 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.790
 Every year my salary is indexed on 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.030
 10-20 percent and this year I will get 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.950
 also a salary increment but it seems 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.729
 manufacturers are better protected than 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.649
 exporters 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.840
 international sanctions not directed 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.549
 direct against the food industry but these 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.320
 measures has an impact on banking 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.390
 system for what financial transactions 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.390
 turn into a very difficult task 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.950
 the main problem is that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.229
 they do not fine banks in the usa or europe 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.579
 let's say in china and south america for 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.950
 cooperation with iran 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.140
 which is basically illegal in terms of 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.030
 international law or gal 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.520
 Iranian manufacturers say that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.830
 good pi stashko smiles at her 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.990
 the shell is half ajar now 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.780
 they add that a good nut is something 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.140
 what makes a country profit and iso file 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.150
 black 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.430
 if oil is black gold pistachio 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.650
 gold is green at least in iran 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.480
 locals say these are small nuts 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.020
 able to endow a person especially 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.330
 a man 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.040
 considerable strength now they help 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.500
 country and other important way 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.790
 financially the largest export commodity 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.530
 post-oil countries 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.720
 became a significant source of profit 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.510
 today when sanctions are heavier than 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.209
 ever on small nuts big
