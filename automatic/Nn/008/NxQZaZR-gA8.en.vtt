00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 very good everyone I've decided to do 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.049
 something else in this channel logically 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.389
 there will always be someone who says that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.469
 famous four-word speech 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 you're copying something that I do not care 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.130
 I say it like that, I take it without hesitation 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 many years ago I will not shut up now 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.789
 I am a man who has a lot to say 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.079
 and little to be silent 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.910
 What I have decided is to make reflections 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.550
 reflect with a game of something from 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 bottom what I can think of is the least 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.300
 important of what is playing that what 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.300
 makes all christ if we think 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.460
 no then it is worth the copy 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 I give as an example wish michu since 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.309
 today I will start with a topic that goes very 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.870
 related to me 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.120
 continue on twitter you will know that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.009
 those parts I'm somewhat unbalanced 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.839
 something very common I tend to 

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:57.239
 insert some meat element not in 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.150
 my tweets be a sausage a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.850
 black pudding until now many of you 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.680
 you think I 'm an asshole or I have some 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.030
 problem 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.270
 good is a psychiatric problem and if 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.970
 you are not wrong but I know 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.950
 to cope in a good way although I 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.960
 imbalance is more for fun than 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.500
 by its very nature there are others that already 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.650
 they have it come audes series the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.590
 another the other night happened the funny thing that 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.660
 it's not the first time I see a follower 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 subscriber or like noses what you want 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.620
 call the wish michu decided to make a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.560
 gilipollez 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.690
 200 retweets were made to his comment 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.040
 the name of wish michu was written in 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:47.280
 his saint nard we're going to call it spikenard 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.160
 nardo nar of beige teverga morcillo ya 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.560
 is already started and a picture was taken 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.540
 so that it could be put on 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.740
 michu on your twitter 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.250
 regrettable 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.290
 thing that logically like delay that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.780
 accompanies these types of people not 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.239
 he thought of the consequences naming a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.310
 person with more than 200,000 followers 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.959
 imply that what do you have to 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.910
 fulfill his promise and is that friends 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.120
 first of all in social networks 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.250
 they have a danger you have to measure very 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.410
 much what you do is a place to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.140
 entertain not to sink you in the 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.470
 bitch misery thing that many get 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.569
 for not thinking before writing 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.090
 logically now that tuberose is in the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.130
 gallery of wish michu images 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.019
 twitter friends 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.450
 I think it's a horny guy wanting to 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.049
 party wanting to mess around there's no 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.850
 party that is what it is about 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.250
 He makes videos that even though he tells me that 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.319
 that do not have much value or work 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.840
 like others with less followers 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.349
 macho everything has its value for very 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.049
 small that it was I did not need 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.019
 claim him a follow in his day neither he nor 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.109
 nobody follows or stops following 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.670
 because it gives the santa wins in this case 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.650
 michu guys will be regretting 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.120
 follow an uncle like me not the question 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.120
 is that it does not matter 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.810
 after that anecdotic penis with ink that 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.730
 wish michu got 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.310
 seriously consider to what extent 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.820
 some people move because of the morbid 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.160
 or by mere nonsense not in the networks 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.440
 social go feel like watching a cock 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.120
 photographed gentlemen you have thousands of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.950
 porn websites if it's your 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.140
 purpose the purpose of Mr. wish 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.750
 michu was to leave on the floor at 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.510
 silly ass in question and did not do what 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.820
 got is more closed the account but 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.230
 well I said fuck psychological studies 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.810
 you already know some that I like 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.470
 this from psychological studies like this 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.380
 Well I said that because I'm going to do 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.960
 same we will not see what happens we will 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.850
 see what happens let's see what happens you 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.700
 I wrote to wish mich a tweet in which 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.830
 I put it clearly if I get to 50 retweets 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.820
 I write the name of wish michu in my 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.200
 sausage 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.930
 logically isma because he did retweet and not 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.150
 it took not even five minutes to have 50 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.190
 retweets required 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.900
 There are people who thought they would do 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.030
 same as the other kid there are times 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.700
 You have to read fuck how I'm going to put 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.800
 the name in binary I put sausage I put 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.290
 sausage you have to dig a little into the 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.640
 tuit does not have much difficulty either 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.870
 but I showed that people move by 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.380
 morbid and for por por por placer placer 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.170
 channel or something and think basically says 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.400
 the photo to a sausage with modest 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.750
 had the fridge until they gave the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.640
 background that you never find different 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.430
 fuck but if I have a sausage here and 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.470

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.780

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.910
 well said wish michu a sample that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.850
 fanaticism and idolizing someone is 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.560
 an absolute error each one has its 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.140
 personality you have to be yourself 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.270

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.100

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.620
