00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.400 

hello<00:00:10.490> in<00:00:10.730> this<00:00:11.060> short<00:00:11.300> video<00:00:11.480> I'm<00:00:12.170> going<00:00:12.350> to

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
hello in this short video I'm going to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.350 
hello in this short video I'm going to
show<00:00:12.620> you<00:00:12.680> how<00:00:12.920> you<00:00:12.980> can<00:00:13.220> use<00:00:13.460> modo<00:00:13.730> to

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
show you how you can use modo to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.520 
show you how you can use modo to
generate<00:00:14.720> a<00:00:14.780> dirt<00:00:15.050> mask

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.560 

all<00:00:18.400> of<00:00:18.580> our<00:00:18.730> work<00:00:18.850> is<00:00:18.970> going<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.150> be<00:00:19.240> done<00:00:19.420> in

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
all of our work is going to be done in

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.960 
all of our work is going to be done in
the<00:00:19.660> render<00:00:19.960> layout<00:00:20.290> and<00:00:21.160> here<00:00:21.400> I<00:00:21.430> have<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:21.700> base

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
the render layout and here I have a base

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.450 
the render layout and here I have a base
material<00:00:22.150> that's<00:00:22.720> white<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:24.070> will<00:00:24.220> add

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
material that's white we will add

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.860 
material that's white we will add
inclusion<00:00:25.420> toucher<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:28.300> skill<00:00:28.600> of<00:00:28.630> this

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:28.870 
inclusion toucher the skill of this

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.630 
inclusion toucher the skill of this
asset<00:00:29.290> is<00:00:29.440> quite<00:00:29.680> large<00:00:29.890> so<00:00:30.040> we're<00:00:30.400> going<00:00:30.520> to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
asset is quite large so we're going to

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.339 
asset is quite large so we're going to
have<00:00:30.670> to<00:00:30.850> adjust<00:00:31.120> the<00:00:31.330> occlusion<00:00:31.840> distance

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
have to adjust the occlusion distance

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.410 
have to adjust the occlusion distance
accommodate<00:00:33.070> for<00:00:33.280> that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 

we<00:00:40.289> will<00:00:40.440> change<00:00:40.739> from<00:00:41.070> uniform<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.969> down

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
we will change from uniform to down

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.670 
we will change from uniform to down
slope<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.899> further<00:00:43.410> refine

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.090 

we<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.400> change<00:00:49.730> variants<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.930> variants<00:00:51.740> scale

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
we to change variants and variants scale

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:03.890 
we to change variants and variants scale
to<00:00:52.790> just<00:00:53.180> an<00:00:53.510> add<00:00:54.080> variation<00:00:55.010> overall

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.280 

once<00:01:04.620> we<00:01:04.770> have<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:05.250> reasonable<00:01:06.150> result<00:01:06.540> I'm

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
once we have a reasonable result I'm

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.180 
once we have a reasonable result I'm
going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> add<00:01:07.800> a<00:01:07.830> noise<00:01:08.160> texture<00:01:09.770> like<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.980> do

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
going to add a noise texture like to do

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.670 
going to add a noise texture like to do
this<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> mask<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:14.010> remove<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.490> areas<00:01:15.680> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this as a mask to remove some areas and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.050 
this as a mask to remove some areas and
add<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.460> layer<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.970> variation

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.210 

at<00:01:23.149> first<00:01:23.840> glance<00:01:23.990> you're<00:01:24.560> going<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.770> see<00:01:24.979> that

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
at first glance you're going to see that

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.770 
at first glance you're going to see that
we<00:01:25.340> need<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.549> adjust<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.180> scale<00:01:26.479> on<00:01:26.540> the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
we need to adjust the scale on the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.630 
we need to adjust the scale on the
texture<00:01:27.140> locator<00:01:29.470> we<00:01:30.470> will<00:01:30.680> also<00:01:30.950> need<00:01:31.189> to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
texture locator we will also need to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.230 
texture locator we will also need to
adjust<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.390> noise<00:01:32.630> parameters

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.770 

you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 

we<00:01:46.320> now<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> texture<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.760> can<00:01:47.909> use<00:01:48.090> as

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
we now have a texture that we can use as

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.770 
we now have a texture that we can use as
a<00:01:48.299> mask<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.610> quite<00:01:50.820> easy<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.420> we

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
a mask and this is quite easy to do we

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
a mask and this is quite easy to do we
will<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.229> drag<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.950> noise<00:01:53.220> texture<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.180> top

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
will just drag the noise texture on top

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.950 
will just drag the noise texture on top
of<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.810> occlusion<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:57.030> remove

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
of the occlusion and that will remove

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.010 
of the occlusion and that will remove
dirt<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:58.710> reveal<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.640> white<00:02:00.030> base<00:02:00.360> material

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
dirt and reveal the white base material

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.730 
dirt and reveal the white base material
underneath

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.429 

at<00:02:04.400> this<00:02:04.670> point<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.210> have<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.420> dirt<00:02:05.750> mass<00:02:06.020> that

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
at this point we have a dirt mass that

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.499 
at this point we have a dirt mass that
we<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:06.740> bake<00:02:06.950> out<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.520> use<00:02:07.790> in<00:02:07.970> our<00:02:08.090> preferred

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
we can bake out and use in our preferred

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.309 
we can bake out and use in our preferred
paint<00:02:08.810> package

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.379
