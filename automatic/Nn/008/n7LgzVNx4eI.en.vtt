enemies but change the terrain while

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.070 
enemies but change the terrain while
these<00:02:42.310> work<00:02:42.490> okay<00:02:42.880> actually<00:02:43.570> getting<00:02:43.870> them<00:02:43.990> to

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
these work okay actually getting them to

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.110 
these work okay actually getting them to
go<00:02:44.230> where<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.500> want<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> pain<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.970> also

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
go where you want is a pain you also

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.030 
go where you want is a pain you also
don't<00:02:46.420> get<00:02:46.570> very<00:02:46.720> many<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.320> having<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.680> waste<00:02:47.890> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
don't get very many so having to waste a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.560 
don't get very many so having to waste a
few<00:02:48.070> grenades<00:02:48.520> before<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.940> hit<00:02:49.090> your<00:02:49.209> target

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
few grenades before you hit your target

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.480 
few grenades before you hit your target
is<00:02:49.660> pretty<00:02:49.870> annoying<00:02:50.280> regardless<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.459> don't

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
is pretty annoying regardless you don't

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.190 
is pretty annoying regardless you don't
have<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.880> use<00:02:52.000> them<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.450> often<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.990> you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
have to use them all that often and you

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.449 
have to use them all that often and you
will<00:02:53.350> start<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.650> get<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.920> hang<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.250> over

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
will start to get the hang of it over

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.340 
will start to get the hang of it over
time<00:02:54.670> but<00:02:55.060> they<00:02:55.240> do<00:02:55.300> seem<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.810> act<00:02:55.930> like<00:02:56.110> bricks
