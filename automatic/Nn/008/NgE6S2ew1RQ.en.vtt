Series line of tiles but first I think

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.310 
Series line of tiles but first I think
it's<00:00:07.970> important<00:00:08.450> to<00:00:08.510> take<00:00:08.660> a<00:00:08.720> look<00:00:08.960> at<00:00:09.140> the

no<00:00:18.679> doubt<00:00:18.980> that<00:00:19.009> mineral<00:00:19.550> fiber<00:00:19.789> has<00:00:20.300> some

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
no doubt that mineral fiber has some

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.779 
no doubt that mineral fiber has some
advantages<00:00:21.169> and<00:00:21.410> would<00:00:21.740> probably<00:00:22.099> be<00:00:22.609> the

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
advantages and would probably be the

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.329 
advantages and would probably be the
best<00:00:23.029> choice<00:00:23.119> for<00:00:23.329> almost<00:00:23.869> any<00:00:24.140> project<00:00:24.740> if<00:00:25.159> it

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
best choice for almost any project if it

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.819 
best choice for almost any project if it
weren't<00:00:25.519> for<00:00:25.669> one<00:00:25.880> major<00:00:26.300> disadvantage<00:00:26.829> they

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
weren't for one major disadvantage they

weren't for one major disadvantage they

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
the water stains on a ceiling that

conditioning<00:00:35.780> unit<00:00:35.840> yep<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.190> unattractive

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
conditioning unit yep it's unattractive

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.939 
conditioning unit yep it's unattractive
but<00:00:38.480> that's<00:00:38.629> just<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.019> beginning<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.769> the

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
but that's just the beginning of the

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.220 
but that's just the beginning of the
problem<00:00:40.399> what<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:41.180> can<00:00:41.449> see<00:00:41.690> in<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:41.870> room<00:00:42.050> is

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
problem what you can see in the room is

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.860 
problem what you can see in the room is
the<00:00:42.350> air<00:00:42.469> quality<00:00:42.800> over<00:00:43.760> time<00:00:43.789> mineral<00:00:44.660> fiber

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
the air quality over time mineral fiber

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.840 
the air quality over time mineral fiber
tiles<00:00:45.410> can<00:00:45.559> become<00:00:45.829> a<00:00:45.859> breeding<00:00:46.280> ground<00:00:46.460> for

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
tiles can become a breeding ground for

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.240 
tiles can become a breeding ground for
mold<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.510> mildew<00:00:47.719> not<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.739> kind<00:00:48.949> of<00:00:49.010> stuff

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
mold and mildew not the kind of stuff

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.740 
mold and mildew not the kind of stuff
you<00:00:49.309> want<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.730> breathe<00:00:49.910> into<00:00:50.059> your<00:00:50.149> lungs<00:00:50.420> and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
you want to breathe into your lungs and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.380 
you want to breathe into your lungs and
eventually<00:00:51.589> this<00:00:52.070> mineral<00:00:52.460> fiber<00:00:52.670> tile<00:00:53.089> is

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
eventually this mineral fiber tile is

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.119 
eventually this mineral fiber tile is
going<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.839> turn<00:00:54.019> into<00:00:54.079> this<00:00:54.530> mineral<00:00:54.949> fiber

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
going to turn into this mineral fiber

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.639 
going to turn into this mineral fiber
tile<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:55.820> need<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.269> be<00:00:56.420> replaced<00:00:56.620> instead<00:00:57.620> of

tile and need to be replaced instead of

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.380 
tile and need to be replaced instead of
dealing<00:00:57.949> with<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.399> headaches<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:58.910> costs

dealing with the headaches and costs
that<00:00:59.539> come<00:00:59.660> with<00:00:59.809> replacing<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.499> mineral<00:01:00.859> fiber

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100
