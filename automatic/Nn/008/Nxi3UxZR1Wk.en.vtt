a hit on headset use and you try to use

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.160 
a hit on headset use and you try to use
the<00:00:58.800> a-10<00:00:59.100> cable<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.210> will<00:01:00.390> work<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.989> your

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the a-10 cable it will work but your

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
the a-10 cable it will work but your
speaker<00:01:01.649> volume<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.160> microphone<00:01:02.640> volume<00:01:02.969> will

be too low to adequately be used for

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
be too low to adequately be used for
business<00:01:05.909> conversations<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> way<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
business conversations so the way this
