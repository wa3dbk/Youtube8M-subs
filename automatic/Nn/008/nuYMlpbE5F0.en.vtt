00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
grown-up car the previous model was

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.270 
grown-up car the previous model was
sporty<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:44.960> fun<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.440> very<00:00:45.560> possible<00:00:46.160> with

sporty and fun and very possible with

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.490 
sporty and fun and very possible with
the<00:00:46.340> turbo<00:00:46.670> this<00:00:47.180> model<00:00:47.630> it's<00:00:48.020> much<00:00:48.290> more

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
the turbo this model it's much more

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.080 
the turbo this model it's much more
mature<00:00:48.739> it<00:00:49.430> has<00:00:49.670> a<00:00:50.059> lot<00:00:50.750> more<00:00:51.489> road<00:00:52.489> manners<00:00:52.910> by

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
mature it has a lot more road manners by

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.910 
mature it has a lot more road manners by
that<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.270> mean<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.870> wheels<00:00:54.110> just<00:00:54.320> feel<00:00:54.650> like

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
that I mean the wheels just feel like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.220 
that I mean the wheels just feel like
they're<00:00:55.520> more<00:00:55.760> connected<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.390> road<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
they're more connected to the road the

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.869 
they're more connected to the road the
steering<00:00:57.650> is<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:57.860> little<00:00:58.190> bit<00:00:58.280> more<00:00:58.400> precise

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
steering is a little bit more precise

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.090 
steering is a little bit more precise
I'd<00:00:59.270> say<00:00:59.480> it's<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.809> little<00:00:59.900> bit<00:01:00.050> heavier<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.680> it

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
I'd say it's a little bit heavier and it

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.460 
I'd say it's a little bit heavier and it
just<00:01:01.280> feels<00:01:01.460> like<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.879> much<00:01:02.239> bigger<00:01:02.510> grown-up

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
just feels like a much bigger grown-up

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.590 
just feels like a much bigger grown-up
car<00:01:03.739> most<00:01:04.489> things<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:04.940> choose<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.300> down<00:01:05.479> from

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
car most things to choose it down from

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.690 
car most things to choose it down from
the<00:01:05.750> six<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> four<00:01:06.860> turbo<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.460> want<00:01:07.640> the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
the six to a four turbo you want the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.240 
the six to a four turbo you want the
exact<00:01:08.000> opposite<00:01:08.450> y-yeah<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:09.410> moved<00:01:09.649> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
exact opposite y-yeah we moved the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.430 
exact opposite y-yeah we moved the
current<00:01:10.640> RDX<00:01:11.060> as<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.270> four<00:01:11.690> cylinder<00:01:12.020> turbo

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
current RDX as a four cylinder turbo

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.710 
current RDX as a four cylinder turbo
engine<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.820> engine<00:01:14.149> was<00:01:14.509> designed

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
engine that engine was designed

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.790 
engine that engine was designed
specifically<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:16.220> boost<00:01:16.610> up<00:01:16.790> performance

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
specifically to to boost up performance

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.770 
specifically to to boost up performance
but<00:01:18.800> it<00:01:19.040> came<00:01:19.310> at<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.820> price<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.360> fuel<00:01:20.479> economy

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
but it came at a price of fuel economy

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.889 
but it came at a price of fuel economy
so<00:01:21.170> we<00:01:21.710> moved<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.310> v6<00:01:22.790> this<00:01:23.270> year<00:01:23.600> for<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
so we moved to the v6 this year for the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.830 
so we moved to the v6 this year for the
13<00:01:24.229> model<00:01:24.680> really<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.820> pick<00:01:26.479> up<00:01:26.630> some

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
13 model really to pick up some

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.320 
13 model really to pick up some
horsepower<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:27.950> also<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.759> pick<00:01:28.970> up<00:01:29.119> fuel

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
horsepower and also to pick up fuel

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.029 
horsepower and also to pick up fuel
economy<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:29.869> fuel<00:01:30.110> economy<00:01:30.289> is<00:01:30.619> up<00:01:30.770> several

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
economy so fuel economy is up several

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.740 
economy so fuel economy is up several
miles<00:01:31.369> per<00:01:31.610> gallon<00:01:32.000> now<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.300> is<00:01:32.420> built<00:01:32.660> in

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
miles per gallon now this is built in

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
I'm stunned because I'm looking at the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.350 
I'm stunned because I'm looking at the
MDX<00:01:43.130> over<00:01:43.399> your<00:01:43.550> right<00:01:43.670> shoulder<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.090> the

MDX over your right shoulder and the
front<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.020> very<00:01:45.110> similar<00:01:45.470> it's<00:01:45.740> much<00:01:46.160> more<00:01:46.750> MDX

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
front is very similar it's much more MDX

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.410 
front is very similar it's much more MDX
like<00:01:47.929> now<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.259> some<00:01:48.410> ways<00:01:48.590> yeah<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.420> certainly

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
like now in some ways yeah the certainly

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.180 
like now in some ways yeah the certainly
the<00:01:50.569> design<00:01:50.899> language<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.679> there<00:01:51.920> it's

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
the design language is there it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.370 
the design language is there it's
designed<00:01:52.610> at<00:01:52.789> our<00:01:52.940> Acura<00:01:53.630> advanced<00:01:53.899> styling

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
designed at our Acura advanced styling

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.520 
designed at our Acura advanced styling

California

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.029 
California
so<00:01:58.970> both<00:01:59.509> vehicles<00:01:59.840> have<00:02:00.259> kind<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.619> family

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
so both vehicles have kind of a family

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.680 
so both vehicles have kind of a family
look<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.399> them<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:01.880> certainly<00:02:02.060> that's<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.569> the

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
look to them and certainly that's to the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the intention 2013 RDX feels a lot more

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.499 
the intention 2013 RDX feels a lot more
grown-up<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.610> feels<00:02:07.819> like<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.149> gone<00:02:08.300> to
