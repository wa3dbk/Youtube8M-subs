00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
while it's in the stand and the top one

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.120 
while it's in the stand and the top one
I'm<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:58.020> sure<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.560> correct<00:01:58.829> me<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.100> wrong

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I'm not sure so correct me if I'm wrong

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.020 
I'm not sure so correct me if I'm wrong
but<00:01:59.540> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.899> I'm<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.500> fitness<00:02:01.979> stand<00:02:02.790> isn't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
but I think I'm this fitness stand isn't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.789 
but I think I'm this fitness stand isn't
just<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.450> iPhones<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.350> also<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.740> other

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
just for iPhones it's also for other

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.670 
just for iPhones it's also for other
smartphones<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.560> an

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
smartphones so I think this is for an

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.650 
smartphones so I think this is for an
alternate<00:02:08.129> power<00:02:08.369> source<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.569> can

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
alternate power source so you can

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.479 
alternate power source so you can
connect<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> power<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.979> through<00:02:11.220> there

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
connect it power it through there

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.080 
connect it power it through there
instead

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
instead

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.440 
instead
I'm<00:02:12.269> not<00:02:12.450> sure<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:13.760> basically<00:02:14.760> what<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> think

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I'm not sure that basically what I think

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.820 
I'm not sure that basically what I think
you<00:02:15.510> would<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.870> stand<00:02:16.110> for<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.620> once

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
you would get this stand for and once

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.860 
you would get this stand for and once
the<00:02:16.980> stand<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:17.519> good<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:17.879> is<00:02:18.120> for

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the stand is really good for is for

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.070 
the stand is really good for is for
facetime<00:02:19.410> calls<00:02:19.709> video<00:02:20.580> calling<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.420> keeping

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
facetime calls video calling and keeping

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.900 
facetime calls video calling and keeping
your<00:02:22.140> desk<00:02:22.349> more<00:02:22.560> organized<00:02:23.010> there's<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.730> lot

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
your desk more organized there's a lot

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.309 
your desk more organized there's a lot
of<00:02:23.940> other<00:02:24.150> reasons<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:24.780> those<00:02:24.900> are<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.080> some

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
of other reasons but those are just some

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.990 
of other reasons but those are just some
of<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.440> main<00:02:25.650> ones<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.250> think<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.879> might

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
of the main ones that I think you might

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.699 
of the main ones that I think you might
use<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.840> lot<00:02:28.140> more<00:02:28.200> than<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> other

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
use it for a lot more than the other

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.280 
use it for a lot more than the other
ones<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:30.480> reason<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.019> good<00:02:31.140> for

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
ones so the reason I think is good for

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
ones so the reason I think is good for
videos<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.709> face<00:02:31.920> time<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.430> because<00:02:32.910> as

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
videos in the face time is because as

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.500 
videos in the face time is because as
you<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.840> at<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> very<00:02:34.260> good<00:02:34.530> height

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
you can see it's at a very good height

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.789 
you can see it's at a very good height
it's<00:02:36.510> nice<00:02:36.720> viewing<00:02:37.110> angle<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.500> can't<00:02:37.650> really

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
it's nice viewing angle you can't really

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.470 
it's nice viewing angle you can't really
tell<00:02:38.010> as<00:02:38.129> much<00:02:38.280> from<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.459> camera<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.390> when

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
tell as much from the camera but when

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.360 
tell as much from the camera but when
you<00:02:39.540> get<00:02:39.690> this<00:02:39.840> product<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.799> will<00:02:40.920> step<00:02:41.340> you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
you get this product you will step you

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.759 
you get this product you will step you
can<00:02:41.519> immediately<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.629> has<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.260> very

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
can immediately see that it has a very

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.699 
can immediately see that it has a very
good<00:02:43.860> angle<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.459> pretty<00:02:45.090> much<00:02:45.150> any<00:02:45.420> sized<00:02:45.810> any

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
good angle for pretty much any sized any

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.240 
good angle for pretty much any sized any
size<00:02:46.890> person<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:48.530> unless<00:02:49.530> that's<00:02:49.920> one<00:02:50.099> great

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250
