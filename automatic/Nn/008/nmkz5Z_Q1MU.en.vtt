00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.109 
sticking up right simply a whole string
and<00:01:22.979> drawing<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> weapon<00:01:23.520> again<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:23.909> fix

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and drawing the weapon again will fix

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.910 
and drawing the weapon again will fix
this<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.750> feel<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> glitch<00:01:25.740> with

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this but I feel like that glitch with

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
this but I feel like that glitch with
the<00:01:26.090> thumbs<00:01:27.090> sticking<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:27.990> be

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the thumbs sticking up right would be

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.890 
the thumbs sticking up right would be
more<00:01:28.259> fun<00:01:28.439> these<00:01:28.619> things<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:28.979> pretty<00:01:29.130> cool

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
they're not that bad as a melee weapon

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
they're not that bad as a melee weapon
but<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.470> use<00:01:34.740> them<00:01:34.890> because<00:01:35.009> they

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
but I would just use them because they

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.100
