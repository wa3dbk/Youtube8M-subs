00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 I am claudio vettorello organizer 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.879
 of the one hundred percent mountain bike 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.460
 we are inside the circus 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.300
 maximum for one hundred mountain bikes 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.610
 there are 100 cm 100 gl 100 km route is 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.320
 just a kilometer long yes 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.560
 they run for a hundred laps 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.820
 the themes are composed of three athletes who 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.820
 they come from all over Italy 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.430
 yes no 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.070
 ancient money 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.440
 I had been thinking and hoping for years 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.010
 being able to organize an event inside 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.280
 of this archaeological site seems made 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.220
 specifically for this type of 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 demonstration has never been spoken of a hundred 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.170
 laps for 100 km and a great one 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.039
 novelty because in a journey precisely of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.860
 one kilometer but in a long ring 350 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:32.640
 meters to 200 have managed to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.160
 run these these athletes in a manner 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.460
 spectacular was what i was looking for was 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.280
 the bicycle show the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 bicycle needs show of 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.430
 a moment like this 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.980
 of joy all the public succeeds in 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:55.330
 see the path at 360 degrees and then 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.330
 you couldn't do better than that 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.860
 we are here in front of the change area 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.730
 where the competitors 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.830
 being a relay race they give the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.880
 change every lap 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.630
