00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hey guys, it's another edition of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.780
 However, he asked us 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.179
 continue our preparation for vinha 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 network team here to train the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.870
 Inter came back home, has a little corner. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 but meanwhile the technical committee 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.310
 attack to be able to plan strategies 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:28.800
 to make the best game on bm at 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.750
 earned all of kiko to maxwell which his 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 perspective on Brazilians in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:01:57.479
 special mtv compared to the teams 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:02:06.750
 Green point on improving a bit is on a 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:08.399
 game a game and then it 's better this 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.860
 hence it comes from a little energy and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.750
 communication team a little quick 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.720
 when making decisions 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.700
 and a main thing is also to use 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.860
 plus the errors of the Greek team 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.470
 We abused some but left 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.270
 several times then this type of error 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.070
 people can create the nobel on top 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.660
 Then we have to be more 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.120
 aware of these mistakes and play more in 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.190
 most of them on the list is the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.990
 alexandre magno alex you normally 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.370
 divides analyst's role with juarez 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.020
 while he is the coach 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.640
 You did something different from the type of who. 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.830
 or preparation for the final if you 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:57.410
 could do left would change something until the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:57.410
 headlight daycare agent pages 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.910
 first for this year 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.380
 then a team like you think 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.370
 the course team must train to 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.450
 maximize performance good for you 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.820
 best 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.530
 I think you have to cherish what 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.260
 It's good for your team. 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:12.959
 you have to see the routine of them are 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.850
 doing everything else then always better 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.479
 For you, better for the team. 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.609
 second, the team that has the 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.900
 The best first time is with the same 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.669
 seven more have to be in the same 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.220
 they have to think the same way. 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.860
 way to try at the same pace 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.440
 If you did not, you do not have one. 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.000
 good workout now if you look you're in 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.100
 The right path you have to continue 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.530
 evolving in the same way 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.300
 question diana laura tobacco I took 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.800
 photo continues in the final of the first split 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.430
 You are very charismatic. What else? 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.430
 Do you like Brazil? 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:05:25.830
 china is here the question of 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.800
 May / June you need to do and 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.560
 let it do for you in the cup of 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.390
 Brazil 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.620
 We're going to quit our victories a little bit. 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.060
 about your question 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.990
 I decided then the main objective is to 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.390
 towers 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.220
 so a composition of this 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.090
 opponent has a good composition of 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.669
 fight 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.960
 We'd rather ignore fighting in the dragon. 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.510
 that will not be a favorable thing for 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.880
 we join in circus in towers 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.530
 so we opted for towers as 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.990
 main objective we'll be in 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.370
 advantage and this was the main reason is 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.930
 low we hear that the team 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:10.850
 studied the possible gold mines 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:37.870
 final ftf a decisive factor for good 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:44.260
 or upset your leg 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:47.860
 the tool only the board and the chassis or 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:07:00.210
 nokia comes from outside 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:07:00.210
 the boss we will rock you 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:17.710
 the question that elvis hours 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.750
 I think the Sevilla defeat can 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:29.800
 affect the players a bit since the 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:36.600
 user save to human tabulated 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:39.600
 dollar face but still and 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.600
 abandoned
