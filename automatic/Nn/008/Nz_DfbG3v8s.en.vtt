00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
description and i'm just going to use

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.189 
description and i'm just going to use
this<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.370> contour<00:04:33.759> a<00:04:33.819> little<00:04:34.090> bit<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.960> sure

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
this to contour a little bit you sure

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.469 
this to contour a little bit you sure
you<00:04:35.380> blend<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.770> upwards<00:04:36.190> not<00:04:36.370> downwards

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
you blend it upwards not downwards

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.730 
you blend it upwards not downwards
because<00:04:37.479> then<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.840> just<00:04:38.080> affects<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.620> whole

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
because then that just affects the whole

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.550 
because then that just affects the whole
purpose<00:04:39.009> of<00:04:39.220> how<00:04:39.370> contour<00:04:40.139> and<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.259> can<00:04:41.380> take

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
purpose of how contour and you can take

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.170 
purpose of how contour and you can take
a<00:04:41.590> little<00:04:41.860> bit<00:04:42.069> of<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.250> on<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.490> nose<00:04:42.669> not<00:04:42.940> too

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
a little bit of that on the nose not too

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.200 
a little bit of that on the nose not too
much<00:04:43.360> because<00:04:43.630> obviously<00:04:44.310> our<00:04:45.310> nose<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.940> gonna

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
much because obviously our nose is gonna

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.909 
much because obviously our nose is gonna
have<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.479> lot<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.690> color<00:04:46.990> on<00:04:47.199> it<00:04:47.349> because<00:04:47.680> we

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
have a lot of color on it because we

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.499 
have a lot of color on it because we
don't<00:04:48.069> want<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.250> be<00:04:48.340> adding<00:04:48.639> too<00:04:49.000> much<00:04:49.180> color

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
don't want to be adding too much color

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.640 
don't want to be adding too much color
back<00:04:49.690> into<00:04:49.870> our<00:04:50.050> face<00:04:50.199> because<00:04:50.319> then<00:04:50.530> that

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
back into our face because then that

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.990 
back into our face because then that
just<00:04:50.800> defeats<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.280> purpose<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.729> what<00:04:51.880> we've

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
just defeats the purpose of what we've

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.540 
just defeats the purpose of what we've
