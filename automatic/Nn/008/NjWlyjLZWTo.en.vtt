hi in this video I want to talk about

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.379 
hi in this video I want to talk about
stiffness<00:00:09.620> in<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:10.190> right<00:00:10.430> arm<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:11.240> bow

arm specifically in the wrist and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.050 
arm specifically in the wrist and
fingers<00:00:15.080> and<00:00:15.260> if<00:00:16.160> you're<00:00:16.340> a<00:00:16.370> beginning<00:00:16.700> player

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
fingers and if you're a beginning player

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.779 
fingers and if you're a beginning player
you<00:00:17.750> may<00:00:17.870> not<00:00:18.020> even<00:00:18.140> know<00:00:18.470> that<00:00:18.800> you<00:00:19.430> have

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
you may not even know that you have

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.760 
you may not even know that you have
stiffness<00:00:20.300> in<00:00:20.480> your<00:00:20.510> wrist<00:00:20.840> but<00:00:21.020> if<00:00:21.260> you<00:00:21.619> are

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
stiffness in your wrist but if you are

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.100 
stiffness in your wrist but if you are
experiencing<00:00:22.460> problems<00:00:22.810> keeping<00:00:23.810> a<00:00:23.870> straight

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
experiencing problems keeping a straight

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.010 
experiencing problems keeping a straight
bow<00:00:24.320> or<00:00:24.670> if<00:00:25.670> you<00:00:25.880> hear<00:00:26.210> that<00:00:26.360> sometimes<00:00:26.600> your

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
bow or if you hear that sometimes your

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.370 
bow or if you hear that sometimes your
tone<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.680> is<00:00:28.250> shaky<00:00:28.910> it's<00:00:29.480> not<00:00:29.630> really<00:00:29.900> pure

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
tone is is shaky it's not really pure

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.119 
tone is is shaky it's not really pure
and<00:00:30.410> deep<00:00:30.950> and<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:31.820> know<00:00:32.180> something<00:00:32.689> is<00:00:32.870> up

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
and deep and you know something is up

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.770 
and deep and you know something is up
likely<00:00:34.129> you<00:00:34.399> have<00:00:34.550> tension<00:00:34.910> in<00:00:35.120> in<00:00:35.329> your<00:00:35.480> wrist

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
likely you have tension in in your wrist

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.619 
likely you have tension in in your wrist
and<00:00:36.020> or<00:00:36.829> fingers<00:00:37.370> now<00:00:37.789> I<00:00:37.820> do<00:00:38.030> think<00:00:38.210> that<00:00:38.449> they

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
and or fingers now I do think that they

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.299 
and or fingers now I do think that they
are<00:00:38.690> both<00:00:38.870> connected<00:00:39.230> I<00:00:39.469> think<00:00:39.679> if<00:00:39.859> you<00:00:40.010> have

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
are both connected I think if you have

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.270 
are both connected I think if you have
tension<00:00:41.210> in<00:00:41.449> your<00:00:41.600> wrist<00:00:41.809> then<00:00:42.440> likely<00:00:43.010> it's

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
tension in your wrist then likely it's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.790 
tension in your wrist then likely it's
because<00:00:43.730> your<00:00:43.909> fingers<00:00:44.359> are<00:00:44.390> stiff<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.530> then

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
because your fingers are stiff and then

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.950 
because your fingers are stiff and then
vice<00:00:46.489> versa<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:47.420> can<00:00:47.570> just<00:00:47.749> do<00:00:47.839> this

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
vice versa and you can just do this

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.720 
vice versa and you can just do this
quick<00:00:48.320> demo<00:00:48.739> for<00:00:48.920> yourself<00:00:49.219> and<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:49.460> can<00:00:49.489> just

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
quick demo for yourself and you can just

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.970 
quick demo for yourself and you can just
feel<00:00:49.969> how<00:00:50.420> they<00:00:50.690> are<00:00:50.749> connected<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.499> just

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
feel how they are connected so just

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.470 
feel how they are connected so just
tighten<00:00:52.219> your<00:00:52.460> fingers<00:00:52.879> as<00:00:53.120> if<00:00:53.149> you're

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
tighten your fingers as if you're

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.389 
tighten your fingers as if you're
holding<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:53.929> bow<00:00:54.079> tighten<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.679> you<00:00:55.039> can<00:00:55.219> feel

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
holding a bow tighten that you can feel

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.279 
holding a bow tighten that you can feel
immediately<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.179> your<00:00:56.210> wrist<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:56.960> can<00:00:57.140> feel

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
immediately in your wrist you can feel

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.529 
immediately in your wrist you can feel
things<00:00:57.589> tightened<00:00:58.100> through<00:00:58.309> here<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.879> then

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
things tightened through here and then

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.509 
things tightened through here and then
just<00:01:00.050> try<00:01:00.440> not<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:00.920> move<00:01:01.039> your<00:01:01.219> wrist<00:01:01.399> just

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
just try not to move your wrist just

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.939 
just try not to move your wrist just
hold<00:01:01.999> it<00:01:02.269> you<00:01:02.780> know<00:01:02.870> keep<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:03.319> really<00:01:03.739> rigid

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
hold it you know keep it really rigid

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.590 
hold it you know keep it really rigid
and<00:01:04.400> you're<00:01:04.610> going<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.790> feel<00:01:05.030> your<00:01:05.239> fingers

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
and you're going to feel your fingers

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.170 
and you're going to feel your fingers

want to tighten as well so you know
you've<00:01:08.330> heard<00:01:08.570> many<00:01:09.050> times<00:01:09.380> I'm<00:01:09.560> sure<00:01:09.590> in

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
you've heard many times I'm sure in

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.429 
you've heard many times I'm sure in
other<00:01:10.280> videos<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:11.509> you<00:01:11.899> know<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.110> bow<00:01:12.200> arm

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
other videos that you know the bow arm

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.709 
other videos that you know the bow arm
needs<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.740> be<00:01:12.920> relaxed<00:01:13.579> that<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.030> allow<00:01:14.420> for

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
needs to be relaxed that you allow for

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.810 
needs to be relaxed that you allow for
the<00:01:14.960> weight<00:01:15.200> of<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.649> arm<00:01:15.860> into<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.460> strings

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
the weight of the arm into the strings

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.969 
the weight of the arm into the strings
that's<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.420> real<00:01:17.600> common<00:01:17.960> phrase<00:01:18.439> we<00:01:18.740> teachers

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that's a real common phrase we teachers

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.029 
that's a real common phrase we teachers
use<00:01:19.939> but<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:20.930> easy<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.469> hear<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:21.860> an

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
use but it's it's easy to hear that an

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.209 
use but it's it's easy to hear that an
intellectually<00:01:22.729> grasp<00:01:22.969> it<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.270> harder<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.049> do

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
intellectually grasp it and harder to do

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.700 
intellectually grasp it and harder to do
but<00:01:25.219> generally<00:01:25.939> speaking<00:01:26.149> we<00:01:26.899> learned<00:01:27.200> once

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
but generally speaking we learned once

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.950 
but generally speaking we learned once
we<00:01:27.920> sort<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.250> understand<00:01:28.700> certain<00:01:29.420> concepts

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
we sort of understand certain concepts

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.670 
we sort of understand certain concepts
so<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.979> another<00:01:31.189> little<00:01:31.780> demo<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.439> can<00:01:33.590> do

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
so do another little demo and you can do

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.520 
so do another little demo and you can do
this<00:01:33.829> too<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.520> use<00:01:34.969> your<00:01:35.119> left<00:01:35.810> arm<00:01:36.079> as<00:01:36.320> the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
this too so use your left arm as the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.800 
this too so use your left arm as the
base<00:01:36.710> user<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.430> let's<00:01:37.969> get<00:01:38.119> our<00:01:38.240> bow<00:01:38.420> bow

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
base user and let's get our bow bow

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.580 
base user and let's get our bow bow
holds<00:01:39.170> ready

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590

the past but if you can bend your
fingers<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.359> can<00:01:56.659> let<00:01:56.929> your<00:01:57.109> wrist<00:01:57.380> be

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
fingers and you can let your wrist be

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.730 
fingers and you can let your wrist be
dangled<00:01:58.969> like<00:01:59.119> this<00:01:59.359> then<00:01:59.869> you're<00:02:00.109> fine<00:02:00.320> so

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
dangled like this then you're fine so

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.109 
dangled like this then you're fine so
the<00:02:00.829> only<00:02:00.979> tension<00:02:01.399> in<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.579> arm<00:02:01.729> at<00:02:01.969> all

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
the only tension in the arm at all

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.870 
the only tension in the arm at all
really<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.749> just<00:02:03.289> what<00:02:03.469> we<00:02:03.619> need<00:02:03.670> in<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
really is just what we need in the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.300 
really is just what we need in the
shoulder<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.509> hold<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:05.840> arm<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.289> so<00:02:06.890> sort<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.219> a

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
shoulder to hold the arm up so sort of a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.730 
shoulder to hold the arm up so sort of a
contradiction<00:02:07.750> allow<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.810> weight<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
contradiction allow the weight of the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.980 
contradiction allow the weight of the
arm<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.220> sink<00:02:10.640> into<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.060> strings<00:02:11.390> yet<00:02:11.630> we<00:02:11.840> have

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
arm to sink into the strings yet we have

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.839 
arm to sink into the strings yet we have
to<00:02:12.170> support<00:02:12.560> our<00:02:12.710> arm<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:13.550> have<00:02:13.700> to

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
to support our arm and we have to

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.850 
to support our arm and we have to
support<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.390> bow<00:02:14.569> so<00:02:15.050> there<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.530> some

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
support the bow so there is some

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.030 
support the bow so there is some
necessary<00:02:16.870> tension<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.140> begin<00:02:18.440> with

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
necessary tension to begin with

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.619 
necessary tension to begin with
we<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.400> want<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.580> make<00:02:19.730> sure<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:20.300> just

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
we just want to make sure that it's just

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.839 
we just want to make sure that it's just
in<00:02:20.840> certain<00:02:21.290> spots<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:21.890> really<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.459> muscle

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
in certain spots so really this muscle

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.539 
in certain spots so really this muscle
here<00:02:23.090> okay<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.409> you<00:02:25.129> need<00:02:25.370> to

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
here okay this is the one you need to

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.089 
here okay this is the one you need to
keep<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.970> arm<00:02:26.150> elevated<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:27.860> very

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
keep the arm elevated and and it's very

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.259 
keep the arm elevated and and it's very
different<00:02:28.430> we<00:02:28.519> don't<00:02:28.580> want<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.849> raise<00:02:29.090> the

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
different we don't want to raise the

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.420 
different we don't want to raise the
shoulder<00:02:29.599> like<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:30.980> lift<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
shoulder like this so we just lift the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.809 
shoulder like this so we just lift the
arm<00:02:32.440> from<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.560> elbow<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.400> just<00:02:34.610> elevates

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
arm from the elbow and it just elevates

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.880 
arm from the elbow and it just elevates
our<00:02:35.209> arm<00:02:35.390> okay<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:35.780> let<00:02:36.440> your<00:02:36.530> wrist<00:02:36.680> angle

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
our arm okay so let your wrist angle

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.009 
our arm okay so let your wrist angle
like<00:02:37.129> this<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.310> hold<00:02:37.670> your<00:02:37.790> arm<00:02:37.970> out<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.269> just

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
like this and hold your arm out and just

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.670 
like this and hold your arm out and just
start<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.709> drop<00:02:40.069> your<00:02:40.700> arm<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.410> fingers<00:02:42.410> hit

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
start to drop your arm and fingers hit

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.559 
start to drop your arm and fingers hit
first<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.489> as<00:02:43.640> soon<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.060> fingers<00:02:44.330> hit

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
first so as soon as the fingers hit

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.449 
first so as soon as the fingers hit
there's<00:02:44.989> no<00:02:45.170> tension<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.680> fingers<00:02:46.040> start<00:02:46.310> to

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
there's no tension the fingers start to

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.390 
there's no tension the fingers start to
bend<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.319> wrist<00:02:48.590> starts<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.159> lower

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
bend and then the wrist starts to lower

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.500 
bend and then the wrist starts to lower
as<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:50.000> let<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.750> arm<00:02:50.930> sink<00:02:51.560> sink<00:02:52.459> further<00:02:53.299> and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
as you let the arm sink sink further and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.420 
as you let the arm sink sink further and
further<00:02:53.660> down<00:02:53.959> okay<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.250> do<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.670> again<00:02:57.430> now

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
further down okay so do that again now

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.759 
further down okay so do that again now
if<00:02:58.579> your<00:02:58.760> fingers<00:02:59.209> are<00:02:59.329> stiff<00:02:59.690> okay<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
if your fingers are stiff okay and you

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.740 
if your fingers are stiff okay and you
do<00:03:00.920> this<00:03:01.099> it's<00:03:01.670> going<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.849> be<00:03:01.940> really<00:03:02.269> hard<00:03:02.599> to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
do this it's going to be really hard to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.080 
do this it's going to be really hard to
let<00:03:03.440> your<00:03:03.620> wrist<00:03:03.859> come<00:03:04.190> down<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.910> wrist

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
let your wrist come down the wrist

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.180 
let your wrist come down the wrist
doesn't<00:03:05.299> want<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.810> bend<00:03:05.989> if<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.470> do<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.799> it

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
doesn't want to bend if you do this it

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.940 
doesn't want to bend if you do this it
wants<00:03:07.549> to<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.480> know<00:03:08.569> create<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:09.079> steel

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
wants to you know create this steel

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.000 
wants to you know create this steel
support<00:03:10.700> here<00:03:11.090> but<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:12.109> you<00:03:12.379> let<00:03:12.590> your<00:03:12.709> fingers

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
support here but if you let your fingers

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.819 
support here but if you let your fingers
then<00:03:13.400> relax<00:03:13.819> allow<00:03:14.390> them<00:03:14.599> to<00:03:14.780> Bend<00:03:15.019> then

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
then relax allow them to Bend then

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.309 
then relax allow them to Bend then
everything<00:03:16.489> will<00:03:16.790> Bend<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.209> well<00:03:17.390> okay<00:03:18.170> now

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
everything will Bend as well okay now

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.039 
everything will Bend as well okay now
take<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.920> one<00:03:19.160> little<00:03:19.370> step<00:03:19.549> further<00:03:20.049> rotate

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
take this one little step further rotate

also helps bring the wrist up okay and

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.380 
also helps bring the wrist up okay and
now<00:06:09.650> imagine<00:06:10.130> that<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:10.370> strings<00:06:10.730> are<00:06:10.880> all<00:06:11.060> cut

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.010 
and this very this very floppy puppet
arm<00:06:15.640> that<00:06:16.640> does<00:06:16.910> not<00:06:17.090> have<00:06:17.330> a<00:06:17.360> will<00:06:17.570> of<00:06:17.600> its<00:06:17.750> own

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
arm that does not have a will of its own

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.200
