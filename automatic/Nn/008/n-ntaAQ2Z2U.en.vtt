00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
wondering if isn't sure how to do it

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.470 
wondering if isn't sure how to do it
easily<00:02:06.190> within<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.670> video<00:02:06.880> so<00:02:07.240> it'll<00:02:07.390> be<00:02:07.450> a

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
easily within the video so it'll be a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.780 
easily within the video so it'll be a
lot<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.660> sped<00:02:07.840> up<00:02:07.960> part<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.230> me<00:02:08.670> probably<00:02:09.670> just
