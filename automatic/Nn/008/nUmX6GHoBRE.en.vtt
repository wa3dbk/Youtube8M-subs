00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.929
 Hello and welcome to 1 6 bn 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.120
 in today 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.460
 Light Hohmann tutorial powerful 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.169
 show how we Roth we little 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:28.580
 now have imported pictures and then the rest No what to do 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.409
 mainly I want to focus on topics here 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 set to brightness and white balance 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.410
 Percent, as most people already know, I mainly take pictures in the break 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.370
 format 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.180
 that means percent similar 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.390
 that usually no corn spawning the camera in court leaves it all up 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.390
 to stand automatic 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.130
 and percent next to the white balance 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.680
 Lie to me 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.030
 Farmer 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.770
 Here I photograph UBS with 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 Specify percent in small intent 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.980
 Blitz Forint 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.620
 it beeps 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.520
 Felix 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.430
 Per cent, however, the mistress Klein little falsified that is to order with 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.550
 this essay on the flash 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.960
 Although I can not get one more percent than if I were completely normal without 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.200
 this essay places 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.330
 Percent that is such a sum of milk glass 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.240
 However, in order to find I essentially find Bernauer form essential 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.420
 Domra light color and I have to do this now and Lightroom 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.210
 still adapt 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.290
 how to calculate there again Red 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.190
 yes I have here now an example picture of the world percent that you 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.240
 photographed last weekend 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.880
 This has been the case that you see all the allegations are 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.220
 Picture book a little too dark, but because the SOPLEX from that too and a bit 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.960
 Liechti 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.370
 swallows 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.370
 and here I just want to show how I act so out 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.600
 do the picture 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.450
 a little bit on not so much whether that percent is too bright 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.649
 now 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:19.719
 give in the light liveliness reclaim even a little bit high 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.129
 by percent the woman has something more to satisfy 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.329
 and those clarity controllers I can now very nice a fitting 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.929
 on which left Danzer push it is drawn relatively soft 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.679
 and continue to the right here 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:39.209
 Per cent, what do you have such a very small percent less the impression that it is 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.589
 Picture sharpness moved in the midst of contrast is raised 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.639
 Jan Little a little the 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.709
 Brightness maybe still we can see that looks pretty good 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.370
 now 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.069
 because only women are not 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.609
 that is, the brightness percent already fits here 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.840
 and I choose yours with them now 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.279
 Rehklau with these little ones would have with this little point 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.689
 one 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.849
 Crown area I know that the background of her the wallpapers the boys 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.299
 save the reason 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.579
 to have been white 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.379
 so you can get out of the field i can also down here this way 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.399
 Korte TuS printed on white paper use 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.609
 I 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.239
 who is curious now the background 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.420
 and just click with the eyedropper automatically the colors are 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.579
 now been adapted 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.209
 you can see it up here 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.719
 the percentages have been adjusted in advance to the bratwurst 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.289
 I had here before 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:42.669
 a color temperature of 5800 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.179
 Calvi Ben and now I have 4850 here 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.900
 Percent Kelly in Tarsus is more in the blue direction than in the cooler one 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.239
 Percentages have been trained 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.749
 and so I have here again 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.509
 relative 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.519
 Normally, the picture looks the brightness which I still a bit one 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.179
 noticeable something else 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.179
 the pass in the background a bit more getting through 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.390
 and so powerful the picture is left 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.539
 rips 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.930
 Here I have for this picture 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.079
 DM 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.639
 contrast 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.729
 adjusted the white balance the brightness 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.690
 and I could get up now 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.270
 more pictures I made in the same room in the same lighting conditions 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.020
 have 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.020
 that percentage of these settings simply percent sync that 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 I do not want to be that now 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.949
 I have another picture here 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.629
 the percent 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.819
 has been made with the same attitude 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.819
 and percent now i want to show 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.759
 the settings 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.210
 Hero dense in this picture debts have made on the second picture easy 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.860
 can take over that I could not do any more pictures if 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.650
 I have many citizens in this room 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.370
 I've shot over these with the same settings 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.560
 Sync function very nice take over the settings 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.830
 so quiet source more on that within the edited pictures 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.289
 and hold the big city button pressed shift button and click the last picture 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.779
 in the series 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.639
 to which I like and customer like her 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.300
 and I have pumped her in the develop motul now 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.680
 synchronize 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.659
 Here is everything 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.629
 11 percent except for local adjustments Sculptures area 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.270
 I do not want to do that 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.710
 all other settings have been taken with picture 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.600
 Clarity changes sharpness squad to us group brightness contrast 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.009
 showy 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.849
 the women 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.250
 MT the vignetting the birch avenue now from that the picture at all 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.559
 taken over other pictures 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:58.559
 and now here from the protest Klika 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.520
 you move here 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.520
 if I admit Ammon picture change 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.610
 I'll take it here 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.279
 Rousseau theme 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:18.009
 and so it is adjusted now that means i can set the default for too 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.290
 many take on role models Kandern 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.490
 Step by step 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.030
 every single picture percent in every single picture the free the fine tuning 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.370
 do
