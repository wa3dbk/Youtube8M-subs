know double-a or triple-a something
pretty<00:02:49.280> common<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:51.319> other<00:02:51.409> thing<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.709> if<00:02:52.129> you

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
pretty common the other thing is if you

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.729 
pretty common the other thing is if you
have<00:02:52.879> a<00:02:52.909> newer<00:02:53.180> mouse<00:02:53.450> one<00:02:54.319> with<00:02:54.440> an<00:02:54.560> optical

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
underneath or a rollerball you don't

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.770 
underneath or a rollerball you don't
