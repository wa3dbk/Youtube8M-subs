00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
it comes in this pouch and then you just

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.910 
it comes in this pouch and then you just
unravel<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:49.350> has<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.770> sponge<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:52.230> a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.450 

it's<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.740> really<00:03:59.070> really<00:03:59.550> thin<00:03:59.850> sponge<00:04:00.270> I<00:04:01.460> could

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
it's a really really thin sponge I could

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.100 
it's a really really thin sponge I could
see<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:02.820> falling<00:04:03.210> apart<00:04:03.540> although<00:04:03.960> it

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
see this falling apart although it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.750 
see this falling apart although it
hasn't<00:04:04.470> yet<00:04:04.590> after<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:05.040> wash<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.490> couple

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
hasn't yet after you wash it a couple

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.270 
hasn't yet after you wash it a couple
times<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.210> don't<00:04:06.360> know<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.510> they're<00:04:06.630> gonna<00:04:06.720> sell

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
times I don't know if they're gonna sell

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.590 
times I don't know if they're gonna sell
refills<00:04:08.280> for<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.550> sponges<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:09.210> it<00:04:09.420> probably

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
refills for the sponges but it probably

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.530 
refills for the sponges but it probably
a<00:04:09.810> good<00:04:09.960> idea<00:04:10.020> if<00:04:10.350> they<00:04:10.440> did<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:11.880> compact<00:04:12.390> and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
a good idea if they did the compact and

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.720 
a good idea if they did the compact and
comes<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.750> good<00:04:15.900> size<00:04:16.109> mirror<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.739> it's<00:04:17.459> a

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
comes with a good size mirror and it's a

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.030 
comes with a good size mirror and it's a
really<00:04:18.209> really<00:04:18.540> white<00:04:19.049> powder<00:04:19.320> but<00:04:19.859> it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
really really white powder but it

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.420 
really really white powder but it
doesn't<00:04:20.370> show<00:04:20.549> up<00:04:20.730> white<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.359> skin<00:04:21.630> at<00:04:21.840> all

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
doesn't show up white on the skin at all

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.060 
doesn't show up white on the skin at all
and<00:04:23.430> then<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.330> already<00:04:24.840> have<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.230> on<00:04:25.350> but<00:04:25.620> just

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and then I already have it on but just

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.960 
and then I already have it on but just
so<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.280> could<00:04:26.400> see<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.160> really<00:04:29.340> does<00:04:29.670> cut

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
so you could see and it really does cut

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.580 
so you could see and it really does cut
down<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.480> shine<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:31.260> lot<00:04:32.270> without<00:04:33.590> looking

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
down on shine a lot without looking

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.400 
down on shine a lot without looking
really<00:04:34.980> like<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.250> have<00:04:35.430> anything<00:04:35.880> on<00:04:36.410> which

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
really like you have anything on which

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.560 
really like you have anything on which
is<00:04:37.560> good<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.670> good<00:04:41.820> for<00:04:42.000> travel<00:04:42.420> I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
is good and this is good for travel I

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.480 
is good and this is good for travel I
kind<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:42.900> don't<00:04:43.110> like<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.920> fact<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.280> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
kind of don't like the fact that the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.920 
kind of don't like the fact that the
sponge<00:04:44.730> doesn't<00:04:45.210> fit<00:04:45.450> in<00:04:45.600> there<00:04:45.810> though

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
sponge doesn't fit in there though

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.300 
sponge doesn't fit in there though
because<00:04:45.960> even<00:04:46.410> though<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.620> sponge<00:04:46.950> is<00:04:47.130> so

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
because even though the sponge is so

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.480 
because even though the sponge is so
thin<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.990> compact<00:04:49.470> doesn't<00:04:49.860> shut<00:04:50.130> with<00:04:50.370> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
thin the compact doesn't shut with the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.050 
thin the compact doesn't shut with the
sponge<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.870> then<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:53.640> got<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:53.820> carry

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
sponge in it so then you got a carry

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.930 
sponge in it so then you got a carry
around<00:04:54.240> this<00:04:54.510> dump<00:04:54.900> thing<00:04:55.169> but<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:55.820> just<00:04:56.820> don't

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
around this dump thing but I just don't

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.920 
around this dump thing but I just don't
know<00:04:57.090> why<00:04:57.210> they<00:04:57.390> just<00:04:57.419> didn't<00:04:57.810> make<00:04:57.870> the

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
know why they just didn't make the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.110 
know why they just didn't make the
compact<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.620> little<00:04:58.890> bit<00:04:59.070> thicker<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.820> really

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
compact a little bit thicker it really

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.850 
compact a little bit thicker it really
wouldn't<00:05:00.390> have<00:05:00.419> hurt<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.870> make<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.230> a<00:05:01.410> little

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
wouldn't have hurt to make it a little

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.680 
wouldn't have hurt to make it a little
bit<00:05:02.010> bigger<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.820> fit<00:05:02.850> this<00:05:03.180> little<00:05:03.510> tiny

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
bit bigger to fit this little tiny

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.680 
bit bigger to fit this little tiny
sponge<00:05:04.020> but<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:06.680> but<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:08.070> like<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.480> guess

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
sponge but it but I like it so I guess

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.970 
sponge but it but I like it so I guess
I'm<00:05:09.810> going<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:09.990> carry<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.320> around<00:05:10.410> in<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.770> dump

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
I'm going to carry it around in the dump

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:18.230 
I'm going to carry it around in the dump
pouch<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:14.660> again<00:05:15.660> for<00:05:16.350> NARS<00:05:16.740> I<00:05:17.130> think<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:18.120> is

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
pouch and again for NARS I think this is

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.340 
pouch and again for NARS I think this is
not<00:05:18.419> a<00:05:18.450> bad<00:05:18.690> price<00:05:18.870> $34<00:05:20.360> for<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.450> point<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:22.110> 4

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
not a bad price $34 for the point to 4

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.040 
not a bad price $34 for the point to 4
ounces<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:24.979> pressed<00:05:25.979> or<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.610> 0.35<00:05:27.540> ounces

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
ounces of the pressed or the 0.35 ounces

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.700 
ounces of the pressed or the 0.35 ounces
of<00:05:28.640> loose

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
of loose

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.920 
of loose
so<00:05:31.710> definitely<00:05:32.520> mint<00:05:32.880> recommend<00:05:33.419> check<00:05:33.750> this

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
so definitely mint recommend check this

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.340 
so definitely mint recommend check this
out<00:05:34.140> especially<00:05:34.800> if<00:05:35.040> you<00:05:35.790> like<00:05:36.540> powders<00:05:37.020> but
