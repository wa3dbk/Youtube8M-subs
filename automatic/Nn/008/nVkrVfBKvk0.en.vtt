00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:12.809
 video tag confession enlarged bureau 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.839
 even if I hate the name bruce e ti 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.720
 thank you and then I take the ball that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.390
 cindy passed me and we begin immediately 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 answer the questions then hours 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.760
 it depends mainly on the video though 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.949
 undoubtedly dedicate a video e 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 it involves a lot of time and above all 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.680
 when I make the video for beauty ge 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.880
 I have to do the various pieces I have to first 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.920
 find all the information then 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.050
 then he puts them together 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 I write I write a kind of script it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.980
 I will say wrong five thousand times and then I will 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.469
 I have to avoid so let's say maybe 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.140
 that of video that lately me 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.329
 take a little more time 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 absolute works that spend and for 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.379
 luck my side a person like 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 in reality he is a very careful one 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.750
 so they taught me a little bit 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.579
 maybe to make us a little more case 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.080
 when I buy things thinking about it maybe 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.380
 a little more before however absolutely 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.689
 unfortunately they spend one of the two 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.159
 when it's easy then it's easy when 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.550
 there is nobody at home because of it 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.920
 how much 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.540
 for years now I 've been making the video 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.980
 however it bothers me when I know that 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.250
 on the other side there is someone who is standing by me 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.910
 listening and so there is I am ashamed 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.220
 comes to laugh 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.050
 in fact now you see they are four big 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.000
 fair screen at the bottom we say that I am a 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.590
 a little bit more isolated or two doors then 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.540
 from this thing it makes me feel a little bit 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.850
 safer a little less stupid 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.530
 write at ease then we say that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.790
 I also found situations 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.920
 in which I had to speak before one 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.510
 camera with other people and I noticed 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.390
 okay obviously that from early times 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.220
 today I feel a little bit more in my own 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.570
 ease 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.700
 obviously have a person if I have to 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.170
 talk so I have an interlocutor who 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.090
 you ask me the questions with which anyway 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.280
 i have to exchange a person with 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.750
 which I am comfortable with and with 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.120
 which I obviously have this feeling 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.100
 it definitely helps is another thing that i do 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.350
 like a lot and when they call me 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.390
 and they call me robbie instead of roberta 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.760
 riberto a little makes me uncomfortable though 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.720
 rodi is the thing that surely puts me 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.399
 immediately at ease 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.590
 my worst make-up habit 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.150
 I believe they are the eyeliner england 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.040
 in fact roles terms that snow me 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.800
 take my friends too some 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.930
 maybe make their own make -up artists because 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.459
 anyway I fix this to all 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.110
 hours of day and night as far as 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.870
 regards the laner in glitter on I like it 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.080
 I use a lot of it for my hair 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.879
 They say this and george outside 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.510
 dai says I should inflate this 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:41.340
 part only that I'm not there I don't want to 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.840
 it annoys me to put the collapses and then there 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.150
 I never get lost every time 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.310
 Tower cards are worth this sentence 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.079
 I always say is that there is no trick 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.610
 that can make a woman beautiful if not 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.409
 he is accompanied by his own smile 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.250
 they say it is the mantra that I carry 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.049
 behind 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.849
 then I am afraid the first prepare myself every day 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.040
 depends on whether I have to stay at home to work 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.230
 that is the computer and so not the office 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.780
 or if I have to study even worse or 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.459
 if I have to go out usually if there 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.220
 preparation also involves washing 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.609
 hair at least an hour then an hour in between 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.379
 hair makeup is usually in between us 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.209
 they also make their nails finish because they don't 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.590
 they measure a lot so I wanted to do them 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.019
 also those therefore an oret not net a 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.970
 fourth my favorite video on youtube 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.549
 the video dedicated to the birth 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.099
 of the little girl who now escapes me 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.720
 proper name placed here is that video there 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.579
 I saw it for the first time in a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.109
 newscast that during a newscast 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.450
 I was at dinner with my parents 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.889
 surely I can cry so it's a 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.269
 video that has excited me so much and is 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.560
 a beautiful idea and there were also 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.299
 used for nine months for 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
 make it then I found it 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.440
 really cute and original singular 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.829
 one thing that remains above all for 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.470
 the child then the youtuber I follow 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.490
 that deserves more views 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.600
 this entry is looking for and she likes it 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.180
 a lot and I think it's motivated anyway 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.380
 in what he does and above all 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.000
 quite original which is one thing 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.100
 lately especially here on youtube 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.510
 premier next year's project 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.490
 which makes me happy is really a 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.750
 project that will cover the first two months 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.820
 of the year 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.950
 there is a launch of something I have 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.720
 given birth and therefore it is a thing of 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.720
 which I still can't completely 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.480
 speak but it is a project that is mine in 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.220
 everything and for everything and of which precisely to the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.720
 which I hold particularly as if 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.550
 was my son my son 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.170
 obviously, as soon as you can talk about it 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.660
 you will be the first to know 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.450
 the strangest moment while I filmed 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.730
 oh well that time on the bike what kind it was 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.480
 attached with the camera in the incline 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.700
 videos like ro have fun on tour and I'd say 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.150
 that of other times 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.740
 maybe I did I signed the people 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.390
 looks at you weird but I was 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.680
 honestly that can do that for the 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.060
 camcorder while I go around though 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.700
 honestly I don't even do it anymore 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.580
 In case I keep that use to prepare myself 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.320
 for a video it also depends there that 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.820
 however very often you win I prepare 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.010
 so while I 'm shooting it then if I am 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.750
 otherwise I prepare a video tutorial a 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.250
 times not to give are already made up and 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.930
 so I'm going to step up as in 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.240
 this case all not just the lipstick e 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.940
 then I turn the video what I wear into 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.419
 this moment you are lucky that o 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.040
 pile blins with cellars 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.800
 however in short, baboons then leggins then 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.280
 usually also pajamas or type of 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.780
 rooms that are in their underwear 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.870
 because then you can only see up here 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.570
 so sometimes I really put in the first one 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:38.790
 what I find and then the last one 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.440
 he asks what makes me proud then 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.030
 okay first of 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.370
 that is something that maybe one of many 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.630
 the others, because they are there anyway 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.810
 people who obviously follow me 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.400
 from the beginning so that they have done a little 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.840
 with me all that was the 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.000
 path, however, change 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.580
 of the university to make what 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.320
 it was my passion a job like al 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.030
 in short, a lot of time determination 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.040
 I try hard and certainly there 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.110
 you put in twenty and I always say 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.000
 because you are the people I am 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.070
 argue from the beginning perhaps again 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.290
 first of the people I have beside me 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.480
 in my life because if you are the first 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.660
 to know and now maybe I could 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.610
 month or so later is the thing that pleases me 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.750
 is that very often I always try to 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.810
 share with you the things that I do 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.490
 captain because I feel part of everything 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.190
 in short, therefore, the relationship is beautiful 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.810
 there this is all I thank the cindy e 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.040
 I greet all the others who have been 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.240
 cut yourself as I go to see also i 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.240
 your videos and a big kiss
