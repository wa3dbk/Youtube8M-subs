00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.789 
you can actually go on to and and select
so<00:02:43.390> i'll<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.569> select<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.080> one<00:02:44.140> first<00:02:44.560> of

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
so i'll just select this one first of

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.080 
so i'll just select this one first of
all<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.040> we'll<00:02:45.130> give<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.430> go<00:02:47.850> now<00:02:48.850> there's<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
all and we'll give it a go now there's a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.520 
all and we'll give it a go now there's a
whole<00:02:49.239> variation<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.930> ways<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.110> can<00:02:50.350> actually

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
whole variation of ways you can actually

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.710 
whole variation of ways you can actually
control<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.130> car<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:52.030> I've<00:02:52.150> got<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.450> set<00:02:52.660> up

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
control the car but I've got it set up

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.360 
control the car but I've got it set up
so<00:02:52.840> as<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.319> does<00:02:53.500> throttle<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.130> brake

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
so as it does throttle and brake

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.220 
so as it does throttle and brake
automatically<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.239> then<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:56.019> simply

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
automatically and then I just simply

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.570 
automatically and then I just simply
steer<00:02:56.769> by<00:02:57.340> moving<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.720> ipad<00:02:59.620> 2<00:02:59.860> around<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.459> my

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
steer by moving the ipad 2 around in my

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.710 
steer by moving the ipad 2 around in my
hands<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.380> we<00:03:02.440> go<00:03:02.970> by<00:03:03.970> moving<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.390> left<00:03:04.600> we

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
hands so if we go by moving it left we

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.580 
hands so if we go by moving it left we
go<00:03:04.840> left<00:03:05.079> right<00:03:05.320> we<00:03:05.560> go<00:03:05.709> right<00:03:05.950> obviously<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
go left right we go right obviously the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.400 
go left right we go right obviously the
graphics<00:03:09.010> are<00:03:09.130> absolutely<00:03:09.160> superb

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.040 

we<00:03:15.010> get<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> track<00:03:15.850> indicator<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.630> show<00:03:16.810> where
