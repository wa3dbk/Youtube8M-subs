00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this huge deal now here's a waterfall

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.539 
this huge deal now here's a waterfall
comes<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> moat<00:01:31.159> then<00:01:32.159> there's<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
comes down to the moat then there's a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.819 
comes down to the moat then there's a
heat<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> main<00:01:33.659> filming<00:01:34.110> area<00:01:34.409> here

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
heat this is the main filming area here

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.399 
heat this is the main filming area here
yeah<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> crews<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.689> run<00:01:36.840> their<00:01:36.960> cables

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
yeah so the crews can run their cables

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.219 
yeah so the crews can run their cables
from<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> mine<00:01:38.159> shaft<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.600> there's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
from the mine shaft this way and there's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
from the mine shaft this way and there's
another<00:01:40.500> tunnel<00:01:40.770> over<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.310> goes<00:01:41.520> off<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
another tunnel over there goes off that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
another tunnel over there goes off that
way<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.540> an<00:01:42.630> escape<00:01:42.840> by<00:01:43.170> implication

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
way so you have an escape by implication

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.160 
way so you have an escape by implication
needed<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.280> set<00:01:44.520> set<00:01:44.790> up<00:01:44.939> here<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:46.020> you
