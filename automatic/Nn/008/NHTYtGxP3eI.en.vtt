pressure on water droplets that reverse

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.340 
pressure on water droplets that reverse
the<00:00:59.370> direction<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.940> those<00:01:00.090> droplets<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.660> stop

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the direction of those droplets and stop

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.500 
the direction of those droplets and stop
them<00:01:01.559> getting<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> skin<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.000> garment

them getting to the skin this garment
works<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> same<00:01:04.140> way<00:01:04.199> water<00:01:05.100> gets<00:01:05.519> into<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
works in the same way water gets into it

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
works in the same way water gets into it
but<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> water<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.650> through

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
but the water can then not get through

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
but the water can then not get through
it<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.430> water<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.850> literally<00:01:09.330> physically

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it the water is literally physically

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
it the water is literally physically
turned<00:01:10.650> around<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.159> pumped<00:01:11.460> back<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:11.729> now

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
turned around and pumped back out now

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.550 
turned around and pumped back out now
the<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.630> wonderful<00:01:12.930> thing<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the other wonderful thing about this is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.109 
the other wonderful thing about this is
that<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.460> inner<00:01:14.670> lining<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.619> extremely

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
that the the inner lining is extremely

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
that the the inner lining is extremely
hydrophilic<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.990> loves<00:01:19.530> water<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.280> any

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
hydrophilic it loves water so any

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.980 
hydrophilic it loves water so any
