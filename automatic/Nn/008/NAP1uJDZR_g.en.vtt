5.5<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.870> would<00:02:31.080> have<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.320> measure<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.620> with<00:02:31.830> my

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
5.5 I would have to measure it with my

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.760 
5.5 I would have to measure it with my
ruler<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.090> far<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.510> can

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
ruler but so far I can

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.410 
ruler but so far I can
tell<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.580> beautiful<00:02:35.150> device

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
tell you that it is a beautiful device

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.630 
tell you that it is a beautiful device
here<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.990> back<00:02:36.170> we<00:02:36.380> had<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.680> Gianni<00:02:37.130> logo

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
here in the back we had the Gianni logo

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
here in the back we had the Gianni logo
you<00:02:38.240> have<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.570> 13<00:02:38.930> megapixel<00:02:39.050> with<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.680> LED

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
you have the 13 megapixel with the LED

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.770 
you have the 13 megapixel with the LED
flash<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.580> back<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.210> some<00:02:41.450> sort<00:02:41.720> of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
flash in the back and then some sort of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.050 
flash in the back and then some sort of
microphone<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.890> do<00:02:43.010> believe<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.550> this<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.760> so

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
microphone I do believe that this is so

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.030 
microphone I do believe that this is so
that<00:02:44.270> when<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.540> put<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.840> on<00:02:44.960> speaker<00:02:45.830> mode

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
that when you put it on speaker mode

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.820 
that when you put it on speaker mode
this<00:02:46.400> microphone<00:02:46.970> gets<00:02:47.210> activated<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.080> also

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
this microphone gets activated and also

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.970 
this microphone gets activated and also
serves<00:02:49.100> as<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> noise<00:02:49.640> cancellation<00:02:50.210> then<00:02:51.050> here

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
serves as a noise cancellation then here

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.620 
serves as a noise cancellation then here
at<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> bottom<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.670> have<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.880> actual

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
at the bottom you have the actual

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.050 
at the bottom you have the actual
loudspeaker<00:02:54.380> then<00:02:54.710> here<00:02:54.920> we<00:02:55.010> had<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.430> 3.5

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
loudspeaker then here we had the 3.5

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.310 
loudspeaker then here we had the 3.5
millimeter<00:02:56.420> headphone<00:02:56.480> jack<00:02:56.840> with<00:02:57.290> the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
millimeter headphone jack with the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.830 
millimeter headphone jack with the
standard<00:02:57.770> microphone<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:59.090> right<00:02:59.450> side<00:02:59.720> of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
standard microphone on the right side of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.260 
standard microphone on the right side of
the<00:02:59.930> device<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.560> pretty<00:03:01.400> much<00:03:01.550> we<00:03:01.880> have<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
the device is pretty much we have the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.360 
the device is pretty much we have the
SIM<00:03:02.630> tray<00:03:02.660> I'm<00:03:03.080> gonna<00:03:03.290> try<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.560> focus<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:04.160> for

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
SIM tray I'm gonna try to focus this for

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.250 
SIM tray I'm gonna try to focus this for
you<00:03:04.460> guys<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.880> best<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.210> possible<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:06.020> think

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
you guys the best way possible I think

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.720 
you guys the best way possible I think
this<00:03:06.350> is<00:03:06.440> going<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.620> be<00:03:06.710> a<00:03:06.740> micro<00:03:07.220> sim<00:03:07.430> card

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
this is going to be a micro sim card

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.180 
this is going to be a micro sim card
slot<00:03:08.030> then<00:03:08.810> at<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> very<00:03:09.290> top<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.920> have<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
slot then at the very top you have the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.040 
slot then at the very top you have the
charging<00:03:10.520> port<00:03:10.880> with<00:03:11.180> some<00:03:11.390> sort<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.660> antenna

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
charging port with some sort of antenna

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.440 
charging port with some sort of antenna
here<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.620> then<00:03:13.250> on<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.580> left<00:03:13.820> hand<00:03:14.000> side<00:03:14.240> we

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
here and then on the left hand side we

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.670 
here and then on the left hand side we
had<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.750> power<00:03:14.930> button<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.650> volume

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
had the power button and the volume

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830 
had the power button and the volume
rocker<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.370> located<00:03:16.820> at<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.000> same<00:03:17.210> spot<00:03:17.570> which

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
rocker is located at the same spot which

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.570 
rocker is located at the same spot which
I<00:03:17.960> actually<00:03:18.080> like<00:03:18.500> because<00:03:18.710> sometimes<00:03:19.280> I

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
I actually like because sometimes I

prefer you know just so that I don't get
confused<00:03:21.800> for<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.790> buttons<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.210> be<00:03:23.330> on<00:03:23.510> one

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
confused for the buttons to be on one

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.420 
confused for the buttons to be on one
side<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.170> device<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.740> something<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.160> like

then<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.180> device<00:03:26.390> also<00:03:26.810> has<00:03:26.960> a<00:03:27.350> five<00:03:27.800> inch

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
then this device also has a five inch

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.060 
then this device also has a five inch
multi-touch<00:03:28.610> screen<00:03:29.180> which<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.070> 1080p

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.800 
multi-touch screen which is the 1080p
version<00:03:31.340> then<00:03:31.850> on<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.060> front<00:03:32.270> we<00:03:32.540> have<00:03:32.690> an

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
version then on the front we have an

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.140 
version then on the front we have an
actual<00:03:33.050> 5<00:03:33.350> megapixel<00:03:34.010> camera<00:03:34.040> now<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:34.910> don't

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
actual 5 megapixel camera now I don't

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.460 
actual 5 megapixel camera now I don't
know<00:03:35.210> if<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.420> guys<00:03:35.570> can<00:03:35.840> see<00:03:36.020> this<00:03:36.170> already

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
know if you guys can see this already

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.800 
know if you guys can see this already
but<00:03:36.920> from<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.370> quality<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.240> lens

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
but from the quality of the lens

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.960

for<00:03:59.360> being<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.050> thin<00:04:00.320> I<00:04:00.560> do<00:04:00.950> believe<00:04:01.400> that

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
for being so thin I do believe that

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.490 
for being so thin I do believe that
developers<00:04:02.150> are<00:04:02.270> working<00:04:02.780> into<00:04:02.959> getting<00:04:03.380> it

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
developers are working into getting it

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.610 
developers are working into getting it
with<00:04:03.730> Android<00:04:04.730> KitKat<00:04:04.940> which<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.500> new

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
with Android KitKat which is the new

with Android KitKat which is the new
version<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.100> Android<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:08.090> really<00:04:08.360> can't

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
version of Android and I really can't

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.900 
version of Android and I really can't
wait<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.900> see<00:04:09.110> that<00:04:09.290> as<00:04:09.440> well<00:04:09.709> here<00:04:10.400> we<00:04:10.550> can<00:04:10.700> see

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
wait to see that as well here we can see

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.030 
wait to see that as well here we can see
already<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.420> on<00:04:11.780> viewing<00:04:12.200> angles<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.860> has

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
already that on viewing angles it has

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.370 
already that on viewing angles it has
beautiful<00:04:13.340> colors<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.209> mean<00:04:14.720> of<00:04:14.930> course<00:04:14.959> we

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
beautiful colors I mean of course we

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.650 
beautiful colors I mean of course we
would<00:04:15.560> expect<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:16.160> from<00:04:16.310> an<00:04:16.669> IPS<00:04:17.090> screen<00:04:17.120> and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
would expect that from an IPS screen and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.140 
would expect that from an IPS screen and
also<00:04:17.810> 1080p<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.190> think<00:04:19.580> this<00:04:19.820> is<00:04:19.940> gonna<00:04:20.030> be

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
also 1080p so I think this is gonna be

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.540 
also 1080p so I think this is gonna be
the<00:04:20.330> first<00:04:20.540> boot<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.169> I'm<00:04:21.980> not<00:04:22.160> sure<00:04:22.340> but<00:04:22.460> I

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
the first boot and I'm not sure but I

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.700 
the first boot and I'm not sure but I
think<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.910> baby<00:04:23.150> also<00:04:23.570> told<00:04:23.810> me<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.110> it's

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
think I baby also told me that it's

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.040 
think I baby also told me that it's
gonna<00:04:24.890> be<00:04:25.070> in<00:04:25.280> Chinese<00:04:25.790> right<00:04:26.030> now<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.990> think

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
gonna be in Chinese right now so I think

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.590 
gonna be in Chinese right now so I think
I<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.919> way<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.430> getting<00:04:28.669> this<00:04:28.970> resolved

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
I have a way of getting this resolved

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.100 
I have a way of getting this resolved

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
here we have the I believe this is going

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.550 
here we have the I believe this is going

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.320 
to be the main page so far I'm not sure
how<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.740> use<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:37.250> know<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.850> actually<00:04:38.150> what's

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
manuals now the manuals I do believe

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.850

that<00:05:38.330> they're<00:05:38.480> gonna<00:05:38.570> be<00:05:38.750> mostly<00:05:39.200> in<00:05:39.410> Chinese

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
that they're gonna be mostly in Chinese

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.770 
that they're gonna be mostly in Chinese
but<00:05:40.790> that<00:05:40.970> doesn't<00:05:41.240> really<00:05:41.390> bother<00:05:41.570> me

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
but that doesn't really bother me

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.390 
but that doesn't really bother me
because<00:05:42.140> I<00:05:42.380> don't<00:05:42.710> read<00:05:42.830> them<00:05:43.010> anyways

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
because I don't read them anyways

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.970 
because I don't read them anyways
nowadays<00:05:44.180> even<00:05:44.960> a<00:05:45.140> kid<00:05:45.380> knows<00:05:45.560> how<00:05:45.590> to<00:05:45.740> use<00:05:45.830> a
