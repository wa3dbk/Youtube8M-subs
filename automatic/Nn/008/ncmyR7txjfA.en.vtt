incredible the only thing you can really

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.560

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
do is put in a difference put in a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.920 
do is put in a difference put in a
different<00:00:30.929> spring<00:00:31.940> but<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.660> doesn't

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
different spring but really that doesn't

different spring but really that doesn't
wouldn't<00:00:34.260> even<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.590> much<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.520> could

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
wouldn't even do much because you could

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.319 
wouldn't even do much because you could
potentially<00:00:35.790> break<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.630> priming<00:00:37.200> run<00:00:38.329> so

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
