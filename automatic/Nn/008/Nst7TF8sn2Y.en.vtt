about<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.859> knee<00:00:08.040> binding<00:00:08.490> what<00:00:09.210> makes<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.540> knee

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
about the knee binding what makes a knee

about the knee binding what makes a knee
mining<00:00:10.019> special<00:00:10.500> essentially<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.580> two

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
mining special essentially it's two

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.629 
mining special essentially it's two
things<00:00:12.300> number<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.860> most<00:00:14.040> prominent

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
things number one and the most prominent

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.609 
things number one and the most prominent
thing<00:00:14.880> about<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.210> knee<00:00:15.389> binding<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.199> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
thing about this knee binding is that it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.730 
thing about this knee binding is that it
releases<00:00:16.980> laterally<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.449> heel<00:00:18.779> no<00:00:19.560> other

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
releases laterally at the heel no other

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.710 
releases laterally at the heel no other
bond<00:00:20.010> no<00:00:20.250> other<00:00:20.430> modern<00:00:20.850> mining<00:00:21.240> does<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
bond no other modern mining does that

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750 
bond no other modern mining does that
many<00:00:22.350> people<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.220> tyrolia

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
many people think that the tyrolia

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.580 
many people think that the tyrolia
binding<00:00:24.180> did<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.230> didn't

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
binding did that but now that didn't

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
binding did that but now that didn't
release<00:00:25.830> purely<00:00:26.550> latter<00:00:26.789> yet<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> heel<00:00:27.390> some

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
release purely latter yet the heel some

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.779 
release purely latter yet the heel some
people<00:00:28.260> who<00:00:28.320> didn't<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.890> Marta<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
people who didn't think that Marta that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.790 
people who didn't think that Marta that
look<00:00:30.029> turntable<00:00:30.779> does<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
look turntable does that and that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
look turntable does that and that
definitely<00:00:32.340> does<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.640> release<00:00:33.120> laterally<00:00:33.870> at

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
definitely does not release laterally at

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.220 
definitely does not release laterally at
the<00:00:34.200> heel<00:00:35.300> but<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.630> does<00:00:36.870> release

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the heel but this one does release

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.880 
the heel but this one does release
laterally<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> way<00:00:39.629> these<00:00:39.899> findings<00:00:40.320> was

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
laterally and the way these findings was

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
laterally and the way these findings was
developed<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> help<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.170> guy<00:00:43.379> named

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
ski accidents for many many years I

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.310 
ski accidents for many many years I
think<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> University<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
think it's with the University of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.119 
think it's with the University of
Vermont<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.640> he's<00:00:54.449> determined<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.379> many

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
Vermont and he's determined that many

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.709 
Vermont and he's determined that many
ACL<00:00:56.850> tears<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> result<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.879> backward

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
ACL tears are a result of a backward

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
those results in in tears and this is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
those results in in tears and this is

in<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.460> type<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.259> fall<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.920> what's<00:01:32.430> make

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
in that type of fall so that what's make

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
in that type of fall so that what's make
this<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.329> makes<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.689> funny<00:01:33.930> unique<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.619> in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
this what makes this funny unique in in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.490 
this what makes this funny unique in in
a<00:01:35.189> safety<00:01:35.670> perspective<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.780> what's<00:01:37.200> also

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
a safety perspective and what's also

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
a safety perspective and what's also
great<00:01:37.829> about<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.280> funny<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
great about this funny is really the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.319 
great about this funny is really the
performance<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> binding<00:01:40.320> during<00:01:40.710> skiing

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
performance of the binding during skiing

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.170 
performance of the binding during skiing
it<00:01:42.329> has<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> very<00:01:43.140> tight<00:01:44.100> coupling<00:01:44.430> between<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it has a very tight coupling between the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.069 
it has a very tight coupling between the
boot<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> ski<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.450> roll<00:01:48.840> your

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
boot and the ski so when you roll your

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.530 
boot and the ski so when you roll your
boot<00:01:49.290> up<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.619> edge<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.759> ski<00:01:50.970> goes<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
boot up on edge the ski goes with it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810 
boot up on edge the ski goes with it
100%<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.860> were<00:01:52.950> able<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> attain<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
100% and you were able to attain the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.580 
100% and you were able to attain the
high<00:01:54.000> edge<00:01:54.240> therefore<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> better<00:01:54.990> edge<00:01:55.290> hold

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
high edge therefore a better edge hold

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.389 
high edge therefore a better edge hold
on<00:01:56.250> hard<00:01:56.490> snow<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.909> ice<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:58.200> large<00:01:58.979> amount<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
on hard snow and ice a large amount of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.249 
on hard snow and ice a large amount of
elastic<00:01:59.880> travel<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> heat<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> toe

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
elastic travel at the heat at the toe

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.160 
elastic travel at the heat at the toe
piece<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.130> heel<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.509> reduces

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
piece and the heel so that that reduces

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.359 
piece and the heel so that that reduces
the<00:02:04.920> chance<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.430> premature<00:02:06.210> release<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:07.369> so
