 home premium the included video memory 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.239
 of 4 gb of ram 500 gb hard drive and so 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.640
 it is medium but the computer in this way 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.920
 let's start 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 but that I approach in this video we are going to 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.270
 see the front of the box 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.850
 we can only show that he has here 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.230
 The samsung logo or above has good 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.199
 how many features in 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.000
 Equipment specifications from the back 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.000
 we only have again samsung which is a 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.129
 notebook and is from series 3 and below 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.870
 we have a black strip with the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.480
 sideways we only have a few 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.500
 equipment with different colors and by the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.420
 another side we do not have absolutely 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.570
 nothing 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.590
 let's start opening this box 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.490
 we can emphasize that it opens of this 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.220
 way 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.960
 we uncover it and with the first thing that we 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.900
 we find are the molars 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.480
 it's a manual with a war ask 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.700
 that is, calculate and to continue with the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.440
 boxing let's see what we have according to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.760
 distance what is the team itself 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.070
 we can see that it is a computer 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.960
 Pretty pretty with a very texture 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330
 nice to touch I can see that here 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.640
 has the samsung logo that we are going to 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.470
 leave it aside to see what is it 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 that knew the face it fits to stand out God 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.510
 that came with some protections of the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 sides but they were removed by the owners 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.850
 so it's not really in a pure booty 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.770
 she was already raped 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.990
 as next we tell what is with the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.240
 second part of the charger that we are going to 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.820
 watch 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.290
 the pretty small charger let's go let's 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.320
 to leave aside 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.600
 because we have what is the stack 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.740
 you can see that that is tall chubby not 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.740
 of water but very little 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 over here we have what is the second 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.480
 part of the charger that is what goes 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.700
 connected to the wall and what's going 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.319
 connected to the other party 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 I would have absolutely nothing 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:26.560
 box and let's see all feminine why 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.599
 and well let's see the computer 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.819
 we can emphasize that the computer as 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.680
 I told them it 's got a pretty texture 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.390
 pretty good 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.710
 we can see that it's plastic by this 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.960
 sound that makes 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.260
 because we only have the tray of 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.300
 disks two usb ports on this side 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.460
 we have an entry for what are the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.850

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.410
 the fans the port to connect 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.490
 and the internet port 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.490
 let's open it 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.220
 It is also pretty inside 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.360
 has an island type keyboard 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.030
 here we have what are the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.599
 characteristics over here we have a 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.780
 4 forgiveness screen 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.690
 here we have what is the camera 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.370
 and what is the touch pad in touch pad the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.190
 it's really good to touch by 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.040
 end well divided and as I said here 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.050
 what the keyboard button 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.540
 on and off 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.540
 we will urge what is the stack 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.450
 fucking mother 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.940
 one hand a boat 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.520
 say 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.410
 already of its respective click and at the time 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:59.160
 feels much heavier 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:02.730
 and well this has been the manuals of the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.720
