00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.680 

which<00:00:30.600> hits<00:00:30.780> the<00:00:30.930> ground<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.530> so<00:00:32.539> here's<00:00:33.539> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
which hits the ground like so here's the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.540 
which hits the ground like so here's the
bottom<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.199> little<00:00:34.560> bottom<00:00:34.950> coming<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.370> here

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
bottom a little bottom coming up here

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:47.750 
bottom a little bottom coming up here
and<00:00:38.550> his<00:00:38.730> little<00:00:38.970> flippers<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> back

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.180 

well<00:00:48.329> that's<00:00:48.480> making<00:00:48.780> Lina's<00:00:49.500> head<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:49.920> back

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
well that's making Lina's head way back

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
well that's making Lina's head way back
actually<00:00:50.670> I'd<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.540> Molina's<00:00:51.870> heads

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
actually I'd like to have Molina's heads

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.130 
actually I'd like to have Molina's heads
way<00:00:52.200> back<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.420> like<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:56.570> now<00:00:57.570> all<00:00:57.900> of<00:00:58.020> his

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
way back and like so now all of his

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
way back and like so now all of his
hands<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.530> front<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.739> his<00:00:58.829> face<00:00:58.980> instead<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
hands in front of his face instead I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.160 
hands in front of his face instead I
think<00:01:00.540> that<00:01:00.660> might<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.900> little<00:01:01.079> more

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
think that might be a little more

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:15.420 
think that might be a little more
expressive<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.829> him

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.330 

yeah<00:01:16.030> that's<00:01:16.180> better<00:01:16.560> yeah

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.850 

and<00:01:21.909> now<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.390> lien<00:01:22.720> ratio<00:01:23.439> in<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> back

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
and now that lien ratio in the back

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.340 
and now that lien ratio in the back
makes<00:01:24.610> more<00:01:24.759> sense<00:01:25.090> here's<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.659> split<00:01:25.960> lip<00:01:26.110> he's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
makes more sense here's a split lip he's

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.160 
makes more sense here's a split lip he's
got<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> little<00:01:26.710> bit<00:01:26.829> of<00:01:26.920> split<00:01:27.159> lip<00:01:31.020> he's<00:01:32.020> got<00:01:32.140> a

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
got a little bit of split lip he's got a

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.300 
got a little bit of split lip he's got a
round<00:01:32.380> head<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:32.860> almost<00:01:33.070> like<00:01:33.280> a

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
round head that it's almost like a

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.620 
round head that it's almost like a
rounded<00:01:33.820> square<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.600> say<00:01:34.840> have<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.020> round<00:01:35.259> head

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
rounded square I say have a round head

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.749
