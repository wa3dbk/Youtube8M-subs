00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello my name is jim pansa and you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.940
 see ten facts about the rocket league 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.809
 Maybe you should not know her yet 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.340
 I do not need anything rock-solid 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.990
 Great to imagine the game fits 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.670
 here perfectly into our season purely 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.440
 I mean, it came out in the summer 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.570
 actually totally shitty time for 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.789
 to release a computer game sims 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 but it's just the perfect time in 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.880
 all are now waiting in principle only 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 on what happens after gamescom 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.720
 so speak now in the fall or then 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.160
 also at the end of the year and until then 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.779
 Maybe one or the other will come 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.850
 Another interesting game but I bet 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.660
 hardly anyone had a rocket league with you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 on the screen 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 fact number one the spectator mode yes 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.960
 it should give a spectator mode 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.219
 however, he did not get it now 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.989
 release and I think that then we will 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.730
 just the right thing to cheer on 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.379
 for example, if you just at 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.930
 want to watch a game or 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.820
 accordingly at matches below 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.440
 Just look at friends or friends 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.300
 then stop later under tournaments 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 The thing is not for nothing synonymous with 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.829
 the esl very high already in the course 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.640
 been so splatter mode we come 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.100
 can look forward to it 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
 at fact number two of the map editor 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 is not excluded is probably 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.830
 currently being discussed with the developers 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.360
 is not sure if the thing is now 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.950
 really could come in or not 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.000
 but of course I would 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.979
 I had a few times with the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.229
 streams said maps wish the offside 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.490
 this typical stadium images are 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.560
 For example, sometimes with a few 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 Objects that are in the way, yes, the ones around 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.530
 must play ok fact number three ross 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 play pc against ps4 is currently not 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.189
 directly possible so speak you can 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.130
 currently not against your friends on the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.200
 ps4 also play that should come later 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.720
 this feature will be so later 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 be installed at the fact number four 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.119
 different day and night 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.470
 conditions so speaks the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 weather conditions or just keep that it 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.100
 day or night is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.259
 So yes it's already in the game in it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.000
 and actually it does not matter in principle 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.229
 whether in the stadium because for example at 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.549
 Floodlight plays or on something like that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.770
 a strange lawn then stop 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.390
 night because actually lit, of course 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.000
 everything and even that should be 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.610
 The next one will be expanded further 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.409
 asks controller mouse and keyboard the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.969
 Developers actually prefer the ps4 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.649
 controller to play so mouse and 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.360
 keyboard is also supported 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.350
 I have it honest 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.330
 not even once 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.369
 tried but to play on pc 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.930
 you should be one then 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.850
 controller so I personally 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.400
 so have a very simple replica 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.750
 controller for I think 17 euro I have 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.430
 take a look at the video description 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.440
 not packaged cheapest at amazon 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.120
 I found who of you that particle 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.410
 should order thing to know if that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.130
 ding or if I can get you out of there 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.680
 should take 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.420
 bern the next follows bed recorder 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 or cinema mode have already seen that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.770
 yes there is a recorder or in the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.600
 cinema mode is actually the thing 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.430
 completely self-explanatory the recorder 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.870
 takes in principle all matches and 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.400
 What then is cool about it is like you 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.410
 for example, call of duty too 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.630
 one knows the camera positions the 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.190
 view and everything completely free 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.600
 So determining is not just about 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.459
 screen recording of what is here 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.680
 but you can also 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.780
 so that the most diverse cinematics 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.040
 or similar effects then keep up 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.050
 make the next nude price sonic 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.940
 2x bronze pronounce sonics so that 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.620
 Entwicklerstudio wanted rocket league 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.150
 already published so long ago 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.070
 Game has been over and over again 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.600
 held back to the back 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.340
 was repeatedly polished 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.540
 new features built in or just 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.670
 other things with the one not yet so 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.680
 is completely satisfied and that is what it stands for 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.870
 Entwicklerstudio yes I say take 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.380
 already a relatively unique situation here 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.670
 was other studios really big 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.200
 for example, the name I now here 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.910
 do not want to pronounce the bring yes 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.519
 I like to play in a stadium 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.959
 to the market if the crowd then later 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.830
 just say something like that, well then 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.500
 You know what I mean 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.660
 Dynamic ground properly belongs to mature 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.700
 should originally imprints or even 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.019
 leave traces on the ground and 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.860
 Of course, those tracks would have 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.660
 again influence on the driving behavior 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.459
 the other player or of course 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.540
 one had even so speaks a 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.459
 leave a small paddock 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.630
 but luckily this feature became so 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.980
 not in the finished game with 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.390
 I could, however, take over 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.310
 Imagine that maybe something like that 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.380
 later then again about a dlc 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.540
 at single maps or a complete 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.870
 own mode then stop with one 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.690
 dazed why was there already the first 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.550
 rocket league cake yes we can now 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.100
 to die in peace and the most important 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.680
 factor now at the very end all maps and 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.510
 dlcs should also be free in the future 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.400
 stay if they still follow 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.440
 so at Sonicwall already stressed several times 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.000
 that you do not split the community 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.700
 and that means that all new 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.350
 contents stay free as always 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.450
 So we should not, but they should 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.070
 keep always free I think 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.720
 personally a super interesting thing 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.430
 However, I have my finger now 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.920
 let's lift it up very short because we know 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.320
 from the talks or contracts 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.940
 between apple and sony for example 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.800
 that it then determined that 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.470
 markings are so speak for 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.470
 a game only a certain number of 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.450
 free things can come out and 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.260
 then accordingly I may 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.880
 am curious 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.470
 I stay on the ball my name is Jim 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.730
 Thanks a lot for looking at this 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.720
 videos if you liked it 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.250
 I write about a rating and 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.310
 Of course, comments if the 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.960
 own fucked up file x hereby in 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.490
 comments in and I'll watch 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.490
 I can make something out of it, too
