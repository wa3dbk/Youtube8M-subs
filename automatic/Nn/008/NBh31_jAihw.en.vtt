home<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.840> my<00:02:50.020> reference<00:02:50.200> points<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.770> see

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
home but as my reference points to see

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.040 
home but as my reference points to see
if<00:02:51.070> everything's<00:02:51.370> lined<00:02:51.580> up<00:02:51.730> straight<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.390> as

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
if everything's lined up straight and as

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.360 
if everything's lined up straight and as
you're<00:02:53.320> putting<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.650> down<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:53.980> feel<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
you're putting it down you can feel the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.730 
you're putting it down you can feel the
edge<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.210> can<00:02:55.300> see<00:02:55.600> if<00:02:55.930> you're<00:02:56.080> standing

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
edge and you can see if you're standing

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.430 
edge and you can see if you're standing
directly<00:02:56.890> over<00:02:57.400> if<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.090> all<00:02:58.240> lined<00:02:58.420> up<00:02:58.690> so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
directly over if it's all lined up so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.080 
directly over if it's all lined up so
that's<00:02:59.680> how<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.920> get<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.280> all<00:03:00.400> lined<00:03:00.670> up<00:03:00.850> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that's how you get it all lined up and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.390 
that's how you get it all lined up and
aligned<00:03:01.960> correctly<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:03.010> best<00:03:03.190> way<00:03:03.370> to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
aligned correctly in the best way to

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.460 
aligned correctly in the best way to
just<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:04.090> do<00:03:04.210> it<00:03:04.240> in<00:03:04.510> my<00:03:04.630> opinion<00:03:04.990> there's

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
just to do it in my opinion there's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.600 
just to do it in my opinion there's
other<00:03:05.680> ways<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:05.950> do<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.220> work<00:03:06.370> for<00:03:06.490> other

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
other ways to do it that work for other

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.760 
other ways to do it that work for other
people<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.210> what<00:03:07.390> works<00:03:07.660> for<00:03:07.900> me<00:03:08.350> almost

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
people this is what works for me almost

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.620 
people this is what works for me almost
every<00:03:08.950> time<00:03:09.160> so<00:03:09.490> this<00:03:09.670> next<00:03:09.880> part<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.390> actually

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
every time so this next part is actually

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.720 
every time so this next part is actually
the<00:03:10.870> probably<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.530> worst<00:03:11.710> part<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.220> working

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
the probably the worst part is working

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.420 
the probably the worst part is working
out<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.910> bubbles<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.600> then<00:03:14.350> seeing<00:03:14.680> if<00:03:15.010> any

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
out the bubbles and then seeing if any

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.000 
out the bubbles and then seeing if any
actual<00:03:15.910> dust<00:03:16.330> got<00:03:16.990> stuck<00:03:17.320> between<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.800> glass

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
actual dust got stuck between the glass

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.530 
actual dust got stuck between the glass
and<00:03:18.040> screen<00:03:18.550> protectors<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.180> go<00:03:19.300> ahead<00:03:19.450> and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
and screen protectors so go ahead and

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.150 
and screen protectors so go ahead and
work<00:03:19.630> out<00:03:19.780> those<00:03:19.930> bubbles<00:03:20.290> if<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:20.950> see

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
work out those bubbles if you see

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160 
work out those bubbles if you see
anything<00:03:21.370> left<00:03:21.610> over<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.810> see<00:03:22.960> a<00:03:22.990> little

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
anything left over and you see a little

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.350 
anything left over and you see a little
speck<00:03:23.350> inside<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.220> middle<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.820> usually

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
speck inside the middle that usually

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.300 
speck inside the middle that usually
indicates<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.960> it's<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.530> piece<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.830> dust<00:03:27.040> and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
indicates that it's a piece of dust and

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.580 
indicates that it's a piece of dust and
we'll<00:03:27.550> cross<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.450> bridge<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:28.990> a<00:03:29.050> second<00:03:29.470> if

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
we'll cross that bridge in a second if

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.260 
we'll cross that bridge in a second if
this<00:03:29.800> happens<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.310> me<00:03:30.460> so<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.850> looks<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.150> I

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270

bubbles<00:04:01.480> being<00:04:01.870> worked<00:04:02.050> out<00:04:02.200> go<00:04:02.440> ahead<00:04:02.530> and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
bubbles being worked out go ahead and

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.560 
bubbles being worked out go ahead and
remove<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.220> second<00:04:03.610> layer<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:07.120> second

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
remove this second layer the second

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.070 
remove this second layer the second
layer<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.810> not<00:04:07.959> even<00:04:08.260> wanted<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.590> stake<00:04:09.370> and

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
layer is not even wanted to stake and

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.390 
layer is not even wanted to stake and
remove<00:04:11.080> if<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.620> could<00:04:11.770> see<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.100> other<00:04:12.130> side

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
remove if you could see the other side

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.199 
remove if you could see the other side
of<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.730> camera

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
of the camera

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:23.420 
of the camera
I<00:04:13.390> am<00:04:13.570> literally<00:04:13.900> doing<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.350> s<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:15.720> H

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.969 

so<00:04:24.430> normally<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.960> first<00:04:26.169> time<00:04:26.320> this

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
so normally this is the first time this

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.300 
so normally this is the first time this
has<00:04:27.160> ever<00:04:27.370> happened<00:04:28.470> here<00:04:29.470> we<00:04:29.560> go<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.949> got<00:04:30.190> it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
has ever happened here we go I got it

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.270 
has ever happened here we go I got it
off<00:04:30.509> this<00:04:31.509> is<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.080> show<00:04:32.139> you<00:04:32.410> how<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.770> and

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
off this is just to show you how to and

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.010 
off this is just to show you how to and
so<00:04:33.490> I'm<00:04:33.699> not<00:04:33.850> really<00:04:34.240> doing<00:04:34.389> a<00:04:34.479> review<00:04:34.720> on<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
so I'm not really doing a review on the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.529 
so I'm not really doing a review on the
screen<00:04:35.440> protector<00:04:35.590> itself<00:04:36.310> but<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.360> how

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
screen protector itself but this is how

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.290 
screen protector itself but this is how
you<00:04:37.570> do<00:04:37.930> it<00:04:40.710> but<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:41.740> will<00:04:41.979> give<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.300> couple

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
you do it but I will give a couple

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.779 
you do it but I will give a couple
minutes<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.440> what<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.830> think<00:04:45.130> about<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.520> screen

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
minutes of what I think about the screen

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.070 
minutes of what I think about the screen
protector<00:04:45.910> so<00:04:46.509> far<00:04:46.810> not<00:04:47.800> really<00:04:47.830> good<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:50.020> I

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
protector so far not really good and I

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.510 
protector so far not really good and I
was<00:04:50.169> actually<00:04:50.350> interested<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:51.009> see<00:04:51.160> how<00:04:51.310> this

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
was actually interested to see how this

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.279 
was actually interested to see how this
would<00:04:51.729> work<00:04:51.759> because<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.570> iPhone<00:04:52.780> has<00:04:53.259> a

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
would work because the iPhone has a

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.740 
would work because the iPhone has a
curve<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.889> display<00:04:54.310> now<00:04:54.520> or<00:04:55.030> just<00:04:55.360> round<00:04:55.630> it

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
curve to display now or just round it

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.230 
curve to display now or just round it
off<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:57.190> was<00:04:57.460> kind<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:57.669> wondering<00:04:57.789> how<00:04:58.060> that

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
off and I was kind of wondering how that

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.610 
off and I was kind of wondering how that
did<00:04:58.419> so<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.720> screen<00:04:58.900> protector<00:04:59.020> doesn't<00:04:59.560> go

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
did so the screen protector doesn't go

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.110 
did so the screen protector doesn't go
all<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.860> way<00:04:59.889> to<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.160> edge<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.639> iPhone

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
all the way to the edge of the iPhone

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.360 
all the way to the edge of the iPhone
like<00:05:01.690> I've<00:05:01.840> seen<00:05:01.990> with<00:05:02.169> previous<00:05:02.620> models<00:05:03.010> but

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
like I've seen with previous models but

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.279 
like I've seen with previous models but
that<00:05:03.789> is<00:05:03.970> how<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.300> install<00:05:04.750> a<00:05:05.050> screen

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
that is how you install a screen

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.430 
that is how you install a screen
