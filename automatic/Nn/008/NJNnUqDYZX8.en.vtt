what<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.159> up<00:00:02.280> guys<00:00:02.310> Jackie<00:00:02.879> come<00:00:03.179> on<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> pixel

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
what is up guys Jackie come on a pixel

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:04.760 
what is up guys Jackie come on a pixel
and<00:00:03.780> today<00:00:03.959> I'm<00:00:04.049> gonna<00:00:04.140> show<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.440> how<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.589> use

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
and today I'm gonna show you how to use

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.680 
and today I'm gonna show you how to use
the<00:00:04.890> walkie-talkie<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.700> dayz<00:00:05.940> standalone<00:00:06.120> so

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
the walkie-talkie in dayz standalone so

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.720 
the walkie-talkie in dayz standalone so
the<00:00:06.779> walkie-talkie<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> 2-way<00:00:08.130> short-range

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the walkie-talkie is a 2-way short-range

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.549 
the walkie-talkie is a 2-way short-range
radio<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.900> can<00:00:10.050> select<00:00:10.200> through

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
radio and you can select through

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.200 
radio and you can select through
different<00:00:10.889> frequencies<00:00:11.490> but<00:00:11.639> how<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> work<00:00:12.059> it

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
different frequencies but how to work it

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.330 
different frequencies but how to work it
is<00:00:12.330> basically<00:00:13.230> get<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> 9-volt<00:00:13.830> battery<00:00:14.160> with

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
is basically get a 9-volt battery with

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.099 
is basically get a 9-volt battery with
some<00:00:14.490> juice<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.059> put<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.690> into<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
some juice in it put it into the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.660 
some juice in it put it into the
walkie-talkie<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.010> then<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.340> can<00:00:17.490> cycle

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
walkie-talkie and then you can cycle

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.880 
walkie-talkie and then you can cycle
through<00:00:17.880> whatever<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:19.109> frequencies<00:00:19.710> you'd

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
through whatever have frequencies you'd

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.960 
through whatever have frequencies you'd
like<00:00:20.070> there's<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.400> five<00:00:20.789> different

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
like there's about five different

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
like there's about five different
frequencies<00:00:21.689> which<00:00:21.840> makes<00:00:22.109> very<00:00:22.410> formidable

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
frequencies which makes very formidable

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.859 
frequencies which makes very formidable
for<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.340> choosing<00:00:23.670> what<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.789> want<00:00:23.880> what

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
for you know choosing what you want what

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.060 
for you know choosing what you want what
if<00:00:24.960> other<00:00:25.109> people<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> walkie-talkie

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
if other people have a walkie-talkie

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.740 
if other people have a walkie-talkie
they<00:00:26.550> will<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.849> able<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> switch<00:00:27.269> into<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
they will be able to switch into the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.919 
they will be able to switch into the
frequency<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.439> listen<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.939> basically

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
frequency and listen to you so basically

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.200 
frequency and listen to you so basically
start<00:00:31.289> using<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.679> turn<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.059> will

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
start using it turn it on and that will

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.819 
start using it turn it on and that will
mean<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.960> start<00:00:34.200> receiving<00:00:34.500> and

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
mean that you can start receiving and

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.280 
mean that you can start receiving and
giving<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:35.340> transmissions<00:00:36.050> please<00:00:37.050> note

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
when you actually don't have it sort of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.840 
when you actually don't have it sort of
using<00:00:39.960> other<00:00:40.950> people<00:00:41.219> will<00:00:41.340> be<00:00:41.370> able<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.670> hear

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
using other people will be able to hear

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
using other people will be able to hear
it<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:43.020> Bill<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.590> very

you're not using a any other talk thing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810 
you're not using a any other talk thing
um<00:00:49.260> otherwise<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.460> settings

um otherwise going into your settings
and<00:00:50.940> actually<00:00:51.239> setting<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> thing<00:00:51.899> for

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and actually setting a thing for

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.689 
and actually setting a thing for
previous<00:00:52.440> channel<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.890> next<00:00:53.250> channel<00:00:53.550> I

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
previous channel and next channel I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.590 
previous channel and next channel I
would<00:00:53.850> si<00:00:54.449> maybe<00:00:54.780> yeah<00:00:55.309> dot<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.610> comma

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
would si maybe yeah dot or comma

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
would si maybe yeah dot or comma
whatever<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.320> choose<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> here<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> place<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
whatever you choose so here I place the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
whatever you choose so here I place the
walkie-talkie<00:01:01.170> onto<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> floor<00:01:01.920> while

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
walkie-talkie onto the floor while

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.429 
walkie-talkie onto the floor while
turned<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> certain<00:01:03.570> frequency<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
turned on and on a certain frequency and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.710 
turned on and on a certain frequency and
I<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.070> my<00:01:05.189> body<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.640> radio<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
I get my body to radio in on that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 
I get my body to radio in on that
frequency<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.369> hear<00:01:08.700> him

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
frequency and we can actually hear him

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
frequency and we can actually hear him
and<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.450> works<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> same<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and this works the same as if you have a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
and this works the same as if you have a
radio<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.580> body<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.479> probably<00:01:12.900> behind

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
radio on on your body so probably behind

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.359 
radio on on your body so probably behind

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
walkie-talkie but hey you know it's a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.950 
walkie-talkie but hey you know it's a
nice<00:01:26.070> feature<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.670> anyway<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.840> is

nice feature to have in anyway and it is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
nice feature to have in anyway and it is
pretty<00:01:28.170> cool<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.560> bait<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> want<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> use
