00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.188
 In this way, Shao Shao came to the center of the mainland, in the holy valley in the middle of his empire. 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.886
 Unloaded all the heavy emperor's heart like a mirror. 

00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:21.363
 In the valley, his people searched for refuge. 

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:30.755
 They know that the end of the world is coming. They cried and asked their emperor to save them! 

00:01:31.014 --> 00:01:43.009
 Shao Shao announced: "Pandaria's people! Calm down. Stay focused. We can spend this difficult time together." 

00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:47.264
 However, his people did not understand. 

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:54.938
 Shao Yu saw the burden he had overcome from their faces. 

00:01:55.062 --> 00:02:04.909
 He recognized doubt and despair. His people are full of fear, or tremble in anger. 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.320
 The emperor was shocked that they did not have time to learn the lessons he had learned. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.195
 He thought: "Time, my people need time." 

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:30.590
 At that time, the emperor remembered the teachings that Yuxi gave him. 

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:37.658
 "You have to find the heart of Pandaria, and the answer is there." 

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:47.953
 Shao Shao recalled that during his journey, he once looked at the earth and saw a petal in the wind. 

00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:56.859
 He thought to himself: "No matter what the difficulties are, the earth always guides me..." 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:12.145
 "But the most authentic answer always comes from... the heart." Shao Yu suddenly realized. 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:22.795
 "I should have an empire with longevity and prosperity. But I am not just an emperor." 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:33.126
 "I know what to do now...because I am the heart of Pandaria." 

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:47.116
 Shao Shao declared: "Pandaria's people! You are not ready to face this storm." 

00:03:47.381 --> 00:04:03.122
 "I can't stop it. But you will get through this many storms with the future, because I will give you time to learn the lessons I have learned!" 

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:23.904
 Then, the last emperor of Pandaria sacrificed what he had and what he had in the future, giving the last breath to the earth. 

00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:37.490
 A thick fog surrounds and protects his empire... 

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:48.427
 When the rest of the world fell apart due to the big bang, Pandaria was spared. 

00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:57.414
 Under the hiding of Shao's breath, it drifted into the ocean... just like the petals in the wind. 

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:13.325
 The flowers in the valley continue to bloom. Over time, our pandaren learned the emperor's way of life. 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:24.464
 The temple here inherits his teachings. He is still watching us on the snowy peaks of Kunle Peak. 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:34.855
 It is said that as long as you listen carefully, you can still hear his whispering to us in the fog. 

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:44.354
 This is the gift given by the emperor... 

00:05:44.713 --> 00:05:49.785
 This is Pandaria!
