predecessor<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.410> only<00:03:08.650> difference<00:03:09.010> is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
predecessor with the only difference is

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.220 
predecessor with the only difference is
that<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.610> red<00:03:09.790> team's<00:03:10.060> costume<00:03:10.630> has<00:03:10.840> four

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.789 
appendages instead of spider-man's three
I<00:03:15.030> see<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.269> I<00:03:16.299> guess<00:03:16.570> there's<00:03:16.900> two<00:03:17.590> different

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
I see so I guess there's two different

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.069 
I see so I guess there's two different
types<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.310> iron<00:03:18.940> spider<00:03:19.180> man<00:03:19.360> suits<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.989> will

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
types of iron spider man suits and will

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.520 
types of iron spider man suits and will
explain<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.440> four<00:03:20.940> individual<00:03:21.940> legs<00:03:22.530> for

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
explain the four individual legs for

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.410 
explain the four individual legs for
articulation<00:03:24.250> his<00:03:24.579> head<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:25.030> on<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> ball<00:03:25.239> joint

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
articulation his head is on a ball joint

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.789 
articulation his head is on a ball joint
so<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.260> does<00:03:26.500> go<00:03:27.070> completely<00:03:27.519> 360<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:29.590> goes<00:03:29.769> up

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
so it does go completely 360 it goes up

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.039 
so it does go completely 360 it goes up
and<00:03:30.130> down<00:03:31.440> for<00:03:32.440> his<00:03:32.560> arms<00:03:32.920> they<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.400> go<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.660> and
