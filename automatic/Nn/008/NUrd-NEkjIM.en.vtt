Dragon Ball super really reminds me a
lot<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.959> lot<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.140> ways<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.790> one<00:02:49.090> which<00:02:49.630> I

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
lot in a lot of ways of that one which I

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.930 
lot in a lot of ways of that one which I
really<00:02:50.349> like<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:50.920> that's<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.220> good<00:02:51.400> thing<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.760> my

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
really like so that's a good thing in my

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.979 
really like so that's a good thing in my
opinion<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.989> animation<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:54.099> this<00:02:54.849> is<00:02:55.120> quite

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
opinion the animation of this is quite

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.960 
opinion the animation of this is quite
honestly<00:02:56.379> not<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.099> greatest<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.640> could<00:02:57.790> be

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
honestly not the greatest it could be

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.449 
honestly not the greatest it could be
it's<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.599> terrible<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.650> gets<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.160> job<00:03:00.190> done

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
it's not terrible it gets the job done

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.640 
it's not terrible it gets the job done
it'll<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.569> interesting<00:03:01.870> since<00:03:02.230> there<00:03:02.470> wasn't

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
it'll be interesting since there wasn't

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.190 
it'll be interesting since there wasn't
many<00:03:02.950> action<00:03:03.459> sequences<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.390> episode

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
many action sequences in this episode

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.809 
many action sequences in this episode
it'll<00:03:05.410> be<00:03:05.500> interesting<00:03:05.739> how<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.160> animation

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
it'll be interesting how the animation

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.759 
it'll be interesting how the animation
will<00:03:06.970> be<00:03:07.000> later<00:03:07.750> on<00:03:07.959> especially<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.590> very

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
will be later on especially in very

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.000 
will be later on especially in very
action<00:03:09.340> intensive<00:03:09.970> scenes<00:03:10.720> but<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.650> guess<00:03:11.829> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
action intensive scenes but I guess the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.190 
action intensive scenes but I guess the
biggest<00:03:12.040> knock<00:03:12.940> even<00:03:13.480> though<00:03:13.569> I<00:03:13.599> did<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:14.049> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
biggest knock even though I did have the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.020 
biggest knock even though I did have the
warm<00:03:14.440> fuzzies<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.430> was<00:03:15.549> gonna<00:03:15.760> get<00:03:16.000> a

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
warm fuzzies and I was gonna get a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.670 
warm fuzzies and I was gonna get a
little<00:03:16.239> emotional<00:03:16.600> because<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.109> was<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.290> Dragon

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
little emotional because I was a Dragon

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.039 
little emotional because I was a Dragon
Ball<00:03:17.829> fan<00:03:18.239> watching<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.359> for<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.510> first<00:03:19.780> time

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
Ball fan watching it for the first time

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.440 
Ball fan watching it for the first time
I<00:03:20.380> guess<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:20.920> biggest<00:03:21.130> knock<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.880> could<00:03:22.150> really

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
I guess the biggest knock I could really

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.349 
I guess the biggest knock I could really
give<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.980> beginning<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
give is that in the beginning of the

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.599 
give is that in the beginning of the
episode<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:26.230> had<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> flashback<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.430> what

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
episode they had a flashback of what

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.849 
episode they had a flashback of what
happened<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.180> Buu<00:03:28.359> saga<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.109> they<00:03:29.560> took

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
happened in the Buu saga and they took

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.120 
happened in the Buu saga and they took
clips<00:03:30.400> directly<00:03:30.970> from<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.750> Z<00:03:32.049> anime<00:03:32.799> not

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
clips directly from the Z anime not

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.099 
clips directly from the Z anime not
reanimating<00:03:34.060> these<00:03:34.209> scenes<00:03:34.630> at<00:03:34.840> all<00:03:34.959> they

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
reanimating these scenes at all they

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.009 
reanimating these scenes at all they
just<00:03:35.139> took<00:03:35.470> clips<00:03:36.010> directly<00:03:36.459> from<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.090> which

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
just took clips directly from it which

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.530 
just took clips directly from it which
honestly<00:03:38.620> just<00:03:39.340> seemed<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.609> little<00:03:39.639> lazy<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.359> my

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
honestly just seemed a little lazy in my

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.949 
honestly just seemed a little lazy in my
opinion<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.260> hopefully<00:03:42.239> doesn't<00:03:43.239> become<00:03:43.930> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
opinion and hopefully doesn't become a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.800 
opinion and hopefully doesn't become a
trend<00:03:44.530> in<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.919> series<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.910> that's<00:03:46.419> really

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
trend in this series but that's really

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.199 
trend in this series but that's really
the<00:03:46.930> only<00:03:46.959> knock<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.950> could<00:03:48.190> really<00:03:48.639> give<00:03:49.000> on

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
the only knock I could really give on

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.740 
the only knock I could really give on
this<00:03:49.450> besides<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.739> really<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.940> looks<00:03:51.970> really

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
this besides that really it looks really

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.140 
this besides that really it looks really

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.020 
Dragon Ball might be a little
disappointed<00:04:00.250> with<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.989> honestly<00:04:03.030> this

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
disappointed with this but honestly this

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.270 
disappointed with this but honestly this
is<00:04:04.269> all<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.959> think<00:04:05.590> most<00:04:05.829> people<00:04:06.190> will

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
is all I think most people will

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.190 
is all I think most people will
understand<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.299> all<00:04:07.569> setting<00:04:08.049> up

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
understand that this is all setting up

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.020 
understand that this is all setting up
something<00:04:08.620> else<00:04:08.739> Goku's<00:04:09.280> off<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.639> King<00:04:09.849> Kai's

watching<00:06:05.980> this<00:06:06.130> thing<00:06:06.430> which<00:06:06.670> is<00:06:06.880> if<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.930> was

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
watching this thing which is if it was

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.870 
watching this thing which is if it was
kind<00:06:08.290> of<00:06:08.380> similar<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.740> battle<00:06:09.250> of<00:06:09.370> gods<00:06:09.520> when<00:06:09.850> I

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
kind of similar to battle of gods when I

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.370 
kind of similar to battle of gods when I
first<00:06:10.210> watched<00:06:10.480> that<00:06:11.490> but<00:06:13.110> honestly<00:06:14.110> maybe

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
first watched that but honestly maybe

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.280 
first watched that but honestly maybe
even<00:06:14.710> greater<00:06:15.010> because<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:16.480> thing<00:06:16.720> is<00:06:16.990> with

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
even greater because the thing is with

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.290 
even greater because the thing is with
battle<00:06:17.830> of<00:06:17.950> gods<00:06:18.160> when<00:06:18.490> it<00:06:18.610> was<00:06:18.790> over<00:06:19.150> it<00:06:19.270> was

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
battle of gods when it was over it was

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
over it was a movie with this with this

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.040 
over it was a movie with this with this
episode<00:06:22.540> when<00:06:23.050> it<00:06:23.140> was<00:06:23.290> over<00:06:23.680> I<00:06:24.030> no<00:06:25.030> mores<00:06:25.750> to
