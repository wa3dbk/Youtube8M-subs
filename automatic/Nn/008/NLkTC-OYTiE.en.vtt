what noibat turns into so awesome I
really<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.669> is<00:03:41.819> probably<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.269> guy<00:03:42.419> that<00:03:42.450> I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
really this is probably the guy that I

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
instead of like dragon balls or

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.180 
instead of like dragon balls or
something<00:03:46.030> which<00:03:46.420> is<00:03:46.540> really<00:03:46.780> really<00:03:47.260> weird<00:03:47.500> I

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190
