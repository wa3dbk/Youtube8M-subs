and<00:03:26.460> I<00:03:26.580> know<00:03:26.760> what's<00:03:27.210> gonna<00:03:27.300> go<00:03:27.420> down<00:03:27.720> with

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and I know what's gonna go down with

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.050

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
suffocation the appropriate level

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.030 
suffocation the appropriate level
depends<00:03:33.960> on<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.140> number<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.410> living<00:03:34.710> objects
