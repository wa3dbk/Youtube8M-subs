00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
are two questions here immediately is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.580 
are two questions here immediately is
whether<00:00:41.570> President<00:00:42.570> Obama<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> consolatory

whether President Obama is consolatory
from<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> point<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.460> view<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> strength<00:00:45.059> or

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
from the point of view of strength or

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.229 
from the point of view of strength or
weakness<00:00:45.890> because<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
weakness because if we think that it is

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.760 
weakness because if we think that it is
from<00:00:48.539> strength<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.500> he's<00:00:49.710> probably

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
from strength then then he's probably

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.560 
from strength then then he's probably
doing<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.610> thing<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.090> he<00:00:51.390> knows

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
doing the right thing because he knows

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
doing the right thing because he knows
perfectly<00:00:52.079> well<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.949> Russians<00:00:53.430> are

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
perfectly well that the Russians are

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
perfectly well that the Russians are
touchy<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.210> certain<00:00:54.660> matters<00:00:54.809> whether<00:00:55.230> their

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
touchy on certain matters whether their

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
touchy on certain matters whether their
superpower<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.280> whether<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
superpower that whether they have this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.970 
superpower that whether they have this
and<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> whether<00:00:58.199> their<00:00:58.440> military

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and that whether their military

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.939 
and that whether their military
superpower<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.359> he<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.020> probably<00:01:01.079> doing<00:01:01.710> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
superpower so he was probably doing it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.000 
superpower so he was probably doing it
right<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.629> probably<00:01:03.629> even<00:01:03.719> scoring<00:01:04.619> points

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
right and probably even scoring points

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.359 
right and probably even scoring points
in<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.369> certain<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.409> from

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
in a certain way but if we think from

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.429 
in a certain way but if we think from
another<00:01:08.580> point<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.030> view<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.450> he<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.140> doing

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
another point of view that he was doing

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
another point of view that he was doing
it<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.830> point<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.130> view<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.490> weakness

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it from a point of view a weakness

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.230 
it from a point of view a weakness
meaning<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.110> he<00:01:13.320> still<00:01:13.740> has<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.220> talk<00:01:15.060> about

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
meaning that he still has to talk about

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
meaning that he still has to talk about
the<00:01:15.659> money<00:01:16.140> side<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> things<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.369> Putin
