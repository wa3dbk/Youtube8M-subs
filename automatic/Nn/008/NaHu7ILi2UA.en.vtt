own harness and we recommend you hook it
up<00:01:13.650> directly<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.369> battery<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
up directly to the battery and if you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.320 
up directly to the battery and if you
don't<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> room<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.640> two

harnesses<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.950> recommend

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
harnesses on there then we recommend

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.120 
harnesses on there then we recommend
taking<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.000> SAE<00:01:21.380> harness<00:01:22.380> completely<00:01:22.920> off

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and then using this adapter you can plug

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.420 
and then using this adapter you can plug
this<00:01:26.790> into<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.810> battery<00:01:28.140> harness<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.220> then

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
this into the battery harness and then

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.200 
this into the battery harness and then
plug<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> battery<00:01:30.329> tender<00:01:30.689> into<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:32.210> from

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
plug the battery tender into that from

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
plug the battery tender into that from
here<00:01:34.549> you'll<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:36.060> hook<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.710> heat
