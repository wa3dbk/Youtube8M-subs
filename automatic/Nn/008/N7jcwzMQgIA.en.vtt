billion dollar budget a year is they
have<00:01:01.980> demonstrated<00:01:02.899> what<00:01:03.899> they're<00:01:04.049> capable

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
have demonstrated what they're capable

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.760 
have demonstrated what they're capable
of<00:01:04.589> doing<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.820> them<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.689> said

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
of doing and not only them like I said

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.740

impalas<00:01:18.030> OnStar<00:01:18.720> system<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.950> hear<00:01:20.220> me

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
impalas OnStar system now hear me

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.300 
impalas OnStar system now hear me
this<00:01:21.299> OnStar<00:01:21.900> system<00:01:22.170> doesn't<00:01:22.860> even<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this OnStar system doesn't even have to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.460 
this OnStar system doesn't even have to
be<00:01:23.430> paid<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> doesn't<00:01:24.780> even<00:01:24.930> have<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
be paid for and it doesn't even have to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
be paid for and it doesn't even have to
work<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> hear<00:01:26.430> me<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.630> even<00:01:27.810> have

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
work do you hear me you don't even have

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.710 
work do you hear me you don't even have
to<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.530> an<00:01:28.650> older<00:01:28.979> Impala<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:31.430> OnStar

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
to have an older Impala that has OnStar

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
to have an older Impala that has OnStar
option<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.110> may<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.530> paying<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:36.740> they

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
option you may not be paying for it they

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700 
option you may not be paying for it they
can<00:01:37.950> still<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> same<00:01:38.700> thing<00:01:39.229> they<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.409> tap

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
can still do the same thing they can tap

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.510 
can still do the same thing they can tap
into<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.490> what<00:01:42.390> they<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:43.520> they

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
into it and what they do is they

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.960 
into it and what they do is they
transmit<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> data<00:01:45.509> pack<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.860> confuses<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
transmit a data pack that confuses the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.289 
transmit a data pack that confuses the
internal<00:01:48.420> computers<00:01:49.369> then<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.759> plant<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
internal computers then they plant a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.950 
internal computers then they plant a
malicious<00:01:51.750> bit<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.770> code<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.700> allows<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
malicious bit of code that allows this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350 
malicious bit of code that allows this
whole<00:01:55.229> thing<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.829> reprogrammed<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.149> they

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
whole thing to be reprogrammed so they

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
whole thing to be reprogrammed so they
can<00:01:57.659> control<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.409> control<00:01:58.770> systems<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
can control the control systems on the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.620 
can control the control systems on the
ECU<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:03.479> allows<00:02:03.780> them<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.259> everything

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
ECU this allows them to do everything

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.089 
ECU this allows them to do everything

that's<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.840> let<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.960> be<00:02:17.050> known<00:02:17.080> if<00:02:17.790> DARPA

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that's it and let it be known if DARPA

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.570 
that's it and let it be known if DARPA
is<00:02:18.850> pulling<00:02:19.210> this<00:02:19.330> off<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.750> demonstrating<00:02:20.320> it

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
is pulling this off and demonstrating it

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.650 
is pulling this off and demonstrating it
it's<00:02:21.580> very<00:02:21.910> possible<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:25.150> don't<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.480> to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
it's very possible and you don't have to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.960 
it's very possible and you don't have to
look<00:02:25.810> much<00:02:25.990> farther<00:02:26.350> farther<00:02:26.650> than<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.220> okay

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
look much farther farther than this okay

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.690 
look much farther farther than this okay
