00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.460
 here attention power sison coming from 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.090
 that the voltage to turn on and off the 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.460
 TV 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.990
 as I explained when you also had 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.490
 It is low five votes while 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.289
 connected 0 volts 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.660
 this tension will control these three 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.630
 transistors where the transit of 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.199
 up what will feed 16 or not 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.269
 this would be the 26 that is the 6 key of the 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.580
 operation of this part of the source 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.550
 without the video if it is working 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.579
 this part here at the source can work 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.350
 cc 1 26 that part of the source does not work 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.110
 It does not work and get itv 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.730
 off when there is power sison sound 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.860
 is in 5 volts 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.020
 this traffic or from below leads to 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.440
 waste collector voltage goes to zero and 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.289
 depolarizing that 16 than 16 receives 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.620
 19 volts and does not let out any voltage 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.989
 pupil 16 of his 26 from that part of the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.660
 source is turned off completely when the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.880
 power sison voltage has 10 volt 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.280
 traffic is from below failing to drive 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.410
 attention of the collector increases and hence 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.080
 polarizes base than 16 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.280
 hence the eldest of 19 votes comes out 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.610
 of it and food pin 9 of 26 and there the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.070
 traffic source is that 18 serves 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.659
 to connect pin 9 of 26 to ground 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.509
 when TV is in standby condition 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.180
 these neighborhoods and 26 is actually a 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.400
 double oscillator of pwm or of wave 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.579
 square and one of the signs out 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.409
 by pin 10 and another exit by pin 7 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.119
 of pin 10 passes through these two 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.540
 transistors that gives a resulting gain 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.750
 a married couple and go key to the gate of that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.310
 that the other leaves at least seven passes 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.360
 on the other to a married couple 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.219
 due and will switch to the gate than 24 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.040
 Now we're going to talk about you . 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.990
 that 19 and said that 24 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.240
 here we would need a transistor 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.670
 the pain that you know the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.280
 The best players are freights 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.220
 only that there is a small problem here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.080
 of space I have to put Mosfet 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.270
 the size of those used in the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.160
 and normal tv only here not 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.500
 space for it so that the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.070
 manufacturer did he put a ce 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.490
 eight terminals and inside the 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.820
 these 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.090
 we have one of the fat this kid owns 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.090
 three terminals in the teacher's and 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.220
 four terminals going to training because 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.560
 so if you had a terminal only 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.140
 to source a terminal only for training 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.110
 the excess current between the ores 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.540
 drain could heat up a part 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.610
 and it ends up burning or it ends up 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.230
 inventing the tracks because due to 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.280
 space, the trails here should be 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 reduced 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.380
 then switched television source 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.230
 lcd lcd monitors you will find 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.570
 these mosfets components than in the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.210
 truth is a fat one that has three 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.650
 teacher and teacher 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.270
 terminals in the problem 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.940
 so they can better divide the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.760
 current and not overheats both the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.850
 component then these fat symbols 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.820
 observe that the 19 volts entered the 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.310
 terminals and leaves the terminals 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.990
 the training session and if there is a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.780
 channel and neither that which the voltage 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.630
 between the 11 and out of the drama all serves 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.570
 in the gate between the square wave dossier or 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.090
 26 we already talked and then he switched 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.270
 he keeps switching on and off when he 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.850
 A chain passes through this coil 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.300
 here in this piece and loads ska 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.290
 pastor to 5-volt attention when 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.730
 it cuts or the energy stored in the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.610
 magnetic field coil 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.050
 keeps the capacitor charged with 5 volts 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.390
 So I realize that I'm always going to have five 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.610
 votes here on the capacitor is when the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.270
 fat when it is when it cuts 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.220
 already that diode of 35 that has this symbol 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.310
 really weird here is a 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.840
 Special game called another mall 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.270
 of the shock that is nothing more than the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.060
 then how fast is it 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.100
 works then we see that when the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.380
 fat leads the current passes through the coil 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.359
 creates a magnetic field when it cuts 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.590
 the magnetic field come to attention that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.930
 bear the shepherd 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.140
 only the reverse voltage back pupo c 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.910
 can burn mosfet then at the time the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.390
 cis for driving the voltage 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.090
 reverse could go bad little out of 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.310
 This game gets into driving and kills this 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.139
 There's sound so CeI can not burn. 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.169
 therefore decided to provide protection 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.180
 we continue fat then here we already have 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.229
 attention of 5 volts that will feed the 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.960
 part of tv 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.819
 this voltage has here a zenner diode 5.6 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.599
 that also a protection if it rises 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.279
 very 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.810
 this money comes in short and leaves no 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.800
 5 volts and burn some later 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.749
 component 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.569
 therefore this source is a reducing source 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:58.659
 of tension has taken seven catches the attention that 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.610
 is 19 volts and through this 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:03.249
 key he can get regular and 5 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.169
 volts and protection kyodo 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.969
 it is clear that if the sinus 26 stops 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.469
 will not have on the square in the 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.960
 gate and if it shows, it will not 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.669
 It works and here it will be all 10 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.250
 now observe a detail in relation to 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.199
 this dorky qsl 73 that is actually a 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.000
 transformer which the winding 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.900
 here and has another regulation in this 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.509
 Score 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.039
 so when fat is leading to 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.860
 coil creates a magnetic field 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.289
 as I said when fat stops 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.629
 driving the magnetic field becomes attention 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.099
 charge the capacitor induces a voltage in the 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.020
 top coil 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.460
 this tension in the upper coil around 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.379
 of 7 thousand volts 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.430
 this voltage of seven turns in a coil of 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.930
 top adds 25 more votes to source 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.080
 results in 12 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.389
 then filtered rectified attention to here 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.430
 diogo chote a fast computing game 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.860
 and results in 12 volts 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.469
 then this circuit reinforces the attention of 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.409
 5 volts coming out of here touch we have 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:01.539
 12 volts passes through this regulator 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.849
 stabilize 9 volts 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.129
 observe that the transformer is 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.139
 used both to get 5 volts for 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.569
 feed a part of the TV as well as to 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.240
 get 9-volt attention to the 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.969
 another step down here the same thing 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.819
 the fat boy gets in the square at the gate 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:22.089
 key when he drives pass currents 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:25.300
 the coil but magnetic energy is 75 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:26.919
 when it cuts off the magnetic energy if 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.270
 transform intention and stay 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.180
 charged capacitor 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.310
 only now with 3.3 volts then this 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.620
 circuit here he switches on a 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.419
 frequency to get 3.3 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.879
 already the top key in another frequency 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:43.419
 to get 5 volts 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:46.269
 the fat protection kodo and here the 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.300
 diode zenner protection is a genre of 

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:50.610
 3.6 volts 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.919
 our attention 3.3 really a 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.050
 curiosity this tension of 3.3 observes 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.000
 that she has more filtrations she'll be 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.759
 used to feed the six largest 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.539
 which in this case is the escaler and the 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.539
 video processor
