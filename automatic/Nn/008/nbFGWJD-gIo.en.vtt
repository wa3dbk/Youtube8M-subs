 information in the description hello to 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.410
 I'm all wind and good filter 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.630
 welcome to a new video of fifa 15 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.620
 new video of trade oy good as 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.820
 I always remember that if you want 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.039
 participate in a draw of 10 thousand 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.120
 coins that I make in each video 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.280
 just be subscribed to my channel 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.769
 like this video and comment something 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.269
 related to today's video and good 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.760
 the new video trade or as I said of 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.019
 trade or thanks to the app that good what 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.550
 I will explain quickly why 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.039
 better many of you do not know what this is 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.089
 the app and well I explain is if a 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.309
 player is having a great season 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.579
 as is the case for example of disk 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.350
 griezmann from the bruijn cassette 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.899
 well i'm going to lesaka an improved version 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 then how are we going to take advantage of this? 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.969
 for example disk has average of 83 I think 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.089
 and your average will be 85 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.549
 85 84 depends as much as she wants on 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.830
 sometimes I get you up at a point sometimes 23 yo 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.439
 I think last year as much as possible 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.939
 I think it was good there was some bronze 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.950
 to banana but those do not interest us 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.530
 especially the golds in the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.630
 golden players who have and made them 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 already have anything but have a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.310
 informal version then for example I 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.460
 I'm dealing with isco which is the one 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.960
 better I see that you can take profit and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.429
 what to do and disk for example 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 As you can see, his shift version has a 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:36.090
 average of 85 if you have to get a version 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.149
 app can raise the average 84-85 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.030
 imagine that you raise the average 85 to 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.360
 normal disk then what it does is that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 their versions in tennis are uploaded 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.270
 also in this case this shift disk 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.149
 it would be 87 in average so imagine the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.310
 price goes up a lot this album I 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.830
 I have signed all for 120 thousand coins 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.569
 Velez said three or four days ago 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 I say all for about 120 thousand coins 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.900
 I have got in this 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.420
 account I have 5 I do not have a 6 because here 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.780
 in players as you see I have another one because 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.600
 I do not fit anymore in the articles without 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.960
 assign or be six discs here discs and 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.330
 all and then I have others in total I have 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.180
 another five in another account or I have 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.210
 eleven albums and they have been signed 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.430
 all to 120 thousand coins and I arrived late 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.230
 because this disc was at 60 thousand 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 I 'm going to show you this page is 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.630
 food min in case you ask and you see that 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.570
 it is 170 thousand coins practically 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.160
 now imagine always disk up going to 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.770
 see I'm going to cover the xbox I always 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.320
 I speak of play 3 you see in the touches 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.230
 was even for 50 thousand coins already 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.050
 better when this album comes out in 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.540
 up that is not safe that 's why this is 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.160
 trader is not 100% sure but it is clear 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.350
 that I think this is going to come out 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.090
 another one that most likely comes out street 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.550
 man the cassette will probably come out 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.650
 also good bruijn I 'm going to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.810
 say everything but in 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.909
 in google or on youtube you have a lot 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.599
 of videos or articles that tell you 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.610
 the app most likely because that 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.860
 good as I say I'm not going to say 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.930
 everything so if you want to know of some 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.610
 player with whom you can treat the 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.370
 searches on youtube you put prediction 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.470
 of app stuff so I already say that there is a 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.299
 lots of videos that people do not 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.340
 making a prediction of the app 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.950
 I already say that isco brightman and the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.019
 cassette probably because they are from the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.329
 main ones or I think they are 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.190
 clear is worth those three I also have a 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.590
 Griezmann around here but I'm not going to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.049
 use me to try to look for example 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.209
 this brightman imagine I have you 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.829
 fixed like me not to two hundred thousand 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.139
 coins east to griezmann yes and look at the 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.609
 price to which it is now I want it 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.260
 for friends when I'm not going to work with him 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.930
 but they look at the price that is now 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.739
 of almost 700 thousand coins yesterday was 700 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.000
 thousand coins and I get it 200,000 and 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.980
 500,000 profit coins for each 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.200
 you can get out but this is the 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.829
 price now it's a bit late for 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.359
 upload it the same as with the Irish 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.250
 it's a bit late but you're still going to 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.070
 get out a lot because this to griezmann 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.570
 aena that this letter is very likely to be 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.840
 is going to put a million and a half or something 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.400
 so you're going to get a lot out yet 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.890
 imagine if you have done it before as 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.080
 I ie 200 thousand coins pass 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.150
 sell it for a million and a half that is 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.760
 a trade or good going to take a few 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.950
 incredible benefits as you see me 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.440
 I already say I recommend doing it with 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.600
 expensive players like griezmann or the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.970
 cassette that you are going to see that is also 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.300
 quite expensive this song 'the shift 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.520
 you see you're 660,000 so it's true that if 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.140
 the swap goes out it may be the most 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.330
 probable it is not practically certain that 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.900
 your app will go out and you will get a million and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.360
 half or more was even going to take 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.050
 but knowing that a lot has been to 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.700
 much less do you see the 170,000 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.790
 I get a bit like I'm not angry 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.650
 spend 500 coins more than what 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.930
 that has been before so it's true 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.600
 as I say that you are going to get more 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.160
 but I'm saying that it's good that I'm not going to 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.360
 dealing with this is simply what 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.090
 do with the disk that is very likely 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.620
 let it out now that if you want to go to no 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.060
 risk doing it with disk though 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.130
 neither is it likely to come out disc up 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.840
 but good disk as you see me 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.919
 tab one hundred twenty thousand coins and it's going 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.080
 for the gloves I think 170 thousand 670 thousand 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.260
 coins that is already won I do not think that 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.930
 go down will not go down and what 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.300
 what is going to be going up and you go up a 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.740
 video warning when they leave these up that 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.330
 I think it 's about the 30th of 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.950
 January about 29 a date like this plus or 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.470
 less good then soon but I 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.180
 I think it 's January 30 and that's when 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.760
 come out on Saturdays upload a video of 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.200
 warning that you have to sell them and 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.880
 at the price at which you have to sell it 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.940
 this I always look at it in football that is 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.740
 a page very very good football good 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.750
 feve and n-ii nothing that of signing players 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.729
 that probably come out in app I say 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.169
 that is not totally safe but good 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.880
 more or less you know what good players 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.590
 go out in app I'm doing everything 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.380
 with isco because the body is not going to 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.910
 sell I have 10 taxpayers in total and if 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.470
 it comes out then imagine the amount of 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.210
 benefit that he could get booked by 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.639
 one hundred and twenty thousand and maybe I'll sell them 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.070
 600 thousand or some incredible benefits 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.849
 will give us disc just like we are going to 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.770
 give 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.879
 all these players that are going to come out 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.599
 in app and have an important version 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:32.029
 so I do not expect anything to be left 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:34.490
 everything clear and if not if you do not have something 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:37.270
 they ask in the comments and nothing 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.270
 greetings and goodbye
