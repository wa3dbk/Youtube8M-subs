00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
to make it happen all at once so it

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.720 
to make it happen all at once so it
might<00:03:02.600> happen<00:03:02.840> like<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.410> Lydia<00:03:04.190> might<00:03:04.489> get

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
to another player who engages too and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.610 
to another player who engages too and
then<00:03:10.069> throws<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.459> ball<00:03:10.880> for<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.360> shot<00:03:11.660> that

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
then throws the ball for the shot that

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.530 
then throws the ball for the shot that
makes<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> defense<00:03:13.400> work<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.819> lot<00:03:14.000> harder<00:03:14.299> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
makes the defense work a lot harder and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.630 
makes the defense work a lot harder and
usually<00:03:15.200> if<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:15.440> engage<00:03:15.620> twice<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.519> row
