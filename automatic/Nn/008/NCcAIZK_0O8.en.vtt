the<00:00:24.740> chassis<00:00:25.160> on<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.369> hot<00:00:25.490> rod<00:00:25.669> is<00:00:25.820> something

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
the chassis on the hot rod is something

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.700 
the chassis on the hot rod is something
we<00:00:26.269> really<00:00:26.599> wanted<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:26.960> do<00:00:27.050> different<00:00:27.529> from

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
we really wanted to do different from

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.370 
we really wanted to do different from
what<00:00:27.859> we've<00:00:28.009> seen<00:00:28.039> out<00:00:28.400> there<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.779> really

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
what we've seen out there and and really

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.560 
what we've seen out there and and really
more<00:00:30.590> towards<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.279> performance<00:00:31.759> end<00:00:32.329> of<00:00:32.480> the

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
more towards the performance end of the

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.509 
more towards the performance end of the
spectrum<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.170> more<00:00:33.379> similar<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.100> what<00:00:34.399> we've

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
spectrum and more similar to what we've

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.189 
spectrum and more similar to what we've
done<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:34.820> past<00:00:34.970> with<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.269> other<00:00:35.420> cars<00:00:35.690> so

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
done in the past with the other cars so

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.319 
done in the past with the other cars so
we<00:00:36.320> really<00:00:36.500> started<00:00:36.920> from<00:00:36.980> scratch<00:00:37.180> built<00:00:38.180> a

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
we really started from scratch built a

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.540 
we really started from scratch built a
space<00:00:38.719> frame<00:00:38.899> chassis<00:00:39.159> designed<00:00:40.159> it<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.370> fit

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
space frame chassis designed it to fit

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.819 
space frame chassis designed it to fit
inside<00:00:40.820> of<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.269> body<00:00:41.449> that<00:00:41.750> we<00:00:41.989> came<00:00:42.620> up<00:00:42.680> with

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
inside of the body that we came up with

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.200 
inside of the body that we came up with
which<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.159> actually<00:00:43.579> a<00:00:43.610> little<00:00:43.730> wider<00:00:44.000> a

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
which is actually a little wider a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.119 
which is actually a little wider a
little<00:00:44.329> lower<00:00:44.690> all<00:00:45.409> for<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.680> same<00:00:45.829> reason<00:00:46.100> to

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
little lower all for the same reason to

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.460 
little lower all for the same reason to
get<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.339> car<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.550> handle<00:00:47.050> get<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.140> chassis

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
get the car to handle get the chassis

our GTM is our challenge cars the front
suspension<00:00:54.110> here<00:00:54.680> we<00:00:54.800> started<00:00:55.159> from<00:00:55.250> scratch

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
suspension here we started from scratch

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.479 
suspension here we started from scratch
did<00:00:56.390> our<00:00:56.479> own<00:00:56.510> spindle<00:00:57.049> which<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:57.710> accepts<00:00:58.430> the

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
did our own spindle which is accepts the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.520 
did our own spindle which is accepts the
Mustang<00:00:58.850> hub<00:00:59.059> accepts<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.900> Mustang<00:01:00.229> brakes

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
Mustang hub accepts the Mustang brakes

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.649 
Mustang hub accepts the Mustang brakes
and<00:01:00.830> then<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.519> aftermarket<00:01:01.939> Mustang<00:01:02.420> brakes

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
and then the aftermarket Mustang brakes

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.329 
and then the aftermarket Mustang brakes
but<00:01:03.110> all<00:01:03.259> the<00:01:03.350> geometry<00:01:03.500> is<00:01:03.979> something<00:01:04.250> we

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
but all the geometry is something we

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.439 
but all the geometry is something we
were<00:01:04.460> able<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.670> start<00:01:04.939> right<00:01:05.119> from<00:01:05.180> scratch

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
were able to start right from scratch

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.539 
were able to start right from scratch
with<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:06.710> is<00:01:06.860> our<00:01:06.979> spindle<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.490> we

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
with so this is our spindle that we

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.149 
with so this is our spindle that we
manufacture<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.479> designed<00:01:08.869> to<00:01:09.409> use<00:01:09.740> Mustang

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
manufacture it's designed to use Mustang

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.730 
manufacture it's designed to use Mustang
brakes<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.580> Mustang<00:01:10.939> hub<00:01:11.180> but<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:11.900> get<00:01:12.049> all<00:01:12.590> of

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
brakes a Mustang hub but we get all of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.980 
brakes a Mustang hub but we get all of
our<00:01:12.830> own<00:01:12.979> geometry<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:14.000> bolt<00:01:14.210> on<00:01:14.360> steering<00:01:14.720> arm

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
our own geometry to bolt on steering arm

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.480 
our own geometry to bolt on steering arm
so<00:01:15.229> we<00:01:15.320> can<00:01:15.470> change<00:01:15.650> bump<00:01:16.009> steer<00:01:16.189> we<00:01:16.369> can

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
so we can change bump steer we can

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.510 
so we can change bump steer we can
change<00:01:16.640> different<00:01:17.030> things<00:01:17.180> with<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:18.520> lower

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
change different things with that lower

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.090 
change different things with that lower

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
cleaner look when the body is on we can

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.389 
cleaner look when the body is on we can
also<00:01:32.840> run<00:01:33.049> with<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.439> with<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.740> nose<00:01:33.890> off<00:01:34.100> and

make<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.170> car<00:02:00.380> handle<00:02:00.590> at<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.340> absolute

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
make the car handle at the absolute

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.230 
make the car handle at the absolute
limit<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:03.229> what<00:02:03.829> we<00:02:03.950> race<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.819> really

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
limit as what we race and it really

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.399 
limit as what we race and it really
makes<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.539> car<00:02:05.749> so<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.020> can<00:02:06.170> put<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.380> right

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
makes this car so you can put it right

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.160 
makes this car so you can put it right
on<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.679> track<00:02:07.539> chassis<00:02:08.539> czar<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.750> designed<00:02:09.050> so

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
on a track chassis czar all designed so

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.539 
on a track chassis czar all designed so
that<00:02:09.200> either<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:09.950> those<00:02:10.039> suspensions<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.729> be

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
that either of those suspensions can be

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.710 
that either of those suspensions can be
you<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> make<00:02:12.299> a<00:02:12.330> chance<00:02:12.599> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
you don't have to make a chance to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.089 
you don't have to make a chance to
change<00:02:12.870> if<00:02:13.049> you<00:02:13.080> want<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.290> upgrade<00:02:13.620> or<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:13.950> back

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
change if you want to upgrade or go back

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.190 
change if you want to upgrade or go back
and<00:02:14.280> forth<00:02:14.489> maybe<00:02:15.299> do<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.480> little<00:02:15.599> drag<00:02:15.870> racing

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and forth maybe do a little drag racing

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.330 
and forth maybe do a little drag racing
one<00:02:16.319> week<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> little<00:02:16.829> road<00:02:16.950> racing<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
one week in a little road racing the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.800 
one week in a little road racing the
next<00:02:17.519> weekend<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.000> switch<00:02:18.420> between<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
next weekend you switch between the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.300 
next weekend you switch between the
suspension<00:02:19.230> systems<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:19.920> engine

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
suspension systems so the engine

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.860 
suspension systems so the engine
compartment<00:02:20.939> in<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.299> car<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.689> designed

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
compartment in the car was designed

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.410 
compartment in the car was designed
around<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.530> 4.6<00:02:23.099> liter<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.549> overhead<00:02:23.909> cam<00:02:24.090> Ford

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
around a 4.6 liter do overhead cam Ford

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.869 
around a 4.6 liter do overhead cam Ford
which<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> very<00:02:25.470> wide<00:02:25.680> engine<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.519> enables

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
which is a very wide engine that enables

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.119 
which is a very wide engine that enables
us<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> basically<00:02:27.720> go<00:02:28.140> from<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.650> engine<00:02:28.980> and

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
us to basically go from that engine and

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.869 
us to basically go from that engine and
downsize<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.090> smaller<00:02:30.329> 302<00:02:30.720> 351<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:32.730> also

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
downsize to the smaller 302 351 but also

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.569 
downsize to the smaller 302 351 but also
the<00:02:33.120> engine<00:02:33.480> mounts<00:02:34.290> are<00:02:34.379> modular<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.310> buy

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
the engine mounts are modular so you buy

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.430 
the engine mounts are modular so you buy
the<00:02:35.640> same<00:02:35.879> chassis<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.599> all<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:36.900> piece<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
the same chassis it's all one piece and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.080 
the same chassis it's all one piece and
then<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.859> buy<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.280> engine<00:02:38.609> mounts<00:02:38.790> depending

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
then you buy the engine mounts depending

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.490 
then you buy the engine mounts depending
on<00:02:39.180> what<00:02:39.359> your<00:02:39.510> application<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.079> or<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.349> can

on what your application is or you can
change<00:02:40.739> your<00:02:40.950> application<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.700> without<00:02:42.450> it

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
change your application and without it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.300 
change your application and without it

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
having to make a frame change this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.899 
having to make a frame change this
