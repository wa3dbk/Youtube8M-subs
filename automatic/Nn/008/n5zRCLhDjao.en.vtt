00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.250
 Welcome to the new day and well I 'm leaving 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.170
 and it occurred to me as so 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.429
 times just walking the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 primark store the truth is that I 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.969
 I got there and I started to get involved 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.769
 the blanket and things happen to me then 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.780
 I came up with also a little inspired 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.970
 in a lot of clothes that we have come 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
 seeing in the previous autumn-winter that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.289
 they are garments that are composed of two fabrics 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 For example, the sleeves are made of leather and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.330
 others as a more military fabric or the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.189
 The fists are made of hair and the other is 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.500
 of cowboy I that is undertaken is that 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 Normally mix two types of fabrics 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 inside the same garment, not before 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 a super simple way happens in that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.790
 then take advantage and buy there 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.070
 the clothes but good that probably 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 at home you are going to have some pledge with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.489
 which you can play we will unveil 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.600
 this mystery we begin with the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.600
 materials that we need 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.370
 we need an American 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 and a plaid shirt that can be 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 long sleeve or short sleeve whatever 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 you have at home this season as you 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.100
 share approximately in my blog a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.320
 of the trends are the pictures the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.290
 T-shirt type eyeliner t-shirts 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 with the typical non-Scottish pie then 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.440
 good because I have not decided that those two 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 mixtures of tissues in this garment 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.310
 concrete I'm going to make cake has given us 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.800
 a box fabric that is to say and a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.509
 americana lisa anyone not and this 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 could be with another type of fabrics or if 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.090
 you do not want it to be pictures because 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.740
 example cowboy you can also 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.440
 try what you have left a cowboy 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.270
 dark with navy blue or the same a 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.619
 shirt for example military with some 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.180
 different tissue now the question 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.160
 is to mix fabrics and make it from a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.390
 very simple two at the beginning 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.090
 had thought to use the machine 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.740
 I have decided to be good with those 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.869
 people who do not have a sewing machine 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.490
 and simplify it and do it with glue 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.410
 for elected that is more accessible to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.140
 all all idea for us to understand each other 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.149
 if you see it that way, it's easy to do this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.080
 what are you seeing here is not basically 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.700
 it's like lining or filling let's say that 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.250
 American that was totally marine blue 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.159
 the shirt that you feel you have for 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.750
 example , a long sleeve shirt as 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.450
 you simply cut the most pleasing 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.220
 you do not buy directly or you have 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.539
 house one that comes to you already sleeveless 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.400
 because it's going to be more comfortable because the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.470
 I want to fill everything professional did not have 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.060
 sense and so you see the two pieces that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.950
 is the trick now is how are we going to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.330
 go placing that checkered cloth over 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.819
 of the American so that when we go 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.340
 applying the glue does not move us 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.870
 for this we are going to help of some 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.060
 pins very well the one that the aissami 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.220
 wise said safety pins I give you a 10 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.750
 We will continue as indicated first 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.489
 What we are going to do is take a lot of 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.080
 unmissable and we 're going to help 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.269
 them to place the garment in their 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.860
 site then you are simply checking 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.230
 some guides I'm going to mark for example 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.990
 the neck and here I will do a guide what 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.270
 I will hold 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.690
 so that later when for example 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.880
 I bent my neck, it's good that I'm not going to 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.040
 agree that it fits well then I'm going to 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.200
 decide if I'm going to cut this excess or not 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 probably equal cut what is the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.160
 flap of the neck and leave only the part 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.350
 is down but at the moment as I do not know 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.880
 how will it look until I see it I'm going 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.660
 to leave provisional I'm stretching a 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.030
 little bit and placing some safety pins 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.270
 some pins and there comes a point in the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.220
 that are the eyelets for obviously 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.660
 tie the American then we have to 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.340
 keep in mind when we go to paste 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 that we just do not apply glue there 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.350
 to leave this gap free and I have 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.150
 applied three as you see three pins and 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.350
 a little bit as a guide I'm just going to 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.820
 then do the test giving the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.010
 American to make sure it looks good 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.350
 you see that you can not see anything out here 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.090
 there should be nothing left over from the fabric of 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.520
 pictures because I present the beautiful thing is that 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.260
 you see the two fabrics we are going to repeat the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.450
 same operation on the other side as 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.280
 you see the shirt is a little shorter 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.630
 that the American but good I'm not going to 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.790
 give more importance in fact I tried 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.840
 several different shirts to see if 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.730
 longer 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.650
 it was better but then it was very 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.120
 bulky and we are not interested in it 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.349
 very bulky because then it's not going to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.000
 get stuck this is what 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.800
 we want then I have taken everything from my 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.840
 size in this concrete this is the size 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
 8 and the shirt because I imagine it would be 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.200
 also the size that we simply make 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.650
 continues to apply glue for the part 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.560
 inside the shirt and we're going it spinning 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.030
 and we put pressure if you open a 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.730
 little bit of glue as it happened to me 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.319
 here remove it right away to prevent 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.730
 when I turn it over and you get stained 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.139
 another part that is what happened to me 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.000
 I will perform exactly the same 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.470
 on the other side of the American I'm going to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.919
 start at the top of the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.169
 neck and I apply glue on the shirt 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.950
 You see up here I'm going to apply glue 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.260
 the one in the shirt 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.600
 careful to extend it well so that 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.470
 do not get stuck then 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.630
 we turn 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.250
 the garment 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.250
 and we make a slight pressure 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.930
 the same when you arrive in the area of 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.270
 button do not apply glue you pass this 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.890
 part to that there is no glue and we can 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.840
 Then make a hole and take out the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.430
 button the next thing I'm going to do is 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.350
 just apply glue on the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.150
 back side 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.120
 and the same thing in the neck so he applied a 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.770
 little bit of glue arrived at this 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.990
 point where it is already dry 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.340
 front, there was the doubt of 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.200
 what do you do and from behind hit or not 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.030
 you will speak you have decided not to hit because in 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.310
 reality that is stuck there is no 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.900
 secured the neck area with that 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.520
 is stuck and secured the area of 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.080
 in front of what need to paste 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.000
 glue cut because it is no longer going to 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.620
 move and then we avoid that some 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.150
 basic as the glue is 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.040
 come out or that is transparent on 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.690
 glue there is no need with which 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.280
 simply still easier than what 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.320
 we think even if we put the glue 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.910
 ahead it will be much better 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.280
 now the next step is a bit 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.870
 Hurry those little details like the 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.460
 buttonhole and he goes right now when I 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.600
 I was facing what to do with the 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.920
 button suddenly and a-6 that my 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.660
 specialty is here doing everything a 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.070
 little on the fly not then of 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.930
 suddenly he and I have said good for 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.250
 what am I going to cut here a hole that is 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.650
 where would I make a hole for 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.009
 take the button and can simply like this 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.569
 how not 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.819
 and nothing to get the button like that 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.580
 simply and put it on the other side 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.649
 and it will be much cleaner 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.999
 broken like that has a little more trick 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:57.919
 to tie but masters the effect is 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.020
 exactly the same the final you see that 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.659
 the American is just as good 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.069
 and if better without breaking or anything the button and 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.779
 you know that another good news I tell you 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.129
 that I have decided to do nothing in the 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.539
 neck because look how little is the 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.999
 detail that comes out I think that is is 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.680
 original that comes out a little the neck 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:14.539
 from the other shirt I think it looks good 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.770
 it is very subtle but she yes girls 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.020
 you can see it costs bullets that I do not 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.789
 Stick anything with the clothes I have on 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.289
 today is that I would have to plan not to say 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.210
 to see how it will be result 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.499
 what clothes do I wear so that you really 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.909
 you have a good impression but good 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:27.289
 I like more also to surprise them in the 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.300
 blog with this I 'll put it on the blog 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.339
 sure but you see how real it is 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.039
 like a medium prep and half british 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:36.080
 as well as male or female I do not know to me 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.209
 like it a lot you see it like that a little bit 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.830
 up close you can see that it is a very 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:42.319
 simple from the back too 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.550
 You see how it looks and nothing I want to see 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.289
 our experiments I want to see what 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.149
