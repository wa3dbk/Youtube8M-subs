hi<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.640> stupid<00:00:05.970> gigabyte<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.569> I'd<00:00:06.810> like

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
hi this is stupid gigabyte and I'd like

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.320 
hi this is stupid gigabyte and I'd like
to<00:00:07.020> show<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.350> our<00:00:07.680> brand<00:00:07.980> new<00:00:08.160> 3d<00:00:08.820> bios

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
to show you our brand new 3d bios

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.230 
to show you our brand new 3d bios
technology<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.950> 3d<00:00:11.280> bias<00:00:11.460> technology<00:00:12.120> is

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
technology this 3d bias technology is

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.780 
technology this 3d bias technology is
based<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.660> our<00:00:12.809> new<00:00:12.990> UEFI<00:00:13.790> BIOS

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
based on our new UEFI BIOS

based on our new UEFI BIOS
implementation<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.619> basic<00:00:16.980> idea<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
implementation and the basic idea is to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090

just highlighting a few these icons
right<00:00:42.780> while<00:00:42.989> we're<00:00:43.170> looking<00:00:43.260> at<00:00:43.500> system<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
right while we're looking at system and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
right while we're looking at system and
as<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> see<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.899> board<00:00:46.110> we're<00:00:46.320> using

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
as you can see the board we're using

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.479 
as you can see the board we're using
this<00:00:46.739> case<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> XV<00:00:47.879> nine<00:00:47.910> UT<00:00:48.450> five<00:00:48.750> board

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
this case is the XV nine UT five board

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.400 
this case is the XV nine UT five board
the<00:00:50.489> advanced<00:00:50.760> mode<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.300> pretty<00:00:51.780> similar<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the advanced mode is pretty similar to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.510 
the advanced mode is pretty similar to
what<00:00:52.590> you'll<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.860> used<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.399> a
