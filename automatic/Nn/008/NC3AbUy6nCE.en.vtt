00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
Dave you've got to try these bars you're

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.660 
Dave you've got to try these bars you're
gonna<00:00:17.080> be<00:00:17.230> so<00:00:17.470> aerodynamic<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:18.340> so<00:00:18.520> much

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
gonna be so aerodynamic and so much

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.490 
gonna be so aerodynamic and so much
faster<00:00:18.910> than<00:00:19.180> your<00:00:19.330> competitors<00:00:19.869> his

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
faster than your competitors his

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.230 
faster than your competitors his
original<00:00:20.920> design<00:00:21.250> was<00:00:21.430> made<00:00:21.640> out<00:00:21.789> of<00:00:21.880> wood<00:00:22.060> he

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
original design was made out of wood he

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.330 
original design was made out of wood he
was<00:00:22.330> actually<00:00:22.630> a<00:00:22.690> wood<00:00:22.869> craftsman<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.619> he

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
was actually a wood craftsman and he

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.890 
was actually a wood craftsman and he
mounted<00:00:24.699> these<00:00:24.880> bikes<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.390> I'm<00:00:25.480> not<00:00:25.630> sure<00:00:25.779> if

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
mounted these bikes and I'm not sure if

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.450 
mounted these bikes and I'm not sure if
it<00:00:25.990> was<00:00:26.080> made<00:00:26.230> out<00:00:26.260> of<00:00:26.470> aluminum<00:00:26.890> or<00:00:27.039> steel<00:00:27.250> but

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
it was made out of aluminum or steel but

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.609 
it was made out of aluminum or steel but
I<00:00:27.520> think<00:00:27.730> we<00:00:27.820> lashed<00:00:28.510> him<00:00:28.779> on<00:00:28.930> with<00:00:29.109> rope<00:00:29.380> or

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
I think we lashed him on with rope or

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.280 
I think we lashed him on with rope or
duct<00:00:30.160> tape<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.609> put<00:00:30.760> him<00:00:30.850> on<00:00:31.000> my<00:00:31.180> bars<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.260> I

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
duct tape and put him on my bars and I

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.140 
duct tape and put him on my bars and I
proceeded<00:00:32.650> to<00:00:32.739> ride<00:00:32.949> around<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.489> parking<00:00:34.090> lot

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
proceeded to ride around the parking lot

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.570 
proceeded to ride around the parking lot
I<00:00:34.480> had<00:00:34.750> never<00:00:35.199> felt<00:00:35.290> so<00:00:35.559> unwieldy<00:00:36.370> in<00:00:36.460> my

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
I had never felt so unwieldy in my

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.460 
I had never felt so unwieldy in my
entire<00:00:36.850> life<00:00:37.149> when<00:00:37.720> I<00:00:37.780> was<00:00:37.930> on<00:00:38.050> top<00:00:38.290> of<00:00:38.320> these

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
entire life when I was on top of these

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.830 
entire life when I was on top of these
bars<00:00:38.739> and<00:00:38.860> I<00:00:39.040> mean<00:00:39.850> somewhat<00:00:40.390> polite<00:00:40.630> at<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
bars and I mean somewhat polite at the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.180 
bars and I mean somewhat polite at the
time<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.079> said<00:00:41.470> you<00:00:41.500> know<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:41.710> just<00:00:41.829> don't<00:00:42.070> think

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
time I said you know I just don't think

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.860 
time I said you know I just don't think
they're<00:00:42.430> gonna<00:00:42.520> work<00:00:42.760> but<00:00:43.030> I<00:00:43.059> think<00:00:43.570> that<00:00:43.780> you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
they're gonna work but I think that you

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.420 
they're gonna work but I think that you
know<00:00:43.960> they<00:00:44.079> have<00:00:44.260> some<00:00:44.500> merit<00:00:44.680> for<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.250> other

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
know they have some merit for the other

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.630 
know they have some merit for the other
guys<00:00:46.020> about<00:00:47.020> six<00:00:47.410> months<00:00:47.710> later<00:00:47.920> all<00:00:48.280> my

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
guys about six months later all my

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.690 
guys about six months later all my
competitors<00:00:49.210> had<00:00:49.450> him<00:00:49.600> and<00:00:50.070> Dave<00:00:51.070> Scott<00:00:51.399> was

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
competitors had him and Dave Scott was

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.490 
competitors had him and Dave Scott was
left<00:00:52.000> in<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.390> dust<00:00:52.570> on<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.960> bike<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.350> Aero

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
left in the dust on the bike the Aero

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.920 
left in the dust on the bike the Aero
bars<00:00:53.680> make<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.190> big<00:00:54.579> difference<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.750> I'm<00:00:55.840> gonna

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
bars make a big difference so I'm gonna

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.810 
bars make a big difference so I'm gonna
try<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.200> point<00:00:56.469> out<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.710> few<00:00:56.980> things<00:00:57.160> in<00:00:57.489> the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
try to point out a few things in the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.940 
try to point out a few things in the
arrow<00:00:57.969> position<00:00:58.180> that<00:00:58.660> you<00:00:58.809> can<00:00:59.079> really<00:00:59.680> use

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
arrow position that you can really use

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.770 
arrow position that you can really use
to<00:00:59.980> sort<00:01:00.399> of<00:01:00.460> accommodate<00:01:00.730> your<00:01:01.149> body<00:01:01.450> type

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
to sort of accommodate your body type

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.900 
to sort of accommodate your body type
and<00:01:02.050> hopefully<00:01:02.320> maximize<00:01:02.890> your<00:01:03.129> potential

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
and hopefully maximize your potential

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.700 
and hopefully maximize your potential
and<00:01:03.969> your<00:01:04.030> efficiency<00:01:04.629> let's<00:01:05.199> just<00:01:05.379> start<00:01:05.560> on

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
and your efficiency let's just start on

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.010 
and your efficiency let's just start on
the<00:01:05.830> back<00:01:06.009> end<00:01:06.340> first<00:01:06.720> Julie<00:01:07.720> I'll<00:01:07.810> have<00:01:07.930> you

stop here just for a second when I move
around<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.750> back<00:01:10.929> side<00:01:11.229> here<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.590> lot<00:01:11.709> of<00:01:11.740> times

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
around the back side here a lot of times

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.010 
around the back side here a lot of times
when<00:01:12.039> we<00:01:12.100> look<00:01:12.250> at<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.819> hip<00:01:13.390> position<00:01:13.899> the

butt position on the bike and we try to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.600 
butt position on the bike and we try to
obtain<00:01:16.660> that<00:01:17.080> flat<00:01:17.470> back<00:01:17.740> position<00:01:18.039> I<00:01:18.429> can

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.949 
obtain that flat back position I can
push<00:01:18.789> Julie<00:01:19.149> down<00:01:19.330> here<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.630> just<00:01:19.750> sort<00:01:19.840> of

so<00:01:33.700> I'm<00:01:33.910> gonna<00:01:34.149> pull<00:01:34.360> her<00:01:34.450> back<00:01:34.660> just<00:01:34.959> slightly

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
so I'm gonna pull her back just slightly

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.380 
so I'm gonna pull her back just slightly
here<00:01:35.679> and<00:01:35.830> then<00:01:36.220> if<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.459> just<00:01:36.490> fold<00:01:37.000> her<00:01:37.179> right

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
here and then if I just fold her right

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.059 
here and then if I just fold her right
at<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.660> navel<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:38.289> she's<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.679> gonna<00:01:38.800> bend

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
at the navel so she's just gonna bend

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.100 
at the navel so she's just gonna bend
over<00:01:39.399> right<00:01:39.429> at<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.729> navel<00:01:40.000> but<00:01:40.119> keeping<00:01:40.599> her

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
over right at the navel but keeping her

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.169 
over right at the navel but keeping her
hips<00:01:41.410> fixed<00:01:42.069> so<00:01:42.160> go<00:01:42.310> ahead<00:01:42.429> and<00:01:42.880> come<00:01:43.000> down<00:01:43.030> on

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
hips fixed so go ahead and come down on

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.889 
hips fixed so go ahead and come down on
your<00:01:43.300> aerobars

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
your aerobars

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.230 
your aerobars
and<00:01:44.349> now<00:01:44.679> we've<00:01:44.830> got<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.039> narrow<00:01:45.310> position<00:01:45.819> why

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and now we've got a narrow position why

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.120 
and now we've got a narrow position why
do<00:01:46.300> we<00:01:46.450> do<00:01:46.569> that<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.500> powers<00:01:47.800> got<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.069> be

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
do we do that the powers got to be

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.919 
do we do that the powers got to be
generated<00:01:48.670> from<00:01:48.819> the<00:01:48.910> glutes<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.599> hips

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
generated from the glutes and the hips

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.050 
generated from the glutes and the hips
we<00:01:50.170> can't<00:01:50.440> think<00:01:50.739> of<00:01:50.890> being<00:01:51.039> quad<00:01:51.369> dominated

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
we can't think of being quad dominated

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.199 
we can't think of being quad dominated
now<00:01:52.630> what<00:01:53.080> happens<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.739> if<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:54.190> move<00:01:54.700> Julie

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
now what happens is if we move Julie

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:56.609 
now what happens is if we move Julie
forward<00:01:55.599> on<00:01:55.690> this<00:01:55.840> seat<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.080> actually<00:01:56.349> slide

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
forward on this seat and actually slide

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.290 
forward on this seat and actually slide
her<00:01:56.739> forward<00:01:57.069> and<00:01:57.190> try<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.670> push<00:01:57.940> her<00:01:58.090> down

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
her forward and try to push her down

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.940 
her forward and try to push her down
just<00:01:58.599> a<00:01:58.630> little<00:01:58.690> bit<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.470> load<00:01:59.739> is

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
just a little bit the load is

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.680 
just a little bit the load is
transferred<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.789> outside<00:02:01.239> of<00:02:01.270> leg<00:02:01.539> the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
transferred to the outside of leg the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.990 
transferred to the outside of leg the
vastus<00:02:02.050> lateralis<00:02:02.349> in<00:02:02.800> here<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:03.429> leg<00:02:03.610> muscles

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
vastus lateralis in here the leg muscles

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.850 
vastus lateralis in here the leg muscles
real<00:02:04.209> strong<00:02:04.539> but<00:02:05.140> it's<00:02:05.289> not<00:02:05.440> as<00:02:05.590> strong<00:02:05.800> as

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
real strong but it's not as strong as

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.169 
real strong but it's not as strong as
the<00:02:06.069> glutes<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.550> we've<00:02:06.670> got<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.880> make<00:02:07.000> sure

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
the glutes and we've got to make sure

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.300 
the glutes and we've got to make sure
again<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.349> glutes<00:02:08.619> are<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.860> firing

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
again that the glutes are the firing

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.339 
again that the glutes are the firing
system<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.300> lead<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.840> quads<00:02:11.140> and

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
system and they lead to the quads and

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.540 
system and they lead to the quads and
then<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.590> lower<00:02:11.739> leg<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.220> we're<00:02:12.310> gonna<00:02:12.430> bring

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
then the lower leg so we're gonna bring

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.059 
then the lower leg so we're gonna bring
Julie<00:02:12.939> back<00:02:13.150> into<00:02:13.810> her<00:02:14.019> pelvic<00:02:14.650> position

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
Julie back into her pelvic position

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.920 
Julie back into her pelvic position
where<00:02:15.219> she<00:02:15.370> sets<00:02:15.670> her<00:02:15.790> hips<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.299> let's<00:02:16.719> keep

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
where she sets her hips so let's keep

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.450 
where she sets her hips so let's keep
moving<00:02:17.290> forward<00:02:17.709> here<00:02:17.829> when<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.010> look<00:02:18.159> at<00:02:18.219> you

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
moving forward here when we look at you

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.430 
moving forward here when we look at you
on<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> front<00:02:19.030> end<00:02:19.210> we<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.870> take<00:02:20.080> her<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.320> this

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
on the front end we can take her in this

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.870 
on the front end we can take her in this
forward<00:02:20.680> position<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.280> one<00:02:21.370> thing<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.670> notice

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
forward position and one thing to notice

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.990 
forward position and one thing to notice
is<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.330> her<00:02:22.800> flexion<00:02:23.800> at<00:02:24.010> her<00:02:24.220> elbows<00:02:24.670> we

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
is just her flexion at her elbows we

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.660 
is just her flexion at her elbows we
should<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.270> about<00:02:25.450> 110<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.650> 90<00:02:26.950> degree<00:02:27.220> flexion

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
should be about 110 to 90 degree flexion

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
should be about 110 to 90 degree flexion
at<00:02:27.760> your<00:02:27.910> elbows<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.840> get<00:02:29.020> too<00:02:29.320> long<00:02:29.590> out<00:02:29.860> in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
at your elbows if we get too long out in

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.350 
at your elbows if we get too long out in
front<00:02:30.220> where<00:02:30.370> we're<00:02:30.550> really<00:02:30.730> elongated<00:02:31.210> go

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
front where we're really elongated go

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.700 
front where we're really elongated go
ahead<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.630> scooch<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.960> back<00:02:32.080> Julia<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.560> just

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
ahead and scooch it back Julia and just

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.110 
ahead and scooch it back Julia and just
stretch<00:02:32.920> your<00:02:33.040> arms<00:02:33.280> ladies<00:02:33.520> come<00:02:33.730> way<00:02:33.880> back

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
stretch your arms ladies come way back

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.030 
stretch your arms ladies come way back
you<00:02:34.570> can<00:02:34.690> see<00:02:34.840> what<00:02:34.990> happens<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> angle<00:02:35.920> at

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
you can see what happens to the angle at

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.490 
you can see what happens to the angle at
the<00:02:36.160> elbow<00:02:36.400> right<00:02:36.550> here<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.630> she's<00:02:38.200> very

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the elbow right here is that she's very

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.620 
the elbow right here is that she's very
very<00:02:38.770> long<00:02:39.010> well<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.280> opens<00:02:39.550> up<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.030> core<00:02:40.330> and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
very long well it opens up the core and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.620 
very long well it opens up the core and
we're<00:02:41.170> unable<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.620> generate<00:02:42.280> power<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.330> we

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
we're unable to generate power so we

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.940 
we're unable to generate power so we
want<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:43.960> tighten<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.470> up<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:44.770> little

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
want to just tighten that up a little

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.390 
want to just tighten that up a little
bit

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
bit

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.030 
bit
reduce<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.180> angle<00:02:46.630> at<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.900> elbows<00:02:47.230> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
reduce that angle at the elbows the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.470 
reduce that angle at the elbows the
reach<00:02:48.220> out<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:48.640> front<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.970> hand<00:02:49.210> should<00:02:49.360> be

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
reach out in front the hand should be

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.880 
reach out in front the hand should be
nice<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.900> relaxed<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.350> don't<00:02:50.530> want<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.710> feel

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
nice and relaxed we don't want to feel

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.440 
nice and relaxed we don't want to feel
as<00:02:51.220> though<00:02:51.280> we're<00:02:51.580> doing<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.820> death<00:02:52.030> grip<00:02:52.300> on

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
as though we're doing the death grip on

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.870 
as though we're doing the death grip on
the<00:02:52.930> front<00:02:53.170> end<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.410> handles<00:02:53.830> her<00:02:54.670> eyes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
the front end of the handles her eyes

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.370 
the front end of the handles her eyes
should<00:02:55.210> be<00:02:55.270> looking<00:02:55.570> forward<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.110> slightly

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
should be looking forward and slightly

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.470 
should be looking forward and slightly
down<00:02:56.740> because<00:02:57.310> this<00:02:57.460> maximizes<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.330> arrow

we do there's a couple simple things
that<00:03:13.960> we<00:03:14.080> can<00:03:14.200> start<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:14.740> and<00:03:14.980> one<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.370> just

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
that we can start with and one is just

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.200 
that we can start with and one is just
to<00:03:16.150> check<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:17.140> pad<00:03:17.620> height<00:03:17.950> with<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.940> seat

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
to check the pad height with the seat

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.790 
to check the pad height with the seat
height<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:19.810> Julie<00:03:20.170> if<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.380> just<00:03:20.500> stand<00:03:20.680> up

for a second and come off your saddle if
we<00:03:24.340> just<00:03:24.490> take<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> measurement<00:03:25.210> from<00:03:25.450> her<00:03:25.720> sit

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
we just take a measurement from her sit

we just take a measurement from her sit
bones<00:03:26.320> on<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.890> saddle<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.460> measure<00:03:27.970> that

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
bones on the saddle and measure that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.720 
bones on the saddle and measure that
down<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.960> we<00:03:29.500> get<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.740> distance<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.460> we<00:03:30.580> can

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
down and we get a distance and we can

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.780 
down and we get a distance and we can
measure<00:03:30.910> from<00:03:31.240> her<00:03:31.480> pads<00:03:31.840> down<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:33.040> get<00:03:33.610> that

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
measure from her pads down and get that

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.480 
measure from her pads down and get that
distance<00:03:34.390> what<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.680> drop<00:03:35.950> between<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
distance what is the drop between the

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.880 
distance what is the drop between the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
seat to her pads other words how low can

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.010 
seat to her pads other words how low can
she<00:03:39.130> get<00:03:39.370> down<00:03:39.910> in<00:03:40.090> front<00:03:40.360> here<00:03:40.570> well<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.750> could

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
she get down in front here well I could

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.690 
she get down in front here well I could
bring<00:03:41.140> her<00:03:41.260> way<00:03:41.410> way<00:03:41.590> down<00:03:41.830> but<00:03:42.280> again<00:03:42.400> that

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
bring her way way down but again that

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.570 
bring her way way down but again that
squishes<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.630> hip<00:03:43.930> angle<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.010> optimum

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
squishes that hip angle so the optimum

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.240 
squishes that hip angle so the optimum
range<00:03:45.610> really<00:03:46.330> depends<00:03:46.780> on<00:03:46.930> hamstring<00:03:47.590> low

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
range really depends on hamstring low

range really depends on hamstring low
back<00:03:48.490> flexibility<00:03:49.210> and<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.480> range<00:03:49.690> is

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
back flexibility and the range is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.200 
back flexibility and the range is
between<00:03:49.900> about<00:03:50.320> one<00:03:50.710> to<00:03:51.010> four<00:03:51.250> inch<00:03:51.490> drop<00:03:51.910> and

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
between about one to four inch drop and
