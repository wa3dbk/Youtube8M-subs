00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
something that seemed to make sense so

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.210 
something that seemed to make sense so
we<00:01:47.070> let<00:01:47.250> fly<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:48.000> crying<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.479> did<00:01:48.659> by<00:01:48.780> myself<00:01:49.220> but

we let fly my crying I did by myself but
it<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.789> feeling<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.330> emotion<00:01:51.920> if<00:01:52.920> not

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the location was very accurate because

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
the location was very accurate because
there<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.399> by<00:01:56.580> myself<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
there that was when I was by myself and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.590

everything<00:01:57.659> sort<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.960> decompressed<00:01:59.600> that's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
everything sort of decompressed that's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.080 
everything sort of decompressed that's
pretty<00:02:00.930> much<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.039> I<00:02:02.429> was<00:02:02.670> walking

that fine line between portraying and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.790 
that fine line between portraying and
accurately<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.550> not<00:02:05.670> being<00:02:05.880> exploited<00:02:06.800> we
