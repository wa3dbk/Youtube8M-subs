00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.969
 Hello dear friends for a long time with us 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.480
 there were no video lessons on the program and weight 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.760
 video 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.190
 edita and we correct this misstep i 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.730
 you promised previous video tutorials that we 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:31.230
 still see some of these possibilities 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.180
 this program for working with live video and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 frankly a little this program 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.860
 upset that cleaning up the background on 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.600
 video 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.270
 she is not very good at how you are now 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.570
 make sure of this though 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.690
 This program is there and I think that and 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.120
 we have to show you specifically that is 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.960
 my brother prepared a video in which he 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.239
 came out shortly with a green background 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.550
 came out told something with good 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.390
 the lighting is pretty normal 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.120
 the camera and we have this green background now 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.210
 on which he told something we are 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.510
 remove the green background and place it on 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.159
 another background 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.010
 let's get down to the actual 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.070
 video tutorial but immediately running ahead yet 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.250
 would like to say that immediately after 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.220
 this video lesson we still have and immediately 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.979
 video tutorial on color correction for working with 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 live video i.e. it will be like a bonus 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.790
 to the fact that this video lesson 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.340
 not so useful because 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.200
 we personally 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.729
 we process live videos we remove back 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.220
 background using other more 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.240
 professional programs about this we still 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.080
 talk in our other video lessons a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:01.299
 Today, our topic is related to 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:05.409
 program and weight video somewhere so i'm 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.019
 prepared here this video here already 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.460
 immediately to insert it with a green background 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.880
 and a picture of winter 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:18.320
 just got such a picture first 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.620
 we place the picture on the line 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.310
 video processing extensible 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.660
 around here and so further 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.490
 put our live video with green 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.310
 background 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:39.200
 only this way you can remove the rear 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.900
 the background on this video is first you 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.230
 should put the picture on the line 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.440
 processing on the timeline or a picture or 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:53.620
 video and video from which we will 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.610
 clean up the background we omit in the overlay and 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.880
 press the edit button 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.990
 the overlap in front of us opens 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.240
 editor 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.200
 superimposed video that is, we see that 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.410
 here are our green videos we can here 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.720
 select it and move it to any 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.410
 direction and also with the help of these 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.680
 here are the bottom markers stretch it 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.130
 I stretch to such limits I put in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.160
 this place and let's rewind a bit 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.430
 forward so that we can see that we will 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.520
 trim that's talking man on 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.160
 video behind green background see what 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.460
 good lighting here is very important 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.790
 when removing the background because 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.330
 if the lighting is not very good 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:48.080
 I canâ€™t do it at all 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.980
 first it should be a green background though 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:56.360
 it is not necessary to be further 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.810
 good lighting and quite good 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.810
 the camera though about the camera here is no longer 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.540
 very surely the most important thing about it 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.850
 In fact this lighting also you must 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.330
 look to ensure that there are no such 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.050
 here are the shadows behind you that is you should not 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.160
 stand close to the background should be fine 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.989
 highlighted now look even before 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.660
 how are we going to clean it 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.360
 there is a lighter part and in 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.110
 lower ground since the light was 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.509
 top bottom green 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.780
 darker meaning we will clean up 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:38.830
 this light gradually to 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.009
 remove the background we press the tick 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.660
 color 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:47.870
 reef projection and further choose either from 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.229
 colors offered either by yourself 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.080
 so that's cool here in color we 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.599
 pipette we can specify which color 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.870
 we will delete it more accurate 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:04.849
 setting so we choose for example 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:10.550
 light color and start cleaning up 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:14.210
 this background is almost completely removed 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.479
 but with the exception of these places where there was 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.380
 a little shadow over here were more 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.819
 dark greens and and in those corners 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.240
 now we click again on this 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:29.479
 color and choose a darker color 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.750
 which is in this corner after 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.509
 of this this light is gone we can of course still 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.979
 more work with these 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:44.870
 here are the colors let's try to eat here 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:51.860
 let's zoom in first twice 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:55.330
 and here these places are darker remove 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.900
 we did quite well 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.110
 cropped video 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.560
 but due to the fact that this program is not 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.770
 works so well with this 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:11.229
 function after all you see that silhouette 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:14.330
 human he is not very high quality and 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:18.610
 cut more quality will not work 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:21.199
 let me run a video and you see what 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.590
 principle prune we got on 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.919
 man's background turned out to put but 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.919
 quality suffers 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.590
 after that click ok i think that u 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.980
 you here in the preview is not visible 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.740
 but you can that moment when you 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.810
 go to the frame for example in this place 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.800
 this is the first part of the video you do not need 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.950
 you can cut it like this 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.280
 and start from where you are 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.370
 came to the background and started something 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.400
 telling this video lesson I 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.310
 I finish inviting you to view 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.860
 next video lesson on color 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.670
 corrections 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.710
 live video there I filmed in the summer 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.070
 the forest and show you how you can 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:16.300
 adjust color brightness clarity 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:19.690
 This video is waiting for your comments. 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.690
 bye everyone
