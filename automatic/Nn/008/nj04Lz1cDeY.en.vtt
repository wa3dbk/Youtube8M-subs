00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.010
 You can try to restore the dead 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.099
 18:50 battery from laptop with 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:26.699
 it was wonderful to charge graco to imax b6 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:31.949
 and so we measure the voltage on 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.130
 battery since these two 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.370
 the battery is connected in parallel 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.100
 It is considered as one battery because 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 that, in general, I summed up their capacity 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:53.730
 the voltage remains unchanged and so i 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:59.030
 I measure the voltage on a pair of medium 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 the battery, that is, these fermentation 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:15.570
 1 and 12 volts and on oh maxi 1 and 11 but this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:18.810
 In principle, not so important, and so what 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:26.580
 try to charge in the normal mode that 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:33.299
 will we be told charging does not change current 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:37.439
 the prince and not fundamentally but it is Kononova 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:42.710
 penetrate that loading too low and how 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.600
 would battery or the absence or him 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.299
 ass 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.830
 we go in the mode metal hydrides we evict 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.950
 I put the necessary contact 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.670
 07 amperes 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:10.500
 charging and as we see the voltage 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:17.739
 rises rises rises 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:23.220
 a little or a bunch here I raised a little 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.220
 current to voltage rises faster 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:03:03.459
 that's how we see already on motion 2 and 8 already 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:07.540
 315 should also note the following such 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:11.130
 the kick should be short-lived and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:17.730
 this to be able to follow 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:20.910
 voltage if you leave on charging 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.250
 in nickel metal hydride mode 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.620
 it is possible that the battery is simple 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.250
 recharge a lithium ion 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.950
 Accumulators as it is known do not like very much 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:38.350
 recharge so don't advise charging 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.140
 continuous mode we raise the voltage 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.750
 to the level of 3 volts quickly 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.260
 switch to mitty polymer and 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.650
 continue to charge in the usual 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.370
 mode so switch to lithium mode 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.370
 polymeric 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:08.209
 Now I chose the current 1 ampere thought should 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:12.760
 be okay so lace charging 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.760
 determined that one cell is connected and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:24.710
 charging went as we see as there 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:30.370
 I only have two batteries 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:39.710
 distributed on the idea evenly in 0.5 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:45.410
 the battery voltage is already 35 we 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:52.520
 Charging it is certainly more in the wires 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:55.699
 there is a voltage drop 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.419
 so you can actually try 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.430
 restore 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:04.550
 dead rounding 18 hours and cert if 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.930
 the battery counts the most likely 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.729
 will need to hide the shell and bypass 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.080
 defense 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.449
 as protection at a certain 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:21.620
 voltage just break contact 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:23.810
 between just developing contact and charging 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.460
 the idea is to happen no longer occur 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:31.430
 thanks everyone for watching 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.020
 subscribe to my channel like 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.720
 if you liked the video and not 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.720
 pleasant place dizlayk aa
