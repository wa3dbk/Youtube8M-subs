I'll mill that from this piece of paid
quarter<00:00:48.679> walnut<00:00:49.039> I<00:00:49.070> have<00:00:49.280> right<00:00:49.460> here

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.500 

we're<00:01:03.400> finished<00:01:03.700> cutting<00:01:03.880> the<00:01:04.000> outside<00:01:04.059> of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
we're finished cutting the outside of

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.780 
we're finished cutting the outside of
the<00:01:04.570> frame<00:01:04.750> using<00:01:04.989> wall<00:01:05.350> huh<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:05.800> ripped<00:01:06.640> it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
the frame using wall huh I ripped it

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.580 
the frame using wall huh I ripped it
then<00:01:07.120> ran<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.480> through<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.660> sander<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.290> then

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
then ran it through the sander and then

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.530 
then ran it through the sander and then
I<00:01:08.650> cut<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.980> a<00:01:09.100> rough<00:01:09.400> length<00:01:09.640> that's<00:01:10.270> just

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
I cut it to a rough length that's just

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.940 
I cut it to a rough length that's just
so<00:01:10.660> it's<00:01:10.810> easier<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.200> handle<00:01:11.290> when<00:01:11.650> I<00:01:11.740> go<00:01:11.890> to

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
so it's easier to handle when I go to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.550 
so it's easier to handle when I go to
cut<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.490> miter<00:01:12.670> saw<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:13.990> need<00:01:14.410> to

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
cut it on the miter saw now I need to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.860 
cut it on the miter saw now I need to
cut<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.890> inside<00:01:15.250> of<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.490> frame<00:01:15.760> that's<00:01:16.510> the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
cut the inside of the frame that's the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.710 
cut the inside of the frame that's the
part<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.590> painting<00:01:18.490> will<00:01:18.610> actually<00:01:19.060> sit

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
part that the painting will actually sit

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.410 
part that the painting will actually sit
on<00:01:19.750> so<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.650> inside<00:01:21.070> will<00:01:21.760> be<00:01:21.790> attached<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.360> the

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
on so the inside will be attached to the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.750 
on so the inside will be attached to the
outside<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.050> then<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> painting<00:01:23.979> will<00:01:24.460> sit

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
outside and then the painting will sit

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.790 
outside and then the painting will sit
right<00:01:24.790> in<00:01:25.120> here<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.660> want<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.110> inside<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.740> the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
right in here I want the inside of the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.070 
right in here I want the inside of the
frame<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.280> measure<00:01:27.490> 13<00:01:28.000> inches<00:01:28.300> by<00:01:28.510> 11<00:01:28.900> and<00:01:28.990> a

of the miter I'll measure out 13 inches

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.680 
of the miter I'll measure out 13 inches
and<00:01:41.580> put<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.610> mark<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:44.110> where<00:01:44.350> I'll<00:01:44.410> cut<00:01:45.690> so

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
and put a mark that's where I'll cut so

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.960 
and put a mark that's where I'll cut so

the outside of the frame is put together

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.429 
the outside of the frame is put together
now<00:02:54.920> what<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.099> need<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.340> do<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:56.019> run<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.049> piece<00:02:57.260> of

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
now what I need to do is run a piece of

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.170 
now what I need to do is run a piece of
molding<00:02:57.769> on<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.920> inside<00:02:58.519> of<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.700> frame<00:02:58.939> a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
molding on the inside of the frame a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.500 
molding on the inside of the frame a
little<00:03:00.049> bit<00:03:00.319> deeper<00:03:00.769> than<00:03:01.120> 7/8<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.239> an<00:03:02.329> inch

little bit deeper than 7/8 of an inch

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.679 
little bit deeper than 7/8 of an inch
and<00:03:02.810> that's<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:03.859> the<00:03:03.980> painting<00:03:04.280> will<00:03:04.790> sit<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
and that's so the painting will sit a

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.500 
and that's so the painting will sit a
little<00:03:06.349> deeper<00:03:06.560> than<00:03:07.159> flush<00:03:10.060> I'll<00:03:11.060> use<00:03:11.359> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.660 
grit I wouldn't want to use a machine

before<00:04:59.840> I<00:05:00.440> stain<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:01.040> is<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:02.090> have<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.420> pre-drill

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
before I stain it is I have to pre-drill

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.450 
before I stain it is I have to pre-drill
some<00:05:02.840> holes<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.560> put<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.920> screws<00:05:04.220> through

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
some holes to put the screws through

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:23.520 
some holes to put the screws through
that<00:05:04.610> will<00:05:04.760> hold<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.120> painting<00:05:05.480> in<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.660> frame

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.690 

since<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.650> frame<00:05:24.890> is<00:05:25.040> made<00:05:25.220> out<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.430> one<00:05:25.670> I

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
since the frame is made out of one I

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.260 
since the frame is made out of one I
really<00:05:26.240> don't<00:05:26.420> even<00:05:26.630> need<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.960> stay<00:05:27.170> in<00:05:27.230> it<00:05:27.350> but

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
really don't even need to stay in it but

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.580 
really don't even need to stay in it but
by<00:05:29.270> putting<00:05:29.570> some<00:05:29.690> staining<00:05:30.020> on<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.140> it<00:05:30.320> blends

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
by putting some staining on it it blends

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.370 
by putting some staining on it it blends
the<00:05:30.770> poplar<00:05:31.220> inside<00:05:31.730> piece<00:05:32.060> with<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.960> walnut

the poplar inside piece with the walnut

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.870 
the poplar inside piece with the walnut
and<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.680> darkens<00:05:34.070> it<00:05:34.190> up<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.400> little<00:05:34.520> bit<00:05:34.700> and<00:05:34.820> I

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
and it darkens it up a little bit and I

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.340 
and it darkens it up a little bit and I
want<00:05:35.150> that<00:05:35.390> look<00:05:35.660> for<00:05:35.840> this<00:05:35.960> project

with a few screws from behind now you

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.629 
with a few screws from behind now you
want<00:06:24.289> to<00:06:24.319> make<00:06:24.439> sure<00:06:24.680> that<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.159> don't<00:06:25.370> use

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
want to make sure that you don't use

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.070 
want to make sure that you don't use
screws<00:06:25.879> that<00:06:25.969> are<00:06:26.090> too<00:06:26.300> long<00:06:26.479> or<00:06:26.719> you<00:06:26.810> can<00:06:26.960> run

screws that are too long or you can run

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.209 
screws that are too long or you can run
the<00:06:27.199> risk<00:06:27.379> of<00:06:27.469> actually<00:06:27.620> going<00:06:27.919> through<00:06:28.039> the

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
the risk of actually going through the

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.149 
the risk of actually going through the
painting<00:06:28.610> which<00:06:28.699> would<00:06:28.819> be<00:06:28.909> a<00:06:28.939> nightmare<00:06:30.159> what

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.469 
painting which would be a nightmare what
I've<00:06:31.250> done<00:06:31.400> here<00:06:31.639> is<00:06:31.789> I've<00:06:31.879> taken<00:06:32.000> a<00:06:32.180> piece<00:06:32.330> of

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
I've done here is I've taken a piece of

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
cardboard I put some fabric on because I

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.529 
cardboard I put some fabric on because I
don't<00:06:34.520> want<00:06:34.699> to<00:06:34.759> touch<00:06:34.939> the<00:06:35.120> front<00:06:35.360> of<00:06:35.449> the
