some of the sounds oh yeah there we go

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.209 
some of the sounds oh yeah there we go
and<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:00.930> too<00:02:01.200> sure<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.409> reloading<00:02:01.950> or

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
and I'm not too sure about reloading or

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.820 
and I'm not too sure about reloading or
anything<00:02:02.520> yet

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
anything yet

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.650 
anything yet
I<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.610> might<00:02:04.730> be<00:02:04.790> just<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.240> system<00:02:05.570> of

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
I think it might be just a system of

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.780 
I think it might be just a system of
repair<00:02:06.050> or<00:02:06.620> finding<00:02:07.070> more<00:02:07.250> ammo<00:02:07.490> but<00:02:07.670> I<00:02:07.700> do

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
repair or finding more ammo but I do

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.520 
repair or finding more ammo but I do
know<00:02:08.180> that<00:02:08.210> when<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.750> placed<00:02:08.990> on<00:02:09.170> an<00:02:09.259> indoor

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
I'll take a rim spawn 12 here we go ah

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.480 
I'll take a rim spawn 12 here we go ah
I'm<00:02:57.590> all<00:02:57.709> slow<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.160> close<00:02:58.760> up<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:59.180> vision<00:03:00.490> come

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
I'm all slow and close up in vision come

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.360 
I'm all slow and close up in vision come
here<00:03:01.640> pick<00:03:01.850> oh<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.120> got<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.450> stone<00:03:02.750> wall<00:03:03.020> ah<00:03:03.370> nice

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.070 
here pick oh I got a stone wall ah nice
okay<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.030> i<00:03:05.150> guess<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> end<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.690> chests<00:03:05.990> are

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
okay so i guess the end of chests are

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650 
okay so i guess the end of chests are
labeled<00:03:06.410> by<00:03:06.620> certain<00:03:07.340> items<00:03:07.640> basis<00:03:08.090> or<00:03:08.300> towns

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
labeled by certain items basis or towns

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.690 
labeled by certain items basis or towns
or<00:03:08.870> something<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:10.160> i<00:03:10.220> guess<00:03:10.430> we<00:03:10.550> can

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
or something like that so i guess we can

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.009 
or something like that so i guess we can
collect<00:03:11.000> those<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.450> order<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.780> shield

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
collect those in order to shield

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.110 
collect those in order to shield
ourselves<00:03:12.200> if<00:03:12.620> we<00:03:12.739> need<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.920> right<00:03:13.910> now<00:03:14.030> i'm

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120
