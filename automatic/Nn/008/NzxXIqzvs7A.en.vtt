00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello friends welcome to the area 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.570
 gravity today we come to another one of those 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.160
 fundamental concepts in making 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.000
 point of any vehicle 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.740
 competition that is the drift angle 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.230
 when we want to rotate what 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.230
 we do is take the wheel and change the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.449
 direction of the front wheels the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 carrilana tends to go straight in the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.130
 direction in which he was rolling 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.999
 before we imagine that we shot 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.850
 completely straight let's call him 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.250
 zero degrees and we throw the wheel 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.190
 front five degrees 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.010
 when a rubber particle that was 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.870
 spinning from the wheel she turned on the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.540
 address 0 degrees and we say of 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.790
 soon to turn to 5 degrees 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.350
 the rubber can not change 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.570
 instantly from address 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.910
 remember that the front of the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.410
 footprint also suffers extra pressure 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.610
 by the centrifugal force of the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.409
 tires what the tire does is 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.299
 wriggle slightly he would want to continue 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.610
 right because it's the address that you brand 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.369
 the inertia of the vehicle but we 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.229
 we insist on it turning 5 degrees in what 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.729
 what it does is good look gave 5 degrees no 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.909
 I can rotate but if I twist a 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.640
 little bit I can turn a degree and that 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.229
 rubber particle rotates one degree and passes 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.909
 by the contact footprint until it 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.710
 relax again because he is no longer in 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.390
 contact with the ground the next 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.460
 particle of the wheel happens the same 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.960
 the address that marks the lane now 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.080
 It is already a grade but you are asking 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.820
 5 degrees and 5 degrees I can not but I'm going to 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.580
 advance another side I will write until 2 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.229
 degrees and so forth little to 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.030
 little bit we are changing the direction 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.830
 to the address that we 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.770
 we are dialing 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.870
 this angle formed between the direction to 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.240
 the one pointing the wheels and the direction 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.730
 to which the vehicle is pointing is what 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.270
 flame angle drift and is what we 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.399
 allows twisting 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.350
 if we are increasing that angle 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.359
 of drift is to say more 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.740
 difference between where they point 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.390
 wheels and where the vehicle is pointing 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.240
 we will be increasing this angle 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.000
 drift and will increase the grip of the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.340
 this continues like this for a 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 stretch comes a moment that reaches the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.410
 maximum lateral grip and then a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610
 moment that lateral grip loses in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.280
 function of the characteristics of the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.310
 tire this curve has a shape u 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.110
 another racing tires 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.730
 they have a very high lateral grip 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.010
 for that they are of competition although 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.680
 they need to operate some temperatures 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.140
 generally very high 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.829
 they have a curve with a very 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.420
 pronounced that is to say they are winning 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.849
 lateral acceleration but when the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.609
 they lose the blow at once 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.620
 they forgive very little and they generally achieve 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.319
 this maximum lateral grip with an angle 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.120
 relatively small drift 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 passenger tires tires 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.810
 street the tires that we use 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.319
 we to compete have a curve 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.790
 a little different the lateral grip 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.760
 maximum is not as high as that of a 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.129
 competition tire obviously 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.439
 but nevertheless this curve is not so 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.060
 picuda is a little more rounded in 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.519
 the upper part that means that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.799
 when it reaches the maximum for about 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.650
 how many degrees more a little bit of 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.689
 grip but not an exaggerated thing and the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.669
 third feature is that this 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.579
 Maximum grip is achieved with some angles 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:25.250
 of drift generally a little greater than 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.319
 competition tires because the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.120
 grip curve against drift angle 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.680
 has this form 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.260
 again we return to the footprint of 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.260
 pneumatic the front of the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.790
 footprint is more load bearing 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.980
 this will produce more lateral grip 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.469
 on the back of the tire is 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.329
 supporting less load but that produces 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:49.530
 less lateral grip when we 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.790
 let's increase the lateral acceleration 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.159
 there comes a time that the most 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.959
 back of the footprint starts to slide 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.599
 because it does not have enough charge to 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.700
 resist that lateral acceleration the 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.519
 coefficient of friction that measures the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.950
 friction force between two bodies 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.959
 it is always greater when it is static than 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.670
 when it is dynamic that is to say two bodies 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.010
 present more friction when they are 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.450
 still between them that when they start 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.220
 to slide 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.930
 when we are increasing this 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.430
 drift angle we said that the 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.489
 back of the footprint starts to 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.710
 slide however the front 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.139
 of the footprint if it resists that force 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.910
 lateral and by increasing this angle it drifts 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.310
 it gives us more grip 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.590
 if we continue to increase this angle of 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.600
 drift the front is giving us 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.540
 more and more grip but the back 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.530
 start to lose square centimeters 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.810
 that start to slide, which is why 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.419
 adding all the square millimeters 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.700
 of the contact footprint this sum 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.850
 reaches a certain maximum 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.889
 degrees of drift angle because because 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.750
 although we are gaining grip in 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.370
 the front part of the footprint the part 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.960
 rear begins to slide more and more and 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.550
 more and there comes a moment that does not compensate 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.290
 the grip gain of the part 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.580
 front of the water already with the loss of 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.350
 grip that we suffer because the part 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.510
 back of the footprint is sliding 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.130
 and this is the reason why the 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.220
 tires with a contact footprint 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.530
 wider usually have better 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.540
 lateral grip because the footprint of 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.210
 contact is not so elongated but it is 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.310
 shorter and wider, that's why 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.740
 less square centimeters of footprint in 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.380
 this back area that is going to start 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.680
 slide see you in the next 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.680
