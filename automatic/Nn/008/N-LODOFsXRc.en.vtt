back

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.240 

that<00:01:52.390> was<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.900> secret<00:01:53.200> ending<00:01:53.680> from<00:01:54.040> the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
that was the secret ending from the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.420 
that was the secret ending from the
Maxis<00:01:54.880> side<00:01:55.210> now<00:01:56.110> what<00:01:56.860> he's<00:01:56.980> basically

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
Maxis side now what he's basically

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.270 
Maxis side now what he's basically
saying<00:01:57.760> is<00:01:57.940> he<00:01:58.150> controls<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> aether<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.410> he

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
saying is he controls the aether and he

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.570 
saying is he controls the aether and he
could<00:02:01.000> reach<00:02:01.270> our<00:02:01.570> gathi<00:02:01.870> so<00:02:02.410> maybe<00:02:03.190> he's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
could reach our gathi so maybe he's

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.430 
could reach our gathi so maybe he's
indicating<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:04.690> he<00:02:04.810> wants<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.140> go<00:02:05.260> back<00:02:05.380> to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
indicating that he wants to go back to

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.070 
indicating that he wants to go back to
our<00:02:05.680> gathi<00:02:05.890> but<00:02:06.400> this<00:02:07.270> is<00:02:07.510> what<00:02:07.690> makes<00:02:07.840> me

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
our gathi but this is what makes me

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.020 
our gathi but this is what makes me
think<00:02:08.110> there's<00:02:08.440> going<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.100> second<00:02:09.820> map

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
think there's going to be a second map

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.020 
think there's going to be a second map
now<00:02:10.720> if<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.140> do<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.380> max<00:02:11.590> aside<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.490> may<00:02:12.700> be

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
now if you do the max aside you may be

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.510 
now if you do the max aside you may be
able<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.360> access<00:02:13.720> our<00:02:14.200> gathi<00:02:14.650> side<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> map

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
able to access our gathi side of the map

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.090 
able to access our gathi side of the map
and<00:02:15.850> if<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.510> do<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> Richthofen<00:02:17.140> side<00:02:17.560> he

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
and if you do the Richthofen side he

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.800 
and if you do the Richthofen side he
doesn't<00:02:18.400> mention<00:02:18.520> anywhere<00:02:19.150> he<00:02:19.390> wants<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.690> go

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
doesn't mention anywhere he wants to go

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.050 
doesn't mention anywhere he wants to go
he<00:02:20.200> just<00:02:20.470> mentions<00:02:21.040> he<00:02:21.250> could<00:02:21.460> control<00:02:21.730> any

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
he just mentions he could control any

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.880 
he just mentions he could control any
body<00:02:22.420> doesn't<00:02:23.020> mention<00:02:23.230> where<00:02:23.530> he<00:02:23.560> wants<00:02:23.860> to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
body doesn't mention where he wants to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.390 
body doesn't mention where he wants to
go<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:25.860> considering<00:02:26.860> he<00:02:26.950> doesn't<00:02:27.250> mention

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
go and considering he doesn't mention

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.010 
go and considering he doesn't mention
where<00:02:27.640> he<00:02:27.670> wants<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> go<00:02:28.060> why<00:02:28.600> would<00:02:28.780> he<00:02:28.870> want

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
where he wants to go why would he want

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.380 
where he wants to go why would he want
to<00:02:29.080> go<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.230> our<00:02:29.410> gathi<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.280> if<00:02:30.490> map<00:02:30.850> pack<00:02:31.060> for

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
to go to our gathi so if map pack for

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.880 
to go to our gathi so if map pack for
would<00:02:31.570> be<00:02:31.660> our<00:02:31.780> Gothel<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.380> wouldn't<00:02:32.800> make

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
would be our Gothel that wouldn't make

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.680 
would be our Gothel that wouldn't make
any<00:02:32.950> sense<00:02:33.160> with<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.610> Richthofen<00:02:34.060> side<00:02:34.480> would

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
any sense with the Richthofen side would

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.050 
any sense with the Richthofen side would
it<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.560> what<00:02:35.710> most<00:02:36.010> people<00:02:36.190> have<00:02:36.640> been<00:02:36.760> saying

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
it but what most people have been saying

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.310 
it but what most people have been saying
is<00:02:37.390> France<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.350> map<00:02:38.650> pack<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.400> now<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.810> kind

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
is France is map pack for now this kind

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.430 
is France is map pack for now this kind
of<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.460> my<00:02:42.640> little<00:02:42.850> theory<00:02:43.270> on<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:44.050> map

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
of this is my little theory on the map

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.250 
of this is my little theory on the map
pack<00:02:44.650> for<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.130> being<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.520> France<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.990> all

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
pack for and being in France so all

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.880 
pack for and being in France so all
under<00:02:47.740> France<00:02:48.190> there<00:02:48.940> are<00:02:49.170> catacombs<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
under France there are catacombs the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.670 
under France there are catacombs the
Paris<00:02:51.550> catacombs<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:53.080> these<00:02:53.200> catacombs

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
Paris catacombs and in these catacombs

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.760 
Paris catacombs and in these catacombs
are<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.370> bunch<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.120> tunnels<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.750> we<00:02:56.500> know

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
are a bunch of tunnels and we know

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.370 
are a bunch of tunnels and we know
buried<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.430> already<00:02:57.760> an<00:02:57.880> underground<00:02:58.270> map<00:02:58.540> but

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
buried is already an underground map but

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.350 
buried is already an underground map but
so<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.680> our<00:02:59.800> gathi<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.580> there's<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.000> map<00:03:01.180> pack

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
so is our gathi so if there's a map pack

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.240 
so is our gathi so if there's a map pack
in<00:03:01.510> our<00:03:01.600> gothic<00:03:01.959> be<00:03:02.110> underground<00:03:02.440> still<00:03:02.830> at

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
in our gothic be underground still at

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.210 
in our gothic be underground still at
basically<00:03:04.060> our<00:03:04.270> gathi<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.989> hollow<00:03:05.440> earth<00:03:05.770> or

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
basically our gathi is a hollow earth or

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.449 
basically our gathi is a hollow earth or
the<00:03:06.700> theory<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.060> an<00:03:07.239> hollow<00:03:07.480> earth<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:09.340> if

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
the theory of an hollow earth but if

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.620 
the theory of an hollow earth but if
Maxis<00:03:09.940> wants<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.360> go<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.750> our<00:03:11.650> gathi<00:03:12.209> maybe<00:03:13.209> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
Maxis wants to go in our gathi maybe it

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
Maxis wants to go in our gathi maybe it
the<00:03:14.320> entrance<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:16.060> Paris<00:03:16.570> catacombs<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the entrance is the Paris catacombs and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.130 
the entrance is the Paris catacombs and
this<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.700> why<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:18.940> bring<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.420> up<00:03:19.480> Richthofen

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
this is why I bring this up Richthofen

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.250 
this is why I bring this up Richthofen
doesn't<00:03:20.650> stay<00:03:20.890> our<00:03:21.160> gathi<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.390> like<00:03:23.110> I

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
doesn't stay our gathi and so like I

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.020 
doesn't stay our gathi and so like I
said<00:03:23.320> before<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:24.070> would<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.280> make<00:03:24.400> sense<00:03:24.730> if<00:03:24.880> we

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
said before it would it make sense if we

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.100 
said before it would it make sense if we
will<00:03:25.150> go<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.300> our<00:03:25.480> Gotham<00:03:25.870> with<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
will go to our Gotham with the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.310 
will go to our Gotham with the
Richthofen<00:03:26.470> side<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.520> maybe<00:03:27.760> France<00:03:28.330> is<00:03:28.690> the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
Richthofen side so maybe France is the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.170 
Richthofen side so maybe France is the
Richthofen<00:03:29.739> side<00:03:30.190> part<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.700> you're<00:03:30.760> able<00:03:30.910> to

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
Richthofen side part and you're able to

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.120 
Richthofen side part and you're able to
access<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.780> part<00:03:32.050> of<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.200> map<00:03:32.380> if<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.650> do

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
access that part of the map if you do

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.979 
access that part of the map if you do
the<00:03:33.310> Richthofen<00:03:33.730> side<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.330> Easter<00:03:34.630> egg<00:03:34.720> or

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
the Richthofen side of the Easter egg or

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.440 
the Richthofen side of the Easter egg or
the<00:03:35.170> secret<00:03:35.380> easter<00:03:35.680> egg<00:03:36.040> or<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.000> then<00:03:37.180> our

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
the secret easter egg or and then our

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.780 
the secret easter egg or and then our
gathi<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.530> could<00:03:38.680> access<00:03:39.070> that<00:03:39.130> part<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.700> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
gathi you could access that part of the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.979 
gathi you could access that part of the
map<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.239> then<00:03:40.780> if<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.470> do<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.770> Maxis<00:03:42.370> side

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
map and then if you do the Maxis side

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.900 
map and then if you do the Maxis side
but<00:03:43.989> like<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.350> heard<00:03:44.620> Maxis<00:03:45.370> wants<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.730> go<00:03:45.850> to

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
but like you heard Maxis wants to go to

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.360 
but like you heard Maxis wants to go to
our<00:03:46.060> gathi<00:03:46.300> but<00:03:46.690> Richthofen<00:03:47.470> has<00:03:47.680> no<00:03:47.980> need<00:03:48.220> to

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
our gathi but Richthofen has no need to

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.180 
our gathi but Richthofen has no need to
go<00:03:48.489> out<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:49.000> her<00:03:49.120> gothis<00:03:49.570> oh<00:03:49.780> that's<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:50.920> my

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
go out to her gothis oh that's just my

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.610 
go out to her gothis oh that's just my
logic<00:03:52.060> on<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.360> whole<00:03:52.510> subject<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:53.230> map<00:03:53.410> pack

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
logic on the whole subject of map pack

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.020 
logic on the whole subject of map pack
for<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.420> play<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.570> game<00:03:55.600> central<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.769> course

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.059 
for and play the game central of course
has<00:03:58.300> said<00:03:58.600> in<00:03:58.780> their<00:03:58.930> videos<00:03:59.230> not<00:03:59.680> directly

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
has said in their videos not directly

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.600 
has said in their videos not directly
but<00:04:00.550> they<00:04:01.209> said<00:04:01.630> France<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:02.410> map<00:04:02.830> pack<00:04:03.040> for<00:04:03.340> so

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
but they said France is map pack for so

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.270 
but they said France is map pack for so
maybe<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:05.290> do<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.530> Richthofen<00:04:05.860> side

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
maybe if you do the Richthofen side

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.699 
maybe if you do the Richthofen side
you'll<00:04:06.490> be<00:04:06.640> able<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.880> access<00:04:07.120> France<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.200> if

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
you'll be able to access France and if

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.080 
you'll be able to access France and if
you<00:04:08.800> did<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.040> max<00:04:09.250> aside<00:04:09.640> you'll<00:04:09.910> be

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
you did the max aside you'll be

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.590 
you did the max aside you'll be
accessing<00:04:11.700> our<00:04:12.700> gathi<00:04:14.790> but<00:04:15.790> before<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.299> end

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
accessing our gathi but before I end

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.920 
accessing our gathi but before I end
this<00:04:16.750> video<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.489> only<00:04:18.489> contradiction<00:04:19.480> there

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
this video the only contradiction there

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.409 
this video the only contradiction there
really<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.650> with<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.010> theory<00:04:21.400> is<00:04:21.639> people

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
really is with this theory is people

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.879 
really is with this theory is people
that<00:04:22.540> haven't<00:04:22.750> done<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.110> Easter<00:04:23.440> egg<00:04:23.500> at<00:04:23.680> all

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
that haven't done the Easter egg at all

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.000 
that haven't done the Easter egg at all
or<00:04:24.250> haven't<00:04:24.580> even<00:04:24.700> touched<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.510> mean<00:04:26.200> how<00:04:26.950> do

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
or haven't even touched it I mean how do

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.740 
or haven't even touched it I mean how do
they<00:04:27.250> get<00:04:27.430> on<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.669> map<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.060> mean<00:04:28.240> there's<00:04:28.510> no

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
they get on the map I mean there's no

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.890 
they get on the map I mean there's no
possible<00:04:29.410> way<00:04:29.620> that<00:04:30.040> they<00:04:30.430> could<00:04:30.490> access<00:04:31.150> a

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
possible way that they could access a

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.720 
possible way that they could access a
part<00:04:32.530> of<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.680> map<00:04:32.860> if<00:04:33.040> they<00:04:33.160> don't<00:04:33.430> do<00:04:33.610> the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
part of the map if they don't do the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.270 
part of the map if they don't do the
Easter<00:04:34.000> egg<00:04:34.060> with<00:04:34.300> this<00:04:34.480> theory<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.680> that's

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
Easter egg with this theory so that's

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.400 
Easter egg with this theory so that's
just<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.970> only<00:04:37.150> contradiction<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.169> can't

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
just the only contradiction I can't

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.120 
just the only contradiction I can't
really<00:04:38.560> think<00:04:38.830> of<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.100> solution<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:40.419> um<00:04:41.140> maybe

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
really think of a solution but um maybe

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.650 
really think of a solution but um maybe
it's<00:04:42.460> not<00:04:42.669> just<00:04:42.910> because<00:04:43.030> if<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.390> do<00:04:43.510> the

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
it's not just because if you do the

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.900 
it's not just because if you do the
Easter<00:04:44.020> egg<00:04:44.050> maybe<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.530> could<00:04:44.710> do<00:04:44.919> both<00:04:45.160> maps

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
Easter egg maybe you could do both maps

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.560 
Easter egg maybe you could do both maps
but<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:47.160> story-wise<00:04:48.160> if<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.730> want<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.150> see<00:04:49.450> the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
but I story-wise if you want to see the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.830 
but I story-wise if you want to see the
storyline<00:04:50.080> of<00:04:50.310> this<00:04:51.310> certain<00:04:51.880> map<00:04:52.090> which<00:04:52.630> is

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840
