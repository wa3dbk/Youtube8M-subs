00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.009 
going to work with me and that I
actually<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.569> i'll<00:04:00.569> probably<00:04:00.780> have<00:04:00.930> to

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
actually like so i'll probably have to

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.910 
actually like so i'll probably have to
start<00:04:01.260> trying<00:04:01.440> some<00:04:01.739> soon<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:03.800> then<00:04:04.800> i'm

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
start trying some soon and then i'm

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.770 
start trying some soon and then i'm

using the whole bronzer by benefit and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.090 
using the whole bronzer by benefit and
then<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.860> always<00:04:11.040> take<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.670> from<00:04:12.709> right<00:04:13.709> here

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
then I always take it from right here

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:24.620 
then I always take it from right here
too<00:04:14.459> just<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:16.019> metal<00:04:16.320> my<00:04:16.560> cheek<00:04:16.829> and
