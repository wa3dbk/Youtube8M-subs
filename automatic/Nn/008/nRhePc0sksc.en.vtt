a hollow shaft turns the minute hand and
this<00:01:44.180> would<00:01:44.360> be<00:01:44.540> for<00:01:44.840> removing<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.549> it's<00:01:46.700> a

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
this would be for removing it so it's a

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.380 
this would be for removing it so it's a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.130 
of one today now I believe this is also
a<00:02:13.129> watchmakers<00:02:13.970> tool<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.569> think<00:02:14.599> it<00:02:15.019> is

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
a watchmakers tool and I think it is

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140 
a watchmakers tool and I think it is
like<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> little<00:02:15.769> gear<00:02:16.010> puller<00:02:16.310> or<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.730> pull<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
like a little gear puller or to pull the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.259 
like a little gear puller or to pull the
hands<00:02:17.599> off<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.050> shaft<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.670> clock<00:02:20.000> or

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
hands off of the shaft on a clock or

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.949 
hands off of the shaft on a clock or
something<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.050> nature<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.629> me<00:02:23.930> I

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
something of that nature and I to me I

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.470 
something of that nature and I to me I
think<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.560> when<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:24.980> came<00:02:25.400> across<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:26.060> oh<00:02:26.239> it

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
think that when I came across this oh it

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.920 
think that when I came across this oh it
was<00:02:26.629> in<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> same<00:02:27.080> box<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:28.549> as<00:02:28.910> this<00:02:29.629> was

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
was in the same box of this as this was

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.250 
was in the same box of this as this was
so<00:02:30.230> that's<00:02:30.860> why<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.069> think<00:02:31.190> it's<00:02:31.489> probably<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.819> a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
so that's why I think it's probably a a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.780 
so that's why I think it's probably a a
jeweler's<00:02:33.260> tool<00:02:33.560> nickel<00:02:34.010> plated<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.610> got<00:02:34.760> a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
jeweler's tool nickel plated it's got a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.690 
jeweler's tool nickel plated it's got a
Assessor<00:02:35.780> cago<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:36.769> got<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.950> real

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
Assessor cago on it and it's got a real

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.190 
Assessor cago on it and it's got a real
old<00:02:37.940> patent<00:02:38.420> date<00:02:38.629> and<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:38.989> rather

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
old patent date and it's rather

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.350 
old patent date and it's rather
precision<00:02:39.920> made<00:02:40.099> but<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.910> know<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> me<00:02:41.269> it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
precision made but you know to me it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.479 
precision made but you know to me it
looks<00:02:41.540> just<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.930> tiny<00:02:42.349> little<00:02:42.530> gear

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
looks just like a tiny little gear

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.050 
looks just like a tiny little gear
puller<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:45.040> there's<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.130> dimple<00:02:46.340> on<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.849> end

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
puller and there's a dimple on that end

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.479 
puller and there's a dimple on that end
I<00:02:47.209> suppose<00:02:47.269> for<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.840> little<00:02:48.110> shaft<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.890> go<00:02:49.040> into

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
I suppose for a little shaft to go into

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.370 
I suppose for a little shaft to go into
if<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:50.150> know<00:02:50.269> what<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.660> put<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
if you know what that is put it in the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.190 
if you know what that is put it in the
comments<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.069> believe<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.610> a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
comments but I believe it's a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.199 
comments but I believe it's a
watchmakers<00:02:54.200> tool<00:02:54.230> for<00:02:54.829> possibly<00:02:55.819> pulling<00:02:56.030> a

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
watchmakers tool for possibly pulling a

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.449 
watchmakers tool for possibly pulling a
little<00:02:56.690> gear<00:02:56.900> off<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.410> shaft<00:02:57.650> or<00:02:58.010> or<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
little gear off of a shaft or or the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.020 
little gear off of a shaft or or the
hands<00:02:59.030> off<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.780> shaft<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.819> give<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:01.849> a

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
hands off of the shaft so give that a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.990 
hands off of the shaft so give that a
try<00:03:02.269> also<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:02.989> then<00:03:03.079> be<00:03:03.200> sure<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.500> watch<00:03:04.000> this

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
try also and then be sure and watch this

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.170 
try also and then be sure and watch this
series<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.049> continue<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.819> week<00:03:08.000> or

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
series as I continue here in a week or

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.890 
series as I continue here in a week or
so<00:03:08.329> with<00:03:08.890> 11a<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.819> next<00:03:11.180> mystery<00:03:11.690> tool

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
so with 11a and the next mystery tool

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.430 
so with 11a and the next mystery tool
and<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.950> tool<00:03:13.190> cane<00:03:13.519> saying<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:15.260> long

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
and this is a tool cane saying so long

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.889 
and this is a tool cane saying so long
for<00:03:15.769> now
