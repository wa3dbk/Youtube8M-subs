00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
you or the three in the Intel are on

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.700 
you or the three in the Intel are on
flipped<00:00:06.270> anger<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.839> mountain<00:00:07.140> clear<00:00:07.319> too

so<00:00:14.540> when<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.630> come<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> Jeep<00:00:16.289> or<00:00:16.650> head

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so when you come to the Jeep or head

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:29.710 
so when you come to the Jeep or head
towards<00:00:17.190> your<00:00:17.369> first<00:00:17.699> march<00:00:18.320> objective

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.240 

someone's<00:00:30.720> me<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.930> this<00:00:31.050> Jeep<00:00:31.320> luck<00:00:31.590> self<00:00:32.070> take

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
someone's me to this Jeep luck self take

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
someone's me to this Jeep luck self take
out<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:32.640> guy

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.410 

if<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.380> does

all right so you're gonna get to this
building<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.610> here<00:01:02.690> right<00:01:03.690> down<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
building right here right down the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.070 
building right here right down the
Jeep's<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.440> see<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.739> building<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
Jeep's to see this building it's on up

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.100 
Jeep's to see this building it's on up
the<00:01:07.170> ladder<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.869> already

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the ladder and as you can see I already

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.080 
the ladder and as you can see I already
got<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.440> Intel<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.130> it'll<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
got the Intel but it'll be right here in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.890 
got the Intel but it'll be right here in
this<00:01:12.150> corner<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.220> that'll<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> first

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
this corner and that'll be the first

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.160 
this corner and that'll be the first
Intel<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.830> mission<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> max<00:01:21.960> head

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
Intel out of this mission so max head

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.320 
Intel out of this mission so max head
towards<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.530> feeling<00:01:22.830> station<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
towards the feeling station for this

00:01:24.330 --> 00:02:09.440 
towards the feeling station for this
next<00:01:24.570> objective

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.050 

so<00:02:09.960> after<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:11.009> putting<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.490> charge<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
so after that putting a charge on the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.720 
so after that putting a charge on the
feeling<00:02:12.480> tradestation<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.709> go<00:02:14.400> towards<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
feeling tradestation and go towards the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.270 
feeling tradestation and go towards the
next<00:02:14.970> market<00:02:15.270> objective<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:16.280> maneuver

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
next market objective but maneuver

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:33.930 
next market objective but maneuver
around<00:02:17.400> these<00:02:17.700> two<00:02:17.880> guys

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.080 

so<00:02:34.480> instead<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.050> going<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.070> objective<00:02:36.520> let

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so instead of going to the objective let

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.020 
so instead of going to the objective let
me<00:02:37.180> drop<00:02:37.360> down<00:02:38.220> go<00:02:39.220> you're<00:02:39.430> right

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
me drop down go you're right

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.450 
me drop down go you're right
and<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.740> this<00:02:42.180> window<00:02:43.180> right<00:02:43.390> here<00:02:44.460> you

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
and go to this window right here you

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.710 
and go to this window right here you
know<00:02:45.610> if<00:02:45.700> you're<00:02:45.820> on<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> head<00:02:46.240> spot<00:02:46.480> you'll

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
know if you're on the head spot you'll

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.120 
know if you're on the head spot you'll
see<00:02:46.870> some<00:02:47.020> workers<00:02:47.320> working<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.710> jet

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
see some workers working on the jet

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.000 
see some workers working on the jet
although<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.630> slice<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.440> window<00:02:50.710> open

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
although I just slice this window open

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.140 
although I just slice this window open
and<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> Intel<00:02:51.580> will<00:02:51.670> be<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
and the Intel will be right on the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.420 
and the Intel will be right on the
sparrow<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.750> that'll<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.740> second<00:02:54.130> intel

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
sparrow and that'll be the second intel

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.589 
sparrow and that'll be the second intel
on<00:02:54.670> clipping<00:02:55.180> here

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.860 

third<00:03:02.110> Intel<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.769> farther<00:03:03.269> down<00:03:04.269> in<00:03:04.659> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
third Intel is farther down in the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.610 
third Intel is farther down in the
mission<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.530> during<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.010> snow<00:03:06.189> meal<00:03:06.340> part

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
mission it's during the snow meal part

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.530 
mission it's during the snow meal part
you<00:03:08.620> got<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.890> keep<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.040> sharp<00:03:09.250> eye<00:03:09.459> it's<00:03:10.269> out<00:03:10.450> in

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
you got to keep a sharp eye it's out in

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.940 
you got to keep a sharp eye it's out in
the<00:03:10.569> middle<00:03:10.629> of<00:03:10.870> woods<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.470> don't<00:03:11.739> know<00:03:11.799> why

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
the middle of woods I don't know why

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.000 
the middle of woods I don't know why
they<00:03:12.129> put<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.400> there<00:03:12.549> but<00:03:12.790> they<00:03:13.360> do<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:17.010> let's

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:45.940 
they put it there but they do so let's
help<00:03:18.280> kill<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:18.610> guy

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.290 

this<00:03:46.950> part<00:03:47.190> tends<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.460> get<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.610> little<00:03:47.730> late<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
this part tends to get a little late the

00:03:48.300 --> 00:04:10.479 
this part tends to get a little late the
game<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.370> sorry<00:03:50.370> about<00:03:50.490> that

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.690 

so<00:04:10.969> make<00:04:11.180> your<00:04:11.299> way<00:04:11.450> towards<00:04:12.189> the<00:04:13.189> end<00:04:13.219> of<00:04:13.489> the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
so make your way towards the end of the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.620 
so make your way towards the end of the
airstrip

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:36.110 

you<00:04:17.630> take<00:04:17.810> my<00:04:17.930> time<00:04:18.109> here<00:04:18.259> said<00:04:18.470> I'm<00:04:18.560> dying

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:05:00.850 

nice<00:04:36.630> little<00:04:36.840> explosion<00:04:37.380> right<00:04:37.470> there

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860
