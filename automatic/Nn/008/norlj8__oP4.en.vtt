00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.390
 details and that the grip is very 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.100
 joking 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.100

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.200

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.880

 your own ship to choose between 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.240
 the dark side and the purity of the order 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.050
 so jedi to master over 40 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.000
 different powers 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.160
 to note finally that the game is not 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.780
 available only in English and that 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.009
 two gigas enemy of open spaces are 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.610
 needed to turn it into 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.610
 the best conditions 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 incredible jack it's over thirty 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.120
 seven levels to explore divided into 7 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.730
 world 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.500
 on the menu so power-ups and parts 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.290
 to collect as quickly as possible 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.940
 not to mention bosses to face a 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.310
 late-game action mix of 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.780
 platform and puzzle with moreover 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.000
 many references to sonic and mario 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.229
 all led by the maul of the game 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.229
 mobile chili nov 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.970
 only available on iphone 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.830
 jetbrains puts you in the shoes of 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.590
 clown programmed to search and 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.360
 destroy reactors and a half with his 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.459
 very accessible gameplay based on 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 the explosion of adverse elements of 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.000
 speed of action in addition to being tinted 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.100
 of the principle of a stained glass debate 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.209
 this title could also seduce his 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.209
 world by its inspired design 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.560
 here is a game to the old school universe and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.209
 with a design strongly reminiscent of 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.819
 8-bit consoles that might well 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.560
 delighted lovers of gender too 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.569
 well intended for video game briscard 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.129
 that youngest this title makes you 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.079
 embody a machine to crush the 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.420
 more enemies possible in order to 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.219
 get the best scores in brief 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.870
 slam bolt is easy to handle 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.870
 but very difficult to master 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.610
 it's no secret to anyone 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.989
 videogame adaptations of movies are 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.060
 generally far from being at the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.190
 height and we'll see in this test 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.470
 if world war z manages to shoot his 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.550
 Pin 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.950
 from the start what strikes the player is 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.140
 the quality of the graphics with particular 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.519
 beautiful effects lights a very number 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.799
 respectable zombies displayed 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.200
 simultaneously on the screen and all without 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.670
 the slightest slowdown but in there 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.140
 looking closer we realize that 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.330
 some textures suffers from a lack 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.890
 cruel care and that there is only one 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.650
 little half dozen models of 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.239
 undead cloned to infinity 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.799
 next to that the different types of 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.180
 present controls promotes the taking into 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.250
 hand for all types of players 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.750
 all with built gameplay 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.030
 around exploration phases for 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.099
 to find weapons and ammunition from 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.519
 little puzzle like here to open a 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.140
 door or even fight and precisely 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.859
 if remote games are pretty 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.480
 friendly 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.700
 it is rather the close combat that 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.439
 are boring because of their extreme 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.120
 redundancy and level of their 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:51.049
 difficulties that we guess complicated 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.819
 for the sole purpose of slowing down the player 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.440
 because in the end world war z ends in 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.540
 about five hours in a straight line 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.760
 a life certainly respectable for 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.340
 a mobile game although ultimately enough 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.109
 disappointing if we base ourselves on its price 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.819
 also note an anecdotal scenario 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.400
 punctuated with subtitle full of errors 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.439
 but despite all world war z has 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.720
 strong assets with its lead 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.340
 atmosphere its scattered bonuses a little 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.229
 everywhere to learn a little more 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.419
 on the film and its system 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.949
 of saving weapons for 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.680
 to deal with ever more zombies 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.260
 tough at the end of the day it's a small 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.820
 6 out of 10 for this world war z 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.340
 despite good ideas and a 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.020
 rather respectable achievement this title 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.060
 fails to reconcile the games 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.640
 based on their movies is this because of 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.320
 many mistakes in sum a 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.860
 production released prematurely in the 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.450
 nature 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:46.770
 to make the spectators wait 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.590
 is leaving today on the trailer of 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.800
 Renew road adventure scheduled June 6 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.850
 next at the price of 4 euros 49 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.200
 as for me I tell you on Saturday 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.850
 next for new releases of 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.620
 ios games and by then you can

 find the previous episodes on the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.750
 digital point website like on this 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.740
