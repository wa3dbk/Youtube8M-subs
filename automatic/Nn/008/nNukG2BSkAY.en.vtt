00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
definitely a you know rugged plastic on

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.210 
definitely a you know rugged plastic on
there<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.040> not

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.740 
removable you can pry it up great in
there<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.620> actually<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> dual-core<00:01:08.370> TI

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
there so this is actually a dual-core TI

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.690 
there so this is actually a dual-core TI
OMAP<00:01:09.750> processor<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.950> believe<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.640> still

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
OMAP processor I believe it's still

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
OMAP processor I believe it's still
running<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.300> sure<00:01:12.660> which<00:01:13.230> one<00:01:13.440> it<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
running I'm not sure which one it is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.030 
running I'm not sure which one it is
exactly<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.560> tickets

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
exactly but yeah to get you some tickets

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
exactly but yeah to get you some tickets
of<00:01:17.100> RAM<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.940> got<00:01:18.180> three<00:01:18.840> tickets<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
of RAM and it's got three tickets of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
of RAM and it's got three tickets of
onboard<00:01:19.530> storage<00:01:19.800> here<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.940> what

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
onboard storage here we go this is what

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210 
onboard storage here we go this is what
I<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.210> looking<00:01:21.480> for<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:22.320> right<00:01:22.800> here<00:01:23.010> at<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I was looking for so right here at the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.620 
I was looking for so right here at the
top<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.180> there's<00:01:24.510> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
top you can see there that there's a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.130 
top you can see there that there's a
micro<00:01:25.020> USB<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:25.620> there's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
micro USB and then there's

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.310 
micro USB and then there's
you<00:01:26.770> can<00:01:26.920> see<00:01:27.130> exactly<00:01:27.880> how<00:01:28.180> thick<00:01:28.540> the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
you can see exactly how thick the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.649 
you can see exactly how thick the
recognized<00:01:29.680> exterior<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.940> so<00:01:31.180> we're<00:01:31.390> able<00:01:31.510> to

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
recognized exterior is so we're able to

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.070 
recognized exterior is so we're able to
drop<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.140> from<00:01:32.500> 5<00:01:33.280> feet<00:01:33.640> onto<00:01:34.060> concrete<00:01:34.600> I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
drop this from 5 feet onto concrete I

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.590 
drop this from 5 feet onto concrete I
think<00:01:35.409> 6<00:01:35.650> feet<00:01:35.860> onto<00:01:36.040> wood<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.640> maybe<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.479> can

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
think 6 feet onto wood and maybe you can

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.640 
think 6 feet onto wood and maybe you can
drop<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:37.840> off<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:37.990> second-story<00:01:38.409> if<00:01:38.530> you're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
drop it off the second-story if you're

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.469 
drop it off the second-story if you're
gonna<00:01:38.740> drop<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.040> onto<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.460> carpet<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.210> much

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
gonna drop it onto the carpet that much

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.969 
gonna drop it onto the carpet that much
sure<00:01:40.690> then<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.320> didn't<00:01:41.530> actually<00:01:41.619> give<00:01:41.950> that

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
sure then it didn't actually give that

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.760 
sure then it didn't actually give that

here<00:01:58.810> at<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.020> back<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.970> because<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.210> kind

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
here at the back that because it is kind

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.300 
here at the back that because it is kind
of<00:02:01.539> sticking<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.899> little<00:02:02.080> bit<00:02:02.200> heavy<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:03.009> again

of sticking a little bit heavy and again
we<00:02:03.430> have<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.880> I<00:02:03.970> think<00:02:04.360> this<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.570> an<00:02:04.690> 8<00:02:04.810> megapixel

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
we have a I think this is an 8 megapixel

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.620 
we have a I think this is an 8 megapixel
shooter<00:02:05.289> with<00:02:05.649> an<00:02:05.770> LED<00:02:05.920> flash<00:02:06.130> here<00:02:06.970> the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
shooter with an LED flash here the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.759 
shooter with an LED flash here the
display<00:02:07.990> resolution<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.860> 1024<00:02:09.869> by<00:02:10.869> 600<00:02:11.290> so

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
display resolution is 1024 by 600 so

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.100 
display resolution is 1024 by 600 so
it's<00:02:12.070> nothing<00:02:12.250> too<00:02:12.580> crazy<00:02:12.760> but<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.810> does<00:02:13.959> have
