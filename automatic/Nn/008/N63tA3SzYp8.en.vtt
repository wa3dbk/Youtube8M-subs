00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
change it but it works fine in

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.670

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
carbon-fiber

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.010 
carbon-fiber
it's<00:00:50.220> pretty<00:00:50.430> quick<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:56.690> I've<00:00:57.690> already<00:00:57.870> made

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it's pretty quick so I've already made

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.230 
it's pretty quick so I've already made
the<00:00:58.140> inlays<00:00:58.520> now<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.880> cutting<00:01:00.150> the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
the inlays now I'm just cutting the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:02:27.360 
the inlays now I'm just cutting the
pattern

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.339 

well<00:02:28.370> two<00:02:28.640> minutes<00:02:28.909> 50<00:02:29.150> seconds<00:02:29.569> isn't<00:02:29.750> bad

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.479 

and<00:02:33.349> then<00:02:33.469> I<00:02:33.590> like<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:33.920> while<00:02:34.370> they're

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
and then I like to just while they're

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.190 
and then I like to just while they're
already<00:02:34.760> glued<00:02:34.969> down<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.540> easier<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.989> say

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
already glued down it's easier to say

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.289 
already glued down it's easier to say
them<00:02:36.439> then<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.519> holding<00:02:37.879> them<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.209> your

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
them then when holding them in your

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.099 
them then when holding them in your
hands<00:02:42.609> let's<00:02:43.609> discuss<00:02:43.939> some<00:02:44.120> 400<00:02:44.659> wet-dry
