00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
shoulders as well but I find that it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.059

it's<00:03:13.599> not<00:03:13.840> as<00:03:14.019> comfortable<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.739> like

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
it's not as comfortable so I like

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.379 
it's not as comfortable so I like
wearing<00:03:15.280> them<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.790> shoulders<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:17.069> um<00:03:18.389> the

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
wearing them on the shoulders and um the

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:28.080 
wearing them on the shoulders and um the
material<00:03:20.079> is<00:03:20.290> polyester<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:23.190> spandex<00:03:27.090> so

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
material is polyester and spandex so

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.960 
material is polyester and spandex so
here<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.930> black<00:03:29.440> Rouge<00:03:29.980> zipper<00:03:30.609> collar
