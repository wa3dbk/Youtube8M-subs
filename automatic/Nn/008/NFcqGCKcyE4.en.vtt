00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 The question how to be tattooed 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.350
 People are pretty often asked 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.879
 get a meaning 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.300
 that really should have been accurate 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.769
 I know this question today 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.880
 the subject must have a tattoo 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.800
 There are several 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.590
 views there are those who say that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.080
 okay, I'll get a tattoo 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.670
 really just from the point it should 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 really a deep meaning for me 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 and I want to be wise 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.060
 So you always keep with me 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.679
 wear with me and always at this arena 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.450
 while, for example, when the grandmother 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.700
 then maybe that's what died 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.829
 portrait die that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.629
 date of birth et cetera something to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.540
 souvenirs or, for example, according to the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.899
 birth of a child etc then there is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.030
 but also these people who tell me 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.710
 it completely does not matter my tattoo needs 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.530
 have no meaning to me is that supposed 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.180
 I like it so easy 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 tattoo xy because I do that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.390
 have seen somewhere or because I am 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.760
 that has thought up and because it is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.920
 I really like it and then 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 there is still the third category 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 Of course the categories are all 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.510
 somehow mixed together and you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.700
 can not do that in a drawer right now 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.630
 but I just give you that way 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.070
 a reason overview what i am so in now 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.420
 so has gained experience with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.170
 foreign exchange people 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 it sounds like it's in a category 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 this label is labels and then 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.360
 there is the third division of the people 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.310
 say I see 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.980
 Government really has as art and 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.730
 go for a tattoo artist and leave the 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.260
 completely free hand and that one stops 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.360
 really ok I do one 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.220
 tattoo artist style that we would have 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.560
 really like and therefore would like 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.360
 have something of this tattoo artist 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.100
 In general, I do not really care 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.170
 whether the me now a quietscheente 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.380
 tattooed or if the me a word pad 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.200
 I do not care 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.100
 and now you wonder to determined 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.610
 which category i have to i 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.080
 say with me the theme changes I am 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.000
 because she's such a mischmash 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.440
 categories and that's how it works 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.229
 Of course , most of the same with 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.300
 this overarching of the categories 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.970
 I have some tattoos that have for 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.739
 me a pretty deep meaning though 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.470
 Of course, this meaning is also important 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.270
 always so deep 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.770
 depends on the person on how to do it 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.000
 I feel like I can say now 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.770
 for me it is a pretty deep one 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.220
 meaning tells that her husband is her 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.410
 but still reduces is of course the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.150
 meaning of a tattoo not at all 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.920
 just because others do not just think it has 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.630
 therefore no great importance 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.610
 That's why one can still do it for me 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.489
 have a big meaning as for example 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.290
 Here you on my wrist the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.870
 pretty much in the last video too 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.670
 fallen in a youtube video and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 many thought but it is not new is 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.310
 and that is an idea which the lead in 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.790
 Cologne shows a heart and ethno for 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.709
 my little town cologne 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.060
 and of course it's one for me 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.709
 deep meaning I did my very 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.540
 I do not think so because I am now 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.080
 really nice place that is 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.090
 Of course not nice win but the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.220
 Meaning stood there in the foreground 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.160
 another tattoo of mine for example my 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.050
 thighs in Schwaan 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.760
 I do not care about that at all 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.580
 hang out a meaning 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.560
 my tattoo artist had it from here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.880
 blood craft had simply said yes 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.760
 I found it so funny to get tattooed 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.440
 and not from me I 'm successful 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.730
 love your work naturally 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.319
 I like and that's why I have now 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.450
 once after the thigh of course 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.890
 you can always say okay maybe 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.510
 is after all a meaning of 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.160
 Hintermann could become everyone now 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.319
 tool can somehow be one 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.780
 meaning from the fingers new is the 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.060
 ask if that is necessary I hold it 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.739
 not necessary but if you are then 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.130
 would like to have an answer to the question 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.570
 what becomes so important 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.459
 maybe some would like to stop then 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.079
 simply that they have a meaning behind it 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.730
 I can not explain that 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.130
 but you could say for example now 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.700
 okay I have a black zo us 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.859
 leave because I was on the high school of 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.720
 island was called Ugly duckling and 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.150
 That's why I have a nice one now 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.280
 Schwan has tattooed 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.169
 otherwise history was added 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.770
 not the meaning of the title but that 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.300
 a bit ugly and that's why I am 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.160
 I'm really such a mixed-media guy 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.409
 then leave me in germany 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.300
 tattoo or let me tell you 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.339
 tattoo with me that many tattoo artists 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.289
 like it is already with numerous 

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.909
 The comments like that makes you like 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.949
 yours decides or if you do not 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.139
 Tattoos family will decide if you 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.610
 that for a moment 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.779
 tattoo or because you 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.879
 you guys, the operas or me 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.509
 just like the motive or everything 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.189
 together 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:55.719
 Of course that's the dak that sounds 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.539
 always as if judging it 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:00.610
 if this is much worse in view 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.989
 teltow without meaning to tattoo what 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.309
 Of course it is not the case 

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:06.039
 left to everyone 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:07.929
 and therefore everyone should also be free 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.879
 decide if he just something 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:11.169
 would have something meaningful almost 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:14.229
 it does not mean anything to him 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.639
 Like and like outlet centers and 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.069
 then give the video a thumb 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.239
 up when I again or wild when I 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.579
 to make a new video 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:23.169
 about the meaning of my tattoos and 

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:24.939
 then I would say see you in the 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.009
 next video click to the last petto 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.019
 block and clicks here for one sets 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.879
 and piercing do it yourself and then 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:34.409
 not if you do not know me yet and 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.409
 then we'll see each other in the next video
