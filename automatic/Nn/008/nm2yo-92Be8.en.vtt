and 1 grain so I'm using 6 in fact we
should<00:02:59.930> use<00:03:00.380> around<00:03:00.800> 6<00:03:01.460> or<00:03:01.870> more<00:03:02.870> more<00:03:03.080> than<00:03:03.290> 6

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
should use around 6 or more more than 6

look at the texture so I like it like

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.310 
look at the texture so I like it like
mushy<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.180> will<00:03:26.360> take<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.750> proportion<00:03:27.260> of

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
mushy if you will take a proportion of

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.890 
mushy if you will take a proportion of
threes<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.860> one<00:03:28.070> like<00:03:28.340> three<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.300> water<00:03:29.570> and
