 the menu in action a united nations television program 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.359
 the ultimatum of the territory 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.359
 the scene and his brother came in large numbers

 productivity figures at cannes in tunisia 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.779
 he hunts like other fishermen did during 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.119
 centuries before 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.029
 fake the charter is a traditional fishing method and this is the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.029
 best method because it does not harm the house 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.070
 walls made of palm leaves placed perpendicular to the current 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.760
 offers a complex case system that has one that is created for channel + and the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.950
 contaminated meat fish 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.330
 but the protesters are no longer as filled counter-offer 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.330
 a little scared to power in 1986 the sharka allow me to bring back between 150 and 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.720
 200 beds and sometimes even 300 kilos of fish per day 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 but now I bring back more than 2 kilos and 2003 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.190
 the earnings of the sharka fishermen and their ancestral way of life 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.030
 are not the only ones to be threatened here because the survival of one of the most 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
 great sea grasslands in the world is also endangered 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.640
 the couple confronted with the French if the factory of the week towards flour or 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.430
 groundfish offside and she was once such a structure that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.890
 is for the thirteen thousand inhabitants of the island who could earn money 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.080
 but they are now more of having some cities of all life 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.740
 Marine 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.140
 several facts are the cause of which marine pollution caused by a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.520
 unregulated development of the region 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 and by warming coastal waters 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 but the most destructive cause has been the increase in the number of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.979
 motor fishing boats that practice forms of plague missiles like the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.720
 bottom trawling 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.030
 a bit like the big boats came and caught up with all the fish 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 these fishermen all have violent behavior with the hand 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.979
 Heavy deschenes rake the bottom of the sea and recall all the vegetation 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.979
 by picking up nets all that is in their path

 unable to make a living a lot of islanders are not 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.849
 eligible on the continent 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.870
 what will remain as the saint and her family face a dark future 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.410
 Assistant 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.379
 days and assad's father of the same currency 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 the sea is not what it was 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.929
 we won there because my sons must become beggars 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.029
 where is it necessary to work on a big potential to make the 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.029
 bottom trawling to feed the family 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.759
 to protect their fishing grounds the fishermen from riding have 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.759
 started making cement blocks that he throws into the sea 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.720
 however we can huh 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.950
 abdelkader ababou indicated the national coordinator of the program 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.249
 Global Microcredit 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.329
 I am in the article 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.369
 with 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.040
 say about the surroundings 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.269
 they are not 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.069
 contactor 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.489
 employment and total output 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.839
 as a reminder of the intrigued the feder one must remain very careful 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.779
 the cement blocks we followed 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.419
 all young marine organisms can shelter 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.289
 thanks to microcredit programs and the initial success of their attention 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.980
 the fishermen intend to develop their efforts for others 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.719
 communities 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.729
 it does not work like that we have to protect the area a parcel to the 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:33.250
 time 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.780
 I'm not saying that we will succeed in its limbs in a closed angle 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.919
 with the rules of the wto 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.379
 we will get there in two years at the same time 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.120
 I'm going to sacrifice myself he just released everything I've 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.749
 I will not give up no
