what then going to do is I put the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.789 
what then going to do is I put the
behavior<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.960> each<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.289> button<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
behavior on each of the button so that

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.709 
behavior on each of the button so that
it<00:01:37.979> skips<00:01:38.280> us<00:01:38.460> along<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> timeline<00:01:39.149> to<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
it skips us along the timeline to the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.569 
it skips us along the timeline to the
next<00:01:39.990> photograph<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> clean<00:01:41.490> up

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
next photograph so if I have a clean up

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.649 
next photograph so if I have a clean up
in<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> timeline<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> next

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
in the timeline i can see that the next

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
your photographs are on the timeline for

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.710 
your photographs are on the timeline for
what<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.000> jump<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> next

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
what we can then do is jump to the next

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.710 
what we can then do is jump to the next
stage<00:02:31.230> 80<00:02:31.590> insert<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> keyframe<00:02:32.630> onto<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
stage 80 insert a keyframe onto the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.890 
stage 80 insert a keyframe onto the
timeline<00:02:36.620> then<00:02:37.620> we<00:02:37.680> need<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.830> change<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
timeline then we need to change the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.030 
timeline then we need to change the
places<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:39.930> these<00:02:40.140> skip<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.920> next

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
places that these skip to so the next

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.059 
places that these skip to so the next
one<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.580> jump<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.030> 160<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.739> right<00:02:43.890> hand

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
one is to jump to 160 on the right hand

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.050 
one is to jump to 160 on the right hand
side<00:02:44.159> button<00:02:44.610> which

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
side button which

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.370 
side button which
change<00:02:46.069> like<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:48.840> left<00:02:49.050> button

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
change like that and the left button

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.900 
change like that and the left button
needs<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.800> go<00:02:49.920> back<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> start<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.700> go<00:02:50.790> back

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
needs to go back to the start to go back

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.520 
needs to go back to the start to go back
to<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.030> original<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.930> baton<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.290> one

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
to the original one so the baton is one

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.880 
to the original one so the baton is one
and<00:02:53.930> then<00:02:54.930> finally<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.500> last<00:02:55.680> video

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
and then finally for the last video

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.690 
and then finally for the last video
we'll<00:02:56.310> put<00:02:56.489> an<00:02:56.580> extra<00:02:56.760> key<00:02:56.970> frame<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.390> at<00:02:58.459> 160

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.449 

so<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.300> time<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:04.650> right<00:03:04.860> hand<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.130> needs<00:03:05.340> to

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
so this time the right hand but needs to

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.150 
so this time the right hand but needs to
skip<00:03:05.700> back<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> start<00:03:06.480> which<00:03:06.750> would<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.160> go

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
skip back to the start which would be go

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.640 
skip back to the start which would be go
to<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.519> play<00:03:08.610> one<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.200> then<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.319> one<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to and play one and then the one on the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.190 
to and play one and then the one on the
left<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.000> drop<00:03:12.150> back<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.599> photograph

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
left is going to drop back to photograph

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.390 
left is going to drop back to photograph
to<00:03:13.470> which<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.459> at<00:03:14.580> 80<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.890> it's<00:03:17.010> pretty<00:03:17.310> much

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
to which is at 80 and it's pretty much

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.570 
to which is at 80 and it's pretty much
as<00:03:17.549> simple<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.180> if<00:03:18.269> we<00:03:18.390> go<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:19.580> let's

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
as simple as that so if we go to let's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.309 
as simple as that so if we go to let's
test<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:20.940> now<00:03:21.239> test<00:03:21.720> movie<00:03:24.019> as<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.140> can<00:03:25.200> see

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
test that now test movie as you can see

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.930 
test that now test movie as you can see
the<00:03:25.440> pictures<00:03:25.709> will<00:03:25.830> rotate<00:03:26.250> automatically

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
the pictures will rotate automatically

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.479 
the pictures will rotate automatically
as<00:03:27.390> normal<00:03:27.720> but<00:03:27.840> if<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:28.019> want<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.319> skip<00:03:28.590> around

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
as normal but if we want to skip around

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.009 
as normal but if we want to skip around
the<00:03:29.640> photographs<00:03:30.120> we<00:03:30.989> can<00:03:31.200> do<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:33.930> how

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
the photographs we can do so that's how

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.140 
the photographs we can do so that's how
to<00:03:34.080> do<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.260> very<00:03:34.380> basic<00:03:34.620> slideshow<00:03:35.610> tutorial

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
to do a very basic slideshow tutorial

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.259 
to do a very basic slideshow tutorial
with<00:03:36.620> back<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.980> next<00:03:38.280> buttons<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.180> can

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
with back and next buttons and you can

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.490 
with back and next buttons and you can
see<00:03:39.420> Taylor<00:03:39.569> stage<00:03:39.810> further<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.349> add

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
see Taylor stage further and add

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.759 
see Taylor stage further and add
different<00:03:41.099> rollovers<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.849> your<00:03:41.970> buttons<00:03:42.299> and

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
different rollovers to your buttons and

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.930 
different rollovers to your buttons and

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
you know and play around with making

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.400 
you know and play around with making
them<00:03:45.060> skip<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:45.690> also<00:03:45.959> see<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
them skip so that you also see the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.340 
them skip so that you also see the
fading<00:03:46.830> transition<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.459> well<00:03:47.580> if<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.819> wish<00:03:48.000> so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350
