00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
there's obviously always a concern when

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.100 
there's obviously always a concern when
there<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> clash<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.579> it's

and<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> course<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.620> also<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.100> little<00:00:44.370> bit

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and of course it's also that little bit

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
and of course it's also that little bit
worrying<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.870> good<00:00:46.020> news<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.410> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
course but we concussion do the medical

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
course but we concussion do the medical
staff<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.530> maybe<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.100> ought<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> give<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
staff think maybe you ought to give a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.170 
staff think maybe you ought to give a
rest<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> ruling<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.000> think

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
rest I think that the the ruling I think

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.700 
rest I think that the the ruling I think
it's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> little<00:01:00.390> bit<00:01:00.510> different<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.170> perhaps

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it's a little bit different to perhaps

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's a little bit different to perhaps
other<00:01:01.980> sports<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.430> rugby<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:04.140> it's

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
other sports like rugby it's it's it's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
other sports like rugby it's it's it's
just<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.460> symptoms<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:06.840> sure

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
just about symptoms and to make sure

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.250 
just about symptoms and to make sure
that<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:08.130> absolutely<00:01:08.700> clear<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.049> no

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that is is absolutely clear you know no

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.490 
that is is absolutely clear you know no
headaches<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.640> no<00:01:12.479> dizziness<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:13.200> or

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
headaches and no dizziness or or

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.880 
headaches and no dizziness or or
anything<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.210> were<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.229> conscious<00:01:16.560> here

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
anything but we were very conscious here

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.280 
anything but we were very conscious here
that<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> make<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.810> decision

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that we have to make the right decision

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.990 
that we have to make the right decision
because<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.909> about

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
because it's not it's not just about

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
because it's not it's not just about
what<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> about<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> well-being<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
what we want is about the well-being of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.760 
what we want is about the well-being of
of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.820> player<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> making<00:01:24.810> sure<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> club

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
of the player and making sure as a club

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.830 
of the player and making sure as a club
and<00:01:25.920> particularly<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> medical<00:01:27.360> staff<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and particularly as a medical staff that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
and particularly as a medical staff that
we<00:01:27.900> do<00:01:28.020> things<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.710> weak<00:01:29.159> mortals<00:01:29.490> adapt

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
we do things right so weak mortals adapt

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
we do things right so weak mortals adapt
then<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> doubt<00:01:31.409> yes<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
then it would be a doubt yes and what I

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.780 
then it would be a doubt yes and what I
mean<00:01:33.000> Raymond<00:01:33.479> you've<00:01:33.900> got<00:01:34.549> it<00:01:35.549> would<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
mean Raymond you've got it would be a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.600 
mean Raymond you've got it would be a
doubt<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.150> well<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.509> um<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> muscle

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
doubt as well it's um it's just a muscle

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.550 
doubt as well it's um it's just a muscle
injury<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.659> he's<00:01:39.780> hit<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
injury and he's hit which is which is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.270 
injury and he's hit which is which is
quite<00:01:40.829> an<00:01:40.950> unusual<00:01:41.720> one<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.320> but

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
quite an unusual one to do but but

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.100 
quite an unusual one to do but but
certainly<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.820> stage<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.780> anybody

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
certainly at that stage for anybody

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.350 
certainly at that stage for anybody
who's<00:01:46.530> who's<00:01:46.979> had<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.250> injury<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.210> one

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
who's who's had that injury it's not one

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.270 
who's who's had that injury it's not one
that<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.840> continue<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.560> he<00:01:49.770> came<00:01:49.979> off<00:01:50.130> at

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that you can continue so he came off at

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.399 
that you can continue so he came off at
the<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.729> time<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the right time and it's really going to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
the right time and it's really going to
be<00:01:52.470> about<00:01:52.590> how<00:01:52.799> quickly<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> settles<00:01:53.729> down

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
be about how quickly that settles down

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.090 
be about how quickly that settles down
so<00:01:54.210> another<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.530> would<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so another one that that would be a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.330 
so another one that that would be a
doubt<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.810> always<00:01:58.799> we'll<00:01:58.979> give<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
doubt but some as always we'll give the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670 
doubt but some as always we'll give the
players<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.000> every<00:02:00.450> opportunity<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
players you know every opportunity and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.100 
players you know every opportunity and
leave<00:02:02.070> things<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.520> late<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.450> he

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
leave things as late as we can but he

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
leave things as late as we can but he
would<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> down<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.829> well<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:05.700> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
would be a down as well and then it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.210 
would be a down as well and then it
steady

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
steady

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.719 
steady
