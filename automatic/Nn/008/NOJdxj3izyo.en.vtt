I<00:00:04.380> made<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.799> little<00:00:05.040> bit<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.250> an<00:00:05.339> error

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
I made a little bit of an error

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.629 
I made a little bit of an error
yesterday<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:07.069> recorded<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> game<00:00:08.309> for<00:00:08.580> about

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
yesterday I recorded the game for about

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.629 
yesterday I recorded the game for about
three<00:00:09.030> hours<00:00:09.059> recording<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.230> end<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.920> leafy

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
three hours recording the end of leafy

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.759 
three hours recording the end of leafy
lake<00:00:11.880> as<00:00:12.090> well<00:00:12.750> as<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> beginning<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.410> Diamond

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
lake as well as the beginning of Diamond

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.160 
lake as well as the beginning of Diamond
Heights<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.420> after<00:00:15.420> recording<00:00:15.870> for<00:00:16.020> about

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
Heights and after recording for about

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.200 
Heights and after recording for about
three<00:00:16.440> hours<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.070> realized<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.880> did<00:00:18.090> not

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
three hours I realized that I did not

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.870 
three hours I realized that I did not
have<00:00:18.420> my<00:00:18.660> game<00:00:18.869> audio<00:00:19.230> turned<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.789> so<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
have my game audio turned on so the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.269 
have my game audio turned on so the
whole<00:00:21.029> thing<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.359> mute<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.470> instead<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.949> going

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
whole thing is mute so instead of going

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.650 
whole thing is mute so instead of going
back<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.640> re<00:00:23.730> recording<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> whole<00:00:24.359> thing

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
back and re recording the whole thing

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
back and re recording the whole thing
because<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.890> any<00:00:26.010> other<00:00:26.160> game<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> really

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
because with any other game I really

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.250 
because with any other game I really
would<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.060> gone<00:00:27.210> back<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.510> recorded<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
would have gone back and recorded the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.720 
would have gone back and recorded the
whole<00:00:28.380> thing<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.189> game<00:00:29.429> there's<00:00:29.670> a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
whole thing but with this game there's a

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.759 
whole thing but with this game there's a
lot<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.000> repetition<00:00:30.439> and<00:00:31.439> there's<00:00:31.619> really

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
lot of repetition and there's really

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
lot of repetition and there's really
only<00:00:31.859> certain<00:00:32.759> things<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.750> need

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
only certain things that I really need

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.220 
only certain things that I really need
to<00:00:33.930> show<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> thought<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.149> would<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.450> okay<00:00:36.930> if

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to show so I thought it would be okay if

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.380 
to show so I thought it would be okay if
I<00:00:37.440> went<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.829> showed<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.280> guys<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.760> end<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I went and showed you guys the end of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.000 
I went and showed you guys the end of
the<00:00:39.540> leafy<00:00:39.840> lake<00:00:40.020> where<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> ended<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the leafy lake where I ended up at the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.760 
the leafy lake where I ended up at the
very<00:00:41.250> end<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> scenario<00:00:42.649> because<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
very end of the scenario because the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.900 
very end of the scenario because the
objective<00:00:44.100> isn't<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.610> straight<00:00:44.879> forward

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
objective isn't really straight forward

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
objective isn't really straight forward
it's<00:00:45.360> exactly<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.110> did<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.350> Diamond

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's exactly what we did in Diamond

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.360 
it's exactly what we did in Diamond
dunes<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> forest<00:00:48.360> frontiers<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.370> diamond

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
dunes and forest frontiers and diamond

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
dunes and forest frontiers and diamond
Heights<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.270> bit

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
Heights is actually a little bit

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.750 
Heights is actually a little bit
different<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> scenario<00:00:52.829> however<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
different with the scenario however I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.400 
different with the scenario however I
haven't<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.329> finished<00:00:54.809> recording<00:00:55.230> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
haven't actually finished recording that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.700 
haven't actually finished recording that
one<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.489> beginning<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:58.050> videos<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
one so the beginning of the videos for

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
one so the beginning of the videos for
Diamond<00:00:59.100> Heights<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.149> halfway

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
Diamond Heights will be about halfway

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900 
Diamond Heights will be about halfway
through<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.050> scenario<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:02.579> I've<00:01:02.670> already

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
through the scenario and I've already

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
through the scenario and I've already
built<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.180> bunch<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.449> cool<00:01:03.660> stuff<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.320> one

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
built a bunch of cool stuff and that one

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.010 
built a bunch of cool stuff and that one
that<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.830> show<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> guys<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:06.810> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that I can show you guys so I'm just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
that I can show you guys so I'm just
going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.290> start<00:01:07.799> by<00:01:07.979> doing<00:01:08.040> any<00:01:08.460> leafy<00:01:08.820> lakes

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
going to start by doing any leafy lakes

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780 
going to start by doing any leafy lakes
run<00:01:09.990> through<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.680> we'll<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:11.640> at

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
run through here and we'll look at

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.190 
run through here and we'll look at
everything<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.330> built<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.960> quite<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
everything that I built which is quite a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.170 
everything that I built which is quite a
bit

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.940 

I<00:01:16.240> came<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.110> conclusion<00:01:17.230> that<00:01:17.680> these

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
I came to the conclusion that these

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.750 
I came to the conclusion that these
shuttle<00:01:18.370> rides<00:01:18.670> are<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.090> complete<00:01:19.870> cash<00:01:20.200> cow

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
shuttle rides are a complete cash cow

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.100 
shuttle rides are a complete cash cow
there<00:01:21.760> is<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.120> much<00:01:22.300> money<00:01:22.510> to<00:01:22.690> be<00:01:22.720> made<00:01:22.840> on

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
there is so much money to be made on

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.660 
there is so much money to be made on
those<00:01:23.320> because<00:01:23.710> they're<00:01:23.950> incredibly<00:01:24.340> cheap

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
those because they're incredibly cheap

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.270 
those because they're incredibly cheap
and<00:01:25.480> people<00:01:25.840> will<00:01:25.990> pay<00:01:26.230> top<00:01:26.470> dollar<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:27.100> ride

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
and people will pay top dollar to ride

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.520 
and people will pay top dollar to ride
them<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:27.790> have<00:01:27.970> three<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.300> those<00:01:28.470> now<00:01:29.470> you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
them so I have three of those now you

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.230 
them so I have three of those now you
probably<00:01:29.860> be<00:01:30.220> starting<00:01:30.640> off<00:01:30.760> most<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.180> my

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
probably be starting off most of my

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.060 
probably be starting off most of my
parts<00:01:31.630> building<00:01:32.020> these<00:01:32.140> things<00:01:32.380> because<00:01:32.890> they

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
parts building these things because they

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.710 
parts building these things because they
just<00:01:33.310> make<00:01:33.580> tons<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.000> money<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.420> then<00:01:34.510> we<00:01:34.570> can

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
just make tons of money and then we can

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.890 
just make tons of money and then we can
have<00:01:34.840> more<00:01:34.870> fun<00:01:35.050> building<00:01:35.650> cool<00:01:35.860> coasters<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
have more fun building cool coasters you

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.410 
have more fun building cool coasters you
guys<00:01:38.410> have<00:01:38.590> seen<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:38.979> one<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:40.030> blue<00:01:40.210> man

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
guys have seen this one the blue man

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.850

hoop<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:40.840> think<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.140> was<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> last<00:01:41.530> thing<00:01:41.740> I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
hoop I think that was the last thing I

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.120 
hoop I think that was the last thing I
built<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.300> previous<00:01:43.690> episode<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:45.100> I

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
built in the previous episode but I

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.980 
built in the previous episode but I
really<00:01:45.610> filled<00:01:45.850> out<00:01:46.000> this<00:01:46.180> area<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.720> park

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
really filled out this area of the park

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.130 
really filled out this area of the park
this<00:01:47.979> coaster<00:01:48.520> was<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:48.970> I<00:01:49.030> built<00:01:49.270> by

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
this coaster was one that I built by

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.430 
this coaster was one that I built by
hand<00:01:51.330> it's<00:01:52.330> one<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.570> those<00:01:52.630> suspended

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
hand it's one of those suspended

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.080 
hand it's one of those suspended
coasters<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.100> goes<00:01:54.250> down<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.700> just<00:01:54.880> kind<00:01:55.060> of

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
coasters it goes down and just kind of

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.609 
coasters it goes down and just kind of
goes<00:01:55.240> around<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.690> park<00:01:55.930> because<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.320> needed

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
goes around the park because I needed

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.609 
goes around the park because I needed
something<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.009> would<00:01:57.220> fit<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.820> gap<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
something that would fit in the gap and

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.810 
something that would fit in the gap and
then<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.860> had<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.040> couple<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.430> pre-built

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
then I had a couple of pre-built

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.910 
then I had a couple of pre-built
coasters<00:02:01.479> over<00:02:01.720> here<00:02:01.869> one<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.170> these<00:02:02.380> really

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
coasters over here one of these really

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.260 
coasters over here one of these really
interesting<00:02:04.140> flying<00:02:05.140> hanging<00:02:05.710> coasters<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
interesting flying hanging coasters of

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.690 
interesting flying hanging coasters of
which<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.570> have<00:02:07.660> never<00:02:07.750> seen<00:02:07.869> before<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.700> guess

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
which I have never seen before I guess

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.970 
which I have never seen before I guess
it's<00:02:09.880> kind<00:02:10.179> of<00:02:10.330> like<00:02:10.509> Superman<00:02:11.260> I've<00:02:11.680> never

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's kind of like Superman I've never

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.820 
it's kind of like Superman I've never
been<00:02:12.190> on<00:02:12.220> Superman<00:02:12.850> at<00:02:13.060> Six<00:02:13.300> Flags<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:14.590> kind

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
been on Superman at Six Flags it's kind

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.240 
been on Superman at Six Flags it's kind
of<00:02:14.860> like<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:16.000> not<00:02:16.180> quite<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.750> same<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
of like that but not quite the same and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.650 
of like that but not quite the same and
also<00:02:18.520> put<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.880> coaster<00:02:19.239> down<00:02:19.360> which<00:02:19.540> is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
also put this coaster down which is

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.449 
also put this coaster down which is
pretty<00:02:19.959> neat<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.680> got<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.830> bunch<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.190> lube

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
pretty neat it's got a bunch of lube

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.570 
pretty neat it's got a bunch of lube
surprisingly<00:02:22.150> enough<00:02:22.450> it's<00:02:22.780> not<00:02:23.049> too

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
surprisingly enough it's not too

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.830 
surprisingly enough it's not too
nauseating<00:02:24.580> for<00:02:24.790> people<00:02:25.060> because<00:02:25.420> these

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
nauseating for people because these

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.300 
nauseating for people because these
kinds<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.290> bends<00:02:26.560> are<00:02:26.799> what<00:02:26.950> will<00:02:27.070> cause

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
kinds of bends are what will cause

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.350 
kinds of bends are what will cause
extreme<00:02:28.090> nausea<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:30.400> luckily<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.090> rides

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
extreme nausea but luckily the rides

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.940 
extreme nausea but luckily the rides
going<00:02:31.690> pretty<00:02:31.840> slow<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:32.830> that's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
going pretty slow and I think that's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.880 
going pretty slow and I think that's
actually<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.310> break<00:02:33.700> right<00:02:33.910> there<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:35.799> you

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
actually a break right there so if you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.199 
actually a break right there so if you
want<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.130> do<00:02:36.250> these<00:02:36.370> kinds<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.700> bends<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.060> got

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
want to do these kinds of bends you got

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.699 
want to do these kinds of bends you got
to<00:02:37.299> make<00:02:37.420> sure<00:02:37.570> your<00:02:37.690> coaster<00:02:38.049> is<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.380> quite

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
to make sure your coaster is going quite

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.330 
to make sure your coaster is going quite
slow<00:02:40.049> some<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.140> these<00:02:41.200> guys<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.830> swear<00:02:42.100> they

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
slow some of these guys I swear they

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.009 
slow some of these guys I swear they
must<00:02:42.519> have<00:02:42.610> whip<00:02:42.910> these<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.150> an<00:02:43.420> AutoCAD<00:02:43.989> or

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
must have whip these up an AutoCAD or

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.810 
must have whip these up an AutoCAD or
something<00:02:44.530> beforehand<00:02:45.040> because<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.370> can't

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
something beforehand because I can't

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.330 
something beforehand because I can't
imagine<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.720> structure<00:02:47.440> some<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.160> these

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
imagine you can structure some of these

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.789 
imagine you can structure some of these
rollercoasters<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.510> have<00:02:49.900> them<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.680> as

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
rollercoasters and have them be as

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.650 
rollercoasters and have them be as
awesome<00:02:51.010> as<00:02:51.370> they<00:02:51.519> are<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.060> still<00:02:52.510> have

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
be able to make a really interesting

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
short I really like to structure my

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.650 
short I really like to structure my
lines<00:04:07.170> like<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:08.270> yep<00:04:09.270> see<00:04:09.450> they're<00:04:09.570> already

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
lines like this yep see they're already

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.300 
lines like this yep see they're already
complaining<00:04:10.170> about<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.440> nasty<00:04:10.650> state<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.220> my

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
complaining about the nasty state of my

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.680 
complaining about the nasty state of my
pads<00:04:11.580> even<00:04:12.000> though<00:04:12.090> I'm<00:04:12.209> probably<00:04:12.420> at<00:04:12.660> a

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
pads even though I'm probably at a

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.810 
pads even though I'm probably at a
really<00:04:12.930> high<00:04:13.080> rating<00:04:13.800> still<00:04:14.010> yep<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.700> was

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
really high rating still yep it was

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.270 
really high rating still yep it was
actually<00:04:15.169> 999<00:04:16.169> when<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> finished<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.100> level

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
actually 999 when I finished the level

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.370 
actually 999 when I finished the level
which<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.030> actually<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.480> maximum<00:04:18.900> rating

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
which is actually the maximum rating

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.240 
which is actually the maximum rating
that<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.650> can<00:04:19.830> get<00:04:21.500> but<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.620> way<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.740> structure

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
that you can get but the way I structure

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.640 
that you can get but the way I structure
my<00:04:23.280> pathing<00:04:23.910> now<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.300> I'll<00:04:24.450> put<00:04:25.080> maybe<00:04:25.290> four<00:04:25.620> or

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
my pathing now is I'll put maybe four or

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.670 
my pathing now is I'll put maybe four or
five<00:04:26.270> blocks<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.600> queue<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.080> then<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.530> will

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
five blocks in the queue and then I will

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.400 
five blocks in the queue and then I will
extend<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.520> exit<00:04:30.270> line<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.720> connect<00:04:31.050> with<00:04:31.260> it

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
extend the exit line to connect with it

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.680 
extend the exit line to connect with it
and<00:04:31.620> then<00:04:31.740> fill<00:04:32.280> out<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.580> path<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:33.540> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
and then fill out the path to the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.320 
and then fill out the path to the
mainland<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.980> it's<00:04:35.730> pretty<00:04:35.970> much<00:04:36.090> how<00:04:36.210> I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
mainland so it's pretty much how I

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.150 
mainland so it's pretty much how I
structure<00:04:36.660> all<00:04:36.990> my<00:04:37.200> lines<00:04:37.440> now<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:37.980> then<00:04:38.070> they

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
structure all my lines now and then they

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.770 
structure all my lines now and then they
never<00:04:38.310> get<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:38.760> long<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.270> people<00:04:39.300> start

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
never get so long that people start

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.350 
never get so long that people start
complaining<00:04:40.460> cuz<00:04:41.460> more<00:04:41.669> people<00:04:41.940> can<00:04:42.060> always

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
complaining cuz more people can always

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.400 
complaining cuz more people can always
just<00:04:42.690> jump<00:04:43.080> in<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.260> line<00:04:43.410> later

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.610 

let's<00:04:46.980> see<00:04:47.720> think<00:04:48.720> that's<00:04:48.960> about<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.470> I've

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
let's see think that's about it I've

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.920 
let's see think that's about it I've
managed<00:04:49.890> to<00:04:49.920> get<00:04:50.390> pretty<00:04:51.390> much<00:04:51.540> all<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.750> the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
managed to get pretty much all of the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.650 
managed to get pretty much all of the
research<00:04:52.260> done<00:04:52.590> keeping<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:53.070> at<00:04:53.160> maximum<00:04:53.660> with

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
research done keeping it at maximum with

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.570 
research done keeping it at maximum with
these<00:04:54.810> guys<00:04:55.020> over<00:04:55.200> here<00:04:55.320> funding<00:04:56.100> most<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.490> it

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
these guys over here funding most of it

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.680 
these guys over here funding most of it
as<00:04:56.760> you<00:04:56.970> can<00:04:57.090> see<00:04:57.270> this<00:04:57.390> one's<00:04:57.600> made<00:04:57.830> 21,000

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
as you can see this one's made 21,000

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.890 
as you can see this one's made 21,000
almost<00:05:00.890> 25,000<00:05:03.080> almost<00:05:04.340> 32,000<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:06.690> think

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
almost 25,000 almost 32,000 and I think

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.490 
almost 25,000 almost 32,000 and I think
these<00:05:06.990> were<00:05:07.200> about<00:05:07.440> 5,000<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.310> piece<00:05:08.540> so<00:05:09.540> big

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
these were about 5,000 a piece so big

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.280 
these were about 5,000 a piece so big
cash<00:05:10.800> cows<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.790> be<00:05:11.940> able<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.480> construct<00:05:12.990> some

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
cash cows to be able to construct some

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.010 
cash cows to be able to construct some
really<00:05:13.590> cool<00:05:13.740> rides<00:05:14.660> without<00:05:15.660> actually

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
really cool rides without actually

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.450 
really cool rides without actually
