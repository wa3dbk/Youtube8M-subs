just<00:00:40.110> happened<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.710> Boots<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:42.210> think

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
just happened to be in Boots on I think

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.350 
just happened to be in Boots on I think
it<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.660> last<00:00:42.809> Tuesday<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:44.520> purchased<00:00:45.210> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
if it's more if it's bad then it won't

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840

telling me what you think about it so I

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.940

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
don't know if this is just a one-off

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.830 
don't know if this is just a one-off
maybe<00:06:39.520> it's<00:06:39.700> gonna<00:06:39.850> stop<00:06:40.180> working<00:06:40.390> it's

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
maybe it's gonna stop working it's

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.990 
maybe it's gonna stop working it's
because<00:06:40.990> I've<00:06:41.080> been<00:06:41.140> using<00:06:41.200> it<00:06:41.470> every<00:06:41.680> day

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
because I've been using it every day

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.150 
because I've been using it every day
maybe<00:06:43.660> the<00:06:43.840> reason<00:06:44.020> why<00:06:44.470> it<00:06:44.530> didn't<00:06:44.980> work<00:06:45.010> so

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
maybe the reason why it didn't work so

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.700 
maybe the reason why it didn't work so
well<00:06:45.610> the<00:06:46.030> first<00:06:46.060> time<00:06:46.480> was<00:06:46.960> because<00:06:47.140> I<00:06:47.350> used

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
well the first time was because I used

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.250 
well the first time was because I used
it<00:06:47.830> in<00:06:47.950> a<00:06:48.040> different<00:06:48.760> way<00:06:48.940> -<00:06:49.110> what<00:06:50.110> it

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.260 
it in a different way - what it

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.840 
it in a different way - what it
indicated<00:06:50.980> it<00:06:51.100> to<00:06:51.220> do

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
indicated it to do

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.220 
indicated it to do
I<00:06:51.880> don't<00:06:52.150> know<00:06:52.300> so<00:06:52.570> I'd<00:06:52.660> really<00:06:52.930> really<00:06:53.110> like
