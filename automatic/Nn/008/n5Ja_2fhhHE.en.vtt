 application in this case is a 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.989

 to take pictures in a very 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.160
 professional I think a digital 6 x goes 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.110
 to eliminate all movements or 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.410
 if you eliminate all the moments that have 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.239
 in your videos or in your photos and also 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.140
 very important for many is the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.720
 timer that does not come from the factory in 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.570
 what is the iphone then it is very very 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.420
 interesting this option in the case of 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.580
 the options there are going to start 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 taking a picture in this case with the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.420
 flash 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.420
 there we will activate it 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.110
 there is like a picture 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.000
 there you are and let's start with that photo 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 we are going to edit it and we are going to make several 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.430
 things we also have what is the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.430
 timer 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.680
 know the anti 6 that can activate it 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.690
 to others it activates to the timer being the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.420
 timer in 15 seconds can 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.790
 you change the time 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.710
 for whom to take a photo of you 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.350
 they will warn the four 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.280
 seconds or five seconds that the photo 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.280
 is about to be taken 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.260
 and well the other features 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.270
 which are specific calls are more 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.970
 professionals that you can deepen 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.390
 a little more but we highlight what is the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.390
 be timer the anti safe that is so that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.730
 the movement is removed and also the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.880
 rapid fire to take photos so 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.170
 very fast approximately 10 times 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.430
 second let's move on 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.170
 the settings that this application has 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.900
 there as you can see is what is the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.690
 stability or instability of the anti 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 sheikh the number or amount of 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.870
 seconds for the timer being the compressor 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.640
 of jpg the screen trigger are 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.440

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.170
 you can check and you can 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.269
 change and what we can also 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.489
 highlight is the video zoom that is in 6 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.720
 x as I already told you that 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.550
 you can activate there 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.780
 then let's move quickly to what 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.780
 are the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.060
 The filters 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.200
