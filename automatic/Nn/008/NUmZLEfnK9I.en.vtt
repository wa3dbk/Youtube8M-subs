00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 a state arising that we are in 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.200
 minecraft 1.6 point 4 let's see this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.420
 basket club map is a is a map of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.530
 basketball but unlike the one of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.530
 football this is a lot more 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.840
 quite more pvp to say it some 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.460
 way let's go to team 1 for example 60 and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.610
 we are in the super costumes these 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.610
 rare 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.489
 the team the team if we do not have to 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.489
 give him 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.950
 with that I already tell you everything 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.950
 music slims in roses 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.269
 sweet child o'mine for the wind the button 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.269
 of this I have stayed 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.690
 the dow who is gay 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:58.430
 already 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:02.470
 thank you if we are going back 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.470
 do it the day just in case 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.729
 to the creative that starts the game we're going to 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.790
 do that starts by entering and we're 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.920
 in what we follow here what moles that have 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.159
 put here as if it were public this one 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.520
 it's cooler you know here super hardcore and 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.230
 the issue is that he 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.120
 the ball is here this is the ball 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.890
 that is, it is not the ball is not 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.930
 here 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.340
 apart from that because to give more because 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.440
 I say it's more pvp because in the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.230
 football they were just a villager and you 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.880
 you hit me up they were coal me here 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.390
 we have the big one in hand and we have to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.280
 leave it here 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.560
 good to start you have to guess if 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.790
 You're as bad as me, so this map does not 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.070
 it's easy like the connectors and 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.940
 entered 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.940
 justly 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.540
 It has to sound a clearing kitchen and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.190
 there not here if our first point we 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.530
 they return to give the desire is very well the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.690
 truth is that that is unlike the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.210
 football was more and try to score 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.210
 simply because it sends this again 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.830
 football was more simply to score 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.480
 goal here is more to kill you before before 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.560
 what to mark but good 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.990
 other than if you kill him for supposedly 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.340
 you will carry the arrows and all that young 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.340
 how bad I really am 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.480
 is a I do not know is a different pvp I think 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.240
 that there are many people who may like 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.520
 I know there are many who like the 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.480
 Minecraft online mode then I 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.100
 I think this really may like 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.680
 also and he is playing us super forever 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.000
 to the one always but that to those who 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.730
 like the online mode I think this 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.140
 map can be very very cool about 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.370
 everything as I rode it here with the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.370
 relax tip 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.390
 at first 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.700
 This is the d 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.930
 this is the team basket of the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.930
 1 if you are in 1 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.890
 clear but that is a map that is 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.170
 pretty good especially for that with 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.569
 servers for pvp if you like 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.430
 the pvp in my case you already know that I do not 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.470
 I do not really like online 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.000
 minecraft but good for your dad who 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.519
 I wanted to teach oslo seems pretty 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.290
 cool then it's very different from the one 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.849
 football no longer only for sport but 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.120
 because so I say that here is a 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.280
 kill yourself to hit the team 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.190
 the opposite is that football is more 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.920
 just hit the villager 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.430
 and nothing this is the map you have in the 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.430
 description 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.180
 I liked you I do not know if I will be able to 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.180
 climb in fact I think I 'm not going either 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.480
 but what I say 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.480
 good little small interruptions 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.060
 here there is a lot of diamond and a lot of gold and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.299
 I tried to try to mark the maximum but 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.759
 it does not work 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:30.009
 I do not know why we're going to give it but it does not put 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.009
 another more better one took off this 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.590
 I do not know very well how it goes but it does not just 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.210
 join the last point here are the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.919
 dispense these with diamonds and all 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.430
 good this for the one that is paid of rest 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:53.670
 for people like me kaka but good as 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.440
 I always like to look 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:01.139
 that has the rest and all that 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.569
 this is what keeps ringing 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.670
 I do not know exactly what it means 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.700
 just to activate 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.840
 where the score that when it arrives 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.840
 here the wool I do not know 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.909
 if it looks like more profile 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.729
 and very cool as I tell you this is more 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:30.509
 but bp 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:33.589
 if you like the status description 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:36.589
 you know there are favorites as such 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.589
 bye 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.660
 to
