way to do is to endure certain other
kind<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.850> high<00:02:40.030> school<00:02:40.300> tortures<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.110> know

and I think that's something we do every

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.030 
and I think that's something we do every
day<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.380> interesting<00:02:44.650> and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
day but it's just interesting and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.720 
day but it's just interesting and
highlighted<00:02:45.520> when<00:02:45.610> it's<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.660> context<00:02:47.230> of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
highlighted when it's in the context of
