trace the pattern can make this cake it
is<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:03.120> basic<00:01:04.309> can't<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.519> much

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is really really basic can't get much

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.760 
is really really basic can't get much
simpler<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:08.250> fancy<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:10.590> do

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
simpler to make a really fancy to do

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.889 
simpler to make a really fancy to do
this<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.220> old-fashioned<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.030> especially<00:01:12.509> if

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
this the old-fashioned way especially if

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.800 
this the old-fashioned way especially if
you<00:01:12.990> wanted<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> silver<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:15.240> would<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you wanted it silver you would have to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
you wanted it silver you would have to
mark<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.259> pattern<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
mark the pattern out you would have to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.639 
mark the pattern out you would have to
pipe<00:01:17.610> sideways<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.200> white

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
pipe sideways you have to do it in white

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.279 
pipe sideways you have to do it in white
royal<00:01:20.039> icing<00:01:20.280> leave<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> dry<00:01:21.149> and<00:01:21.539> then<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
royal icing leave it to dry and then you

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.820 
royal icing leave it to dry and then you
would<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> go<00:01:22.860> back<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> paint<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:24.830> so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
would have to go back and paint it so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.430 
would have to go back and paint it so
that's<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> looks<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.110> we're<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.319> to

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
that's how it looks so we're going to

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.169 
that's how it looks so we're going to
continue<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.190> that<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> next<00:01:30.000> ones

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
continue to do that with the next ones

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.730 
continue to do that with the next ones
and<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.509> sure<00:01:30.539> they<00:01:30.869> join<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.319> so<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> next

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and make sure they join up so the next

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.960 
and make sure they join up so the next
thing<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:32.039> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.549> practice

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
thing I'm going to do is just practice

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.639 
thing I'm going to do is just practice
with<00:01:33.390> these<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.960> sure<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.289> are<00:01:34.319> go<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
with these to make sure they are go to

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.289 
with these to make sure they are go to
join<00:01:35.069> up<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.399> sure<00:01:35.429> we<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.789> our<00:01:35.909> pattern

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
join up make sure we got our pattern

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.410 
join up make sure we got our pattern
right<00:01:39.740> without<00:01:40.740> putting<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.369> water<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.880> just

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
right without putting the water on just

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.169 
right without putting the water on just
to<00:01:42.569> make<00:01:42.750> sure<00:01:46.190> in<00:01:47.190> case<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.640> need<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:47.819> leave<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
to make sure in case we need to leave a

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.109 
to make sure in case we need to leave a
little<00:01:48.509> bit<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.990> gap<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.530> which<00:01:50.459> case<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.940> can

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
little bit of a gap in which case we can

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.730 
little bit of a gap in which case we can
then<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.299> over<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.840> ourselves<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.709> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
then go over it ourselves with the

if<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.660> doesn't<00:03:12.900> stick<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:14.340> peel<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.730> back<00:03:14.910> a

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
if it doesn't stick just peel it back a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.640 
if it doesn't stick just peel it back a
little<00:03:15.270> bit<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.110> where<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.590> not<00:03:16.800> wet

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
put it back up and it'll stick so all

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.110 
put it back up and it'll stick so all
you<00:03:25.590> need<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.980> water<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.610> not<00:03:26.760> like<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.970> have

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
you need is water it's not like you have

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.240 
you need is water it's not like you have
to<00:03:27.150> rip<00:03:27.420> hype<00:03:27.660> over<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.290> or<00:03:28.890> anything<00:03:28.950> like

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
to rip hype over it or anything like

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.680 
to rip hype over it or anything like
that<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> there's<00:03:31.940> two<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:32.970> our<00:03:33.270> embroidery

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
that so there's two of our embroidery

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.980 
that so there's two of our embroidery
piece<00:03:34.080> is<00:03:34.290> done<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:36.120> we<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.480> need<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
piece is done and we just need to do the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.850 
piece is done and we just need to do the
third

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.170 

just<00:03:45.860> continue<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.400> do<00:03:46.670> this<00:03:46.820> all<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.060> way

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
just continue to do this all the way

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:58.840 
just continue to do this all the way
around<00:03:47.480> until<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.980> cake<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.400> finished

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.090 

the<00:03:59.390> reason<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.870> pattern<00:04:00.230> may<00:04:00.410> not<00:04:00.680> fit<00:04:00.950> is

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
the reason the pattern may not fit is

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.590 
the reason the pattern may not fit is
because<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.520> actually<00:04:01.670> measured<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.360> cake

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
because I actually measured the cake

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.850 
because I actually measured the cake
tins<00:04:02.960> as<00:04:03.290> opposed<00:04:04.100> to<00:04:04.340> measuring<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.850> cakes

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
tins as opposed to measuring the cakes

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.800 
tins as opposed to measuring the cakes
once<00:04:06.860> they<00:04:07.100> were<00:04:07.160> iced<00:04:07.490> so<00:04:08.120> there<00:04:08.330> may<00:04:08.540> be<00:04:08.570> a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
once they were iced so there may be a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.110 
once they were iced so there may be a
little<00:04:09.020> bit<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.410> gap<00:04:09.650> as<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:10.790> said<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.060> can

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
little bit of a gap as I said you can

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.840 
little bit of a gap as I said you can
fix<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.570> with<00:04:11.750> just<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.990> pipe<00:04:12.200> didge<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:16.700> just

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
fix that with just a pipe didge you just

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.220 
fix that with just a pipe didge you just
want<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.060> try<00:04:17.270> and<00:04:17.360> make<00:04:17.630> sure<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.989> gaps
