synapse<00:02:44.459> software<00:02:45.459> which<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:46.389> I<00:02:46.540> said<00:02:46.569> is

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
synapse software which like I said is

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.860 
synapse software which like I said is
pretty<00:02:47.350> new<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.799> came<00:02:48.670> out<00:02:48.819> maybe<00:02:49.299> last<00:02:49.540> year

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
pretty new so came out maybe last year

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.990 
pretty new so came out maybe last year
and<00:02:50.519> it's<00:02:51.519> kind<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.359> like<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> one-stop

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and it's kind of like a one-stop

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.819 
and it's kind of like a one-stop
software<00:02:55.000> suite<00:02:55.359> for<00:02:55.660> everything<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:58.829> like

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
software suite for everything and I like

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.280 
software suite for everything and I like
it<00:03:00.040> personally<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:00.940> something<00:03:01.810> more<00:03:01.989> to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
it personally but something more to

it personally but something more to
happy<00:03:02.620> with<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.889> above<00:03:03.099> features<00:03:04.739> I'm<00:03:05.739> kind

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
happy with the above features I'm kind

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.849 
happy with the above features I'm kind
of<00:03:06.010> different<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.989> anyways<00:03:07.989> let's<00:03:08.470> take<00:03:08.829> a

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
of different so anyways let's take a

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.699 
of different so anyways let's take a
look<00:03:09.190> at<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.459> device<00:03:09.609> itself<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.959> starting

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
look at the device itself so starting

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.110 
look at the device itself so starting
with<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.040> cord<00:03:12.459> which<00:03:13.829> hmm<00:03:14.910> it's<00:03:15.910> kind<00:03:16.090> of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
with the cord which hmm it's kind of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.740 
with the cord which hmm it's kind of
interesting

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
interesting

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.379 
interesting

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
razor usually provides us with nice

razor usually provides us with nice
braided<00:03:20.169> cables<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:20.950> looks<00:03:21.760> like<00:03:21.849> they've

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
braided cables but looks like they've

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.259 
braided cables but looks like they've
gone<00:03:22.569> with<00:03:23.260> me<00:03:23.560> kind<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.609> cheaper<00:03:25.090> route

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
gone with me kind of the cheaper route

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.500 
gone with me kind of the cheaper route
this<00:03:25.540> time<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.810> don't<00:03:25.989> know<00:03:26.200> why<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.239> a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
this time I don't know why it's just a

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.379 
this time I don't know why it's just a
regular<00:03:28.930> kind<00:03:29.169> of<00:03:29.230> plastic<00:03:29.680> cable<00:03:29.980> right<00:03:30.130> here

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
regular kind of plastic cable right here

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.569 
regular kind of plastic cable right here
and<00:03:31.389> we<00:03:31.599> still<00:03:31.810> got<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.139> gold<00:03:32.650> plated<00:03:33.190> USB

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
and we still got that gold plated USB

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.409 
and we still got that gold plated USB
connector<00:03:34.620> helps<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.829> can<00:03:36.280> make<00:03:36.639> resistance<00:03:37.269> to

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
connector helps I can make resistance to

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.210 
connector helps I can make resistance to
corrosion<00:03:38.489> but<00:03:39.489> hmm<00:03:40.389> you<00:03:41.169> do<00:03:41.319> get<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.560> more

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
corrosion but hmm you do get a more

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.890 
corrosion but hmm you do get a more
cheap<00:03:44.099> kind<00:03:45.099> of<00:03:45.190> plastic<00:03:45.700> II<00:03:45.819> connector<00:03:46.690> here

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
cheap kind of plastic II connector here

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.850 
cheap kind of plastic II connector here
but<00:03:47.280> looks<00:03:48.280> like<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.609> pretty<00:03:49.860> reinforced

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
but looks like it's pretty reinforced

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.809 
but looks like it's pretty reinforced
here

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
here

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.300 
here
you<00:03:51.879> know<00:03:52.150> what<00:03:52.299> this<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.659> I<00:03:52.870> think<00:03:53.829> this<00:03:54.099> is

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
you know what this is I think this is

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.729 
you know what this is I think this is
like<00:03:54.489> removable<00:03:55.420> or<00:03:55.599> something<00:03:56.019> but

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
like removable or something but

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.770 
like removable or something but
interesting<00:03:59.739> all<00:03:59.920> right<00:04:00.099> so<00:04:00.390> let's<00:04:01.390> move<00:04:01.599> away

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
interesting all right so let's move away

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.559 
interesting all right so let's move away
from<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.200> cable<00:04:02.500> then<00:04:02.739> let's<00:04:03.129> talk<00:04:03.579> about<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
from the cable then let's talk about the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.390 
from the cable then let's talk about the
actual<00:04:05.319> device<00:04:05.560> itself<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.069> on<00:04:06.189> the<00:04:06.250> bottom

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
actual device itself so on the bottom

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.630 
actual device itself so on the bottom
we've<00:04:06.579> got<00:04:06.760> nice<00:04:07.359> rubberized<00:04:08.019> feet<00:04:08.650> for

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
we've got nice rubberized feet for

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.979 
we've got nice rubberized feet for
putting<00:04:09.879> on<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.090> grate<00:04:10.269> over<00:04:10.299> here<00:04:10.659> so<00:04:10.900> it

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
putting on the grate over here so it

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.860 
putting on the grate over here so it
doesn't<00:04:11.290> snap<00:04:11.590> as<00:04:11.769> you<00:04:11.859> can<00:04:12.040> see<00:04:12.390> this<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.689> not

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
doesn't snap as you can see this is not

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.460 
doesn't snap as you can see this is not
going<00:04:14.049> anywhere

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
going anywhere

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.020 
going anywhere
in<00:04:14.709> fact<00:04:14.950> I'm<00:04:15.099> actually<00:04:15.310> shaking<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.849> table

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
in fact I'm actually shaking the table

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.020 
in fact I'm actually shaking the table
which<00:04:16.870> is<00:04:17.049> not<00:04:17.500> good<00:04:20.039> if<00:04:21.039> I<00:04:21.220> remember<00:04:21.609> see<00:04:22.000> I

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
which is not good if I remember see I

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.020 
which is not good if I remember see I
saw<00:04:22.300> this<00:04:22.509> a<00:04:22.720> little<00:04:22.990> bit<00:04:23.289> at<00:04:23.470> CES<00:04:23.979> so<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.759> kind

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
saw this a little bit at CES so I kind

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.439 
saw this a little bit at CES so I kind
of<00:04:25.060> know<00:04:25.949> what's<00:04:26.949> up<00:04:27.130> with<00:04:27.160> this<00:04:27.490> but<00:04:27.820> not<00:04:28.180> all

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
of know what's up with this but not all

of know what's up with this but not all
that<00:04:28.900> much<00:04:29.259> so<00:04:31.229> that<00:04:32.229> mechanical<00:04:32.919> key<00:04:33.070> switch

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
that much so that mechanical key switch

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.570 
that much so that mechanical key switch
is<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.550> here<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.389> can<00:04:34.570> clear<00:04:35.490> got<00:04:36.490> the

is in here so you can clear got the
quickie<00:04:37.060> that's<00:04:37.449> a<00:04:37.539> tactile<00:04:38.880> probably<00:04:39.880> not

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
quickie that's a tactile probably not

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.029 
quickie that's a tactile probably not
gonna<00:04:40.210> remove<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.720> key<00:04:40.930> because<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.560> kind<00:04:41.979> of

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
gonna remove a key because I kind of

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.040 
gonna remove a key because I kind of
know<00:04:42.220> that<00:04:42.520> there<00:04:42.820> cherry<00:04:43.090> IMAX<00:04:43.419> blue<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.840> down

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
know that there cherry IMAX blue is down

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.020 
know that there cherry IMAX blue is down
there<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:46.620> can<00:04:47.620> see<00:04:47.770> right<00:04:47.949> here<00:04:47.979> has<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.880> arrow

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
there I can see right here has the arrow

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.779 
there I can see right here has the arrow
keys<00:04:49.389> but<00:04:49.830> pretty<00:04:50.830> much<00:04:50.889> all<00:04:51.280> these<00:04:51.490> buttons

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
keys but pretty much all these buttons

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.550 
keys but pretty much all these buttons
can<00:04:52.090> be<00:04:52.120> reprogrammed<00:04:52.750> for<00:04:53.020> anything<00:04:53.349> you

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
can be reprogrammed for anything you

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.100 
can be reprogrammed for anything you
really<00:04:53.830> want<00:04:54.039> so<00:04:54.759> you<00:04:55.389> know<00:04:55.509> say<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:55.810> don't

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
really want so you know say you don't

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.600 
really want so you know say you don't
really<00:04:56.289> want<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.620> play<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:57.130> first-person

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
really want to play a first-person

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.830 
really want to play a first-person
shooter<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.360> you're<00:04:58.510> not<00:04:58.659> going<00:04:58.780> to

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
shooter and you're not going to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.969 
shooter and you're not going to
reprogram<00:04:59.199> these<00:04:59.560> for<00:04:59.889> WASD<00:05:01.260> then<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.800> can

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
reprogram these for WASD then you can

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.100 
reprogram these for WASD then you can
reprogram<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.729> for<00:05:03.880> whatever<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.300> want<00:05:04.510> so

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
reprogram it for whatever you want so

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.170 
reprogram it for whatever you want so
you<00:05:05.740> know<00:05:05.830> if<00:05:05.979> you<00:05:06.130> want<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.370> program<00:05:06.610> a<00:05:06.760> macro

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
you know if you want to program a macro

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.750 
you know if you want to program a macro
you<00:05:07.330> program<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.720> macro<00:05:08.110> if<00:05:08.260> you<00:05:08.380> want<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.860> just

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
you program a macro if you want to just

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.100 
you program a macro if you want to just
program<00:05:10.090> individual<00:05:10.599> keys<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.990> could

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
program individual keys you could

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.399 
program individual keys you could
program<00:05:11.289> individual<00:05:11.949> keys<00:05:12.159> so<00:05:12.940> it's<00:05:13.449> a<00:05:13.659> very

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
program individual keys so it's a very

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:19.050 
program individual keys so it's a very
versatile<00:05:15.010> little<00:05:15.310> device<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:17.669> over<00:05:18.669> here

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
versatile little device and over here

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.719 
versatile little device and over here
we've<00:05:19.210> got<00:05:19.389> a<00:05:19.860> directional<00:05:20.860> pad<00:05:20.919> I<00:05:21.220> believe

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
we've got a directional pad I believe

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.960 
we've got a directional pad I believe
this<00:05:21.909> is<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.120> eight<00:05:22.360> way<00:05:22.539> directional<00:05:23.080> pad

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
this is a eight way directional pad

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.110 
this is a eight way directional pad
again<00:05:24.970> you<00:05:25.900> know<00:05:26.020> mechanical<00:05:26.860> over<00:05:27.820> here

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
again you know mechanical over here

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.320 
again you know mechanical over here
we've<00:05:28.419> got<00:05:28.539> a<00:05:28.780> little<00:05:29.020> clicky<00:05:29.590> button<00:05:30.330> thing

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
we've got a little clicky button thing

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.290 
we've got a little clicky button thing
here<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:32.260> I<00:05:32.680> believe<00:05:33.250> this<00:05:33.430> is<00:05:33.639> programmable

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
here so I believe this is programmable

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.839 
here so I believe this is programmable
as<00:05:34.630> well<00:05:34.930> along<00:05:35.800> with<00:05:35.860> this<00:05:36.250> button<00:05:36.820> right

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
as well along with this button right

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.950 
as well along with this button right
here<00:05:37.000> this<00:05:37.300> program<00:05:37.830> programmable<00:05:39.960> this

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
here this program programmable this

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.680 
here this program programmable this
wrist<00:05:41.349> rests<00:05:41.800> this<00:05:42.190> is<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.460> rubber<00:05:43.000> wrist<00:05:43.389> rest

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
wrist rests this is a rubber wrist rest

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.010 
wrist rests this is a rubber wrist rest
nice<00:05:44.229> looking<00:05:44.710> Razer<00:05:45.610> logo<00:05:45.940> here<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.659> should

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
nice looking Razer logo here it should

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.650 
nice looking Razer logo here it should
be<00:05:47.199> adjusted<00:05:47.530> for<00:05:47.889> certify<00:05:48.430> yeah

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
be adjusted for certify yeah

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.540 
be adjusted for certify yeah
push<00:05:50.110> this<00:05:50.290> down<00:05:50.530> should<00:05:51.040> be<00:05:51.160> adjustable

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
push this down should be adjustable

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.720 
push this down should be adjustable
samal<00:05:52.020> yep<00:05:53.020> there<00:05:53.260> it<00:05:53.350> is<00:05:53.440> so<00:05:53.680> push<00:05:54.370> this<00:05:54.550> down

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
samal yep there it is so push this down

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.830 
samal yep there it is so push this down
right<00:05:54.940> here<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:55.270> is<00:05:55.300> adjustable<00:05:56.640> like<00:05:57.640> this<00:05:58.090> I

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
right here it is adjustable like this I

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.210 
right here it is adjustable like this I
have<00:05:59.020> a<00:05:59.050> smaller<00:05:59.320> hand<00:05:59.530> so<00:05:59.770> I'm<00:05:59.980> probably

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
have a smaller hand so I'm probably

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.770 
have a smaller hand so I'm probably
gonna<00:06:00.730> keep<00:06:00.940> it<00:06:01.150> like<00:06:01.390> over<00:06:01.960> here<00:06:02.200> and<00:06:03.780> this

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
gonna keep it like over here and this

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.780 
gonna keep it like over here and this
piece<00:06:05.050> is<00:06:05.260> well<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.830> believe<00:06:06.190> if<00:06:06.310> you<00:06:06.430> pull<00:06:06.640> that

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
piece is well I believe if you pull that

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.840 
piece is well I believe if you pull that
out<00:06:06.850> you<00:06:07.390> can<00:06:07.420> adjust<00:06:08.050> this<00:06:08.350> piece<00:06:08.620> so<00:06:08.890> very

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
out you can adjust this piece so very

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.010 
out you can adjust this piece so very
more<00:06:10.180> comfortable

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
more comfortable

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.820 
more comfortable
kind<00:06:12.010> of<00:06:12.840> refine<00:06:13.840> your<00:06:13.990> keys<00:06:14.200> right<00:06:14.350> here<00:06:14.560> so

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
kind of refine your keys right here so

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.730 
kind of refine your keys right here so

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
like this pretty comfortable for me have

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.190 
like this pretty comfortable for me have
good<00:06:17.980> access<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.490> the<00:06:19.710> little<00:06:20.710> d-pad<00:06:22.020> wrist<00:06:23.020> if

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
good access to the little d-pad wrist if

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.630 
good access to the little d-pad wrist if
I'm<00:06:23.350> playing<00:06:23.500> a<00:06:23.680> first-person<00:06:24.070> shooter<00:06:24.250> for

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
I'm playing a first-person shooter for

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.480 
I'm playing a first-person shooter for
example<00:06:25.120> like<00:06:25.360> here<00:06:25.570> but<00:06:26.260> you<00:06:26.440> probably<00:06:27.280> have

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
example like here but you probably have

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.130 
example like here but you probably have
like<00:06:27.610> one<00:06:27.850> more<00:06:27.970> button<00:06:28.240> here<00:06:28.510> for<00:06:28.540> like<00:06:28.900> your

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
like one more button here for like your

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.950 
like one more button here for like your
maze<00:06:29.290> or<00:06:29.500> something<00:06:29.860> crouched<00:06:30.750> and<00:06:31.750> then

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
maze or something crouched and then

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.610 
maze or something crouched and then
maybe<00:06:33.390> have<00:06:34.390> one<00:06:34.660> of<00:06:34.750> these<00:06:34.870> buttons<00:06:35.290> to<00:06:35.350> serve

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
maybe have one of these buttons to serve

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.230 
maybe have one of these buttons to serve
as<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:35.860> spacebar<00:06:36.400> have<00:06:36.580> this<00:06:36.700> one<00:06:36.910> certain

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
as a spacebar have this one certain

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.970 
as a spacebar have this one certain
space<00:06:37.450> board<00:06:37.690> probably<00:06:37.900> and<00:06:38.290> you<00:06:38.830> know<00:06:38.890> we

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
space board probably and you know we

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.330 
space board probably and you know we
jump<00:06:39.190> around<00:06:40.410> it's<00:06:41.410> pretty<00:06:41.620> neat<00:06:41.830> if<00:06:42.010> you<00:06:42.250> guys

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
jump around it's pretty neat if you guys

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.640 
jump around it's pretty neat if you guys
have<00:06:42.580> you<00:06:42.880> know<00:06:43.200> mmo's<00:06:44.200> you<00:06:44.380> could<00:06:44.530> definitely

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
have you know mmo's you could definitely

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.540 
have you know mmo's you could definitely
program<00:06:45.220> multiple<00:06:46.590> you<00:06:47.590> know<00:06:47.620> macros<00:06:48.070> up<00:06:48.250> here

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
program multiple you know macros up here

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.270 
program multiple you know macros up here
or<00:06:48.850> where<00:06:49.360> you're<00:06:49.540> not<00:06:49.830> this<00:06:50.830> just<00:06:51.010> seems<00:06:51.220> like
