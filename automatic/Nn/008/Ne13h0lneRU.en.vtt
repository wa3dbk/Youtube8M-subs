yeah we're on what is called an env any
which<00:00:34.250> stands<00:00:34.460> for<00:00:34.580> an<00:00:35.300> enabler<00:00:35.660> Ryan<00:00:36.460> mvno

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
which stands for an enabler Ryan mvno

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.790 
which stands for an enabler Ryan mvno
both<00:00:37.670> virtual<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.239> I<00:00:38.390> blood<00:00:38.690> direct<00:00:39.050> well<00:00:39.470> so

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
both virtual and I blood direct well so

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.040 
both virtual and I blood direct well so
really<00:00:40.400> what<00:00:40.610> we<00:00:40.730> do<00:00:40.910> is<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.270> we<00:00:41.510> enable

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
really what we do is that we enable

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.960 
really what we do is that we enable
information<00:00:42.500> what<00:00:43.309> does<00:00:43.400> that<00:00:43.489> mean<00:00:43.700> is<00:00:43.940> that

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
information what does that mean is that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.090 
information what does that mean is that
we<00:00:44.629> help<00:00:44.930> companies<00:00:45.200> who<00:00:45.590> have<00:00:45.710> remote

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
we help companies who have remote

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.550 
we help companies who have remote
devices<00:00:46.430> anywhere<00:00:46.940> in<00:00:47.330> the<00:00:47.420> world<00:00:47.570> connect<00:00:48.440> to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
devices anywhere in the world connect to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.920 
devices anywhere in the world connect to
those<00:00:48.650> devices<00:00:48.890> control<00:00:49.820> those<00:00:50.120> devices<00:00:50.450> and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
those devices control those devices and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.900 
those devices control those devices and
retrieve<00:00:51.650> information<00:00:51.980> from<00:00:52.370> those<00:00:52.579> devices

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
retrieve information from those devices

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.540 
retrieve information from those devices
so<00:00:53.780> that's<00:00:53.930> really<00:00:54.170> what<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.410> do<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.460> be

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
so that's really what to do and to be

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.370 
so that's really what to do and to be
able<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:55.790> do<00:00:55.880> that<00:00:56.000> we<00:00:56.180> have<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.960> couple<00:00:57.320> of

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
able to do that we have a couple of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.020 
able to do that we have a couple of
functions<00:00:57.530> one<00:00:58.250> obviously<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:58.880> we

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
functions one obviously is that we

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.720 
functions one obviously is that we
provide<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> pipe<00:01:00.160> physical<00:01:01.160> pipe<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:01.610> we

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
provide a pipe physical pipe so we

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.069 
provide a pipe physical pipe so we
connecting<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.360> all<00:01:02.450> of<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.660> operators

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
connecting to all of the operators

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.340 
connecting to all of the operators
globally<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:04.119> with<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.270> pipe<00:01:05.509> we<00:01:06.020> can<00:01:06.200> then

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
globally and with that pipe we can then

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.570 
globally and with that pipe we can then
access<00:01:06.590> those<00:01:07.160> devices<00:01:07.550> in<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.509> field<00:01:09.580> simple

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
access those devices in the field simple

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.870 
access those devices in the field simple
sim<00:01:11.330> card<00:01:11.540> system<00:01:11.810> advice<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:13.310> connect<00:01:13.670> to

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
sim card system advice we connect to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.880 
sim card system advice we connect to
that<00:01:13.970> device<00:01:14.180> we<00:01:15.110> cannot<00:01:15.320> take<00:01:15.500> control<00:01:15.800> of

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
that device we cannot take control of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.219 
that device we cannot take control of
that<00:01:16.009> device<00:01:16.690> there's<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.750> first<00:01:17.899> part<00:01:18.170> of

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
that device there's the first part of

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.770 
that device there's the first part of
what<00:01:18.350> we<00:01:18.470> offer<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:19.520> then<00:01:19.700> offer<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:20.030> software

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
what we offer we then offer a software

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.020 
what we offer we then offer a software
platform<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.800> enables<00:01:22.039> to<00:01:22.640> connect<00:01:22.940> to

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
platform that enables to connect to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.120 
platform that enables to connect to
these<00:01:23.149> devices<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.929> control<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.860> flow<00:01:25.100> of

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
these devices and control the flow of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.600 
these devices and control the flow of
information<00:01:25.959> so<00:01:26.959> let's<00:01:27.920> assume<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.399> an

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
information so let's assume that is an

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.080 
information so let's assume that is an
ambulance<00:01:29.350> transmitting<00:01:30.350> data<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.700> patient

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
ambulance transmitting data of a patient

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.139 
ambulance transmitting data of a patient
live<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.420> our<00:01:33.319> ambulance<00:01:33.850> so<00:01:34.850> for<00:01:35.119> example

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
live in our ambulance so for example

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.440 
live in our ambulance so for example
what<00:01:35.539> kind<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.720> blood<00:01:35.990> type<00:01:36.920> does<00:01:37.280> he<00:01:37.399> have

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
what kind of blood type does he have

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.270 
what kind of blood type does he have
what<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.569> this<00:01:38.690> lung<00:01:38.899> capacity<00:01:39.410> like<00:01:39.590> how<00:01:40.039> is

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
what is this lung capacity like how is

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.770 
what is this lung capacity like how is
his<00:01:40.399> liver<00:01:40.640> all<00:01:41.119> of<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.360> data<00:01:41.539> is

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
his liver all of this data is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.050 
his liver all of this data is
transmitted<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.619> hospital<00:01:43.009> as<00:01:43.220> they

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
transmitted to the hospital as they

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.120 
transmitted to the hospital as they
travel<00:01:44.420> towards<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.780> hospital<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.920> then

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
travel towards the hospital we then

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.830 
travel towards the hospital we then
build<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.640> information<00:01:47.300> into<00:01:47.690> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
build that information into the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.919 
build that information into the
hospital's<00:01:48.410> erp<00:01:48.920> solution<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.630> doctors

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
hospital's erp solution so the doctors

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.660 
hospital's erp solution so the doctors
and<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.080> nurses<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:51.560> their<00:01:51.679> PDAs<00:01:52.039> get<00:01:52.280> up<00:01:52.399> ok

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
and the nurses on their PDAs get up ok

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.029 
and the nurses on their PDAs get up ok
patient<00:01:53.090> X<00:01:53.240> comes<00:01:53.569> in<00:01:53.780> he<00:01:54.470> has<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:54.740> kind<00:01:54.920> of

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
patient X comes in he has this kind of

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.800 
patient X comes in he has this kind of
blood<00:01:55.250> type<00:01:55.459> we<00:01:55.670> need<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.880> prepare<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.300> this

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
blood type we need to prepare this this

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.570 
blood type we need to prepare this this
blood<00:01:56.990> tie<00:01:57.170> before<00:01:57.289> he<00:01:57.500> comes<00:01:57.709> in<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.429> do<00:01:58.550> a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
blood tie before he comes in you do a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.370 
blood tie before he comes in you do a
lot<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.789> customization<00:01:59.300> or<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.929> is<00:02:00.050> using

these different parts of the world but

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.920 
these different parts of the world but
they<00:03:12.430> needed<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.760> have<00:03:12.879> direct<00:03:13.030> links<00:03:13.329> into

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
they needed to have direct links into

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.170 
they needed to have direct links into
these<00:03:14.049> robots<00:03:14.620> now<00:03:15.370> they<00:03:15.790> could<00:03:15.970> have<00:03:16.060> asked

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
these robots now they could have asked

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.800 
these robots now they could have asked
the<00:03:16.390> plans<00:03:16.629> for<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.019> land<00:03:17.319> connection<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.600> which

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
the plans for a land connection so which

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.360 
the plans for a land connection so which
means<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.079> they<00:03:20.230> are<00:03:20.260> dependent<00:03:20.950> on<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
means that they are dependent on the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.129 
means that they are dependent on the
factory<00:03:22.209> providing<00:03:22.660> them<00:03:22.810> with<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.959> land

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
factory providing them with a land

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.809 
factory providing them with a land
connection<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.709> they<00:03:24.130> also<00:03:24.280> depend<00:03:24.489> on

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
connection and they also depend on

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.180 
connection and they also depend on
someone<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.560> unplugging<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.769> connection

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
someone not unplugging that connection

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.979 
someone not unplugging that connection
so<00:03:27.700> they<00:03:27.819> wanted<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.120> pre<00:03:28.420> enable<00:03:28.870> these

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
so they wanted to pre enable these

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.170 
so they wanted to pre enable these
robots<00:03:29.380> with<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> connectivity<00:03:29.920> device<00:03:30.310> so

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
robots with a connectivity device so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.240 
robots with a connectivity device so
what<00:03:31.329> we<00:03:31.510> did<00:03:31.690> was<00:03:31.750> we<00:03:32.230> came<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.859> gave<00:03:33.010> them

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
what we did was we came in and gave them

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.670 
what we did was we came in and gave them
the<00:03:33.370> ability<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:34.540> have<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.690> global<00:03:35.049> coverage

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
the ability to have a global coverage

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.140 
the ability to have a global coverage
through<00:03:36.280> our<00:03:36.430> infrastructure<00:03:36.940> of

through our infrastructure of
partnership<00:03:37.599> with<00:03:37.690> all<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.870> operators<00:03:38.170> and

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
partnership with all the operators and

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.000 
partnership with all the operators and
then<00:03:40.150> we<00:03:40.269> also<00:03:40.420> help<00:03:40.810> them<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.109> integrate<00:03:41.769> that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
then we also help them to integrate that

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.949 
then we also help them to integrate that
information<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.150> robot<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:43.599> sending

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
information that the robot is sending

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.809 
information that the robot is sending
through<00:03:44.200> our<00:03:44.319> platform<00:03:44.950> into<00:03:45.549> their<00:03:45.700> own

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
through our platform into their own

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.150 
through our platform into their own
platform<00:03:46.329> now<00:03:47.169> what<00:03:47.380> did<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.650> actually<00:03:47.799> due

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
platform now what did that actually due

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.370 
platform now what did that actually due
to<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> be<00:03:48.880> be<00:03:49.060> given<00:03:49.419> two<00:03:49.569> things<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.349> first

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
to a be be given two things the first

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.620 
to a be be given two things the first
thing<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.859> did<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.370> drove<00:03:51.790> down<00:03:52.030> their<00:03:52.209> costs

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
thing it did it drove down their costs

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.990 
thing it did it drove down their costs
because<00:03:53.230> instead<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.650> now<00:03:54.069> having<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.519> send<00:03:54.819> an

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
because instead of now having to send an

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.690 
because instead of now having to send an
engineer<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.260> China<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.280> cigarette

factory when the robot is feeling poorly

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.210 
factory when the robot is feeling poorly
they<00:04:00.340> could<00:04:00.579> actually<00:04:00.730> do<00:04:01.150> OTA<00:04:01.569> over-the-air

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
they could actually do OTA over-the-air

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.210 
they could actually do OTA over-the-air
updates

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
updates

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.800 
updates
the<00:04:04.790> second<00:04:05.120> thing<00:04:05.180> they<00:04:05.390> could<00:04:05.450> do<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.720> they

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
the second thing they could do is they

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.870 
the second thing they could do is they
could<00:04:05.990> drive<00:04:06.380> new<00:04:06.620> revenue<00:04:07.040> because<00:04:07.550> I<00:04:07.700> could

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
could drive new revenue because I could

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.420 
could drive new revenue because I could
send<00:04:08.180> they<00:04:08.420> could<00:04:08.600> sell<00:04:08.810> s<00:04:08.960> la's<00:04:09.310> so<00:04:10.310> they

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
send they could sell s la's so they

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.770 
send they could sell s la's so they
could<00:04:10.580> not<00:04:10.670> tell<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.000> Chinese<00:04:11.210> factory<00:04:11.660> there

will guarantee that the robot has
99.999%<00:04:19.100> uptime<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.690> they<00:04:20.840> could<00:04:21.049> lower<00:04:21.500> the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
99.999% uptime so they could lower the

99.999% uptime so they could lower the
cost<00:04:21.890> and<00:04:22.070> increase<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.430> every<00:04:22.580> game<00:04:22.760> that's
