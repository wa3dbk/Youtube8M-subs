00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello people I'm okay aline 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.649
 moment of ni I went back to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.860
 second video of this weekend that 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.360
 is a list of five pointers to read 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.849
 At Christmas I saw there in the channel of the Imbuí 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.170
 grandson to leave his video link here and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.529
 will also leave the video link 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 previous year which is quite 2058 where I 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 I explain how the channel will work 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.130
 from now on because two videos in the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.920
 same day you do not understand watching 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.750
 to if you have not watched 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.809
 I have not managed to edit the videos 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.329
 because they have gotten bigger with this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.149
 new camera because the resolution is higher 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.090
 So it has to be straightforward if I make a mistake or 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.160
 recording has to leave the ego in the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 video then let's go there 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.110
 I chose first book attached to a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.730
 fantasy the first book of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 mary helen from roberto 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.940
 the touch and get rid of the province already does 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.309
 a time that was released and the trilogy 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.930
 This author died very early and I 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.390
 I believe that this technology to have 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.299
 more books but he turned out not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.020
 concluding his book Book 1 and 2 and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.110
 he begins with influences from the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.659
 History of jazz are the Argonauts wide 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.560
 of the idea and homero in that shit in which 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.270
 figure in many fantasy stories 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.270
 for example of king arthur 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.150
 because he is a magician, right? 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 It is in this history in this context that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.829
 father for the land many, many years 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 many even and that he has much 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.579
 respect for where it goes is very 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.619
 respected 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.450
 only he has to choose a side 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.939
 In this story this side can 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.329
 weaken not only the power of how he 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.420
 even through the magic and kept it 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.540
 he has not aged nelly he's got the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 aspect of a man but not of an old man 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 so some choices he makes this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.079
 technology can influence one's own 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.250
 His life is really cool if you like 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.829
 fantasy the first book the beginning is well 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.990
 dragged but it's enough just the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.750
 promotion books little expensive but gives 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.280
 to search progressive discount 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.990
 growing children 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.790
 juvenile 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.920
 how to train your dragon cressida 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.720
 cowell and this book said to everyone 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.150
 who likes children 's literature 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.340
 this one is even more childish than in 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.060
 youth events and who would like to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.200
 give a present to some child is a 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.300
 skin book 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.130
 if I had a journal's volume 1 of one 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.040
 banana also caria but why 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.080
 because they are books that the one that mixes text 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.970
 and illustration is but we have enough 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.920
 and have been think this is a way 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.770
 interesting to stimulate the child 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.010
 clean has figures they see one side the 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.870
 children 's books to figures in context but 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.300
 the text still predominates and then 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.550
 narratively this series is evolving 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.780
 and the reader and especially if 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.260
 child, right? 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.780
 can also adapt to the style of 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.990
 reading with pictures and then going is just 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.150
 pretext third book that I chose is 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.430
 the ax axist alienist 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.640
 I love stories that deal with the theme. 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.840
 madness and I did not read ax in school 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.910
 I did not like 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.980
 in fact whenever I had a reading 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.920
 above mandatory 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.240
 I wanted to thank you, but then I regret. 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.130
 not at all because I think some 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.650
 books are important agents in school 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.990
 perhaps the way teachers or 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.180
 own school curriculum determines not to 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.340
 Be more learn product but worth the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.360
 Worth a penny if you like stories about 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.460
 crazy 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.520
 if you have that certain tantrum with 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.250
 ax I point out the alienist to you 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.280
 To know this author, he is a tale. 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.460
 It's not a romance there 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.410
 there I choose one of fiction that I love 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.150
 has appeared in several videos that the guide 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.100
 douglas galaxies backpacker 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.440
 adams and I think this book is very good to 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.600
 all five would not let him be that 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.360
 was written by another author 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.610
 I think he's the author of the aced tennis hall 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.440
 I'm not sure anyone wrote to 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.350
 me the comments I said when 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.100
 I said in another video of this book but 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.560
 is a book that is suitable for young readers 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.230
 and those who are now starting who 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.020
 likes science fiction travel 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.000
 in space and adventure 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.060
 it's worth looking for the backpacker's guide 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.160
 of galaxies 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.900
 is the first you can already have a 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.639
 idea of ​​what is going to be serious then 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.590
 you identify continuous 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.950
 if you do not do too much your style suddenly 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.020
 look for other books is the segment but 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.500
 I overcame Indian backpacker's guide 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.230
 galaxies and to finish this video a 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.300
 romance the diary of a passion 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.950
 nicholas sparks who accompany me to 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.480
 time knows who is coming here in the 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.060
 channel will now find out that I have 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.010
 a certain opening nicolas sparks 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.150
 but this was the first book I 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.250
 Author's li 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.190
 So for me, it was the novelty. 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.110
 I really liked him and I gave him a four 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.820
 or five nicolosi sports books and 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.120
 The one that remains my favorite 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.060
 so far the movie from this book 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.770
 is also very good is not so faithful but the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.340
 adaptation was well done 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.110
 by the way, dear John, it 's a love 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.060
 to remember from there and diary of a 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.770
 passion I found it well adapted 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.510
 I did not see the other movies I did not read 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.310
 books but I'll tell you the 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.190
 found that over time 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.320
 but it's a novel that I point out with a 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.229
 little drama or sparks 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.539
 always has that drama but it's the daily 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.190
 of a passion 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.470
 so this is it these are my indications 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.780

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.270
