00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.433
 Pilots, everyone. 

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:14.633
 You are now watching the 4th-order British heavy fighter - Blenheim's film guide 

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:20.300
 Blenheim is the first aircraft in the second branch of the British fighter plane. It is a real heavy fighter. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.600
 It has two engines and many machine guns, and one of them is a tail machine gun. 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.333
 This makes Blenheim a dangerous opponent for careless pilots. 

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.100
 Because it has two engines, it affects mobility. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.633
 Blenheim's tumbling performance is not the same as that of the German aircraft Bf.110B, but it takes less time to fully flip 360 degrees than the latter. 

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:46.367
 Since Blenheim is not equipped with large caliber guns, its optimal configuration is only slightly above average. 

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:52.167
 But this is not a problem. Although Blenheim does not have a large caliber gun, it is equipped with many machine guns. 

00:00:52.267 --> 00:01:02.633
 Among the existing aircraft, Blenheim only lost to Bf.110B and A6M1. Even in the basic configuration, the two aircraft also have organic guns. 

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:06.933
 Speed ​​performance depends almost on which modules are installed 

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.467
 As far as Blenheim's basic configuration is concerned, it only outperforms BSH-2 

00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:19.267
 But once you look at its top-level module, you know that it is comparable in speed to most fighters, only to the German-class aircraft. 

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:23.767
 In addition, Blenheim also has excellent durability 

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.867
 In terms of blood volume, only BSH-2 is slightly more than it 

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:33.733
 In other words, Blenheim's durability increases, helping to use specific equipment effectively. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 Now let's conduct research 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.567
 As mentioned earlier, Blenheim's basic configuration is not fast enough. 

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:48.700
 To overcome this, first look at the top-level Mercury XVI engine. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.433
 The next step is to study the Blenheim V-body. 

00:01:52.533 --> 00:02:01.333
 This increases the durability, speed and maneuverability of the aircraft and allows the installation of four Whiteron machine guns with a diameter of .303. 

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.900
 Then everyone should study those machine guns 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.033
 The top Vickers K double-connected turret should be placed at the end of the study 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.333
 Because Blenheim is only equipped with a machine gun, it can only be fired at close range. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.333
 Blenheim's best range is about 300-400 meters. 

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:27.233
 There are so many things to study. Let’s talk about height now. 

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:32.767
 Although Blenheim's rate of climb is very poor, its climbing angle is very good. 

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:39.900
 With this in mind, you should replace the long-distance climb with short-range vertical maneuvers. 

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:44.300
 This will help maintain speed and increase availability. 

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:49.833
 Blenheim did not perform well when the flying height was below 750 meters. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.167
 In such a height range, it loses its own speed advantage, and its low mobility is not conducive to the effective use of terrain. 

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.200
 So you should climb to a higher altitude 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.100
 When the flying height reaches 950 meters, Blenheim's cruising speed begins to increase. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.933
 When the flying height is 1200-1300 meters, it reaches its highest cruising speed. 

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:14.167
 This is the best height range for air combat. 

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:19.167
 Blenheim's top speed begins to drop when the height exceeds 1500 meters 

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:24.033
 Only climb to this height when preparing for the next attack or regrouping 

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:27.600
 Now let's talk about the tactics in battle. 

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.933
 It should be wise to choose the target 

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:35.900
 The highest priority is the enemy aircraft with fast speed and high flying height. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.600
 The sooner you destroy them, the easier it is for you and your team to fight. 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.867
 This is also what you need to try at the beginning of the battle. 

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:49.267
 First, climb to the best flight height at the beginning of the battle and try to stay behind the friendly aircraft. 

00:03:49.367 --> 00:03:54.367
 This tactic can help avoid frontal attacks because Blenheim is not good at frontal attacks. 

00:03:54.467 --> 00:04:00.933
 Second, try to avoid the boom-zoom tactic because Blenheim's maximum dive speed is too low to use this tactic. 

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:07.467
 You can't follow the dive to attack enemy aircraft, but you should destroy them when they fly over. 

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:13.533
 I hope that you will destroy the enemy engine and then turn the enemy into a target that is easy to attack. 

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:19.767
 After the initial attack, make sure that it is not tracked by the enemy plane and try to fly back to a certain height. 

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.767
 Then you can focus on the next goal. 

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:27.567
 However, different tactics should be used for different types of enemy aircraft. 

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:29.733
 Let's take a closer look. 

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:32.967
 Fighting against enemy fighters is the most difficult 

00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:39.267
 Since Blenheim is only equipped with a machine gun, it should be close to the target before firing. 

00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:42.167
 This can be done in different ways 

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:48.267
 For slower aircraft, a dive attack can be used, while for an agile fighter, a flying attack can be used to destroy it. 

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:52.200
 If the enemy has less blood, you can use a frontal attack. 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.633
 When being chased, try to lure the enemy plane near your own fighter. Don't count on the gunner at the tail. 

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:05.367
 Not getting support? Use the maximum boost of the engine to get the flying height, then swoop down to chase the enemy planes to kill them. 

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.100
 Fighting with heavy fighters is a bit easier 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.733
 Because Blenheim has a good horsepower, it can temporarily ignore the gunner at the tail of the enemy plane. 

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:17.567
 And its mobility allows you to take advantage of the German heavy fighters. 

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:22.900
 The most important thing is to prevent the enemy from climbing or attacking you in front. 

00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:26.133
 The last type of aircraft to be said is the attack aircraft. 

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:30.333
 These aircraft are slow and cumbersome, but don't underestimate them. 

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.967
 You should try to shoot down those planes that have been damaged. 

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:41.400
 Don't spend too much time chasing the attack aircraft at low altitudes, as this will cause enemy fighters to pay attention. 

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:46.833
 Attacking ground targets is a waste of time and waste of blood 

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.900
 Blenheim can't bring a bomb or rocket 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.400
 So they do more damage to you than you do to them. 

00:05:55.333 --> 00:06:00.167
 If you are at the top of the team, you can use the tactics mentioned earlier. 

00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:03.833
 If it is at the bottom, the tactics are the same. 

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:08.100
 However, it must never be separated from higher-level friends at any time. 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.767
 The more friends around you, the longer you will survive in this type of battle. 

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:17.833
 Now let's talk about how to fight 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.067
 Several faster fighters are the best teammates to choose from. 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.333
 In this case, the fighter can attract the attention of the enemy plane, and Blenheim fights with them. 

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:35.233
 The fighter can also cover the rear of Blenheim or help destroy more tenacious enemy aircraft 

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:42.467
 All in all, how to fight for a British aircraft, especially the British heavy fighter 

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:45.167
 Blenheim gave a good demonstration in general. 

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:53.100
 Pilots who can control such erratic steel birds will also perform well when driving other aircraft in this spur.
