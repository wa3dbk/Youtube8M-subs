00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.569 
pretty excited about that but it so it
was<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.200> good<00:01:12.289> night<00:01:12.439> for<00:01:12.560> us<00:01:12.649> but<00:01:12.889> this<00:01:13.369> was

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
was a good night for us but this was

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.289 
was a good night for us but this was
still<00:01:13.670> just<00:01:13.819> a<00:01:15.039> as<00:01:16.039> such<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:16.429> cheesy<00:01:16.729> tactic<00:01:17.209> I

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
still just a as such a cheesy tactic I

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.629 
still just a as such a cheesy tactic I
don't<00:01:17.810> comprehend<00:01:18.170> why<00:01:18.439> how<00:01:18.920> people<00:01:19.369> can<00:01:19.520> do

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
don't comprehend why how people can do

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:22.809 
don't comprehend why how people can do
that<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:19.909> find<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.959> fun<00:01:21.229> but<00:01:21.859> I<00:01:22.069> just<00:01:22.280> I<00:01:22.490> love

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
that and find it fun but I just I love

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.269 
that and find it fun but I just I love
this<00:01:22.999> map<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.560> actually<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:24.950> first<00:01:25.100> time

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279 
this map this is actually the first time

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.160 
this map this is actually the first time
I<00:01:25.310> saw<00:01:25.609> people<00:01:25.909> using<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.359> tactic<00:01:26.779> but<00:01:26.959> this

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
I saw people using this tactic but this

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.609 
I saw people using this tactic but this
is<00:01:27.289> still<00:01:27.499> one<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.009> my<00:01:28.279> favorite<00:01:28.700> maps<00:01:29.079> if<00:01:30.079> for

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
is still one of my favorite maps if for

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.980 
is still one of my favorite maps if for
conquest<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:31.549> think<00:01:32.359> mostly<00:01:32.630> just<00:01:32.840> because

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
conquest I think mostly just because

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.660 
conquest I think mostly just because
there's<00:01:33.170> not<00:01:33.380> very<00:01:33.409> many<00:01:33.829> vehicles<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.459> just

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
there's not very many vehicles it's just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.989 
there's not very many vehicles it's just
pure<00:01:34.999> for<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.749> most<00:01:35.929> part<00:01:36.520> 95%<00:01:37.520> infantry

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
pure for the most part 95% infantry

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.510 
pure for the most part 95% infantry
fighting<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.469> design<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.099> it<00:01:40.249> the<00:01:40.399> way

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
fighting and the design of it the way

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.459 
fighting and the design of it the way
that<00:01:40.729> it's<00:01:40.849> a<00:01:40.939> circle<00:01:41.389> and<00:01:41.569> not<00:01:41.689> necessarily<00:01:42.289> a

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
that it's a circle and not necessarily a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.120 
that it's a circle and not necessarily a
linear<00:01:43.099> path<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:44.509> is<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.840> very<00:01:45.079> enjoying<00:01:45.529> map<00:01:45.859> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
linear path is is a very enjoying map to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.529 
linear path is is a very enjoying map to
play<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:46.939> very<00:01:47.029> visually<00:01:47.509> appealing

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
play on and it's very visually appealing

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.499 
play on and it's very visually appealing
it's<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:48.619> something<00:01:49.039> that<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.279> are<00:01:49.670> used<00:01:50.329> to

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
it's not something that you are used to

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.489 
it's not something that you are used to

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
PC version slightly letdown I was really

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.819 
PC version slightly letdown I was really
hoping<00:03:51.569> that<00:03:51.750> they<00:03:51.870> wouldn't<00:03:52.109> do<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
hoping that they wouldn't do that

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.280 
hoping that they wouldn't do that
I<00:03:52.950> love<00:03:53.370> DLC<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.150> know<00:03:54.239> additional<00:03:54.720> DLC<00:03:55.200> is

I love DLC you know additional DLC is
great<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.069> wish<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.430> was<00:03:56.519> always<00:03:56.670> free<00:03:57.420> or

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
great but I wish it was always free or

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.590 
great but I wish it was always free or
something<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.310> way<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.519> which<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.420> doesn't

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
something of the way to which it doesn't

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.650 
something of the way to which it doesn't
divide<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.109> community<00:04:02.389> hopefully<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.480> won't

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
divide the community hopefully it won't

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.090 
divide the community hopefully it won't
with<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.260> way<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.500> they're<00:04:04.650> dealing<00:04:04.859> with

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
with the way that they're dealing with

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.690 
with the way that they're dealing with
