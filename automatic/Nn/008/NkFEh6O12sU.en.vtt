00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.889
 hello everyone in this when announcing how 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.930
 create a great automatic meat 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.910
 cooked good be doing a simple 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.290
 we take a couple of pots let's say 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.920
 we have them in a stable and a nice 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.290
 we take them we have them here 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.320
 we would go up to this area that good 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.730
 until what would be the farm and here 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.160
 we have to launch either with the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.700
 hand or pushing the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.650
 hitting the windows and there it is and 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.310
 now the next thing would be to come for this 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.620
 part and with the wheat reproduce them 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.510
 as we see how we see the large casualties 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.390
 they do not manage to fall but when decreed we 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.860
 they gave small cows which will fall 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.860
 now as we see here also the cows 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.150
 little ones do not burn why they do not occupy 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.220
 the amount of block needed to 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.230
 I was talking or for people from public 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.480
 but big cows when those 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.820
 small boats that grow 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.550
 do great starting it will push and you 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.100
 burn 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 and washed with burn Lt. 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.149
 cooked meat and leather enter to give 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.410
 that blow we are going to remove trunnion for 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.940
 the tutorial we go to see several 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.220
 materials the truth is very difficult to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.300
 doing the hardest thing would always be the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.270
 hoppers but they did not give us much 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.729
 problem we take we put a copper here 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.690
 we connect with a hopper of the other 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.300
 torben front and here we put 12 jungle or 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.369
 two on the other side and this we have 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.610
 pipelines is going to be the front would be a 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.800
 structure of 3 x 5 3 of width 5 of 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.610
 long and now we take with what we're going to 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.040
 cover him 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.230
 all this I 'm going to use glass 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.110
 because I think it's very nice but it 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.180
 expected to be destroyed in this area 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.160
 here that wall here we are going to leave 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.690
 only 1 high compared 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.439
 with the highs and the others we are going to 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:52.810
 3 to high cost 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.210
 as I said to this part three high and 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.400
 two of high good as in saying it 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.470
 is that if we take it compared to 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.940
 the floor would be 3 tall but one 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.720
 comparison with bacteria only 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.970
 2 now we take what winston would be 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.619
 that will be the ones that will push the cows 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.000
 great remember that they have to leave 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.069
 to the second level because we hold in the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.330
 first level here push the cows 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.459
 small and small cows to be 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.590
 pushed to push to jump and it's 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.760
 start to burn with side now we take 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.000
 what would be posters like the Moldovan 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.379
 and when the posters that way in the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.730
 second box we respond to the not here 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.860
 they will go up 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 so that the lava does not escape 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.140
 and in the first one they will go down so that 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.850
 burn the cows that are small 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.280
 we put here in there you have to push the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.290
 key 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.319
 just like that and now we will put the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.299
 as we see the hand does not escape nor every 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.180
 down and now we're going to connect the 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.230
 pistons with what would be man what the 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.240
 watch if it has to be a little 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.280
 specific 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.110
 we take stone because the rest is not 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.110
 can put on the glass 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.080
 and then let's do it this way 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.319
 we connect all the slats with 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.909
 repeaters and repeaters with rest 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.980
 then we put the pistons of this 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.980
 way not pistons here 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.360
 repeaters we need congress 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.980
 we work here and here we will build 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.360
 the blog the blog should be this way 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.080
 three repeaters for one side three for 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.420
 the other and all at maximum speed 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.030
 we connect alone contrasted and the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.940
 we turn on we already pay fast as we see 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.910
 will be pushing and coming back pushing and 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.920
 getting back 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.520
 we place stones on people 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.140
 and on the other side to actually build 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.489
 they can do what they want but I 'm 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.319
 using glass like then now 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.020
 on this stone what we are going to 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.569
 use will be the ribs because the 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.150
 strawberries make whole cows not 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.489
 they see it fall but the small ones and this is 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.620
 because whole herds occupy more than 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.310
 a block 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.790
 but the 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:18.359
 those that are small only occupy 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.280
 occupy less than one block 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.889
 then with this and the big cows 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.820
 they will not fall because with the bottles like 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.370
 model that as we see 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.060
 now we assume signs in this other 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.860
 side of him 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.570
 on the opposite side so that when 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.120
 you get here then the small cows 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.830
 do not float is unlikely but 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.760
 everything can happen can happen and 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.650
 we prefer to avoid now he's here 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.960
 this floor must be March 3 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.030
 so good 3 wide then that 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.220
 they have to be hollow day 1 to whom to 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.800
 the sunny stone and it's from here would be the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.800
 third we're just going to put and now the 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:00.310
 next would be to cover everything and with that 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.310
 we conclude this serial 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.750
 there were the problems 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.719
 and now we have it from this part 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.719
 then we go here 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.539
 we take what would be water 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.250
 and that would be all we put something here 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.240
 we can get some stairs by 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.090
 this area on the other side like you 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.920
 prefer to create vaquitas when 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.770
 let's bring the cows we put them here 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.660
 and as we see good as we see here the 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.040
 vacations do not fall but the little ones 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.370
 health produce the cows where the 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.810
 small if they manage to fall 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:52.310
 there is a small 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:55.150
 they are small ages but now the 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.150
 small no 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.280
 but as it grows 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.870
 they started to push and it will start 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.420
 burn 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.420
 and how are we going to see when taking 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.270
 cooked meat and leather will travel by 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.760
 the as by the hoppers and revenge 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.760
 this street but some will certainly give 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.680
 good I hope you liked it 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.760
 keep watching my aic videos 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.760
 subscribe goodbye
