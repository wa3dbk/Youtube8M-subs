camp position sensor easiest way to do

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.390 
camp position sensor easiest way to do
it<00:00:15.219> is<00:00:15.369> to<00:00:15.580> remove<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:17.260> 10<00:00:17.619> millimeter<00:00:17.650> bolts

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
it is to remove the 10 millimeter bolts

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.220 
it is to remove the 10 millimeter bolts
holding<00:00:18.730> down<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:19.150> computer

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
holding down the computer

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.820 
holding down the computer
I<00:00:21.260> believe<00:00:22.099> there's<00:00:22.900> one<00:00:23.900> two<00:00:24.140> three<00:00:24.170> four

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
I believe there's one two three four

I believe there's one two three four
five<00:00:25.189> bolts<00:00:26.230> pulling<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:27.320> down<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.859> then<00:00:28.160> I've

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
five bolts pulling it down and then I've

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.810 
five bolts pulling it down and then I've
better<00:00:29.180> access<00:00:29.689> to<00:00:30.140> these<00:00:30.470> sensor<00:00:30.980> once<00:00:31.669> the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
better access to these sensor once the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.540 
better access to these sensor once the
computer<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.360> unbolted<00:00:33.220> gives<00:00:34.220> you<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.370> little

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
computer is unbolted gives you a little

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.970 
computer is unbolted gives you a little
more<00:00:34.670> room<00:00:35.059> it<00:00:35.510> might<00:00:35.750> not<00:00:35.960> be<00:00:36.140> necessary<00:00:36.800> on

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
more room it might not be necessary on

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.400 
more room it might not be necessary on
all<00:00:37.160> vehicles<00:00:37.870> then<00:00:38.870> we're<00:00:39.110> going<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:39.290> go

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
all vehicles then we're going to go

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.729 
all vehicles then we're going to go
after<00:00:39.589> the<00:00:39.920> cam<00:00:40.250> sensor<00:00:40.610> clip<00:00:41.470> now<00:00:42.470> you<00:00:42.620> can

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
after the cam sensor clip now you can

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.610 
after the cam sensor clip now you can
see<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.010> as<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.160> red<00:00:43.489> tag<00:00:44.059> on<00:00:44.329> it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
see it as a red tag on it

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.280 
see it as a red tag on it
that<00:00:45.620> tag<00:00:45.920> has<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.280> be<00:00:46.400> pushed<00:00:46.670> out<00:00:47.079> in<00:00:48.079> order

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
that tag has to be pushed out in order

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.149 
that tag has to be pushed out in order
to<00:00:48.409> get<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.710> clip<00:00:48.920> up<00:00:49.100> then<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:49.940> used<00:00:50.239> some

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
to get the clip up then I used some

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.410 
to get the clip up then I used some
pliers<00:00:52.420> similar<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:53.600> these<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:55.280> grab<00:00:55.879> onto<00:00:56.119> the

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
pliers similar to these to grab onto the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.780 
pliers similar to these to grab onto the
end<00:00:56.629> of<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.809> clip<00:00:57.049> pull<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.850> then<00:00:58.850> we<00:00:59.030> can<00:00:59.239> go

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
end of the clip pull it then we can go

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.509 
end of the clip pull it then we can go
try<00:01:01.790> to<00:01:01.820> get<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.210> allen<00:01:02.750> bolt<00:01:03.019> that's<00:01:03.979> on<00:01:04.309> the

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
try to get the allen bolt that's on the

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
try to get the allen bolt that's on the
actual<00:01:05.170> sensor

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
actual sensor

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.640 
actual sensor
and<00:01:07.760> try<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> sensor<00:01:09.390> up

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.680 

so<00:01:14.220> here's<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> bolt<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.150> holds<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.510> the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
so here's a bolt that holds down the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.200 
so here's a bolt that holds down the
sensor

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
sensor

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.590 
sensor
you<00:01:17.840> can<00:01:17.990> see<00:01:18.170> it's<00:01:18.290> coming<00:01:18.620> out

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
you can see it's coming out

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.830 
you can see it's coming out
now

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
now

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
now
I'll<00:01:22.619> show<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.190> tools<00:01:23.520> needed<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.150> this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.580 

once<00:01:35.430> your<00:01:35.610> bolt<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.090> removed<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.410> can

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
once your bolt is removed then you can

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.160 
once your bolt is removed then you can
pry<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.760> sensor<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.100> out

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:57.440 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.350 

and<00:01:58.450> here's<00:01:59.020> what<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.439> center<00:01:59.799> looks<00:02:00.070> like

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.470 

this<00:02:03.110> one<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.500> leaking<00:02:04.160> probably<00:02:05.120> because<00:02:05.330> of

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
this one is leaking probably because of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.770 
this one is leaking probably because of
the<00:02:06.460> anaerobic<00:02:07.460> sealant<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.240> so<00:02:08.509> getting

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the anaerobic sealant and so getting

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.560 
the anaerobic sealant and so getting
replaced<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.380> or<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.970> square<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.390> boat

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
replaced this or this square the boat

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.770 
replaced this or this square the boat
goes

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.980 

here's<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> new<00:02:17.830> sensor<00:02:18.630> using<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.720> same

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
here's the new sensor using the same

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.770 
here's the new sensor using the same
bolt<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:22.360> through

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
bolt just going through

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.910 
bolt just going through
show<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.620> sensor<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.590> then

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
show the sensor in like this and then

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.970 
show the sensor in like this and then
as<00:02:31.430> long<00:02:31.670> as<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.880> bulk<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.480> started<00:02:34.180> then

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
as long as the bulk is started then

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.910 
as long as the bulk is started then
we'll<00:02:36.980> be<00:02:37.100> able<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.280> cinch<00:02:37.610> down<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.270> sensor

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.980
