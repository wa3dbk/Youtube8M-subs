you need one of these cable gland just
to<00:03:33.480> protect<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.900> seal<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.800> give<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.880> rating

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
to protect the seal and give that rating

there's a few methods of achieving this
one<00:04:17.070> is<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.280> use<00:04:17.430> extremely<00:04:18.000> well<00:04:18.330> specified

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
one is to use extremely well specified

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.970 
one is to use extremely well specified
gasket<00:04:19.590> seals<00:04:20.120> hinges<00:04:21.120> lids<00:04:21.540> etc<00:04:22.109> they<00:04:22.740> tend

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
gasket seals hinges lids etc they tend

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.920 
gasket seals hinges lids etc they tend
to<00:04:23.010> be<00:04:23.100> slightly<00:04:23.280> more<00:04:23.550> expensive<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.780> other

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
to be slightly more expensive the other

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.080 
to be slightly more expensive the other
option<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.919> use<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.070> standard<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.789> well

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
option is to use a standard and well

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.719 
option is to use a standard and well
