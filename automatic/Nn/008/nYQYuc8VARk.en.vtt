00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.260
 well that's all it's a feeling 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.019
 indescribable is something totally 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.920
 unexpected for me 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.160
 I'm super happy 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.539
 with so much I have no word that has 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.380
 dragged 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.609
 yes when I got here I came here 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.610
 thinking that being here had already 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.520
 won 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.430
 when they passed me to the final I thought that 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.310
 with having passed to the final 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:39.110
 I was leaving with so much heart 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.110
 and then if we win any prize 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.470
 hear 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.980
 which was not thought to be something that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.980
 was not 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.260
 I did not think I could get it good 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.380
 has never won a singer of that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380
 shape 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.810
 if it's something to accompany with the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.450
 guitar is something that is not seen and the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.530
 it's really much more difficult 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.929
 more complex because you have to be 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 pending of the microphone of the voice of 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.240
 letter guitar microphone 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.610
 the falseta 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.040
 of many things you can not stop to drink 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.720
 water since we call everything is a bit more 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.360
 complicated but in the end 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.140
 that the artistic result is more 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.140
 full 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.369
 but you know what you sing you know why 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.060
 singing dances you have been a long time 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.210
 studying flamenco 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.400
 and you are going to make a 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.870
 despite too much because we need a 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.570
 reference strength of the rabbit 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.760
 Man and now 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.780
 what I feel with the lamp is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.780
 great responsibility 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.360
 and good and I have to prove day by day 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.580
 that playing is not wrong with me when 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.030
 it's a responsibility that I have to 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030
 defend it 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.920
 small videos of fonts for 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.300
 known 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.300
 and interpret also the mining 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.120
 well then 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.569
 of the songs of the earth 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:51.420
 the interior of the pineapple red of all 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:56.340
 Incarnation Fernandez then try 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.340
 learn from everyone and I will have to continue 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.310
 of real city because of course also 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.830
 vindicate flamenco a little 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.620
 flamingos of the spot that there is a 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.270
 very flamenco land and reconciled where 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.490
 there are very good singers and very good 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.330
 guitarists and also defend the 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.040
 flamenco from the spot that has been before 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.610
 guitarist who sang 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.219
 I have the guitar that connect, let's start 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.959
 the guitar for my father who is the one 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.250
 I instilled the hobby the also with my 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.760
 father 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.580
 he sings and he wanted full touch 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.140
 the guitar but I started with him and hey 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.720
 little by little I got into the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.070
 mundillo accompanying singers but 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.070
 he is an artist who 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.040
 Flamenco is above the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.269
 guitar and 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.060
 I probably liked singing more than 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.700
 the guitar and I always like me 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.480
 sing when there was another guitarist 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.249
 america and until we decided to do it 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.370
 I'm going to try to do both 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.370
 the time 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.810
 and each of the guitarists that 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.000
 with the great cyclists has impacted 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.340
 our 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.340
 in this case a sung one that has wanted 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.100
 dry but support in this case combine 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.470
 more the sites when 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.940
 for a while so it 's that I 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.220
 I was there hiding behind the 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.750
 guitar and 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.010
 and well there was a moment that good 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.490
 well me too 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.720
 so I decided to do it and here we have 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.720
 arrived in the Senate 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.120
 and I remembered my family from 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.060
 people who have supported me and of 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.160
 the people who are with me 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:52.560
 and above all of my family and my people 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:56.690
 and from my friends and friends 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.690
 and now that I am at this moment like this 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:03.429
 talking to them and where to be insist 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.429
 it is not possible to sleep 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.050
 because it's something super happy 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.240
 on Monday he will start working 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.240
 that is to say good
