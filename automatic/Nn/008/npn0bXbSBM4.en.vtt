00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.240
 disneyworld 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.400
 we all know that perfect park of 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.559
 Disney in Florida for many is the 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.770
 paradise but everything has something 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.930
 well it also has its dark side 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.760
 thanks to the report of rebel jules 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.410
 who wrote about the deaths and 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.800
 accidents without more detours we begin 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 number 8 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.500
 tom sawyer if it 's land in 1973 two guys 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.720

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.220
 island which is an artificial island 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.580
 surrounded by the rivers of america 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.300
 disney de lauro ty his brother 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.790
 unfortunately they lost the last 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.580
 raft back to the park and they were 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.800
 trapped on the island they did not want 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.440
 get into trouble so they decided 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.410
 swim across the artificial river island of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 back to the park they did not notice 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.720
 that artificial rivers are not 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.090
 made to swim remember that scene 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.820
 from willy wonka where the fat kid 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.820
 falls to the chocolate river something a little 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 how that happened to one of the guys the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.400
 little brother was saved but the brother 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.130
 drowned I take employers from the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.440
 park firemen and police eight hours 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.930
 to find your body 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.000
 the turbine produced a stream of water 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.330
 and fake rapids that took his body 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.590
 until it was captured on the rocks 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.590
 number 7 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.040
 marcelo towers of 22 years never 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.930
 he imagined that upon arriving at the expected dinsey 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.479
 world was going to die in one of the games 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.660
 more innocent and soft the train the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.160
 great mountain of thunder 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.380
 marcelo was located in the first 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.600
 wagon the route came up to a 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.790
 tunnel to your bad luck one of the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.369
 locomotive wheels failed what 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.530
 caused it to brake but the wagons of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.509
 back they did not do what caused a 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.460
 great clash between the wagons and the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.160
 locomotive doing that by impact 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.380
 he got up crushing with all his weight 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.330
 of the skull and chest of marcelo towers 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.540
 causing a graphic death and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.060
 bloody is certainly an experience 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.590
 traumatic and horrible that the passengers 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 from behind will never forget 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.410
 number 6 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.870
 the reasons why they always check 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.849
 bags before entering parks or 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.730
 attractions is to prevent 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.159
 stupid provoke their own death 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.950
 marc maples climbed the roller coaster of 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.470
 matero people would think that a boy 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.870
 of 15 years would have well developed the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.299
 common sense but this young man decided 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.609
 remove the harness and stop when your 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.560
 wagon was on a slope just 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.689
 before they reached the descent but 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.389
 he wanted to know what he would feel if he 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.680
 will be stopped while lowering what 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.019
 it was still obvious 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.579
 Marc did not manage to hold on to the harness and the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.909
 halo gravity towards the ground 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.319
 breaking his skull completely 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.450
 turning him into the first dead man of 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:15.540
 disneyland park nine years 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.540
 after open number five 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.569
 toni a 28 year old mother also died 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.150
 on the roller coaster of matero in this 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.430
 case the harness was the one that failed and it did 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.739
 at a critical moment causing your 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.230
 body was fired with enough 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.420
 force to climb 5 meters in the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.730
 air and it fell into another cart full of 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.430
 passengers that came from behind breaking 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.560
 almost all of his bones were counted 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.530
 those that do not give you a quick death 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.900
 but bloody they had to remove 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.650
 all the rails to get your 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.870
 body 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.030
 this time the accident was the fault of the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.030
 park number 4 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.640
 TomÃ¡s Cleveland was also a victim of 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.290
 the disney games but this time it was 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.720
 his own fault was the year 1966 came from 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.730
 a low class family his dream was 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.190
 enter disney but I did not have the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.709
 enough money he could have saved 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.110
 and worked to enter a weekend 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.239
 but instead he found out about a 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.820
 party that would be organized in one of the 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.400
 parks is would be your opportunity to 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.280
 be able to sneak away and that no staff 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.229
 I realized I climb a wall that 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.080
 I was stuck to a high train 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.060
 disney speed is not known if it was the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.580
 confusion or emotion that does not 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.590
 allowed to react and the locomotive 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.590
 he ran around crushing his entire body 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.510
 3 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.570
 Ricky Llama was a teenager who died 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.790
 for his own carelessness because he died in 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.000
 the people move that is the most attraction 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.880
 innocent Disney was a very walk 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.580
 slow and relaxed ricky thought it would be 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.180
 cool stand and move to the back car 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.310
 when they were on the move 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.550
 stumbled but did not have the luck to fall 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.460
 to the vacuum that would be faster in your case 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.030
 he fell on the rails being crushed by 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.220
 the cart where he was trying to jump his 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.650
 death was slow and tortuous and 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.130
 passengers said they could hear 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.310
 how each of his bones thundered 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.310
 number 2 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.620
 Javier Cruz had one of the most dead 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.620
 cynics of the park he worked as a 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.290
 character the famous pluto character 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.110
 that day there would be a parade of beauty and 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.810
 the beast 'they say he was drunk 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.850
 dizzy others say it was just a 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.890
 accident but it is hard to believe 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.800
 since what killed him was the 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.900
 main carriage weighing a few 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.180
 tons and it moves slow what what 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.090
 he killed horribly in a disguise of 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.220
 pluto their cries were overshadowed with 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.670
 the cries and cries of the little ones 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.000
 children who watched the whole show 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.000
 number one 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.969
 This is the most horrific death that 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.219
 he knows the cry of the victim was 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.210
 recorded while dying between two walls 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.909
 of iron 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.580
 the show of america sings is easy 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:21.949
 and pretty has rotating seats 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.169
 that move slowly where the 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.169
 parents and children sit watching 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.620
 but this carousel was special because 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.229
 it was mechanical was better than others this 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.409
 Carousel was unhappy because he has 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.939
 separations between section and section 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.819
 Horrible thing for the young debtor 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:43.219
 Welsh tony 18 who fell in these 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:45.439
 spaces and was crushed by the weight of the 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.629
 scenario causing death more 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:51.159
 horrible of the one who has knowledge in 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.159
 Disneyland Park 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.700
 all right
