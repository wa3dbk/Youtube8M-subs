00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.470 
the only thing about this these
lipsticks<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.640> far<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:05.970> I've<00:03:06.060> noticed<00:03:06.209> is

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
lipsticks so far that I've noticed is

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.479 
lipsticks so far that I've noticed is
that<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:06.810> tend<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.410> bleed<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:08.160> your<00:03:08.280> lips

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that they do tend to bleed on your lips

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.840 
that they do tend to bleed on your lips
so<00:03:08.760> it's<00:03:08.940> really<00:03:09.120> important<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.020> wear

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
so it's really important that you wear

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.190 
so it's really important that you wear
some<00:03:11.850> sort<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.300> maybe<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.600> concealer

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
some sort of like maybe a concealer

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.350 
some sort of like maybe a concealer
around<00:03:13.319> your<00:03:13.620> lips<00:03:13.770> or<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> lip<00:03:14.280> liner<00:03:14.520> to

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
around your lips or a lip liner to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.500 
around your lips or a lip liner to
prevent<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.840> from<00:03:16.400> from<00:03:17.400> cracking<00:03:17.730> around<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
prevent it from from cracking around the

could see myself wearing it as an
evening<00:06:58.480> color<00:06:58.750> I<00:06:59.050> do<00:06:59.110> feel<00:06:59.800> like<00:07:00.070> I<00:07:00.100> need<00:07:00.550> a

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
evening color I do feel like I need a

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.540 
evening color I do feel like I need a
lip<00:07:01.900> liner<00:07:02.110> for<00:07:02.410> it<00:07:02.560> though<00:07:02.740> and<00:07:03.010> this<00:07:03.250> one<00:07:03.430> in

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
lip liner for it though and this one in

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.250 
lip liner for it though and this one in
particular<00:07:03.670> because<00:07:04.180> it<00:07:04.570> seems<00:07:04.840> to<00:07:04.990> go<00:07:05.230> on

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
particular because it seems to go on

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.500 
particular because it seems to go on
very<00:07:05.560> dark<00:07:05.890> in<00:07:06.040> the<00:07:06.130> center<00:07:06.520> and<00:07:06.640> a<00:07:07.180> little<00:07:07.390> bit

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
very dark in the center and a little bit

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.720 
very dark in the center and a little bit
lighter<00:07:07.720> around<00:07:08.170> the<00:07:08.290> edges<00:07:08.470> so<00:07:08.980> I<00:07:09.010> think<00:07:09.340> like

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
lighter around the edges so I think like

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.240 
lighter around the edges so I think like
a<00:07:10.030> lip<00:07:10.750> liner<00:07:10.930> maybe<00:07:11.470> the<00:07:11.620> similar<00:07:11.950> color

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
a lip liner maybe the similar color

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.930 
a lip liner maybe the similar color
would<00:07:12.940> really<00:07:13.360> finish<00:07:13.870> the<00:07:14.230> look<00:07:14.440> to<00:07:15.070> help<00:07:15.790> it

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
would really finish the look to help it

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.120 
would really finish the look to help it
stand<00:07:16.120> out<00:07:16.300> even<00:07:16.360> more<00:07:16.660> but<00:07:17.050> otherwise<00:07:17.770> I

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
stand out even more but otherwise I

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.740 
stand out even more but otherwise I
think<00:07:18.160> it's<00:07:18.460> a<00:07:18.550> very<00:07:18.760> beautiful<00:07:18.910> color<00:07:19.390> all
