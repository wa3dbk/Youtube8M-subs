00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.920
 hello hunters welcome to the channel 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.380
 barbie y cÃ­a we continue with our 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.400
 analysis of armors and it's the turn of 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.380
 the armature of the cross guide for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.419
 swordsman this is another one of the armors 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.759
 of monsters that do not appear in the 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.420
 monster hunter 4 but that can be 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.480
 manufacture 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.390
 this armor has a basic defense 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.140
 per piece of 60 what a total of 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:45.190
 300 and can reach a maximum per piece 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:50.620
 of 113 what would make a total of 565 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:54.730
 it's rare 6 and it has 8 slots and one 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.930
 once finished the external analysis we are going to 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.989
 move to internal analysis as always 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.170
 let's start with the resistances 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:10.540
 elementals this armor has less 25 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:14.289
 on fire 5 water 15 act or less 5 a 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.170
 ice and minus 5 dragon we went to see 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.270
 active skills the first 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.020
 Fast loading affects the speed of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.560
 load of long swords and double ax 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.220
 sword charlie axel big bow sword and 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.319
 hammer the second mass increases the damage 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.780
 when hitting parts of the body where 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.149
 your attacks are very effective 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.159
 the third awakening releases the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.220
 elementary properties latent in 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:46.569
 weapons that lack elements the fourth 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.909
 the negative is abnormal states affects 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.550
 the duration of the attacks of states 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.340
 abnormal 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.960
 and seen this let's move on to the table 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.040
 distribution of points here the order 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:04.640
 change the first is to wake up 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.640
 the second is en masse 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.470
 the third is fast charge focus 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.880
 and the fourth is the negative states 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.340
 abnormal 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.340
 and 3 this is the time of the piece 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.770
 piece before we can the helmet have two 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.810
 slots and you know that in the part 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.840
 bottom of the screen we are putting 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.910
 translated therefore all the resistances 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.280
 elementary that gives us to each of the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.730
 pieces and points to skills 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.190
 that gives us each of the pieces 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.360
 we move on to the next one that is the chest 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.940
 the roof gives us a slot and we pass 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.110
 until you reach this last screen of 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.800
 here 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.130
 what is another of the important 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.110
 and we give way to the third piece the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.200
 gloves that also gives us a slot 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.850
 there we go to the points of 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.850
 the skills that the piecita gives us 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.110
 next the belt the belt gives us 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.380
 three slots 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.330
 and we are passing screens the description 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.970
 active skills until the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:24.330
 skills that this piece gives us 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.940
 and finally the pants on basso 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.660
 legs as you prefer to call them gives us 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.660
 a slot 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.969
 and with this last piece I'm leaving 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.250
 saying goodbye and so hunters I hope 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:41.079
 that you liked this little one 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.290
 analysis of this guide frame 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.569
 cross for swordsman that as I said 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.519
 in the cross guide does not appear as much 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.590
 He showed the lack of the 4 but you know that 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.090
 there is a way to get certain 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.670
 monsters armors that do not appear 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.530
 so as long as you have good 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.530
 houses and see you in upcoming videos
