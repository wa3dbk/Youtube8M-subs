00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
now I just kind of slice the little

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.040 
now I just kind of slice the little
cucumber<00:01:24.730> pieces<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.360> make<00:01:25.570> them<00:01:25.750> pretty

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
cucumber pieces and make them pretty

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.410 
cucumber pieces and make them pretty
thick<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:26.770> too<00:01:26.800> thin<00:01:27.040> but<00:01:27.940> if<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.210> want<00:01:28.360> to

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
thick not too thin but if you want to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.969 
thick not too thin but if you want to
talk<00:01:28.570> them<00:01:28.720> then<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.170> up<00:01:29.410> to<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.740> cut

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
talk them then it's up to you to now cut

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.530 
talk them then it's up to you to now cut
them<00:01:33.130> up<00:01:33.250> into<00:01:33.400> little<00:01:33.640> pieces<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:34.150> here<00:01:34.510> I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
them up into little pieces and here I

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.330 
them up into little pieces and here I
realized<00:01:34.960> they're<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.170> little<00:01:35.410> bit<00:01:35.620> too<00:01:35.979> thick

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
realized they're a little bit too thick

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.480 
realized they're a little bit too thick
so<00:01:36.370> I<00:01:36.640> made<00:01:37.090> them<00:01:37.270> thinner<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:37.990> rolled<00:01:38.229> up

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
so I made them thinner and I rolled up

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.710 
so I made them thinner and I rolled up
translucent<00:01:39.490> clay<00:01:39.640> into<00:01:40.030> little<00:01:40.300> balls<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
translucent clay into little balls and

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.750 
translucent clay into little balls and
put<00:01:40.930> them<00:01:40.960> on<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.650> cucumber<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.220> go<00:01:42.340> get<00:01:42.490> seeds

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
put them on the cucumber to go get seeds

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.790 
put them on the cucumber to go get seeds
now<00:01:43.510> put<00:01:43.750> on<00:01:43.840> dough<00:01:44.020> fitters<00:01:44.380> we're<00:01:44.680> gonna

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
now put on dough fitters we're gonna

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.240 
now put on dough fitters we're gonna
take<00:01:45.100> some<00:01:45.130> eco<00:01:45.640> clay<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.150> roll<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.630> into

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
take some eco clay and roll it into

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.650 
take some eco clay and roll it into
snakes<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.850> roughly<00:01:49.090> shape<00:01:49.390> them<00:01:49.540> into

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
snakes and just roughly shape them into

snakes don't make it too neat and take a
toothbrush<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:52.150> texture<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:54.729> you're<00:01:54.940> just

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
toothbrush to texture it now you're just

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.550 
toothbrush to texture it now you're just
gonna<00:01:55.180> take<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.660> same<00:01:55.810> chocolates<00:01:56.259> just<00:01:56.440> now

and put the snakes into the container
and<00:01:58.930> shake<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.440> up<00:01:59.590> you<00:02:00.160> don't<00:02:00.280> want<00:02:00.460> the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
and shake it up you don't want the

and shake it up you don't want the
fright<00:02:00.910> effect<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.509> look<00:02:01.690> too<00:02:02.110> even<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:02.800> that's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
fright effect to look too even so that's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.560 
fright effect to look too even so that's
why<00:02:03.160> I'm<00:02:03.369> doing<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.119> make<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.300> look<00:02:04.420> more

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
why I'm doing this to make it look more

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.440 
why I'm doing this to make it look more
uneven<00:02:05.200> then<00:02:05.860> I'm<00:02:06.130> taking<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.789> sandpaper

needle tool and just kind of texture the
little<00:02:27.790> lines<00:02:28.000> because<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.660> gonna<00:02:28.750> be

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
little lines because this is gonna be

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.050 
little lines because this is gonna be
the<00:02:29.019> pineapple<00:02:29.620> pieces<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.880> know<00:02:30.940> what

the pineapple pieces so you know what

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.580 
the pineapple pieces so you know what
you<00:02:31.269> wanna<00:02:31.420> make<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.720> realistic<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.290> do<00:02:32.440> this

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
you wanna make it realistic and do this

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.250 
you wanna make it realistic and do this
on<00:02:32.769> both<00:02:32.950> sides<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.450> also<00:02:34.660> use<00:02:34.870> an<00:02:34.989> exacto

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
on both sides you can also use an exacto

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.780 
on both sides you can also use an exacto
knife<00:02:35.530> what<00:02:35.769> I'm<00:02:35.890> doing<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.430> then<00:02:36.580> use

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
knife what I'm doing here and then use

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.039 
knife what I'm doing here and then use
the<00:02:36.910> knife<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.239> cut<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.630> into<00:02:37.840> little

the knife to cut it up into little

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.729 
the knife to cut it up into little
credible<00:02:38.769> pieces<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.810> for<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.110> peanuts<00:02:44.470> take

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
credible pieces now for the peanuts take

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.759 
credible pieces now for the peanuts take
some<00:02:44.920> EQ<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.519> brown<00:02:46.360> colored<00:02:46.750> clay<00:02:47.049> if<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.709> were

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
some EQ and brown colored clay if I were

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.320 
some EQ and brown colored clay if I were
to<00:02:47.920> do<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.070> again<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.700> will<00:02:48.760> actually<00:02:49.120> use

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
to do this again I will actually use

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.170 
to do this again I will actually use
more<00:02:49.630> EQ<00:02:50.079> instead<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.650> more<00:02:50.890> Brown<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.459> just

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
more EQ instead of more Brown and just

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.640 
more EQ instead of more Brown and just
use<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> blade<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.840> chop<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.200> up<00:02:53.260> into<00:02:53.440> little

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
use a blade and chop it up into little

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.210 
use a blade and chop it up into little
pieces<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:54.310> make<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.579> look<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:54.850> peanuts<00:02:55.299> and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
pieces to make it look like peanuts and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.860 
pieces to make it look like peanuts and
after<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.610> everything<00:02:58.060> just<00:02:58.329> bake<00:02:58.630> all

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
after that of everything just bake all

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.080 
after that of everything just bake all
the<00:02:59.200> ingredients<00:02:59.890> inside<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.549> oven<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.030> bake

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
the ingredients inside the oven and bake

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.810 
the ingredients inside the oven and bake
it<00:03:01.720> for<00:03:01.870> about<00:03:02.170> 10<00:03:02.500> minutes<00:03:02.709> at<00:03:02.980> 110<00:03:03.670> degrees

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
it for about 10 minutes at 110 degrees

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.580 
it for about 10 minutes at 110 degrees
Celsius<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:04.959> how<00:03:05.079> they<00:03:05.290> would<00:03:05.410> look

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
Celsius and this is how they would look

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.009 
Celsius and this is how they would look
like<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.250> make<00:03:06.880> sure<00:03:07.030> remove<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.660> bake<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
like and make sure remove to bake the

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.080 
like and make sure remove to bake the
peanuts<00:03:08.350> as<00:03:08.440> well<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.670> Trinity<00:03:09.970> of

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
peanuts as well and for the Trinity of

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.200 
peanuts as well and for the Trinity of
actually<00:03:10.510> made<00:03:10.750> them<00:03:10.900> flatter<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.829> in

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
actually made them flatter so that in

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.380 
actually made them flatter so that in
more<00:03:12.420> realistic<00:03:16.130> now<00:03:17.130> take<00:03:17.520> some<00:03:17.550> fimo<00:03:18.090> deco

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
more realistic now take some fimo deco

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.450 
more realistic now take some fimo deco
gel<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.290> more<00:03:19.650> translucent<00:03:20.100> than

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
gel and this is more translucent than

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.160 
gel and this is more translucent than
the<00:03:20.580> normal<00:03:20.910> vertical<00:03:21.210> gel<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.780> bought<00:03:21.990> this

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
the normal vertical gel I bought this

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.590 
the normal vertical gel I bought this
from<00:03:22.350> popular<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.190> brown<00:03:23.460> point<00:03:23.760> then<00:03:24.330> take

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
from popular in brown point then take

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.570 
from popular in brown point then take
some<00:03:24.780> acrylic<00:03:24.960> paint<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.470> mix<00:03:25.800> in<00:03:26.040> some<00:03:26.070> brown

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580

and<00:03:26.880> black<00:03:27.270> acrylic<00:03:27.450> paint<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.290> looks<00:03:28.470> like

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and black acrylic paint so it looks like

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:43.490 
and black acrylic paint so it looks like

using<00:04:32.289> sculpey<00:04:32.800> translucent<00:04:33.429> liquid<00:04:33.550> sculpey

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:34.529 
using sculpey translucent liquid sculpey

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.260 
using sculpey translucent liquid sculpey
and<00:04:35.529> I<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.949> mixed<00:04:36.219> in<00:04:36.309> some<00:04:36.520> brown<00:04:36.759> and<00:04:37.029> black

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
and I just mixed in some brown and black

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.089 
and I just mixed in some brown and black
paint<00:04:37.539> to<00:04:37.779> make<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.110> look<00:04:38.169> like<00:04:38.469> the<00:04:38.589> sauce<00:04:38.860> but

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
paint to make it look like the sauce but

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.949 
paint to make it look like the sauce but
just<00:04:39.309> a<00:04:39.399> little<00:04:39.550> bit<00:04:39.699> thicker<00:04:39.969> then<00:04:40.659> I<00:04:40.689> added

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:40.959 
just a little bit thicker then I added

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:42.989 
just a little bit thicker then I added
some<00:04:41.349> more<00:04:41.559> fimo<00:04:41.949> that<00:04:42.099> gödel<00:04:42.399> to<00:04:42.639> make<00:04:42.879> it

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
some more fimo that gödel to make it

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.299 
some more fimo that gödel to make it
less<00:04:43.360> thick<00:04:44.199> because<00:04:44.649> it<00:04:44.770> was<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:44.919> little<00:04:45.219> bit

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:45.309 
less thick because it was a little bit

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.239 
less thick because it was a little bit
too<00:04:45.459> thick<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:46.059> just<00:04:46.809> kind<00:04:47.139> of<00:04:47.259> put<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.039> all

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:48.249 
too thick and just kind of put it all

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.969 
too thick and just kind of put it all
over<00:04:48.279> the<00:04:48.580> road<00:04:48.849> rack<00:04:49.029> and<00:04:49.539> if<00:04:50.499> that<00:04:50.649> didn't

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
over the road rack and if that didn't

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.529 
over the road rack and if that didn't
work<00:04:51.159> for<00:04:51.459> you<00:04:51.580> because<00:04:51.909> I<00:04:52.059> realized<00:04:52.419> it

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
work for you because I realized it

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.570 
work for you because I realized it
didn't<00:04:52.719> work<00:04:52.869> for<00:04:52.899> me<00:04:53.169> I<00:04:53.409> actually<00:04:53.770> use<00:04:54.279> some

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
didn't work for me I actually use some

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.239 
didn't work for me I actually use some
epoxy<00:04:54.999> resin<00:04:55.569> and<00:04:55.809> mix<00:04:56.110> in<00:04:56.469> some<00:04:56.800> more<00:04:56.949> brown

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
epoxy resin and mix in some more brown

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.939 
epoxy resin and mix in some more brown
and<00:04:57.459> black<00:04:57.699> paint<00:04:58.479> so<00:04:59.169> that<00:04:59.199> it<00:04:59.469> looks<00:04:59.649> more

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
and black paint so that it looks more

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.649 
and black paint so that it looks more
realistic<00:05:00.189> because<00:05:00.520> sauce<00:05:00.999> turned<00:05:01.479> out<00:05:01.629> a

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
realistic because sauce turned out a

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.269 
realistic because sauce turned out a
little<00:05:01.809> bit<00:05:02.020> too<00:05:02.199> little<00:05:02.499> after<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:02.860> baked<00:05:03.129> it

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
little bit too little after I baked it

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.449 
little bit too little after I baked it
and<00:05:03.459> I<00:05:04.029> part<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.389> resin<00:05:04.629> over<00:05:04.779> the<00:05:05.319> road<00:05:06.309> rock

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:06.459 
and I part the resin over the road rock

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:09.149 
and I part the resin over the road rock
after<00:05:06.849> I<00:05:06.879> finished<00:05:07.240> baking<00:05:07.419> it<00:05:07.719> and<00:05:08.020> here<00:05:08.949> I'm

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159

just breaking it into little pieces so
that<00:05:13.539> it<00:05:13.659> looks<00:05:13.899> like<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.199> skewers<00:05:14.589> that<00:05:14.709> you
