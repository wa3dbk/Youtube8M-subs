00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610

along with the UM I guess you call these
the<00:01:29.850> markers<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> time<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:32.159> also<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
the markers for the time but also it's a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.649 
the markers for the time but also it's a
diver's<00:01:34.530> watch<00:01:34.850> which<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.159> twist<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
diver's watch which they can twist and

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
diver's watch which they can twist and
keep<00:01:39.659> track<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.200> how<00:01:40.350> long<00:01:40.409> they've<00:01:40.920> been

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
keep track of how long they've been

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.380 
keep track of how long they've been
underwater<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:42.180> whatever<00:01:42.600> type<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:45.360> know

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
underwater or whatever type of you know

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.210 
underwater or whatever type of you know
timing<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:49.220> rotation

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
timing they want to do now this rotation

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.330 
timing they want to do now this rotation
is<00:01:50.369> unidirectional<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> can't<00:01:51.720> go

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
is unidirectional so it can't go

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.620 
is unidirectional so it can't go
clockwise<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.610> only<00:01:53.790> goes<00:01:54.090> counterclockwise

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
clockwise it only goes counterclockwise

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.120 
clockwise it only goes counterclockwise
so<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.680> don't<00:01:56.520> set<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.740> little<00:01:58.740> piece<00:01:58.920> up

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so if you don't set this little piece up

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
so if you don't set this little piece up
top<00:01:59.340> right<00:01:59.579> at<00:02:00.210> 12<00:02:00.420> o'clock<00:02:00.750> you'll<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
top right at 12 o'clock you'll have to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.810 
top right at 12 o'clock you'll have to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
non hacking movement so it will keep

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.160

there's enough force with the threads
that<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.560> won't<00:04:22.710> strip<00:04:22.979> out<00:04:23.159> and<00:04:23.340> then<00:04:23.430> you

that it won't strip out and then you
just<00:04:23.700> tighten<00:04:23.849> that<00:04:24.060> down

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
just tighten that down

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.930 
just tighten that down
don't<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.260> know<00:04:25.380> cram<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.370> in<00:04:26.490> there<00:04:26.520> don't

and then you have I don't know what this
is<00:05:36.480> called<00:05:36.540> I'm<00:05:37.290> not<00:05:37.650> too<00:05:37.980> too<00:05:38.340> big<00:05:38.550> into<00:05:38.910> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
but it keeps it from just unclasping and

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.230 
but it keeps it from just unclasping and
falling<00:05:47.190> off<00:05:47.310> your<00:05:47.340> wrist<00:05:47.669> at<00:05:47.850> least<00:05:48.000> it'll

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
now the back side is very very appealing

now the back side is very very appealing
to<00:05:54.090> me<00:05:54.650> let's<00:05:55.650> see<00:05:55.770> if<00:05:55.860> we<00:05:55.979> can<00:05:56.100> get<00:05:56.190> this<00:05:56.310> in

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
to me let's see if we can get this in

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.190 
to me let's see if we can get this in
the<00:05:57.300> camera<00:05:57.720> it<00:05:57.870> is<00:05:58.020> glass<00:05:58.380> and<00:05:58.410> you<00:05:58.740> can<00:05:58.800> see

you can see the automatic while the

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.060 
you can see the automatic while the
camera<00:06:04.560> is<00:06:04.620> not<00:06:04.680> really<00:06:06.740> helping<00:06:07.740> there<00:06:07.890> but

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
camera is not really helping there but

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.400 
camera is not really helping there but
anyways<00:06:08.400> you<00:06:08.610> can<00:06:08.760> see<00:06:09.030> that<00:06:09.300> the<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:10.020> winder
