even<00:01:58.310> Berto<00:01:58.579> can<00:01:58.759> be<00:01:58.850> attacked<00:01:59.119> like<00:01:59.329> as<00:01:59.539> you

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
even Berto can be attacked like as you

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.510 
even Berto can be attacked like as you
see<00:01:59.810> she<00:02:00.020> could<00:02:00.170> be<00:02:00.229> attacked<00:02:00.439> like<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.679> so<00:02:01.490> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
see she could be attacked like that so I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.190 
see she could be attacked like that so I
think<00:02:01.759> Berto<00:02:02.240> might<00:02:02.659> have<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> good<00:02:02.990> shot<00:02:03.170> at

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
one might be a little unlikely but I

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.119 
one might be a little unlikely but I
think<00:04:02.719> it's<00:04:02.840> worth<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:03.049> look<00:04:03.169> mr.<00:04:03.650> Stevenson

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.740 
from gumshoe gumshoe was a game that
came<00:04:06.530> out<00:04:06.590> on<00:04:06.979> the<00:04:07.189> NES<00:04:07.489> in<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:07.669> 80s<00:04:07.969> and<00:04:08.120> his

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
came out on the NES in the 80s and his

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.089 
came out on the NES in the 80s and his
power<00:04:08.959> could<00:04:09.139> just<00:04:09.319> be<00:04:09.379> jumping<00:04:09.799> around<00:04:09.889> like

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
power could just be jumping around like

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.949 
power could just be jumping around like
this<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.579> every<00:04:11.120> few<00:04:11.299> seconds<00:04:11.659> maybe<00:04:11.810> the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
this and every few seconds maybe the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.189 
this and every few seconds maybe the
screen<00:04:12.139> is<00:04:12.229> faded<00:04:13.039> to<00:04:13.129> black<00:04:13.159> and<00:04:14.109> that<00:04:15.109> would

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 
screen is faded to black and that would

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.170 
screen is faded to black and that would
be<00:04:15.319> his<00:04:15.469> thing<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.829> the<00:04:16.729> next<00:04:16.759> one<00:04:17.030> on<00:04:17.060> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
be his thing and the next one on the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.879 
be his thing and the next one on the
list<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.719> think<00:04:18.199> has<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.349> shot<00:04:18.620> just<00:04:18.829> because

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.490 
here's some of ideas from movesets just
very<00:06:11.240> quick<00:06:11.479> if<00:06:11.660> he<00:06:11.750> was<00:06:11.930> playable<00:06:12.229> but

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
very quick if he was playable but

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.650 
very quick if he was playable but
chances<00:06:12.830> are<00:06:12.919> he<00:06:13.039> won't<00:06:13.160> be<00:06:13.370> so<00:06:14.150> don't<00:06:14.510> get<00:06:14.600> mad

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
chances are he won't be so don't get mad

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.810 
chances are he won't be so don't get mad
at<00:06:14.840> me<00:06:14.870> about<00:06:14.990> that<00:06:15.200> and<00:06:15.380> last<00:06:15.950> up<00:06:16.100> knuckles<00:06:16.550> I

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
at me about that and last up knuckles I

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.880 
at me about that and last up knuckles I
feel<00:06:17.150> like<00:06:17.330> maybe<00:06:17.690> he<00:06:18.140> could<00:06:18.289> either<00:06:18.380> replace

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
feel like maybe he could either replace

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.580 
feel like maybe he could either replace
shadow<00:06:19.190> as<00:06:19.580> the<00:06:20.390> new<00:06:20.510> assist<00:06:20.810> ropey<00:06:21.110> for<00:06:21.260> sonic

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
shadow as the new assist ropey for sonic

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.620 
shadow as the new assist ropey for sonic
and<00:06:21.770> come<00:06:21.950> and<00:06:22.130> punch<00:06:22.370> the<00:06:22.580> fighters<00:06:22.940> I'm

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
and come and punch the fighters I'm

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.779 
and come and punch the fighters I'm
going<00:06:23.750> to<00:06:23.810> glide<00:06:24.110> around<00:06:24.289> and<00:06:24.860> hit<00:06:25.430> them<00:06:25.550> into

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
going to glide around and hit them into

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.250 
going to glide around and hit them into
the<00:06:25.880> ground<00:06:25.910> creating<00:06:26.570> like<00:06:26.810> a<00:06:26.840> pitfall<00:06:27.050> and

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
the ground creating like a pitfall and

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.219 
the ground creating like a pitfall and
they<00:06:27.380> get<00:06:27.500> stuck<00:06:27.650> in<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:27.860> ground<00:06:27.950> and<00:06:29.229> that's

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
they get stuck in the ground and that's

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:31.960 
they get stuck in the ground and that's
pretty<00:06:30.350> much<00:06:30.470> for<00:06:30.680> knuckled<00:06:30.950> he's<00:06:31.789> got<00:06:31.940> a
