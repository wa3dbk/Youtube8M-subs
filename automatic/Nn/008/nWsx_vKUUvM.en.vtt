00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.349
 2015 is the year of the sequels well in 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.059
 the sequel to 'jurassic park' star wars 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.220
 and one of my favorite fairies 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.559
 terminator in this video I will make a brief 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.490
 analysis of the trailer and its history well 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.560
 that we start in the year 2029 skynet has 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.329
 devastated to the earth and enslaved to the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.189
 humanity but it is about to be 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.009
 defeated by human resistance 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.460
 led by john connor to avoid his 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.499
 defeat 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.509
 the machines had developed the 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:36.460
 travel in time and decide to send to 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.199
 passed to the 800cc exterminator cm-101 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.480
 to kill John Connor's mother 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.090
 before John Connor is conceived 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.190
 aware of the skynet plan achieves 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.890
 access the time machine and send 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.500
 to his best friend kyle reese to the past 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.780
 to protect his mother this first 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.010
 time travel caused two changes 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.379
 important 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.780
 the artificial technology that will give the 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.629
 birth to skynet was more developed 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.420
 fast because of the remains of 800 and 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.830
 by the year 2029 the machines had 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.370
 developed a new model 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.350
 exterminator called t 1000 the second 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.360
 important change would be that kyle reese 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.580
 he became john's father when 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.620
 for those who are confused with this 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.390
 theme is simply a paradox of 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.580
 travel in time for you to 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.500
 paradoxes do not occur happen facts that 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.290
 correct them that seem like coincidences 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.330
 but they are not, that is, the fact that it is 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.820
 the trigger for the trip to occur in 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.980
 time is inevitable but changes 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.230
 made in the past if they affect the 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.410
 timeline on the second trip in 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.050
 the time in the year 2029 the machines 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.070
 they send the subject to kill John Connor at 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.470
 1995 when they are 10 years old 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.110
 years jon has been raised by a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.850
 experienced sarah connor is aware 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.860
 that his father was kyle reese and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.100
 probably already sent the past 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.410
 now send the t 800 reprogrammed to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.270
 protect himself and his mother 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.369
 important changes in this trip in the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.040
 time are the delay of the final judgment 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.760
 because sarah connor said that the day of the 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.500
 final judgment would be on August 29, 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.460
 1997 but with the death of the doctor 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.020
 teacher jason 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.630
 and the destruction of the remains of 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.270
 first 800 the day the trial was 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.210
 postponed but can not be stopped in 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.370
 the year 2033 the machines perform their 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.440
 third trip in time to stop 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.870
 the victory of humans send to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.800
 exterminator a of exterminators model 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.500
 tx to the year 2007 the day of the final judgment 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.510
 developed in 2007 and the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.730
 major changes caused by the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.480
 finish tricks is that the final judgment 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.920
 it was more devastating and in the year 2018 john 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.890
 connor is not the leader of the resistance 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.390
 human but only part of her john 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 connor tops the list of murders 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.950
 skynet earrings by messages 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.410
 that broadcast on the radio so that people 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.990
 join the resistance what could 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.790
 justify the first shipment of t 800 to 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.800
 past all the changes in time 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.330
 they imply that the machines are 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.130
 managing to win the war now 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.740
 We will analyze what the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.840
 terminator genesis first of all this 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.760
 sequel will be practically a reboot 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.320
 of the saga but keeping the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.540
 movie events 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.370
 previous will be counted again the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.769
 history of terminator 1 and 2 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.629
 but in a different way by the 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.580
 changes in time and what happened 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.819
 previously they will be only memories of 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.019
 hong kong in the year 2029 john connor it 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.239
 has become the leader of the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.970
 resistance and apparently the enemy more 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.379
 of the machines a great detail is 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.379
 see john connor with his scars 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.239
 as they showed it in terminator 2 the 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.340
 resistance has invaded a base of 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.769
 skynet to end once and for all 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.019
 all with the war we see john connor 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.750
 accompanied by kyle reese face 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.129
 only to an unknown machine that can 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.230
 imply that they are also 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.760
 rescuing someone if you do not have 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.040
 move away from his troops 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.049
 maybe they look here for the color the son of 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.510
 John Connor or maybe they are trying to 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.310
 avoid tea machines send 800 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.890
 to the past we see the image of a 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.560
 terminator 3 600 and the first market does not 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.780
 forgiveness appears the moment of truth 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.819
 has arrived john connor knows what he has 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.980
 what to do to send kyle reese to the past 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.500
 so that everything happens again but 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.120
 maybe it 's that jong's mistake to think 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.100
 that everything is happening as it is 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.320
 counted the time travelers but 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.120
 many things have already changed and maybe 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.110
 the machines have made others 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.380
 movements 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.229
 Kyle Reese arrives in 1984 and everything has 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.720
 changed the subject is chasing it and 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.300
 is rescued by the chaise Sarah Connor 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.229
 but what is happening the issue and should 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.900
 arrive in the year 1995 an old t-800 will 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.330
 faces the young t-800 sent by 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.150
 skynet so goodbye to the story of 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.130
 terminator one never happened paradoxes in 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.650
 the time that I can not explain but 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.630
 Rays this is too cool and it's coming 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.789
 the good because everything supposedly has 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.979
 an explanation or pseudo explanation 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.780
 Sarah Connor was orphaned at nine 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.750
 years when his parents were killed 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.570
 by a terminator since then she is 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.820
 cared for by a t 800 that calls box 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.250
 which is programmed to protect in 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.270
 place to kill this unexplained change 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.030
 in the history 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.480
 Sarah Connor is not an innocent girl 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.790
 in 1984 but rather be someone 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.160
 struggling to change their fate she 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.380
 he knew his future at a very young age and was 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.060
 raised by the exterminator apparently 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.740
 everything will have a good explanation in the 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.720
 future although there are two things that I 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.210
 they attract a lot of attention in this trailer 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.190
 there is another time machine and we do not know 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.500
 if it is from the future but it is likely that 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.260
 be from the past because you do not see others 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.630
 characters also looks before 800 more 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.860
 old still of what has been shown will be 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.200
 that there will be more than one trip in time 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.060
 actually this trailer still hides 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.560
 many details and has not been revealed 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.510
 a lot about the new characters 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.820
 secondary but in history is 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.770
 too incredible and we will see again 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.930
 the terminator on a motorcycle and becoming a 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.910
 extreme dad the only thing that I did not like 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.890
 was to see the face of the subject because of 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.200
 Robert Patrick gives an inhuman tone 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.750
 cold and calculating was a complement 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.940
 amazing as a villain and this I see 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.620
 just a little bitter but still missing 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.390
 see it in action it may just be like this 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.250
 for the good scene that was a brief 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.590
 analysis to what is coming in terminator 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.610
 genesis the truth terminator 2 the trial 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.770
 final is one of my movies 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.750
 and honestly I had no hope 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.729
 for this new movie but watch this 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.740
 trailer has opened a light at the end 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.629
 of the road and I can not wait to see 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.460
 this movie actually I hope that 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.500
 break all the schemes and have a good 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.479
 argument as well as being the beginning of a 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.430
 new trilogy thank you very much everyone
