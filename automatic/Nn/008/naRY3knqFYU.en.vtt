hello everyone and welcome in this video

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.350 
hello everyone and welcome in this video
we're<00:00:02.370> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.550> be<00:00:02.610> discussing<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.300> the

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
we're going to be discussing how the

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.539 
we're going to be discussing how the
Koenigsegg<00:00:04.049> direct<00:00:04.380> drive<00:00:04.620> system<00:00:05.130> works<00:00:05.339> in

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
Koenigsegg direct drive system works in

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.849 
Koenigsegg direct drive system works in
the<00:00:05.910> Koenigsegg<00:00:06.330> rig<00:00:06.480> era<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.930> actually<00:00:07.740> it's

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
the Koenigsegg rig era and actually it's

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.290 
the Koenigsegg rig era and actually it's
pretty<00:00:08.040> straightforward<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.820> simple<00:00:09.030> how

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
pretty straightforward and simple how

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.570 
pretty straightforward and simple how
this<00:00:09.510> design<00:00:09.840> works<00:00:10.280> surprisingly<00:00:11.280> or<00:00:11.400> not

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
this design works surprisingly or not

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.580 
this design works surprisingly or not
but<00:00:11.820> anyways<00:00:12.150> looking<00:00:12.570> at<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.259> here<00:00:13.559> we

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
but anyways looking at it so here we

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.200 
but anyways looking at it so here we
have<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.920> two<00:00:14.099> rear<00:00:14.429> wheels<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> vehicle

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
have the two rear wheels of the vehicle

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.269 
have the two rear wheels of the vehicle
you've<00:00:16.020> got<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> battery<00:00:16.680> which<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.890> placed

you've got a battery which is placed

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.680 
you've got a battery which is placed
kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> towards<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.029> front<00:00:18.330> but<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
kind of towards the front but in the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.779 
kind of towards the front but in the
center<00:00:18.960> probably<00:00:19.920> between<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
center probably between you and the

sending power to the rear wheels so what

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
sending power to the rear wheels so what
is<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> process<00:01:09.840> how<00:01:10.260> does<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> work<00:01:10.890> well

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is the process how does this work well

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
is the process how does this work well

rear motors are going to be doing all of

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
rear motors are going to be doing all of
the<00:01:14.640> acceleration<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> started<00:01:15.720> then

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the acceleration to get you started then

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.590 
the acceleration to get you started then
as<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:17.070> speed<00:01:17.310> starts<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> increase<00:01:18.090> the

as your speed starts to increase the
engine<00:01:18.900> rpm<00:01:19.259> starts<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> increase<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
engine rpm starts to increase and this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.719 
engine rpm starts to increase and this
hydraulic<00:01:21.210> coupling<00:01:21.720> starts<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> close<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.979> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
hydraulic coupling starts to close up so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
hydraulic coupling starts to close up so
this<00:01:24.299> third<00:01:24.570> motor<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.380> aiding<00:01:25.799> in

and<00:01:38.759> once<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.540> closed<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.680> you're

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and once it's closed up then you're

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.740 
and once it's closed up then you're
directly<00:01:41.220> driving<00:01:41.579> from<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> engine<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
directly driving from the engine to the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.359 
directly driving from the engine to the
rear<00:01:43.020> wheels<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> only

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
rear wheels so really the only

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.639 
rear wheels so really the only
difference<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.090> between<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.380> let's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
difference here between this and let's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.310 
difference here between this and let's
say<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> different<00:01:47.070> form<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.180> car<00:01:48.450> whether<00:01:49.049> it's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
say a different form of car whether it's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
say a different form of car whether it's
hybrid<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.610> between<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
hybrid or not is that between this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.210 
hybrid or not is that between this
hydraulic<00:01:51.450> coupling<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.350> final<00:01:52.920> Drive

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
hydraulic coupling and this final Drive

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.679 
hydraulic coupling and this final Drive
is<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.880> would<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> transmission

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
is that you would have a transmission

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.569 
is that you would have a transmission
put<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.829> they've<00:01:56.100> added<00:01:56.280> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
put in there and then they've added you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.240 
put in there and then they've added you
know<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.880> hybrid<00:01:57.240> system<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.750> top<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
know this hybrid system on top of it so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
know this hybrid system on top of it so
the<00:01:59.790> benefit<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> taking<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.780> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the benefit of taking out that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
the benefit of taking out that
transmission<00:02:01.439> first<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.219> you're<00:02:02.340> taking

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
transmission first of all you're taking

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
transmission first of all you're taking
out<00:02:02.759> some<00:02:02.969> weight<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.689> let's<00:02:03.899> compare<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
out some weight but let's compare it to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
out some weight but let's compare it to
a<00:02:04.619> parallel<00:02:05.340> hybrid<00:02:05.549> system<00:02:06.060> well<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.659> don't

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
a parallel hybrid system well you don't

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.330 
a parallel hybrid system well you don't
have<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.140> transmission<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
have that transmission with the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
have that transmission with the
efficiency<00:02:08.879> losses<00:02:09.119> through<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
efficiency losses through it and if you

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
efficiency losses through it and if you
were<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> compare<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> series<00:02:11.489> hybrid

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
were to compare it to a series hybrid

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.559 
were to compare it to a series hybrid
system<00:02:12.239> well<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.780> you're<00:02:12.900> not<00:02:13.050> converting

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
system well then you're not converting

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.360 
system well then you're not converting
at<00:02:13.599> energy<00:02:14.049> multiple<00:02:14.439> times<00:02:14.680> from<00:02:14.859> mechanical

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
at energy multiple times from mechanical

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.220 
at energy multiple times from mechanical
to<00:02:15.549> electrical<00:02:15.730> back<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.540> mechanical<00:02:17.079> in

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
to electrical back to mechanical in

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.739 
to electrical back to mechanical in
order<00:02:17.859> to<00:02:18.129> power<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.670> car<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.329> it's<00:02:19.510> more

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:19.749 
order to power the car so it's more

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.989 
order to power the car so it's more
efficient<00:02:20.139> in<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.379> sense<00:02:20.829> so<00:02:21.370> let's<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.909> do

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
efficient in that sense so let's just do

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.640 
efficient in that sense so let's just do
a<00:02:22.030> little<00:02:22.239> bit<00:02:22.389> of<00:02:22.420> math<00:02:22.659> to<00:02:22.930> check<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.439> find

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
a little bit of math to check and find

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.559 
a little bit of math to check and find
out<00:02:23.889> what<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.159> top<00:02:24.340> speed<00:02:24.609> is<00:02:24.639> because<00:02:25.359> this

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
out what the top speed is because this

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.300 
out what the top speed is because this
engine<00:02:25.810> does<00:02:26.170> lock<00:02:26.439> up<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.920> rear<00:02:27.069> wheels

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
engine does lock up to the rear wheels

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.520 
engine does lock up to the rear wheels
and<00:02:27.609> you<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:27.819> use<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.209> gearing<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.989> determine

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and you can use the gearing to determine

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.259 
and you can use the gearing to determine
what<00:02:29.739> your<00:02:29.859> top<00:02:30.069> speed<00:02:30.219> is<00:02:30.519> since<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.239> have

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
what your top speed is since you do have

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.209 
what your top speed is since you do have
that<00:02:31.569> direct<00:02:31.810> drive<00:02:32.079> so<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.709> first<00:02:32.920> thing<00:02:33.129> we

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:33.219 
that direct drive so the first thing we

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.709 
that direct drive so the first thing we
need<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.639> is<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:34.030> wheel<00:02:34.180> circumference

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
need to know is the wheel circumference

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.140 
need to know is the wheel circumference
and<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.469> looked<00:02:35.650> at<00:02:35.799> some<00:02:36.040> photos<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.939> car

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
and I looked at some photos of the car

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.420 
and I looked at some photos of the car
from<00:02:37.450> Geneva<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.469> could<00:02:38.650> see<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:38.950> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
from Geneva and you could see that the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.989 
from Geneva and you could see that the
rear<00:02:39.730> tires<00:02:40.090> were<00:02:40.389> 345<00:02:41.139> over<00:02:41.560> 30<00:02:41.799> our<00:02:42.010> 20<00:02:42.730> tires

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:42.999 
rear tires were 345 over 30 our 20 tires

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:46.050 
rear tires were 345 over 30 our 20 tires
so<00:02:43.599> if<00:02:43.659> we<00:02:43.780> take<00:02:43.930> 345<00:02:44.799> millimeters<00:02:45.340> multiply

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
so if we take 345 millimeters multiply

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.670 
so if we take 345 millimeters multiply
that<00:02:46.239> by<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.480> ratio<00:02:46.719> that's<00:02:47.169> what<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.439> 30

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
that by the ratio that's what the 30

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.559 
that by the ratio that's what the 30
represents<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.519> then<00:02:48.849> divide<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.389> by

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
represents and then divide that by

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.300 
represents and then divide that by
twenty<00:02:49.900> five<00:02:50.049> point<00:02:50.319> four<00:02:50.530> millimeters<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:51.189> an

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
twenty five point four millimeters in an

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.819 
twenty five point four millimeters in an
inch<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.969> gives<00:02:52.209> us<00:02:52.389> a<00:02:52.510> profile<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.139> 4.0

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
inch that gives us a profile of 4.0

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.399 
inch that gives us a profile of 4.0
seven<00:02:54.280> five<00:02:54.459> inches<00:02:54.939> now<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.989> find<00:02:56.230> our

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
seven five inches now to find our

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.009 
seven five inches now to find our
diameter<00:02:56.799> we've<00:02:57.189> got<00:02:57.400> 20<00:02:57.730> plus<00:02:58.000> 2<00:02:58.209> times<00:02:58.449> 4.0

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
diameter we've got 20 plus 2 times 4.0

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.599 
diameter we've got 20 plus 2 times 4.0
seven<00:02:59.319> five<00:02:59.469> that<00:02:59.919> gives<00:03:00.099> us<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.400> wheel

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
seven five that gives us a wheel

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.899 
seven five that gives us a wheel
diameter<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.299> tire<00:03:01.959> diameter<00:03:02.469> of<00:03:02.650> 28<00:03:03.310> point

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
diameter and tire diameter of 28 point

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.539 
diameter and tire diameter of 28 point
one<00:03:04.120> five<00:03:04.359> inches<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.829> we<00:03:05.949> multiply<00:03:06.099> that<00:03:06.489> by

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
one five inches so we multiply that by

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.839 
one five inches so we multiply that by
PI<00:03:06.939> and<00:03:07.239> we<00:03:07.659> get<00:03:07.840> 88<00:03:08.169> point<00:03:08.680> four<00:03:09.280> three<00:03:09.519> five

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
PI and we get 88 point four three five

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.849 
PI and we get 88 point four three five
eight<00:03:10.060> inches<00:03:10.419> that's<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.079> circumference<00:03:11.590> of

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
eight inches that's the circumference of

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.670 
eight inches that's the circumference of
this<00:03:12.370> tire<00:03:12.669> now<00:03:13.329> let's<00:03:13.840> find<00:03:14.230> out<00:03:14.349> what<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
this tire now let's find out what the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.220 
this tire now let's find out what the
wheel<00:03:14.829> rpm<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:15.939> we<00:03:16.269> know<00:03:16.449> that<00:03:16.750> our<00:03:16.870> engine

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
wheel rpm is so we know that our engine

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.559 
wheel rpm is so we know that our engine
rpm<00:03:17.709> redline<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.849> eight<00:03:19.090> thousand<00:03:19.540> two

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
rpm redline is eight thousand two

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.270 
rpm redline is eight thousand two
hundred<00:03:19.659> fifty<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.470> we<00:03:20.560> simply<00:03:20.859> divide<00:03:20.979> that

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
hundred fifty so we simply divide that

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.369 
hundred fifty so we simply divide that
by<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.519> final<00:03:21.909> drive<00:03:22.120> ratio<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.959> gives<00:03:23.169> us

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
by the final drive ratio that gives us

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.080 
by the final drive ratio that gives us
two<00:03:23.620> thousand<00:03:24.069> eight<00:03:24.189> hundred<00:03:24.340> ninety<00:03:24.879> four

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
two thousand eight hundred ninety four

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.809 
two thousand eight hundred ninety four
point<00:03:25.449> seven<00:03:25.659> rpm<00:03:26.349> so<00:03:27.069> now<00:03:27.220> we<00:03:27.280> can<00:03:27.459> find<00:03:27.699> out

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
point seven rpm so now we can find out

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.670 
point seven rpm so now we can find out
what<00:03:27.970> our<00:03:28.060> top<00:03:28.269> speed<00:03:28.479> is<00:03:28.659> so<00:03:28.870> speed<00:03:29.169> is<00:03:29.319> equal

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
what our top speed is so speed is equal

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.460 
what our top speed is so speed is equal
to<00:03:29.859> this<00:03:30.040> number<00:03:30.370> here<00:03:30.609> this<00:03:30.790> rpm<00:03:31.569> multiplied

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
to this number here this rpm multiplied

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.439 
to this number here this rpm multiplied
by<00:03:32.739> 60<00:03:33.189> minutes<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.549> an<00:03:33.669> hour<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:34.090> way<00:03:34.209> we'll

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
by 60 minutes in an hour that way we'll

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.059 
by 60 minutes in an hour that way we'll
get<00:03:34.599> revolutions<00:03:35.169> per<00:03:35.319> hour<00:03:35.470> rather<00:03:35.799> than

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
get revolutions per hour rather than

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.490 
get revolutions per hour rather than
revolutions<00:03:36.639> per<00:03:36.729> minute<00:03:37.319> then<00:03:38.319> we're

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
revolutions per minute then we're

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.860 
revolutions per minute then we're
multiplying<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:39.280> by<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:40.209> number<00:03:40.479> of<00:03:40.599> inches

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
multiplying that by the number of inches

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.259 
multiplying that by the number of inches
the<00:03:41.560> distance<00:03:41.979> this<00:03:42.220> wheel<00:03:42.459> travels<00:03:42.909> with<00:03:43.060> one

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
the distance this wheel travels with one

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.080 
the distance this wheel travels with one
revolution<00:03:43.959> its<00:03:44.349> circumference<00:03:44.889> so<00:03:45.250> 88<00:03:45.790> point

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
revolution its circumference so 88 point

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.149 
revolution its circumference so 88 point
four<00:03:46.329> three<00:03:46.479> five<00:03:46.840> eight<00:03:47.049> divided<00:03:47.470> by<00:03:47.709> 12

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
four three five eight divided by 12

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.099 
four three five eight divided by 12
inches<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.639> a<00:03:48.699> foot<00:03:48.729> multiplied<00:03:49.659> by<00:03:49.840> five

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
inches in a foot multiplied by five

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.020 
inches in a foot multiplied by five
thousand<00:03:50.500> two<00:03:50.590> hundred<00:03:50.620> feet<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.609> mile<00:03:51.790> so

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
thousand two hundred feet in a mile so

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.899 
thousand two hundred feet in a mile so
that<00:03:52.209> will<00:03:52.359> give<00:03:52.540> us<00:03:52.769> miles<00:03:53.769> per<00:03:54.189> hour<00:03:54.370> once<00:03:54.759> we

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
that will give us miles per hour once we

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.059 
that will give us miles per hour once we
multiply<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.359> all<00:03:55.659> out<00:03:55.720> rather<00:03:56.290> than<00:03:56.620> you

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
multiply this all out rather than you

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.509 
multiply this all out rather than you
know<00:03:57.099> these<00:03:57.629> inches<00:03:58.629> per<00:03:58.810> minute<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.769> we<00:04:00.250> have

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
know these inches per minute so we have

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.789 
know these inches per minute so we have
a<00:04:00.819> final<00:04:01.209> speed<00:04:01.629> calculated<00:04:02.259> from<00:04:02.379> this<00:04:02.560> of

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
a final speed calculated from this of

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.159 
a final speed calculated from this of
two<00:04:03.040> hundred<00:04:03.159> forty<00:04:03.549> two<00:04:03.790> point<00:04:04.449> four<00:04:04.870> miles

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
two hundred forty two point four miles

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.099 
two hundred forty two point four miles
per<00:04:05.439> hour<00:04:05.500> so<00:04:06.129> why<00:04:06.310> isn't<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.729> 249<00:04:07.689> miles<00:04:07.930> per

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
per hour so why isn't that 249 miles per

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.929 
per hour so why isn't that 249 miles per
hour<00:04:08.259> well<00:04:08.590> it's<00:04:08.799> not<00:04:08.949> that<00:04:09.219> far<00:04:09.459> off<00:04:09.489> honestly

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
hour well it's not that far off honestly

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.569 
hour well it's not that far off honestly
so<00:04:10.449> if<00:04:10.659> we<00:04:11.139> were<00:04:11.229> to<00:04:11.379> have<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.769> point<00:04:12.069> seven<00:04:12.430> five

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
so if we were to have a point seven five

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.520 
so if we were to have a point seven five
inch<00:04:12.789> difference<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.389> diameter<00:04:13.719> of<00:04:14.049> those

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
inch difference in diameter of those

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.580 
inch difference in diameter of those
wheels<00:04:15.000> then<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.299> would<00:04:16.479> accommodate<00:04:17.199> that

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
wheels then that would accommodate that

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.979 
wheels then that would accommodate that
and<00:04:17.829> we'd<00:04:17.979> be<00:04:18.130> at<00:04:18.250> 249<00:04:19.000> miles<00:04:19.239> per<00:04:19.509> hour<00:04:19.659> and

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
and we'd be at 249 miles per hour and

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.990 
and we'd be at 249 miles per hour and
one<00:04:20.500> other<00:04:20.620> thing<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:21.039> know<00:04:21.159> let's<00:04:21.549> say<00:04:21.789> this

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
one other thing you know let's say this

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.659 
one other thing you know let's say this
is<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.300> exact<00:04:22.930> dimension<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:24.279> is<00:04:24.520> the

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
is the exact dimension and this is the

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.100 
is the exact dimension and this is the
exact<00:04:25.000> circumference<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.690> those<00:04:25.900> tires

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
exact circumference of those tires

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.330 
exact circumference of those tires
eighty<00:04:26.349> eight<00:04:26.529> point<00:04:26.740> four<00:04:26.979> three

eighty eight point four three
five<00:04:27.460> eight<00:04:27.610> well<00:04:28.060> when<00:04:28.210> they're<00:04:28.330> spinning<00:04:28.570> at

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
five eight well when they're spinning at

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.110 
five eight well when they're spinning at
240<00:04:29.590> some<00:04:29.800> miles<00:04:30.040> per<00:04:30.280> hour<00:04:30.460> they're<00:04:30.940> going<00:04:31.060> to

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
240 some miles per hour they're going to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.120 
240 some miles per hour they're going to
kind<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.419> expand<00:04:31.930> out<00:04:32.139> from<00:04:32.410> all<00:04:32.560> those<00:04:32.680> radial

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
kind of expand out from all those radial

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.250 
kind of expand out from all those radial
G's<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.389> could<00:04:34.540> accommodate<00:04:34.840> that

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
G's and so that could accommodate that

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.439 
G's and so that could accommodate that
point<00:04:35.530> seven<00:04:35.830> five<00:04:35.949> inches<00:04:36.430> which<00:04:37.150> would<00:04:37.300> make

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
point seven five inches which would make

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.240 
point seven five inches which would make
it<00:04:37.600> up<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.320> two<00:04:38.440> hundred<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:38.770> forty<00:04:39.100> nine
