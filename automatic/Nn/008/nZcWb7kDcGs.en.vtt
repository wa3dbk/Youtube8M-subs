00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
I'm going to use a regular screw driver

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.900 
I'm going to use a regular screw driver
to<00:00:48.320> slide<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.500> forward<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.640> give<00:00:50.760> myself

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to slide it forward just to give myself

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.950 
to slide it forward just to give myself
a<00:00:51.829> little<00:00:52.829> leeway<00:00:53.670> there<00:00:54.090> there<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.750> go<00:00:54.899> just

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
a little leeway there there we go just

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
a little leeway there there we go just
give<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> little<00:00:55.710> nudge<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.309> lift<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.360> right

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
give a little nudge and lift it right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
give a little nudge and lift it right
off<00:00:58.399> there<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> go<00:01:00.920> now<00:01:01.920> there's<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> CMOS

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
off there you go now there's the CMOS

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.789 
off there you go now there's the CMOS
battery<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.629> reasons<00:01:03.989> you'd<00:01:04.199> replace<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
battery and reasons you'd replace the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.600 
battery and reasons you'd replace the
CMOS<00:01:05.129> battery<00:01:05.339> range<00:01:06.119> from<00:01:06.510> either<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.890> your

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
CMOS battery range from either your your

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.100 
CMOS battery range from either your your
it<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.060> went<00:01:09.299> dead<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> need<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it just went dead and you need to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.870

replace<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.159> trying<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> clear<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
replace it are you trying to clear a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.570 
replace it are you trying to clear a
BIOS<00:01:12.869> password<00:01:13.409> which<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:13.890> believe<00:01:14.130> will

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
BIOS password which I don't believe will

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.460 
BIOS password which I don't believe will
work<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> particular<00:01:15.570> laptop<00:01:17.210> and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
work in this particular laptop and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.539 
work in this particular laptop and
basically<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> just<00:01:19.619> remove<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> CMOS

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
basically you just remove the CMOS

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.840 
basically you just remove the CMOS
battery<00:01:20.759> you'll<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.689> another<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.460> they<00:01:23.460> come

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
battery you'll get another one they come

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
battery you'll get another one they come
pre-wired<00:01:25.580> just<00:01:26.580> plug<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> back<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.740> now

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
pre-wired just plug it back in now

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
pre-wired just plug it back in now
whenever<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.220> turn<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.549> laptop<00:01:29.700> back<00:01:30.180> on

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
whenever you turn your laptop back on

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
whenever you turn your laptop back on
you<00:01:31.259> will<00:01:31.470> need<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> set<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.220> date<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> time

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you will need to set your date and time

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.289 
you will need to set your date and time
again<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.740> may<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> any<00:01:35.790> specialty
