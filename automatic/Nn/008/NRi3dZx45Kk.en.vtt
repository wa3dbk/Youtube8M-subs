00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello channel friends come here to 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.680
 to advance the news that is to come 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.930
 no one wants to work in the 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.270
 web area what do you like about 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.520
 animation creation is eager to learn 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 some programs in the area such as 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.730
 many people even have programs in their 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 computers but do not have the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.430
 even can not enjoy the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.169
 program 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.480
 I come here to say that from now on 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.250
 from now on my channel will not only be 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.210
 directed to the carnival the parade of 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.460
 Samba school 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.649
 I started to create video lessons from different 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 known web programs and some 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.520
 problems not so well known but 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 also greatly aided the sale of breeders 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.790
 of sites among others 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 I'll start by posting a video lesson from 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.770
 adobe dreamweaver did not know how to get 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.410
 a zero site preparation of the size of the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.050
 site is image adjustment buttons 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.060
 transitions with flash animations inside 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.190
 of one's winter program 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.960
 another web-based program is the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 adobe illustrator in our case 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.220
 we would use the cs5 version 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.930
 it is most commonly used for viewing 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.090
 images but would also show the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.609
 functionary of the program 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 and how it serves to prepare image 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.289
 among other things used in the creation of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.990
 sites such as the creation of 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.299
 buttons banding tables etc 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 beyond the level of the liquid in the strait 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.859
 another program of the adobe package 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.729
 used by designers is the photoshop also 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:32.189
 the wand cs5 version of education in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.340
 assembly of images in faith creation of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.350
 brushes text formatting etc 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 A little later I will go to class . 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 corel draw nor will we do as the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.459
 illustrator viewing images with 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.280
 the detail that occurred is more used than the 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.590
 illustrator in leather would teach creation 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.679
 of logos from zero creation of objects 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.090
 text formatting among other things 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.100
 in addition to the programs mentioned above 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.409
 would teach videotapes to use a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.149
 program called photofiltre it is 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.639
 resembling photoshop with less 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.340
 options but with a very good result 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.709
 imagine that light photoshop 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.899
 I hope everyone appreciates the lessons and 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.750
 send me your luck to evaluate 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.370
 also create in classes of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.850
 office package excel word power point 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.570
 a little further and that 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.770
 the bridge can also be used for the web 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.870
 design 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.130
 so if you liked the video I did not like it 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.130
 waiting below is news
