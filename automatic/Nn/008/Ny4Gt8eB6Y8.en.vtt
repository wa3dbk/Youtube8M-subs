can kind of look in the kind of oil was

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.139 
can kind of look in the kind of oil was
like<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.710> skin<00:00:34.770> produces<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.880> skin<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
like my skin produces because my skin is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
like my skin produces because my skin is
very<00:00:36.300> oily<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.230> reason<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.220> bugs<00:00:38.760> me

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
very oily for some reason and it bugs me

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200 
very oily for some reason and it bugs me
but<00:00:40.340> there's<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.430> much<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.970> about<00:00:42.150> it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
but there's not much I can do about it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.240 
but there's not much I can do about it
so<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> thought<00:00:42.720> why<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.200> try<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.590> control<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so I thought why not try and control it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.310 
so I thought why not try and control it
and<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.580> primer<00:00:44.880> that<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> suited

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and get a primer that is like a suited

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.820 
and get a primer that is like a suited
for<00:00:46.770> my<00:00:46.950> skin<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.580> this<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.780> came<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
for my skin and this one came about and

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.150 
for my skin and this one came about and
I<00:00:49.890> thought<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.250> would<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.490> perfect<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.160> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
I thought it would be perfect so it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.890 
I thought it would be perfect so it
claims<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.830> look<00:00:55.830> in<00:00:56.070> shine<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.030> enhance<00:00:57.630> the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
claims to look in shine and enhance the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.490 
claims to look in shine and enhance the
foundation<00:00:58.620> makeup<00:00:59.060> result<00:01:00.060> and<00:01:00.450> it's<00:01:01.110> never

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
foundation makeup result and it's never

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.509

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
felt like a really shiny but then when I

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.839 
felt like a really shiny but then when I
went<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.110> check<00:02:32.349> before<00:02:32.709> lunch<00:02:32.950> she<00:02:33.549> wasn't

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
went to check before lunch she wasn't

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.970 
went to check before lunch she wasn't
too<00:02:33.970> bad<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.480> didn't<00:02:34.810> look<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.739> disco

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
too bad and I didn't look like a disco

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.479 
too bad and I didn't look like a disco
even<00:02:36.760> though<00:02:36.849> I<00:02:36.879> felt<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:37.330> one<00:02:37.629> so<00:02:38.500> yeah<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
even though I felt like one so yeah I

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.220 
even though I felt like one so yeah I
would<00:02:39.730> say<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.090> felt<00:02:40.450> like<00:02:40.870> my<00:02:40.989> skin<00:02:41.049> was

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
would say that I felt like my skin was

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.210 
would say that I felt like my skin was
greasy<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.310> actually<00:02:42.489> wasn't<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.569> I<00:02:44.220> think

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
greasy but it actually wasn't so I think

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
greasy but it actually wasn't so I think
I'd<00:02:45.459> rather<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.299> other<00:02:46.420> way<00:02:46.599> around

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
I'd rather that on the other way around

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.160 
I'd rather that on the other way around
so<00:02:47.950> with<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.760> said<00:02:49.060> I'm<00:02:49.540> gonna<00:02:49.690> go<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:49.989> to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
so with that said I'm gonna go on to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.650 
so with that said I'm gonna go on to
like<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.530> application<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.819> it's<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.239> gel<00:02:52.450> like

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
like the application so it's a gel like

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.460 
like the application so it's a gel like
consistency<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.569> was<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.599> bit<00:02:56.200> worried

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
consistency and I was a bit worried

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.710 
consistency and I was a bit worried
because<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.459> know<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.819> maybelline<00:02:58.239> baby<00:02:58.269> skin

because I know the maybelline baby skin

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.979 
because I know the maybelline baby skin
is<00:02:59.200> also<00:02:59.440> like<00:02:59.799> a<00:03:00.010> gel<00:03:00.310> consistency<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.750> when

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
catching because it's not too bright and

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.880 
catching because it's not too bright and
in-your-face<00:04:36.570> but<00:04:37.050> there's<00:04:37.230> not<00:04:37.380> dull<00:04:37.620> that

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
in-your-face but there's not dull that

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.060 
in-your-face but there's not dull that
you'd<00:04:38.010> miss<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:39.630> really<00:04:39.930> like<00:04:40.110> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
you'd miss it and I really like the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.790 
you'd miss it and I really like the
explanation<00:04:41.880> at<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.240> back<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:43.140> tells<00:04:43.440> you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
explanation at the back it tells you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.250 
explanation at the back it tells you
exactly<00:04:44.190> what<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:45.060> does<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.840> said<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.170> the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
exactly what it does and I said that the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.680 
exactly what it does and I said that the
subtle<00:04:46.440> video<00:04:46.800> wit<00:04:46.980> claimed<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.460> do<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.880> then

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
subtle video wit claimed to do and then

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.830 
subtle video wit claimed to do and then
it<00:04:48.960> also<00:04:49.200> says<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:50.400> what<00:04:50.910> texture<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.600> and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
it also says like what texture is and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.330 
it also says like what texture is and
then<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.050> gives<00:04:52.260> like<00:04:53.840> what<00:04:54.840> they<00:04:55.020> called<00:04:55.350> like

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
then it gives like what they called like

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.880 
then it gives like what they called like
a<00:04:56.370> little<00:04:56.640> scoring<00:04:57.000> system<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:58.230> if<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:58.740> can

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
a little scoring system so if you can

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.190 
a little scoring system so if you can
see<00:04:59.070> here<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.490> says<00:04:59.520> texture<00:05:00.420> and<00:05:00.870> it's<00:05:01.110> a

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
see here it says texture and it's a

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.030 
see here it says texture and it's a
light<00:05:01.380> texture<00:05:01.920> and<00:05:02.550> then<00:05:03.540> it<00:05:03.690> tells<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.170> what

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
light texture and then it tells you what

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.820 
light texture and then it tells you what
it<00:05:05.190> does<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.940> mattifies<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:07.500> I<00:05:07.650> think

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
it does so this mattifies and I think

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.530 
it does so this mattifies and I think
that's<00:05:07.980> quite<00:05:08.100> useful<00:05:08.340> for<00:05:08.640> someone<00:05:09.030> who's

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
that's quite useful for someone who's

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.800 
that's quite useful for someone who's
maybe<00:05:09.960> not<00:05:10.310> as<00:05:11.310> clued<00:05:11.670> up<00:05:11.820> on<00:05:12.000> makeup<00:05:12.360> so

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
maybe not as clued up on makeup so

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.110 
maybe not as clued up on makeup so
they'll<00:05:13.650> know<00:05:13.890> exactly<00:05:14.070> what<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:14.640> does<00:05:14.820> and

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
they'll know exactly what it does and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.140 
they'll know exactly what it does and
then<00:05:15.810> below<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.800> also<00:05:16.980> says<00:05:17.340> when<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.760> use<00:05:17.970> it

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
then below it also says when to use it

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.770 
then below it also says when to use it
so<00:05:18.480> in<00:05:18.720> here<00:05:19.410> it's<00:05:19.850> it's<00:05:20.850> been<00:05:21.060> made<00:05:21.240> bold<00:05:21.570> to

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
so in here it's it's been made bold to

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.010 
so in here it's it's been made bold to
use<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.650> before<00:05:22.920> makeup<00:05:23.520> but<00:05:24.510> there's<00:05:24.750> other

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
use it before makeup but there's other

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.660 
use it before makeup but there's other
ones<00:05:25.200> that<00:05:25.380> say<00:05:25.560> duro<00:05:25.770> makeup<00:05:26.220> or<00:05:26.400> paste

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
ones that say duro makeup or paste

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.130 
ones that say duro makeup or paste
makeup<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:27.150> I<00:05:27.210> think<00:05:27.420> that's<00:05:27.720> quite<00:05:27.930> helpful

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
makeup so I think that's quite helpful

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.370 
makeup so I think that's quite helpful
for<00:05:28.620> beginners<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:29.850> I<00:05:30.150> quite<00:05:30.930> like<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.140> I've

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
for beginners so I quite like that I've

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.280 
for beginners so I quite like that I've
not<00:05:31.530> seen<00:05:31.890> that<00:05:32.040> on<00:05:32.160> products<00:05:32.520> before<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:33.390> it

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
not seen that on products before and it

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.350 
not seen that on products before and it
also<00:05:34.440> gives<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:34.920> little<00:05:35.190> tip<00:05:35.520> which<00:05:36.150> says

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
also gives you a little tip which says

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.510

smooth on to skin working outwards for a

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.210 
smooth on to skin working outwards for a
flawless<00:05:38.910> looking<00:05:39.240> skin<00:05:39.350> texture<00:05:40.350> passing

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
flawless looking skin texture passing

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.610 
flawless looking skin texture passing

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
you for me that tip wasn't helpful

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.370 
you for me that tip wasn't helpful
because<00:05:43.800> I<00:05:44.190> know<00:05:44.340> what<00:05:44.640> I'm<00:05:44.760> doing<00:05:45.090> at<00:05:45.630> least<00:05:46.170> I

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
because I know what I'm doing at least I

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.570 
because I know what I'm doing at least I
like<00:05:47.040> to<00:05:47.100> think<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.490> do<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.850> probably<00:05:48.210> don't<00:05:48.450> but

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
like to think I do I probably don't but

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.240 
like to think I do I probably don't but
but<00:05:50.580> like<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:50.940> say<00:05:51.180> beginners<00:05:51.570> that's<00:05:51.900> quite

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
but like I say beginners that's quite

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.330 
but like I say beginners that's quite
good<00:05:53.250> for<00:05:53.730> them<00:05:53.910> so<00:05:54.900> they<00:05:55.080> can<00:05:55.110> see<00:05:55.530> what<00:05:56.160> they

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
good for them so they can see what they

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.480 
good for them so they can see what they
have<00:05:56.490> to<00:05:56.640> do<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:57.000> how<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.180> apply<00:05:57.570> a<00:05:57.600> primer<00:05:57.840> and

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
have to do and how to apply a primer and

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.270 
have to do and how to apply a primer and
yeah<00:05:59.490> you<00:06:00.450> get<00:06:00.570> 35<00:06:01.200> milliliters<00:06:01.620> if<00:06:02.160> you

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
yeah you get 35 milliliters if you

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.910 
yeah you get 35 milliliters if you
wanted<00:06:02.610> to<00:06:02.730> know<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:04.380> think<00:06:04.470> that's<00:06:04.770> all<00:06:04.890> I

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
wanted to know so I think that's all I

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.980 
wanted to know so I think that's all I
can<00:06:05.130> really<00:06:05.280> say<00:06:05.370> about<00:06:05.700> this<00:06:05.970> primer<00:06:06.300> it<00:06:06.810> is

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
can really say about this primer it is

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
it did mattify my face when I felt I

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.720 
it did mattify my face when I felt I
wasn't<00:06:41.300> really<00:06:41.660> busy<00:06:41.990> working<00:06:42.380> hard<00:06:42.860> when<00:06:43.700> I

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
wasn't really busy working hard when I

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.120 
wasn't really busy working hard when I
was<00:06:44.320> making<00:06:45.320> beds<00:06:45.740> because<00:06:45.980> I'm<00:06:46.100> a

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
was making beds because I'm a

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.830 
was making beds because I'm a
housekeeper<00:06:46.310> so<00:06:46.790> when<00:06:46.910> I'm<00:06:47.000> making<00:06:47.210> beds<00:06:47.570> and

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
housekeeper so when I'm making beds and

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.080 
housekeeper so when I'm making beds and
painting<00:06:48.230> and<00:06:48.380> stuff<00:06:48.680> I<00:06:48.980> did<00:06:49.490> start<00:06:49.730> to<00:06:49.820> feel

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
painting and stuff I did start to feel

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.630 
painting and stuff I did start to feel
like<00:06:50.420> my<00:06:51.080> face<00:06:51.290> was<00:06:51.320> getting<00:06:51.530> a<00:06:51.680> bit<00:06:51.830> shiny<00:06:52.100> but

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
like my face was getting a bit shiny but

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.810 
like my face was getting a bit shiny but
as<00:06:52.790> I<00:06:52.970> said<00:06:53.030> before<00:06:53.180> I<00:06:53.810> felt<00:06:54.440> like<00:06:55.010> it<00:06:55.250> was

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
as I said before I felt like it was

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.760 
as I said before I felt like it was
really<00:06:56.180> really<00:06:56.330> shiny<00:06:56.900> like<00:06:57.170> a<00:06:57.200> disco<00:06:57.590> ball

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
really really shiny like a disco ball

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.250 
really really shiny like a disco ball
when<00:06:58.760> I<00:06:58.790> looked<00:06:59.000> in<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.180> mirror<00:06:59.240> it<00:06:59.660> wasn't<00:07:00.110> so

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
when I looked in the mirror it wasn't so

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.100 
when I looked in the mirror it wasn't so
bad<00:07:00.440> so<00:07:00.830> I<00:07:00.860> think<00:07:01.040> that<00:07:01.640> it<00:07:01.790> does<00:07:02.150> combat

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
bad so I think that it does combat

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.980 
bad so I think that it does combat
shininess<00:07:03.650> and<00:07:04.240> that<00:07:05.240> is<00:07:05.390> really<00:07:05.630> good<00:07:05.780> for

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
shininess and that is really good for

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.780 
shininess and that is really good for
someone<00:07:06.140> like<00:07:06.350> me<00:07:06.620> who<00:07:06.860> has<00:07:07.100> really<00:07:07.430> shiny

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
someone like me who has really shiny

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.870 
someone like me who has really shiny
skin<00:07:08.320> so<00:07:09.320> I<00:07:09.620> would<00:07:09.950> definitely<00:07:10.130> say<00:07:10.370> that<00:07:10.730> it's

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
skin so I would definitely say that it's

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.060 
skin so I would definitely say that it's
a<00:07:10.970> good<00:07:11.120> purchase<00:07:11.720> and<00:07:12.020> if<00:07:12.170> you're<00:07:12.350> interested
