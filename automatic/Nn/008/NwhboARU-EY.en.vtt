probably<00:00:32.099> not<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> most<00:00:32.610> impressive<00:00:33.000> looking

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
probably not the most impressive looking

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.700 
probably not the most impressive looking
wins<00:00:34.100> if<00:00:35.100> you're<00:00:35.309> into<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> oil<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.059> look

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
wins if you're into the oil in this look

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
wins if you're into the oil in this look
but<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> very<00:00:38.850> very<00:00:38.940> functional<00:00:39.420> design

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
but it is a very very functional design

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.200 
but it is a very very functional design
of<00:00:39.809> course<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:41.160> notice<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.520> very<00:00:41.700> large<00:00:41.879> in

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of course you notice it very large in

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.229 
of course you notice it very large in
there<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:42.960> means<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.410> has<00:00:43.559> my<00:00:43.800> cons

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
there which means it it has my cons

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
there which means it it has my cons
special<00:00:45.239> nano<00:00:45.510> crystal<00:00:45.989> coating<00:00:46.100> so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
special nano crystal coating so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.380 
special nano crystal coating so
basically<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:47.969> much<00:00:48.180> much

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
basically it's going to do much much

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
basically it's going to do much much
better<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.809> situations<00:00:49.469> where<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
better in situations where you have a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
better in situations where you have a
very<00:00:50.969> bright<00:00:51.180> light<00:00:51.420> source<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> frame<00:00:52.110> or

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
very bright light source in the frame or

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.569 
very bright light source in the frame or
if<00:00:52.469> you're<00:00:52.620> shooting<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> backlit<00:00:53.340> type

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
if you're shooting in a backlit type

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.119 
if you're shooting in a backlit type
situation<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.469> less<00:00:55.739> flare

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
situation going to see much less flare

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.010 
situation going to see much less flare
and<00:00:56.250> ghosting<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.390> always<00:00:57.570> nice<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020

very<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:01.950> standard<00:02:02.310> fair<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.000> will

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
very very standard fair there I will

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.889 
very very standard fair there I will
point<00:02:03.990> out<00:02:04.079> real<00:02:04.229> fast<00:02:04.259> though<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:06.570> unlike

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
point out real fast though that unlike

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.330 
point out real fast though that unlike
some<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.170> Nikon<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> other<00:02:07.890> hey<00:02:08.550> assessment<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
some of Nikon to other hey assessment is

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.290 
some of Nikon to other hey assessment is
this<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.580> has<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.940> more<00:02:12.209> noticeable<00:02:12.390> stop

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
this one has a more noticeable stop

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.660 
this one has a more noticeable stop
into<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> range<00:02:13.840> there<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.770> while<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.430> rain

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
into the range there so while this rain

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.960 
into the range there so while this rain
keeps<00:02:15.970> spinning<00:02:17.430> there's<00:02:18.430> actually<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> more

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
keeps spinning there's actually a more

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.120 
keeps spinning there's actually a more
noticeable<00:02:19.210> stop<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.500> will<00:02:20.620> come<00:02:21.040> in

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
noticeable stop so that will come in

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.370 
noticeable stop so that will come in
very<00:02:21.160> very<00:02:21.520> handy<00:02:21.820> for<00:02:21.970> video<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.230> way

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
very very handy for video so that way

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.840 
very very handy for video so that way
you<00:02:23.440> won't<00:02:23.740> get<00:02:23.950> into<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> rain<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.670> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
you won't get into the rain to just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.250 
you won't get into the rain to just
accidentally<00:02:25.450> keep<00:02:25.570> spinning<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.110> can

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
accidentally keep spinning it you can

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.170 
accidentally keep spinning it you can
kind<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.560> feel<00:02:26.830> where<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.190> hand<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.060> it's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
kind of feel where the hand is so it's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.940 
kind of feel where the hand is so it's
nice<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.210> 67<00:02:32.020> millimetre<00:02:32.410> filter<00:02:32.740> size

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
nice it is a 67 millimetre filter size

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.220 
nice it is a 67 millimetre filter size

focusing lens which means that the rear

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.460 
focusing lens which means that the rear
elements<00:03:20.110> move<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.650> focus<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.930> very<00:03:22.930> common<00:03:23.350> on

let's go ahead and take a look at some

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.120 
let's go ahead and take a look at some
of<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.240> samples<00:03:43.660> from<00:03:43.780> this<00:03:43.930> image<00:03:44.080> oh<00:03:47.070> boy

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
of the samples from this image oh boy

of the samples from this image oh boy
sample<00:03:49.060> from<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.330> image<00:03:49.660> yeah<00:03:50.440> what<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> meant

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
sample from this image yeah what I meant

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.000 
sample from this image yeah what I meant
to<00:03:51.610> say<00:03:51.640> was<00:03:51.959> sample<00:03:52.959> from<00:03:53.080> this<00:03:53.260> lens<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.800> was<00:03:53.980> a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
to say was sample from this lens I was a

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.130 
to say was sample from this lens I was a
bit<00:03:54.160> tired<00:03:54.400> if<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:54.610> recorded<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.330> last<00:03:55.750> part<00:03:56.050> of

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
bit tired if I recorded the last part of

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.860 
bit tired if I recorded the last part of
this<00:03:56.230> video<00:03:56.620> last<00:03:56.770> night<00:03:57.540> anyways<00:03:58.540> let's<00:03:58.780> go

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
this video last night anyways let's go

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.360 
this video last night anyways let's go
ahead<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.170> take<00:03:59.320> some<00:03:59.350> take<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.950> look<00:04:00.190> at<00:04:00.250> these

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
ahead and take some take a look at these

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.840 
ahead and take some take a look at these
samples<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:02.220> thought<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.370> shot<00:04:03.610> right<00:04:03.790> here

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
samples I thought this shot right here

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.000 
samples I thought this shot right here
would<00:04:04.180> landed<00:04:04.570> let<00:04:05.230> itself<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.770> lens

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
would landed let itself to this lens

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.180 
would landed let itself to this lens
very<00:04:06.160> well<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.170> did<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.890> worked<00:04:09.010> out

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
very well and I it did it worked out

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.220 
very well and I it did it worked out
very<00:04:09.220> nice<00:04:09.580> it's<00:04:10.270> it's<00:04:10.570> somewhat<00:04:10.989> magical

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
very nice it's it's somewhat magical

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.470 
very nice it's it's somewhat magical
being<00:04:11.860> able<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.190> shoot<00:04:12.760> such<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> wide<00:04:13.300> angle

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
being able to shoot such a wide angle

the<00:04:42.129> bokeh<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.699> not<00:04:43.590> it's<00:04:44.590> nothing

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
the bokeh is not it's nothing

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.830 
the bokeh is not it's nothing
particularly<00:04:45.400> special<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.360> mean<00:04:46.539> it's<00:04:46.659> not

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
particularly special but I mean it's not

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:54.600 
particularly special but I mean it's not
bad<00:04:50.340> something<00:04:51.340> like<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.699> 85<00:04:52.449> millimeter<00:04:53.610> 1.8

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
bad something like the 85 millimeter 1.8

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.110 
bad something like the 85 millimeter 1.8
or<00:04:54.639> 1.4<00:04:55.509> anything<00:04:55.780> like<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.460> any<00:04:57.460> telephoto

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
or 1.4 anything like that any telephoto

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.909 
or 1.4 anything like that any telephoto
lens<00:04:58.360> but<00:04:59.169> still<00:04:59.349> very<00:04:59.379> good

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
lens but still very good

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.969 
lens but still very good
I<00:05:02.129> have<00:05:03.129> also<00:05:03.370> shot<00:05:03.759> with<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:05.139> Nikon<00:05:05.469> 24

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
I have also shot with the the Nikon 24

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.999 
I have also shot with the the Nikon 24
millimeter<00:05:06.400> 1.4<00:05:07.300> in<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.479> past<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.169> this<00:05:08.800> one

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
millimeter 1.4 in the past and this one

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.089 
millimeter 1.4 in the past and this one
while<00:05:09.280> not<00:05:09.520> quite<00:05:09.940> as<00:05:10.150> sharp<00:05:11.099> probably

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
while not quite as sharp probably

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.680 
while not quite as sharp probably
because<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.669> fact<00:05:12.909> that<00:05:13.030> this<00:05:13.240> one<00:05:13.449> doesn't

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
because the fact that this one doesn't

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.659 
because the fact that this one doesn't
have<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.319> et<00:05:14.949> glass<00:05:15.310> in<00:05:15.639> it<00:05:16.949> but<00:05:17.949> it<00:05:18.159> is<00:05:18.190> still

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
have the et glass in it but it is still

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.490 
have the et glass in it but it is still
a<00:05:19.120> very<00:05:19.180> very<00:05:19.599> good<00:05:19.810> lens<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.319> when<00:05:20.409> you

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
a very very good lens and when you

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.490 
a very very good lens and when you
consider<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.949> fact<00:05:21.099> that<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:22.330> 24<00:05:23.259> millimeter

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
consider the fact that the 24 millimeter

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.709 
consider the fact that the 24 millimeter
is<00:05:24.180> like<00:05:25.180> about<00:05:25.889> $2,200<00:05:26.889> USD<00:05:27.479> whereas<00:05:28.479> this

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
is like about $2,200 USD whereas this

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.869 
is like about $2,200 USD whereas this
lens<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.610> $6.99<00:05:30.610> USD<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:32.190> mean<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.430> can't<00:05:33.699> you

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
lens is $6.99 USD I mean you can't you

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.589 
lens is $6.99 USD I mean you can't you
can't<00:05:34.090> beat<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.300> for<00:05:34.449> that<00:05:34.539> price<00:05:34.719> at<00:05:34.870> all

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
can't beat it for that price at all

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.390 
can't beat it for that price at all
there's<00:05:37.599> another<00:05:37.870> one<00:05:38.020> here<00:05:38.289> kind<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.279> the

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
there's another one here kind of the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.809 
there's another one here kind of the
same<00:05:39.460> sort<00:05:39.819> of<00:05:39.879> thing<00:05:41.099> you<00:05:42.099> can<00:05:42.219> see<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.669> this

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
same sort of thing you can see in this

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.890 
same sort of thing you can see in this
area<00:05:43.029> here<00:05:43.360> it's<00:05:43.509> it's<00:05:43.839> reasonably<00:05:44.440> sharp<00:05:45.900> is

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
area here it's it's reasonably sharp is

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.350 
area here it's it's reasonably sharp is
starting<00:05:47.680> to<00:05:47.830> lose<00:05:48.069> some<00:05:48.610> softness<00:05:49.060> like<00:05:49.270> if

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
starting to lose some softness like if

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.019 
starting to lose some softness like if
we<00:05:49.449> look<00:05:49.599> down<00:05:49.629> in<00:05:49.930> this<00:05:50.020> area<00:05:50.319> here<00:05:50.819> but<00:05:51.819> still

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
we look down in this area here but still

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.670 
we look down in this area here but still
very<00:05:52.060> very<00:05:52.360> good<00:05:52.719> you<00:05:52.900> know<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.050> mean<00:05:53.289> it's<00:05:53.440> it's

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
a very very good lens though especially

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.010 
a very very good lens though especially
at<00:05:57.159> that<00:05:57.370> $6.99<00:05:58.089> price<00:05:58.360> point<00:05:58.659> there's<00:05:58.839> not

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
at that $6.99 price point there's not

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.070 
at that $6.99 price point there's not
anything<00:05:59.349> else<00:05:59.589> like<00:06:00.039> it<00:06:00.509> this<00:06:01.509> is<00:06:01.719> definitely
