00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.550
 Imagine the whole world too small and Mario Kart together 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.279
 combines what would it be like 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.630
 sorry debutant in the run-up and coming on 25 May with modnation racers 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.839
 maybe get started with the construction of these shares in this world 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.520
 bart buysse 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.010
 Who 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.290
 being allowed to participate in the decision-making process about equality first film makes it 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.680
 The game is presented as a big show that revolves around the murder 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.290
 suez in the championship or the apple martis neal character hears about 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.510
 This tournament made the decision to participate in the progress to make quite a bit of money 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.620
 deserve to have to look for the manager and then enter it 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.270
 Write for the and marti whatever you put down with this and yes you must 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.120
 Proving was a worthy and ashley cole that you notice that it's not the normal one 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.280
 ray players 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.190
 because you can easily compare it with mario kart the oldies in karts and the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.630
 jobs are great creative behind it are full of posts raps 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.290
 the journey itself quite simple this is a separate button to drift but 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.160
 furthermore that they know as we know who picked up some web care enemies and along 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.820
 naturally tries to reach the finish first 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 Really innovative is to master this measurement system 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.900
 If you have a power up while racing on the road be randomly chosen 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.220
 for example, which bonuses get a tongelresestraat rocket use your weapon 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.990
 No, then, this neighborhood will pick up a pool of fauw and Pa extend to life 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.730
 and if you want that there is still going to the last level he won three times 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.810
 but at this time the stone dump did not stay with the original game two 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.700
 elements modnation racers 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.230
 it is of course his game but it goes much further than that 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.909
 After the first race you will end up in the mood spot or the game's menu 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.290
 Developer United Front Games must have thought away with it being two 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.570
 legs we don't want minus interactive 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.810
 and that is it 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.299
 and this mod spot you can tear around with your kart but the garage to go to 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.889
 the multiplayer or he just started career the studio 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.879
 7 2 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.299
 and that everyone is allowed to fly earlier but certainly started again 4 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.899
 forties and fifties meters away 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:18.729
 pvv'er stayed in government 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.639
 in the early version, there was little playing time, the online section was enough 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:23.830
 not activated 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 but as soon as that works both on a square with other players 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.299
 and with that can set up 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.559
 Peter has large video screens with the latest news icons and large statues 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.169
 of the three best mat every week to stand on a stage for everyone to 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.129
 behold 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.379
 from this square itself turned to the garage where ultimately a lot 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.930
 going to spend hours with an animal, modnation racers go hand in hand with 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.819
 merelbeke's motto 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.079
 and is now namely generous before you eat 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.339
 I have many options to adjust my own taste 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.899
 the mills in the game have their own cartoon-like rise you know 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:01.129
 characters among others judge arrogant people grabbing 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.999
 In addition, you can also customize her new clothes to look for 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.219
 to give an impression of the size of the choice of offer some concrete figures 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:15.069
 after 315 different mouths you can choose 260 and n225 stickers that is 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.209
 enough choice 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.540
 this way you can spend quite some time making your own cyclical 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.400
 if you want you will be made fairly easy you can just leave 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.960
 and the rest of the game itself means that your piece will be automatic 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.560
 feature bam and percent builders but there are plenty 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.879
 possibilities has not exactly to do you will want 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.859
 the possibility of different terrains and surroundings seem quite 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.569
 limited but like which central square it really is not going to be much anymore 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 through downloadable content 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.979
 take home 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:04.099
 Modnation racers will be watching the seventeen tons the way it looks now 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.620
 to hold 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.870
 the game combines the formula of weather on this square is a nice way of 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.719
 racing what looks like mario kart 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.599
 most of the work is very tasty and fun for everyone 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.400
 the style of the game might be a bit childish 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.829
 but this is not the game 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.840
 Adjusting a quarter character's characters doesn't really mean creating one 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.689
 ski slope very extensive 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.220
 the emphasis in the game is the online section 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.190
 That will only be known on May 25 when the game is in stores
