hey<00:00:00.210> guys<00:00:00.420> the<00:00:00.630> developer<00:00:01.020> Franco<00:00:01.380> has

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
hey guys the developer Franco has

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.290 
hey guys the developer Franco has
released<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:02.040> dedicated<00:00:02.490> /<00:00:02.820> app<00:00:03.030> modes

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
released a dedicated / app modes

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.700 
released a dedicated / app modes
application<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.140> what<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.529> to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
application and what this is going to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.260 
application and what this is going to
allow<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.130> do<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.430> create<00:00:05.670> custom

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
allow you to do is create custom

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.970 
allow you to do is create custom
profiles<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:06.930> your<00:00:07.080> apps<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.560> can<00:00:07.740> change

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
profiles for your apps so you can change

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.850 
profiles for your apps so you can change
things<00:00:08.160> like<00:00:08.370> CPU<00:00:08.820> frequency<00:00:09.349> GPU<00:00:10.349> frequency

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
things like CPU frequency GPU frequency

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.620 
things like CPU frequency GPU frequency
input<00:00:11.309> boost<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.790> other<00:00:11.940> Turner<00:00:12.240> balls<00:00:12.450> like

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
input boost and other Turner balls like

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.749 
input boost and other Turner balls like
that<00:00:12.660> per<00:00:13.530> app<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.130> if<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> know<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> specific

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that per app so if you know a specific

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.700 
that per app so if you know a specific
application<00:00:15.540> doesn't<00:00:15.780> need<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.199> use<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> lot<00:00:16.680> of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
application doesn't need to use a lot of

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130 
application doesn't need to use a lot of
your<00:00:16.920> CPU<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.369> GPU<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.630> actually<00:00:18.750> down

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
your CPU or GPU you can actually down

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.540 
your CPU or GPU you can actually down
clock<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.680> when<00:00:20.039> you're<00:00:20.220> using<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
clock it when you're using that

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.370 
clock it when you're using that
application<00:00:21.210> then<00:00:21.480> when<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.720> exit<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.199> app

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
application then when you exit that app

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.599 
application then when you exit that app
it's<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:22.920> back<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.310> system

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it's going to go back to your system

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
it's going to go back to your system
defaults<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.410> actually<00:00:25.650> save

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
defaults with this you can actually save

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.710 
defaults with this you can actually save
yourself<00:00:26.310> quite<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> bit<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.090> battery<00:00:27.449> life<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
yourself quite a bit of battery life and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.910 
yourself quite a bit of battery life and
I'll<00:00:27.869> show<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:28.260> example<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
I'll show you an example of that a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.529 
I'll show you an example of that a
little<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.189> later<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> video<00:00:29.910> there

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
little bit later on in the video there

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.089 
little bit later on in the video there
are<00:00:30.660> some<00:00:30.869> requirements<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.769> need<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
are some requirements you do need a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.740 
are some requirements you do need a
rooted<00:00:32.460> device<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:33.000> also<00:00:33.030> need<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
rooted device you also need to be on a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
rooted device you also need to be on a
device<00:00:34.050> running<00:00:34.350> android<00:00:34.770> 4.0<00:00:35.340> point<00:00:35.700> 3<00:00:35.880> or

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
device running android 4.0 point 3 or

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.970 
device running android 4.0 point 3 or
later<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.870> don't<00:00:37.110> specifically<00:00:37.710> need

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
later you don't specifically need

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
later you don't specifically need
franco.kernel<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.940> use<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.420> can

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
franco.kernel to use this you can

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
franco.kernel to use this you can
actually<00:00:39.690> use<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> stock<00:00:40.410> kernel<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:40.920> any

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
actually use the stock kernel or any

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.549 
actually use the stock kernel or any
other<00:00:41.399> custom<00:00:41.790> kernel<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.690> yeah<00:00:43.290> let's<00:00:43.469> go

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
other custom kernel so yeah let's go

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.900 
other custom kernel so yeah let's go
ahead<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.800> check<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.550> first<00:00:44.760> time

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
ahead and check it out the first time

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.100 
ahead and check it out the first time
you<00:00:45.059> open<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> application<00:00:45.899> you'll<00:00:46.020> be

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you open the application you'll be

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
you open the application you'll be
greeted<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> welcome<00:00:47.039> screen<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
greeted with a welcome screen and a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
greeted with a welcome screen and a
small<00:00:47.910> tutorial<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.780> also<00:00:48.930> choose<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
small tutorial you can also choose to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.750 
small tutorial you can also choose to
skip<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.129> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> otherwise

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
skip that if you don't want to otherwise

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
skip that if you don't want to otherwise
swipe<00:00:51.180> from<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.719> left<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.110> it'll<00:00:52.260> tell

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
swipe from right to left and it'll tell

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.560 
swipe from right to left and it'll tell
you<00:00:52.680> basically<00:00:53.370> how<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> application

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you basically how to use the application

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270 
you basically how to use the application
and<00:00:54.750> where<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.230> probably<00:00:55.500> best<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.890> use<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and where it's probably best to use it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.979 
and where it's probably best to use it
so<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.850> user-friendly<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> very

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so it's very user-friendly it's a very

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
so it's very user-friendly it's a very
easy<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.530> intuitive<00:00:58.890> UI<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.239> keep

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
easy and intuitive UI you can just keep

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.819 
easy and intuitive UI you can just keep
going<00:01:00.690> through<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> ready

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
going through these and then you ready

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.280 
going through these and then you ready
let's<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.340> started<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.090> boom<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
let's get started so boom we're into the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.660 
let's get started so boom we're into the
application<00:01:04.379> let's<00:01:04.979> go<00:01:05.100> ahead<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.309> check<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
application let's go ahead and check it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
application let's go ahead and check it
out<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.030> we've<00:01:06.150> got<00:01:06.270> four<00:01:06.540> different<00:01:06.840> options

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
out so we've got four different options

this<00:01:27.900> drawback<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.439> we'll<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> create

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
this drawback out we'll go in to create

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.679 
this drawback out we'll go in to create
and<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.880> where<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.299> actually

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and this is where you go to actually

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.450 
and this is where you go to actually
create<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.320> custom<00:01:31.530> profiles<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.310> your

create the custom profiles for your
different<00:01:32.700> applications<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.659> all

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
different applications you can see all

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.590 
different applications you can see all

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
this application you can actually choose

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.179 
this application you can actually choose
to<00:01:42.329> add<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> using<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> custom<00:01:43.290> pass<00:01:43.710> option

to add it using the custom pass option

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.469 
to add it using the custom pass option
for<00:01:44.490> example<00:01:44.850> I've<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.119> flashed<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> custom

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
for example I've just flashed a custom

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510 
for example I've just flashed a custom
kernel<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> create<00:01:47.040> you'll<00:01:47.250> notice

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
kernel if we go to create you'll notice

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.010 
kernel if we go to create you'll notice
there's<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> lot<00:01:47.939> less<00:01:48.119> turnable<00:01:48.540> than<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.840> had

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
there's a lot less turnable than I had

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
there's a lot less turnable than I had
before<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.950> what<00:01:50.159> we're<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.820> go

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
before so what we're going to do is go

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
before so what we're going to do is go
to<00:01:51.060> custom<00:01:51.540> paths<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:52.530> we're<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> hit

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
to custom paths then we're going to hit

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.039 
to custom paths then we're going to hit
add<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> new<00:01:53.549> path<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> top<00:01:54.270> click<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
add a new path of the top click the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
add a new path of the top click the
actual<00:01:55.320> path<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.770> section<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.610> going

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
actual path a section and this is going

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.910 
actual path a section and this is going
to<00:01:56.820> open<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> internal<00:01:57.780> Explorer<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to open up the internal Explorer now you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
to open up the internal Explorer now you
need<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.250> find<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> path<00:01:59.790> where<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> Eternals

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
need to find the path where the Eternals

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.969 
need to find the path where the Eternals
actually<00:02:01.200> are<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.219> system<00:02:03.290> devices<00:02:04.290> this

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
actually are so that system devices this

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.289 
actually are so that system devices this
one's<00:02:05.189> kind<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.490> big<00:02:05.670> list<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.149> right

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
one's kind of a big list but it's right

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.869 
one's kind of a big list but it's right
the<00:02:06.450> bottom<00:02:06.659> leads<00:02:06.869> filesystem<00:02:07.469> again<00:02:07.879> here

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
the bottom leads filesystem again here

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
the bottom leads filesystem again here
we<00:02:08.940> go<00:02:09.060> system<00:02:09.830> cpu<00:02:11.390> cpu<00:02:12.390> frequency<00:02:12.569> element

we go system cpu cpu frequency element

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
we go system cpu cpu frequency element
X<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.220> here<00:02:14.520> they<00:02:14.640> are<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.270> different

Turner<00:02:15.810> balls<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:16.410> add<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.010> for

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
Turner balls you can now add so for

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.650 
Turner balls you can now add so for
example<00:02:17.250> if<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.940> change<00:02:18.120> sampling

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
example if you want to change sampling

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.540 
example if you want to change sampling
rate<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.319> can<00:02:19.349> click<00:02:19.680> sampling<00:02:20.130> rate<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.520> can

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
rate you can click sampling rate you can

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.860 
rate you can click sampling rate you can
call<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.000> anything<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.750> it's

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
call it anything you want but it's

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.870 
call it anything you want but it's
probably<00:02:22.080> best<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.380> call<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.980> sampling

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
probably best to call it the sampling

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.990 
probably best to call it the sampling
rate<00:02:24.090> here<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.630> go<00:02:25.250> hit<00:02:26.250> fire<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.790> and

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
rate here we go hit fire it up and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.240 
rate here we go hit fire it up and
that's<00:02:27.420> it'll<00:02:27.840> now<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.110> available<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.220> in

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
that's it'll now be available for you in

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.740 
that's it'll now be available for you in
the<00:02:29.489> create<00:02:29.819> list<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.330> see<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.630> right

okay so I'm going to go ahead and create

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.430 
okay so I'm going to go ahead and create
a<00:02:41.880> profile<00:02:42.360> here<00:02:42.569> for<00:02:42.720> flappy<00:02:42.959> birds<00:02:43.260> because

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
a profile here for flappy birds because

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.780 
a profile here for flappy birds because
I<00:02:43.560> know<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.860> game<00:02:44.040> doesn't<00:02:44.400> need<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.550> lot<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
I know that game doesn't need a lot of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.420 
I know that game doesn't need a lot of
CPU<00:02:45.300> or<00:02:45.330> GPU<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.110> run<00:02:46.290> smoothly<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.220> I'm<00:02:47.280> going

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
CPU or GPU to run smoothly so I'm going

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.759 
CPU or GPU to run smoothly so I'm going

megahertz let's go ahead and play the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.319 
megahertz let's go ahead and play the
game<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.489> can<00:03:38.640> see<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> game<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.269> this

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
game so you can see on a game like this

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.660 
game so you can see on a game like this
that's<00:03:39.780> really<00:03:40.170> easy<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.739> play<00:03:40.920> for<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> for

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that's really easy to play for the for

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.550 
that's really easy to play for the for
the<00:03:41.700> hardware<00:03:42.180> there's<00:03:42.750> no<00:03:42.930> problems<00:03:43.380> there's

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the hardware there's no problems there's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.710 
the hardware there's no problems there's
no<00:03:43.590> lags<00:03:43.980> there's<00:03:44.250> no<00:03:44.370> slowdowns<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.359> doesn't

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
no lags there's no slowdowns it doesn't

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.360 
no lags there's no slowdowns it doesn't
need<00:03:45.870> anything<00:03:46.350> higher<00:03:46.739> than<00:03:46.769> what<00:03:47.250> I've

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
need anything higher than what I've

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.920 
need anything higher than what I've
given<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.269> once<00:03:48.450> you're<00:03:48.569> done<00:03:48.690> with<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
given it so once you're done with the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.300 
given it so once you're done with the
application<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.590> go<00:03:49.799> ahead<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.069> eggs

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
application you can go ahead and eggs

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.160 
application you can go ahead and eggs
out<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.000> give<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.450> few<00:03:51.600> seconds<00:03:51.989> and

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
out of it and give it a few seconds and

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.690 
out of it and give it a few seconds and
you'll<00:03:52.260> see<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.829> will<00:03:52.920> disable<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.549> per

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
you'll see that it will disable the per

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.670 
you'll see that it will disable the per
app<00:03:53.910> mode<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.389> your<00:03:54.900> settings<00:03:55.260> we'll<00:03:55.319> go<00:03:55.530> back

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
app mode and your settings we'll go back

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.259 
app mode and your settings we'll go back
to<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.920> normal<00:03:56.190> system<00:03:56.400> default<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.120> there

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
to the normal system default so there

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.210 
to the normal system default so there
you<00:03:57.329> go<00:03:57.389> prep<00:03:57.870> mode<00:03:58.019> disabled<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.980> with<00:03:59.130> the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
you go prep mode disabled so with the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.770 
you go prep mode disabled so with the
mode<00:03:59.400> off<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.910> see<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.359> cpu

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
mode off you can see that the cpu

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.210 
mode off you can see that the cpu
frequency<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.380> quite<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> bit<00:04:01.950> higher<00:04:02.190> than

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
frequency is quite a bit higher than

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.250 
frequency is quite a bit higher than
with<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.700> on<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.209> game<00:04:03.420> like<00:04:03.450> flappy<00:04:04.049> birds

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
with it on in a game like flappy birds

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.539 
with it on in a game like flappy birds
that<00:04:04.470> really<00:04:04.709> doesn't<00:04:04.889> need<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.340> extra

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
that really doesn't need that extra

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.550 
that really doesn't need that extra
power<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:06.299> just<00:04:06.510> end<00:04:06.720> up<00:04:06.840> wasting<00:04:07.109> battery

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
power you just end up wasting battery

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.440 
power you just end up wasting battery
life<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.280> situations<00:04:08.850> like<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.209> the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
life so in situations like this the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.849 
life so in situations like this the

one<00:04:15.840> right<00:04:15.989> here<00:04:16.260> I've<00:04:16.410> changed<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.829> minimum

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
one right here I've changed the minimum

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the hot plug Road threshold to zero so

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.310 
the hot plug Road threshold to zero so
it<00:04:23.700> locks<00:04:23.849> in<00:04:24.120> all<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.390> cause<00:04:24.599> and<00:04:24.930> I've

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
it locks in all the cause and I've

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.350 
it locks in all the cause and I've
changed<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.770> CPU<00:04:26.159> threshold<00:04:26.640> 285

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
changed the CPU threshold 285

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.179 
changed the CPU threshold 285
when<00:04:27.509> I<00:04:27.569> put<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.110> geekbench<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.919> if<00:04:28.979> we<00:04:29.069> go

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
when I put that on geekbench so if we go

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.309 
when I put that on geekbench so if we go
ahead<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.400> open<00:04:29.580> geekbench<00:04:30.150> right<00:04:30.360> now<00:04:30.509> give

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
ahead and open geekbench right now give

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.929 
ahead and open geekbench right now give
it<00:04:31.439> a<00:04:31.500> second<00:04:31.919> you'll<00:04:32.069> notice<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.729> once

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
it a second you'll notice that the once

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.790 
it a second you'll notice that the once
the<00:04:33.090> pair<00:04:33.270> up<00:04:33.389> modes<00:04:33.599> apply<00:04:33.900> you'll<00:04:34.500> see<00:04:34.680> that

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
the pair up modes apply you'll see that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.619 
the pair up modes apply you'll see that
it<00:04:34.949> locks<00:04:35.189> in<00:04:35.490> at<00:04:35.639> two<00:04:35.819> point<00:04:36.120> three<00:04:36.180> gigahertz

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:36.629 
it locks in at two point three gigahertz

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.450 
it locks in at two point three gigahertz
all<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.199> cause<00:04:37.409> our<00:04:37.620> online<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.189> it's<00:04:38.310> going

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
all the cause our online and it's going

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.010 
all the cause our online and it's going
to<00:04:38.520> stay<00:04:38.580> like<00:04:38.969> that<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.629> you're<00:04:39.750> going<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.930> get

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
to stay like that so you're going to get

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.659 
to stay like that so you're going to get
a<00:04:40.110> better<00:04:40.349> score<00:04:40.620> than<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.430> would<00:04:41.580> just

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
a better score than if you would just

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.270 
a better score than if you would just
just<00:04:41.909> leave<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.330> as<00:04:42.599> it<00:04:42.780> was<00:04:42.810> before<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.530> you

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
just leave it as it was before and you

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
just leave it as it was before and you
know<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.400> don't<00:04:44.580> have<00:04:44.699> to<00:04:44.849> be<00:04:44.969> quite<00:04:45.180> as

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
know you don't have to be quite as

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.850 
know you don't have to be quite as
dramatic<00:04:45.389> as<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:45.840> but<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.229> can<00:04:46.409> have<00:04:46.710> it

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
dramatic as that but you can have it

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.559 
dramatic as that but you can have it
quad-core<00:04:47.340> for<00:04:47.550> certain<00:04:47.819> games<00:04:48.090> if<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.419> want

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
quad-core for certain games if you want

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.629 
quad-core for certain games if you want
it<00:04:48.659> to<00:04:48.780> be<00:04:48.810> make<00:04:49.409> them<00:04:49.590> perform<00:04:49.860> better<00:04:50.129> so

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
it to be make them perform better so

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.429 
it to be make them perform better so
there<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.240> go<00:04:51.330> guys<00:04:51.449> that's<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.080> power<00:04:52.319> up

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
there you go guys that's the power up

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:53.839 
there you go guys that's the power up
modes<00:04:52.680> from<00:04:52.919> Franco<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.400> hope<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.699> guys

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
modes from Franco I hope you guys

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.319 
modes from Franco I hope you guys
enjoyed<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.389> peace<00:04:55.110> out
