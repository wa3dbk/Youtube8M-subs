00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.929
 hi I have all the game spaces I am 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.629
 Dr. White we are here today with a video 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.580
 dedicated to pippo 14 latest team ho 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.160
 decided to bring them in fact the news that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 emerged from the transart conference 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 in background colonies you can see the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.439
 trailer of the one that was bigger 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.000
 news in my opinion that it was 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.980
 announced or the presence of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.300
 historic footballers within fig 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.919
 14 last t 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.020
 after many years in which the community 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.520
 he was clamoring for the addition of these 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.379
 legends to revive the mode a little 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.660
 users to use their players 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.760
 favorite of the past than in the time i 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 high trans decided to add them in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.990
 this mode 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.730
 exclusive xbox 360 xbox must therefore 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.160
 playstation users at least for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.380
 the edition of pippa 14 will not be able to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.300
 see of these legends legends that 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.649
 now we're going to see people do 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 will find gold packets like i 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.370
 normal players here you can see them 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.770
 all 40 lots of Italian players 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 historians these legends do not have a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.549
 membership club for now is from 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.340
 still study well how it will work with 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.170
 the chemistry and how it will work with the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.820
 their value because it hasn't been yet 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 defined as they will be more than 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.560
 90 will not have a value then again 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 enough to study though we notice 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 lots of old van basten players 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 maldini pelÃ¨ then in my opinion there 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 we will have a lot of fun to take advantage of these 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
 players who made the history of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.369
 world soccer and many to four 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.930
 Italian soccer stars 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.940
 another really interesting addition e 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.799
 little publicized and the addition of new ones 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.780
 fed modules we begin to see them 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.979
 someone we have a new version of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 4 1 2 1 2 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 this time without exteriors but with two 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.390
 central midfielders those of trips 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 goodbye to and ds who post two 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.080
 central midfielders 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.090
 then we have a 4 1 4 1 new addition 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.670
 this way but it's very nice to me 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.580
 opinion in fact to a cdc in front of defense 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.869
 therefore to make shield 2 cc and two external to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.610
 my opinion will be a very module 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.509
 used line because it really is really 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.360
 strong 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.400
 seeing it so then we have a 4 2 3 1 the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.890
 finally added after years 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.649
 and years you can use the 4 2 3 1 as in 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.560
 head-to-head seasons the 2 external co cs 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.180
 in fact make way for a s is a and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.700
 so finally you can take advantage 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.410
 ronaldo ribery and robben in theirs 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.530
 positions in which they play in reality 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.810
 then we pass to the 43 many variations 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.750
 in this way this version more 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.670
 defensive we find two cd c is a single cc 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.380
 this will be a very defensive form 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.840
 my opinion suitable for those who love the game 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.550
 on the break while we have 4 3 3 more 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.980
 offensive in this case where there are 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.930
 two cc is a cerci this module is 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 really strong in use quite often 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.500
 in head-to-head seasons especially with 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 Brazil is really strong 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.680
 this will be the most used modules 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.860
 by far in my opinion 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.709
 then we find a 4 3 3 with false 9 this 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.629
 it will be a lot because it loves tips like 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.069
 put aguero who do not have the physical for 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.230
 defend it pd shovels to the tyrant 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.209
 slightly further back data also 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.879
 this will be a widely used module 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.790
 other 4 3 3 this time with a median 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.709
 only in front of the defense with 2 cc ready 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.940
 to several forward this may be 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.830
 very useful for an Italian team 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 we can put for example the de rossi 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.849
 cdc and a marchisio vidal to do from 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.349
 incursori also this will be a module 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.810
 really nice to try 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.120
 we find 442 really festive 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.250
 in fact two cc's became cdc per 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.290
 practically form a 6 in line 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.930
 defense if we work well with the workers 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.459
 we can really create a wall 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.540
 very difficult to pass for the 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.239
 Opposing team 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.040
 we close with a basic 4 5 1 4 5 1 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.950
 the two are very offensive this time 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.040
 transform them into cc then one 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.230
 enough midfield line 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.310
 reinforced and therefore less exposed to 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.720
 opponent counter-attacks 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.250
 we also remember that I am no longer 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.260
 form cards so one will be free of 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.930
 various of the modules you prefer 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.489
 finally to consume them limited then 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.200
 there are no more problems to discard i 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 contracts when we might have 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.040
 packages we have the consumption pyre 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.840
 it happens in full addition to this 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.370
 once performance a novelty that 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.709
 it concerns more perhaps careerists and who 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.720
 uses a lot of seasons and the addition of the two 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.819
 changed completely fired on 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.830
 the Chilean championship this soon 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.480
 probably used but what 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.030
 really matters the Argentine championship 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.879
 now completely fired new 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.530
 fifa 14 so they will be really da 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.849
 try this team for today too 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.400
 we concluded if you liked it 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.320
 left 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.509
 a comment excluded from cannes us there 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.970
 we will soon see a 13 tip video 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.900
 points in sight of the 14 unfortunately is not 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.500
 still out 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.500
 Hi everyone
