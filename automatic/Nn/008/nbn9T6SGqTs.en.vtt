00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
easily slide off as you can see here

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.039 
easily slide off as you can see here
should've<00:02:22.239> left<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.569> little<00:02:22.599> bit<00:02:22.840> longer

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
should've left it a little bit longer

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.729 
should've left it a little bit longer
but<00:02:23.769> hey<00:02:24.040> ah<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.540> look<00:02:25.720> pretty<00:02:28.739> you

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
but hey ah this is that look pretty you

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.530 
but hey ah this is that look pretty you
use<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> dotting<00:02:30.280> tool<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.549> help<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.269> get<00:02:31.420> it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
use a dotting tool to help and get it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.009 
use a dotting tool to help and get it
off

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
off

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.750 
off
but<00:02:32.170> when<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.829> is<00:02:32.920> work<00:02:33.160> just<00:02:33.579> use<00:02:33.730> your

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
but when that this is work just use your

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.220 
but when that this is work just use your
nail<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.329> know<00:02:34.480> whatever<00:02:35.140> works<00:02:35.440> right<00:02:37.230> so

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
nail you know whatever works right so

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.360 
nail you know whatever works right so
once<00:02:38.380> you're<00:02:38.500> done<00:02:38.530> cleaning<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:39.069> site<00:02:39.220> you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
once you're done cleaning the site you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.129 
once you're done cleaning the site you
can<00:02:39.489> grab<00:02:39.639> your<00:02:39.670> brush<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.420> brush<00:02:40.870> away<00:02:40.900> any

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:41.139 
can grab your brush and brush away any

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.410 
can grab your brush and brush away any
air<00:02:41.620> bubbles<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.220> might<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.549> there<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.180> it's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
air bubbles that might be there so it's

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.550 
air bubbles that might be there so it's
totally<00:02:43.750> flat<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.650> per<00:02:44.950> day

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.030 

so<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.860> down<00:02:50.100> nine<00:02:50.940> more<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.210> go

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
so one down nine more to go

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.010 
so one down nine more to go
you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.640> do<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.850> same<00:02:54.030> for<00:02:54.090> every

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
you can go and do the same for every

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.950 
you can go and do the same for every
other<00:02:55.200> nail<00:02:55.700> one<00:02:56.700> tip<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.240> use<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:57.930> know

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
other nail one tip you can use you know

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.930 
other nail one tip you can use you know
instead<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.380> using<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.860> clear<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.250> base<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.790> can

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
instead of using a clear of base you can

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.360 
instead of using a clear of base you can
always<00:03:00.120> use<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.630> white<00:03:01.110> base<00:03:01.140> or<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.680> cream<00:03:02.160> base

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
always use a white base or a cream base

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.470 
always use a white base or a cream base
but<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.210> don't<00:03:03.840> really<00:03:04.110> like<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.530> white<00:03:05.370> no<00:03:05.670> or

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
but I don't really like the white no or

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.940 
but I don't really like the white no or
this<00:03:06.630> design<00:03:06.960> because<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.500> want<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> little<00:03:07.830> bit

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
this design because I want a little bit

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.530 
this design because I want a little bit
more<00:03:08.190> subtle<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> went<00:03:09.360> with<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.540> clear<00:03:09.750> base

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
more subtle so I went with a clear base

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.940 
more subtle so I went with a clear base
if<00:03:12.540> they're<00:03:12.720> not<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> perfectionist<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.830> we

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
if they're not a perfectionist that we

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.980 
if they're not a perfectionist that we
need<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.280> matter<00:03:14.490> if<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.090> make<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> mess<00:03:15.960> of

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
need of a matter if you make a mess of
