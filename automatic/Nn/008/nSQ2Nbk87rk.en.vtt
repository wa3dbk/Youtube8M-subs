00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
Starcraft a lot in this review because

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.790 
Starcraft a lot in this review because
that<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:38.969> much<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
that is pretty much what it is

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.280 
that is pretty much what it is
but<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.910> action<00:00:42.420> TV<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.020> where

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
but there is the action TV this is where

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.779 
but there is the action TV this is where
you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.739> view<00:00:43.950> your<00:00:44.010> replays<00:00:44.460> which<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
you can view your replays which is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.040 
you can view your replays which is
definitely<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.120> nice<00:00:45.270> feature<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.780> won't<00:00:45.989> be

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
definitely a nice feature I won't be

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
definitely a nice feature I won't be

player so I'm gonna be playing as a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.200 
player so I'm gonna be playing as a
myriad<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.229> redcoat<00:01:43.500> looks<00:01:43.890> cool<00:01:44.100> um<00:01:44.880> so

myriad not like redcoat looks cool um so
we're<00:01:45.329> gonna<00:01:45.540> play<00:01:45.750> against<00:01:46.640> let's<00:01:47.640> play

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we're gonna play against let's play

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.749 
we're gonna play against let's play
against<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.750> wardens<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:50.430> look<00:01:50.579> cool

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.389 
against the wardens and they look cool
in<00:01:50.909> blue<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.450> we'll<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.720> ahead<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.049> this

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
in blue so we'll go ahead and do this

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.730 
in blue so we'll go ahead and do this
okay<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.390> begin<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.840> let<00:01:55.020> me<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.290> get

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
okay so to begin with let me just get

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.560 
okay so to begin with let me just get
this<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.340> quickly<00:01:56.610> here<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.420> get

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
this going really quickly here just get

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.219 
this going really quickly here just get
them<00:01:57.689> over<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:59.009> way<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.549> work<00:01:59.579> is

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
them over here the way this will work is

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
them over here the way this will work is
go<00:02:01.229> ahead<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.409> select<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.130> guy<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.520> will

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
go ahead and select this guy I will

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.130 
go ahead and select this guy I will
create<00:02:03.659> some<00:02:03.930> gas<00:02:05.000> plate<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
create some gas plate right here but the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.719 
create some gas plate right here but the
way<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.350> works<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.280> StarCraft

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
way this works is just like in StarCraft

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.669 
way this works is just like in StarCraft
do<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.149> three<00:02:09.539> major<00:02:09.750> resources<00:02:10.470> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
do you have three major resources you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.040 
do you have three major resources you
have

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
have

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.420 
have
you<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.230> money<00:02:13.770> which<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.160> basically

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you have money which is basically

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.270 
you have money which is basically
minerals<00:02:14.850> which<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.300> from<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:16.280> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
minerals which you get from this you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.950 
minerals which you get from this you
have<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> build<00:02:17.850> buildings<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.420> top<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
have to build buildings on top of the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.410 
have to build buildings on top of the
minerals<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> resources<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.300> not

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
minerals and the resources but it's not

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.160 
minerals and the resources but it's not
a<00:02:21.450> huge<00:02:21.750> deal

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
a huge deal

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.530 
a huge deal
you<00:02:22.830> also<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.280> energy<00:02:23.790> which<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.150> basically

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
you also have energy which is basically

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.110 
you also have energy which is basically
like<00:02:24.750> gas<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.440> supply<00:02:25.860> which<00:02:26.850> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
like gas and you have supply which is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.699 
like gas and you have supply which is
you<00:02:27.510> know<00:02:27.600> supply<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.440> how<00:02:28.530> many

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
you know supply it's just how many

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.530 
you know supply it's just how many
unions<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.670> we'll<00:02:29.850> send<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
unions you can have so we'll send this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.260 
unions you can have so we'll send this
over<00:02:30.720> here<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:32.459> create<00:02:32.700> more<00:02:32.850> grubs<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
over here and create more grubs the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.190 
over here and create more grubs the
grubs<00:02:33.510> are<00:02:33.870> your<00:02:34.440> drones<00:02:34.980> for<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.459> most<00:02:35.640> part

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
grubs are your drones for the most part

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
grubs are your drones for the most part
we'll<00:02:37.200> set<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> riot<00:02:37.620> point<00:02:37.920> over<00:02:38.250> inside<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
we'll set a riot point over inside the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.380 
we'll set a riot point over inside the
building<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.100> yeah<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.490> very<00:02:41.700> similar<00:02:41.940> in

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
building so yeah it's very similar in

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.580 
building so yeah it's very similar in
fact<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.810> see<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.050> little<00:02:43.230> worm

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
fact you can see that little worm

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.310 
fact you can see that little worm
looking<00:02:43.920> thing<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.370> our<00:02:44.730> drone<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.720> our<00:02:45.930> grub

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
looking thing is our drone or our grub

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.050 
looking thing is our drone or our grub
and<00:02:47.130> that's<00:02:47.310> pretty<00:02:47.610> much<00:02:47.670> our<00:02:47.790> workhorse

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and that's pretty much our workhorse

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.670 
and that's pretty much our workhorse
it's<00:02:48.360> gonna<00:02:48.510> allow<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.080> ahead<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.440> get

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
it's gonna allow you to go ahead and get

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.590 
it's gonna allow you to go ahead and get
units<00:02:50.550> it's<00:02:50.790> gonna<00:02:50.910> allow<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.300> get

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
units it's gonna allow you to get

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.690 
units it's gonna allow you to get
buildings<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.770> of<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.430> stuff<00:02:53.670> so

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
take a look at the various different

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.910 
take a look at the various different
bases<00:03:06.090> all<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.270> way<00:03:06.360> around<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> map<00:03:06.920> you

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
bases all the way around the map you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.530 
bases all the way around the map you
know<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.310> works<00:03:08.489> decently<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.000> would<00:03:09.150> prefer<00:03:09.270> if

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
know it works decently I would prefer if

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.940 
know it works decently I would prefer if
there<00:03:09.660> was<00:03:09.750> actually<00:03:09.870> uh<00:03:10.080> well<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.830> was<00:03:10.920> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
there was actually uh well if it was a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.290 
there was actually uh well if it was a
little<00:03:11.040> bit<00:03:11.190> bigger<00:03:11.370> because<00:03:11.640> obviously<00:03:11.790> your

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
little bit bigger because obviously your

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.610 
little bit bigger because obviously your
finger<00:03:12.690> pretty<00:03:12.870> much<00:03:12.989> covers<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.440> whole

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
finger pretty much covers the whole

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.199 
finger pretty much covers the whole
thing<00:03:13.830> but<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.550> functional<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.060> works

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
thing but it is functional it works

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.780 
thing but it is functional it works
pretty<00:03:15.330> decently<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:16.769> also<00:03:16.890> do<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.340> list

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
pretty decently you also do have a list

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.090 
pretty decently you also do have a list
of<00:03:18.060> things<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:19.470> example<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.860> is<00:03:19.920> our

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
of things so for example this is our

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.949 
of things so for example this is our
main<00:03:20.310> building<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.820> can<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.239> here<00:03:21.269> create

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
main building we can go in here create

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.960 
main building we can go in here create
grubs<00:03:22.290> or<00:03:22.709> different<00:03:23.459> buildings<00:03:23.730> allow<00:03:23.910> you

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
grubs or different buildings allow you

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.670 
grubs or different buildings allow you
to<00:03:24.120> build<00:03:24.299> different<00:03:24.480> things<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.500> should

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
to build different things and should

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.190 
to build different things and should
let's<00:03:25.890> create<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.820> lower<00:03:27.209> nominally<00:03:27.840> quickly

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
let's create a lower nominally quickly

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.350 
let's create a lower nominally quickly
here<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.769> low<00:03:29.340> or<00:03:29.459> not<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.790> what<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.120> use

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
here this is low or not is what you use

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.410 
here this is low or not is what you use
to<00:03:30.630> create<00:03:31.190> units<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.640> for<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.299> most

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
to create units this is for the most

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.300 
to create units this is for the most
part<00:03:33.720> you're<00:03:33.870> spawning<00:03:34.200> pool<00:03:34.560> from<00:03:34.920> Starcraft

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
part you're spawning pool from Starcraft

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.600 
part you're spawning pool from Starcraft
so<00:03:36.200> letting<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.290> making<00:03:37.680> grubs<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.310> because

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
so letting you making grubs just because

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.720 
so letting you making grubs just because
you<00:03:38.970> that's<00:03:39.540> basically<00:03:39.870> your<00:03:40.019> lifeblood<00:03:40.730> if

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
you that's basically your lifeblood if

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.539 
you that's basically your lifeblood if
you're<00:03:41.940> not<00:03:42.090> creating<00:03:42.329> grubs<00:03:42.810> you're<00:03:43.769> you're

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
you're not creating grubs you're you're

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.130 
you're not creating grubs you're you're
gonna<00:03:44.760> need<00:03:44.910> more<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.299> them<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.989> make

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
gonna need more of them just to make

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.640 
gonna need more of them just to make
buildings<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.829> etc<00:03:47.070> etc<00:03:47.630> anyway<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.140> that's

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
buildings and etc etc anyway so that's

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.890 
buildings and etc etc anyway so that's
about<00:03:49.829> it<00:03:50.070> for<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.610> basics<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.600> build

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
about it for the basics you build

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.840 
about it for the basics you build
various<00:03:52.470> different<00:03:52.890> buildings<00:03:53.370> which<00:03:53.579> allows

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
various different buildings which allows

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.060 
various different buildings which allows
you<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.180> get<00:03:54.299> units<00:03:54.890> something<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:55.950> can

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
you to get units something you can

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.560 
you to get units something you can
upgrade<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.549> units<00:03:56.880> all<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.180> kind<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.450> stuff

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
upgrade the units all that kind of stuff

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.530 
upgrade the units all that kind of stuff
I<00:03:57.840> want<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.049> get<00:03:58.140> too<00:03:58.410> technical<00:03:59.040> into<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.730> but

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
I want to get too technical into it but

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
I want to get too technical into it but
suffice<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.019> say<00:04:01.079> if<00:04:01.230> you've<00:04:01.350> ever<00:04:01.470> played

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
suffice it to say if you've ever played

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.650 
suffice it to say if you've ever played
Starcraft<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.700> going<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.940> feel<00:04:03.209> right<00:04:03.510> at

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
Starcraft this is going to feel right at

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.110 
Starcraft this is going to feel right at
home<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.769> here's<00:04:04.950> our<00:04:05.070> first<00:04:05.280> building<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.940> we

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
home so here's our first building and we

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.580 
home so here's our first building and we
can<00:04:06.239> build<00:04:06.480> two<00:04:06.750> units<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.200> can<00:04:07.230> build<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
can build two units we can build the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.009 
can build two units we can build the
Mangler<00:04:07.980> which<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.400> pretty<00:04:09.060> much<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.450> zergling

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
Mangler which is pretty much a zergling

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.350 
Mangler which is pretty much a zergling
we<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.739> build<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.310> venom<00:04:11.610> slinger<00:04:12.030> which<00:04:12.209> is

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
we can build a venom slinger which is

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.910 
we can build a venom slinger which is
pretty<00:04:12.690> similar<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.140> hydra<00:04:13.500> list<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:13.829> let's

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
pretty similar to a hydra list so let's

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.729 
pretty similar to a hydra list so let's
build<00:04:14.130> one<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.760> each<00:04:14.959> set<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:15.989> rally<00:04:16.380> point

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
build one of each set a rally point

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.550 
build one of each set a rally point
right<00:04:16.950> over<00:04:16.979> here<00:04:17.390> our<00:04:18.390> workers<00:04:18.959> are<00:04:19.079> idle<00:04:19.350> so

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
right over here our workers are idle so

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.850 
right over here our workers are idle so
let's<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:21.780> we'll<00:04:22.200> just<00:04:22.380> leave<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.710> alone

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
let's and we'll just leave it alone

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.440 
let's and we'll just leave it alone
right<00:04:23.190> now<00:04:23.220> but<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.880> course<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.210> need<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
right now but of course you need to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.400 
right now but of course you need to
build<00:04:24.630> more

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
build more

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
build more
was<00:04:25.980> called<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.400> mega<00:04:26.670> mite<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.300> bloat<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:29.250> get

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
was called a mega mite and bloat to get

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.030 
was called a mega mite and bloat to get
more<00:04:29.610> energy<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.150> more<00:04:30.420> gas<00:04:30.690> for<00:04:31.170> your<00:04:31.770> more

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
more energy and more gas for your more

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.730 
more energy and more gas for your more
energy<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.670> more<00:04:32.970> crystals<00:04:33.720> for<00:04:34.110> your<00:04:34.290> army

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
energy and more crystals for your army

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.620 
energy and more crystals for your army
so<00:04:34.890> anyway<00:04:35.460> guys<00:04:35.640> I'll<00:04:35.820> go<00:04:36.030> ahead<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.420> cut

here I'm gonna skip ahead and show you
guys<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.790> little<00:04:39.030> bit<00:04:39.120> of<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.360> there<00:04:39.900> we<00:04:40.020> gots

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
guys a little bit of the there we gots

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.910 
guys a little bit of the there we gots
perfect<00:04:40.500> actually

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
perfect actually

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.790 
perfect actually
there's<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.400> scouting<00:04:42.200> little<00:04:43.200> probe<00:04:43.500> or

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
there's a scouting little probe or

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.070 
there's a scouting little probe or
worker<00:04:43.980> in<00:04:44.250> our<00:04:44.340> base<00:04:44.550> but<00:04:44.820> just<00:04:45.570> perfect<00:04:45.960> time

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
worker in our base but just perfect time

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.900 
worker in our base but just perfect time
we've<00:04:46.320> got<00:04:46.440> our<00:04:46.560> units<00:04:47.010> out<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.370> stop<00:04:47.610> it

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
we've got our units out to stop it

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.760 
we've got our units out to stop it
okay<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:48.390> I've<00:04:48.660> built<00:04:48.810> up<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.110> bit<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.350> an<00:04:49.440> army

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
okay so I've built up a bit of an army

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.500 
okay so I've built up a bit of an army
here<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.370> pretty<00:04:50.610> much<00:04:50.700> basically<00:04:51.240> load<00:04:51.390> to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
here just pretty much basically load to

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.780 
here just pretty much basically load to
your<00:04:51.630> units<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.080> for<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:52.770> match<00:04:53.100> that's<00:04:53.490> not

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
your units but for this match that's not

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.620 
your units but for this match that's not
gonna<00:04:53.970> be<00:04:54.120> an<00:04:54.210> issue

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
gonna be an issue

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.710 
gonna be an issue
so<00:04:55.320> as<00:04:55.380> you<00:04:55.470> can<00:04:55.560> see<00:04:55.620> here<00:04:56.480> it's<00:04:57.480> kind<00:04:57.660> of

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
so as you can see here it's kind of

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.900 
so as you can see here it's kind of
attacking<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.380> base<00:04:58.560> on<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.640> easy

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
attacking the base on this easy

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.400 
attacking the base on this easy
difficulty<00:05:00.420> it's<00:05:00.540> pretty<00:05:00.750> simple<00:05:01.020> just<00:05:01.110> sit

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
difficulty it's pretty simple just sit

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.080 
difficulty it's pretty simple just sit
back<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.590> build<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:01.980> base<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.790> know<00:05:02.850> just

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
back and build a base and you know just

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.390 
back and build a base and you know just
win<00:05:03.360> it's<00:05:03.600> it's<00:05:03.840> not<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.260> difficult<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:05.280> can

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400
