00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
occasions come around and we have many

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.509 
occasions come around and we have many
different<00:00:06.569> types<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.770> plants<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.309> shop

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
different types of plants in the shop

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.759 
different types of plants in the shop
like<00:00:08.730> these<00:00:08.880> little<00:00:09.179> mini<00:00:10.110> Adam<00:00:10.530> and

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
like these little mini Adam and

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.970 
like these little mini Adam and
thorium's<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.570> dare<00:00:13.049> say<00:00:13.080> we've<00:00:13.469> all<00:00:13.650> got

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
thorium's and I dare say we've all got

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.620 
thorium's and I dare say we've all got
the<00:00:14.219> craft<00:00:14.490> bags<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.000> they<00:00:15.059> come<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.389> three

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the craft bags and they come in three

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.930 
the craft bags and they come in three
different<00:00:15.660> sizes<00:00:16.100> so<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.250> actually<00:00:17.520> use

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
different sizes so you can actually use

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
different sizes so you can actually use
these<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.510> utilize<00:00:18.990> them<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.320> many<00:00:19.470> different

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
these and utilize them in many different

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.359 
these and utilize them in many different
ways<00:00:20.160> obviously<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.740> take<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.160> bag

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
ways obviously we can just take the bag

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.790 
ways obviously we can just take the bag
and<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.269> open<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.660> put<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> piece<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and we can open it put a piece of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
and we can open it put a piece of
cellophane<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.279> drop<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> plant<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.320> we

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
cellophane and drop the plant in but we

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.750 
cellophane and drop the plant in but we
want<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.130> look<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.400> little<00:00:29.550> bit

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
want to make it look a little bit

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.209 
want to make it look a little bit
different<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.390> interesting<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.260> really

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
different and interesting and really

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.590 
different and interesting and really
give<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> more<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.700> an<00:00:32.880> impulse<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
give it more of an impulse to the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.880 
give it more of an impulse to the
customer<00:00:33.989> when<00:00:34.140> they<00:00:34.260> come<00:00:34.469> through<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.770> shop

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
customer when they come through the shop

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.690 
customer when they come through the shop
door<00:00:36.020> here<00:00:37.020> we've<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> largest<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
door here we've got the largest of the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.750 
door here we've got the largest of the
craft<00:00:38.940> bags<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.809> creamy<00:00:40.079> color<00:00:40.760> and

craft bags it's a creamy color and
obviously<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.600> quite<00:00:42.930> flimsy<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
obviously it is quite flimsy at the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.990 
obviously it is quite flimsy at the
moment<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.489> want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> sort<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
moment and we really want to sort of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
moment and we really want to sort of
create<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.750> extra<00:00:46.079> impact<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
create that extra impact for the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.130

customer to buy when they're in the shop

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.000 
customer to buy when they're in the shop
so<00:00:49.770> what<00:00:50.370> we've<00:00:50.579> done<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.809> have

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
so what we've done here is we all have

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.939 
so what we've done here is we all have
excess<00:00:53.010> zebra<00:00:53.670> boxes<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.440> cardboard<00:00:55.440> boxes

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
excess zebra boxes or cardboard boxes

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
excess zebra boxes or cardboard boxes
and<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.910> we've<00:00:57.180> done<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> actually<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and what we've done this is actually the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.779 
and what we've done this is actually the
perfect<00:00:58.859> size<00:00:59.489> for<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.500> bag<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.340> we've<00:01:02.489> cut

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
perfect size for the bag so we've cut

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
perfect size for the bag so we've cut
the<00:01:03.030> box<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> normally<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.350> two

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the box we're going to normally get two

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.100 
the box we're going to normally get two
sections<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.909> we've<00:01:06.330> kept<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> bottom

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
sections out and we've kept the bottom

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.850 
sections out and we've kept the bottom
part<00:01:07.409> which<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.400> gently<00:01:09.330> open

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
part which we can then just gently open

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.530 
part which we can then just gently open
so<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> would<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.159> sit<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> box<00:01:12.240> just

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so it would actually sit in the box just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.100 
so it would actually sit in the box just
like<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:14.150> framework<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.840> really

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
like a little and framework so it really

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.140 
like a little and framework so it really
makes<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.560> easier<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.340> obviously<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
makes it easier but obviously at the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.810 
makes it easier but obviously at the
moment<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.810> quite<00:01:19.049> unsightly<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.070> what

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
moment this is quite unsightly so what

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.539 
moment this is quite unsightly so what
we<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.119> do<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:22.290> would<00:01:22.320> decide<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.310> take

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we would do is we would decide to take

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.350 
we would do is we would decide to take
say<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.390> piece<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> metallic<00:01:25.950> paper<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
say a piece of the metallic paper and we

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
say a piece of the metallic paper and we
want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:31.100> cut

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.070 

the<00:01:36.380> metallic<00:01:36.799> papers<00:01:37.250> just<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.700> fit<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
the metallic papers just to fit in the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.130 
the metallic papers just to fit in the
back<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.009> this<00:01:40.159> is<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.549> giving<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:41.140> background

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
back so this is just giving a background

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.429 
back so this is just giving a background
and<00:01:42.939> makes<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.119> look<00:01:44.299> cleaner<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.080> neatly

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
and makes it look cleaner and neatly

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.730 
and makes it look cleaner and neatly
finished<00:01:48.549> so<00:01:49.549> we<00:01:49.700> just<00:01:49.880> add<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.149> little<00:01:50.330> bit<00:01:50.509> of

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
finished so we just add a little bit of

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:59.279 
finished so we just add a little bit of
tape<00:01:51.740> at<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.009> top<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.789> hold<00:01:53.530> in<00:01:54.530> place

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.120 

this<00:02:00.289> can<00:02:00.560> then<00:02:00.970> be<00:02:01.970> placed<00:02:02.270> inside<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.890> craft

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
this can then be placed inside the craft

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:14.080 
this can then be placed inside the craft
bag<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.720> open<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.320> craft<00:02:06.590> bag<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.700> slide

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
bag so we open the craft bag and slide

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.479 
bag so we open the craft bag and slide
in<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:15.410> will<00:02:15.590> actually<00:02:15.739> sit<00:02:16.160> quite

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
in and that will actually sit quite

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.870 
in and that will actually sit quite
nicely<00:02:16.760> into<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.870> bag<00:02:18.019> itself<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.670> we've

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
nicely into the bag itself so we've

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.960 
nicely into the bag itself so we've
actually<00:02:20.150> got<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.110> wooden<00:02:21.920> section<00:02:22.549> placed

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
actually got the wooden section placed

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.240 
actually got the wooden section placed
and<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.480> will<00:02:23.690> give<00:02:23.900> us<00:02:23.930> strength<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.739> we

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
and this will give us strength and we

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.190 
and this will give us strength and we
can<00:02:25.430> then<00:02:25.610> just<00:02:25.880> fasten<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:29.209> bag<00:02:29.390> together

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.850 

across<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.500> top<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:35.030> will<00:02:35.269> hold<00:02:35.860> everything

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
across the top this will hold everything

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.530 
across the top this will hold everything
in<00:02:37.130> place

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.849 

so<00:02:44.540> we've<00:02:44.690> fastened<00:02:45.140> across<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.590> top<00:02:45.829> here

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
so we've fastened across the top here

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.569 
so we've fastened across the top here
and<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.880> now<00:02:47.150> gives<00:02:47.720> us<00:02:47.870> quite<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.620> sturdy

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
and this now gives us quite a sturdy

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.930 
and this now gives us quite a sturdy
feel<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.690> bag<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.680> obviously<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.640> want<00:02:52.820> to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
feel to the bag but obviously we want to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.319 
feel to the bag but obviously we want to
use<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.390> plan<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.640> what<00:02:55.640> we're<00:02:55.820> going<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.060> do

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
use the plan so what we're going to do

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.849 
use the plan so what we're going to do
is<00:02:56.630> measure<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:58.269> height<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.660> container

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
is measure the height of the container

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.430 
is measure the height of the container
and<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:02.359> height<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.810> container<00:03:03.170> will

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
and the height of the container will

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.130 
and the height of the container will
give<00:03:03.650> me<00:03:03.890> where<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.670> need<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.060> just<00:03:05.900> make<00:03:06.109> a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
give me where I need to just make a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.170 
give me where I need to just make a
small<00:03:06.670> slit<00:03:07.690> into<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> front<00:03:09.049> of<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.260> bag<00:03:09.440> and

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
small slit into the front of the bag and

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:22.160 
small slit into the front of the bag and
then<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.390> can<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.410> take<00:03:12.709> this<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:16.579> I<00:03:17.030> can

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:33.300 

cut<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:24.180> section<00:03:25.180> out<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:32.200> front<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.220> the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
cut a section out of the front of the

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.670 
cut a section out of the front of the
bag<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.620> this<00:03:35.740> is<00:03:35.950> sort<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.280> creating<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.910> little

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
bag so this is sort of creating a little

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.640 
bag so this is sort of creating a little
window<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:40.390> center<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.990> as<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:41.230> can<00:03:41.380> see

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
window in the center and as you can see

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.590 
window in the center and as you can see
we've<00:03:42.340> already<00:03:42.520> got<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:42.910> pink<00:03:43.330> background

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
we've already got that pink background

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.360 
we've already got that pink background
which<00:03:44.410> will<00:03:44.620> give<00:03:44.770> a<00:03:44.800> connection<00:03:45.460> to<00:03:47.370> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
which will give a connection to the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.880 
which will give a connection to the
plant<00:03:48.930> obviously<00:03:49.930> we<00:03:50.050> still<00:03:50.260> need<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.680> finish

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
plant obviously we still need to finish

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.420 
plant obviously we still need to finish
off<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.430> plant<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.360> again<00:03:53.050> taking<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:56.430> smaller

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
off the plant so again taking a smaller

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.260 
off the plant so again taking a smaller
piece<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.920> same<00:04:00.130> paper<00:04:00.610> which<00:04:01.030> we're

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
piece of the same paper which we're

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:09.570 
piece of the same paper which we're
going<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.600> cut<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.530> half<00:04:07.890> so<00:04:08.890> we've<00:04:09.040> got<00:04:09.220> a

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
going to cut in half so we've got a

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.180 
going to cut in half so we've got a
small<00:04:10.210> piece<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.810> metallic<00:04:11.680> paper<00:04:11.890> which

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
small piece of the metallic paper which

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.490 
small piece of the metallic paper which
we've<00:04:12.400> cut<00:04:12.730> in<00:04:13.090> half<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:13.870> actually<00:04:14.320> then

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
we've cut in half and actually then

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.580 
we've cut in half and actually then
created<00:04:15.070> this<00:04:15.280> star<00:04:16.150> effect<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:17.350> will

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
created this star effect and this will

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.120 
created this star effect and this will
then<00:04:17.739> just<00:04:18.180> go<00:04:19.180> nicely<00:04:19.480> around<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.470> base<00:04:20.680> of

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
then just go nicely around the base of

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.000 
then just go nicely around the base of
the<00:04:21.640> plants<00:04:24.270> again<00:04:25.270> just<00:04:25.840> catching<00:04:26.500> just

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
the plants again just catching just

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.910 
the plants again just catching just
above<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.240> if<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.230> decide<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.650> you

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
above so that if you decide that you

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.160 
above so that if you decide that you
want<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:30.190> water<00:04:30.490> this<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:31.090> can<00:04:31.300> still<00:04:31.600> water

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
want to water this you can still water

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.100 
want to water this you can still water
it<00:04:32.530> quite<00:04:32.860> easily<00:04:35.850> but<00:04:36.850> this<00:04:37.000> still<00:04:37.540> allows<00:04:37.810> me

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
it quite easily but this still allows me

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.020 
it quite easily but this still allows me
then<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.320> just<00:04:39.150> open<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.860> little<00:04:42.160> plant

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
then to just open the little plant

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.360 
then to just open the little plant
slightly<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.440> so<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.770> makes<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.280> little

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
slightly just so it makes it a little

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:55.230 
slightly just so it makes it a little
bit<00:04:45.580> more<00:04:45.730> freely<00:04:52.170> and<00:04:53.640> then<00:04:54.640> using<00:04:55.060> just

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
bit more freely and then using just

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.730 
bit more freely and then using just
small<00:04:55.660> amount<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.290> this<00:04:57.220> lavender<00:04:57.930> oil

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:23.689 

I<00:05:06.470> can<00:05:07.470> then<00:05:07.590> fasten<00:05:08.099> on<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:09.210> center<00:05:09.660> here<00:05:22.699> and

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
I can then fasten on the center here and

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.050 
I can then fasten on the center here and
because<00:05:24.389> we've<00:05:24.599> already<00:05:25.199> made<00:05:25.889> that<00:05:26.220> right

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
because we've already made that right

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.080 
because we've already made that right
sort<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.630> depth<00:05:28.069> this<00:05:29.069> will<00:05:29.310> allow<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:29.639> them

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
sort of depth this will allow you them

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:46.370 
sort of depth this will allow you them
to<00:05:30.360> sit<00:05:30.800> your<00:05:31.800> plant<00:05:32.160> in<00:05:32.430> place<00:05:45.139> I've<00:05:46.139> just

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
to sit your plant in place I've just

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:58.180 
to sit your plant in place I've just
made<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.590> very<00:05:46.860> simple<00:05:49.639> looped<00:05:50.639> bow<00:05:51.120> here

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.910 

and<00:05:58.700> I'm<00:05:58.880> just<00:05:59.000> taking<00:05:59.210> off<00:05:59.540> that<00:06:00.970> excess

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
and I'm just taking off that excess

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.600 
and I'm just taking off that excess
again<00:06:03.920> we<00:06:04.700> can<00:06:04.880> then<00:06:05.030> just<00:06:05.330> add<00:06:05.570> to<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.170> top<00:06:09.610> so

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
again we can then just add to the top so

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.190 
again we can then just add to the top so
we<00:06:10.730> can<00:06:10.760> then<00:06:11.060> just<00:06:11.270> place<00:06:11.450> a<00:06:11.480> little<00:06:11.690> bell<00:06:12.020> on

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
we can then just place a little bell on

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.290 
we can then just place a little bell on
top<00:06:12.470> you<00:06:12.770> can<00:06:12.920> then<00:06:13.130> put<00:06:13.340> your<00:06:13.460> card<00:06:13.730> in<00:06:13.880> but

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
top you can then put your card in but

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.420 
top you can then put your card in but
it's<00:06:14.510> a<00:06:14.570> great<00:06:14.810> way<00:06:15.080> of<00:06:15.500> actually<00:06:15.860> sending<00:06:16.250> out

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
it's a great way of actually sending out
