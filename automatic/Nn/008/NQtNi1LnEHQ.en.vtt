00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.759
 about the last major pocket video 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.500

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.960

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.510
 8 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.309
 This you do not have morale played well for 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.340
 Me to finish the move I do not need 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.160
 have participated in the championship or 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.600
 one of the best players in brazil 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.800
 to have more players if you are 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.240
 within the game rule 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.400
 if you have never used the one you have 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.820
 infinite moral to curse to speak the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.890
 What do you want from hackers that is Edson Oshiro? 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.770
 players me are more inferior 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.460
 despicable of the game they have destroyed 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.200
 our games with is the same faith 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.850
 players directly then any 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.299
 player who did not come here to have moral 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.920
 talk as much as you want of players 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.570
 that the newspaper here so if you do not want 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.649
 see curse with hackers with their 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.690
 radio buddies 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.510
 It's only you that stop being registered 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.820
 channel and do not like the page you 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.610
 Are you going to do anything? 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.260
 think it will be greatly missed me 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.510
 So you can do a good shot of this. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.909
 I just spoke and I will not stop 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.510
 Cursing hacker we have morale to get 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.650
 them to talk about what we want them 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.380
 show with video this is the first 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.780
 bid that sits on the player 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.049
 I'm going back there for you to see that he 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.040
 is holding 60 is well attention well 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.430
 attention on the map a giraffe also together 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.430
 with him 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.290
 Now I'm going to have dinner for the next one. 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.060
 player bid 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.110
 I'll show that bid on two cameras. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.530
 first this here is to see how he 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.530
 accompanies a guy 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.230
 We will now see in first person and not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.239
 You can see the guy in love or he's gone. 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.760
 of the replay even though it accompanies 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.989
 absurd form is by the wall 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.989
 I'm going to jump again here. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.739
 I can not really see through perhaps 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.660
 heard the steps or not but we her 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.769
 began a seven- year visit of the house 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.530
 and hs which is nothing common is we 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.330
 move on to one more bid 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.709
 This is one more move he's going to make. 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.890
 a twist 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.349
 pay attention should not one day 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.880
 You want me to go back again to 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.880
 stop seeing a game again 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.900
 attention today look the map also give 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.120
 super g 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.130
 This is another year and you're having dinner for 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.920
 I think his last move before 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.069
 I want to say something, I want to say something 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.790
 I do not think much good report is 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.400
 in this case because 360 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.109
 it's the same case the site is the one that is the 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.660
 who is a marshal today is the same as that of 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.880
 666 who was the face of the panicat clan 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.299
 appear to have been reported that they have not 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.380
 result because the response of twins 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.310
 who evaluated the replay 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.049
 they say that he is a 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.109
 mouse bug that the sensitivity of the 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.850
 mouse was the answer that the guy daltro 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.500
 of the other two times 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.510
 I still do not know if I'll get much ahead. 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.900
 who want to try to get the report 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.450
 will 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.260
 I'd rather do the video was disclosed 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.739
 for cheating on the page is the video of that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.510
 pac face so more people see to 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.980
 that most people do not play against him 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.870
 funny kiko is imported the dream by 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.790
 example did not work it did not take 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.500
 no carrying of putting foot in the account 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.780
 And my baby and I do not think so. 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.690
 had results that he called the clan of 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.039
 new this is now our replay it 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:35.130
 in which he gives a spin 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:37.919
 I 'll go ahead a little bit I think it's a 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.690
 absurd someone saying that this is a 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.889
 goal milestones and I have less common 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.720
 very good I've seen 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.750
 I already saw how the spin is when the mouse 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.620
 sensitive and is nothing like this 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.840
 here has no place or anything like 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.510
 that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.440
 this spin does not have that way anymore 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.120
 there is a different way 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.639
 the reporter who does not want does not matter 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.889
 because it will remind us to know that 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.400
 did not say that this type of 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.620
 thing, I can now for his account to 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.650
 to continue his clan's page to 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.400
 show that you are aware of a good 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:22.919
 personnel this here is the im page is it 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.750
 is a master of the game field gives a 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.750
 Look at his account he has the custom 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:35.610
 and has four arms pages think 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:40.770
 he has to go fast it's just things 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.889
 pulls even accused have the type then it is 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.490
 tambourine is a game happens starter 306 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.490
 do not fool 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.949
 the leader is the brandÃ£o I entered the no tsb 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.380
 they from here to try to talk to the tac 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.060
 Water, I came here to talk to you. 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.850
 about radio 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.940
 but you have not answered me yet then 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.040
 I can do nothing is like replicating a 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.030
 description who wants to cut what 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.919
 It's a shitty one who will not take a seat. 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.630
 I'll report because I've already hacked the site 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:20.220
 where they said it was the mouse so 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.600
 for this and other reasons it was then 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.169
 This remembers sharing the video for 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:29.520
 more people see when the guy is 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:32.040
 cheetah will play against it is more 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.870
 quick and practical than what to expect 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.580
 in it being banned by sharing the 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.130
 video is best to send the video to the 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.139
 friend of mine a friend clan who does not 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.260
 play open against him I play in the room 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.570
 With it, it 's up to the next one. 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.840
 said thanks for the six minutes of 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.840
 attention
