doesn't<00:00:00.420> matter<00:00:00.510> where<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.840> ball<00:00:00.989> goes<00:00:01.020> this

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
doesn't matter where the ball goes this

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.929 
doesn't matter where the ball goes this
is<00:00:01.770> how<00:00:01.890> you're<00:00:02.100> loading<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.490> shaft<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:02.879> you

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
is how you're loading the shaft how you

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.690 
is how you're loading the shaft how you
delivering<00:00:03.419> it<00:00:03.510> down<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.780> impact<00:00:04.250> so<00:00:05.250> let<00:00:05.640> me

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
delivering it down the impact so let me

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.660 
delivering it down the impact so let me
turn<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.910> on<00:00:06.710> you<00:00:07.710> just<00:00:07.890> hit<00:00:07.950> three<00:00:08.189> balls<00:00:08.220> and

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
turn it on you just hit three balls and

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.060 
turn it on you just hit three balls and
this<00:00:09.330> helps<00:00:09.570> me<00:00:09.660> just<00:00:09.840> dial<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.830> shaft

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this helps me just dial in the shaft

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.730 
this helps me just dial in the shaft
that<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.370> want<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.610> put<00:00:11.730> into<00:00:11.820> our<00:00:11.910> jpx<00:00:12.389> 800<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
that we want to put into our jpx 800 and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.939 
that we want to put into our jpx 800 and
then<00:00:14.040> we'll<00:00:15.080> test<00:00:16.080> your<00:00:16.260> 6-iron<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.859> your

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
then we'll test your 6-iron and your

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.509 
then we'll test your 6-iron and your
5-iron<00:00:17.369> versus<00:00:17.699> our<00:00:17.820> 6-iron<00:00:22.279> hit<00:00:23.279> everything

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
5-iron versus our 6-iron hit everything

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
right think about this being consistent

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.869 
right think about this being consistent
but<00:02:56.530> how<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.709> load<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.189> shaft<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.579> deliver

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
but how you load the shaft and deliver

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.720 
but how you load the shaft and deliver
it<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.060> very<00:02:58.329> consistent
