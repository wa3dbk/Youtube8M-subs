head this is just there to make sure
that<00:01:26.770> belt<00:01:27.039> stays<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.700> also<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:28.840> need<00:01:29.049> to

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
that belt stays on and also you need to

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.440 
that belt stays on and also you need to
take<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.619> tensioner<00:01:30.279> you<00:01:31.029> need<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.299> pull

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
take this tensioner you need to pull

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.029 
take this tensioner you need to pull
this<00:01:31.600> tensioner<00:01:32.079> in<00:01:32.289> you<00:01:32.619> see<00:01:32.829> what<00:01:32.950> it's

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
this tensioner in you see what it's

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.230 
this tensioner in you see what it's
doing<00:01:33.389> it's<00:01:34.389> allowing<00:01:34.779> clearance<00:01:36.029> so<00:01:37.029> by

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
doing it's allowing clearance so by

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.699 
doing it's allowing clearance so by
doing<00:01:37.569> that<00:01:37.719> you're<00:01:37.959> allowing<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.349> clearance

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
doing that you're allowing the clearance

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
for the belt to fit in and now I can put

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.480 
for the belt to fit in and now I can put
the<00:01:41.799> bolt<00:01:42.069> on<00:01:42.249> the<00:01:43.950> thing<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.069> remember<00:01:45.130> is
