all<00:00:46.620> together<00:00:46.829> i<00:00:47.250> don't<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.850> should<00:00:47.969> be

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
all together i don't think it should be

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.310 
all together i don't think it should be
in<00:00:48.149> new<00:00:48.239> york<00:00:48.270> which<00:00:48.660> would<00:00:48.809> maybe<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.200> an

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
in new york which would maybe be an

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.779 
in new york which would maybe be an
advantage<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.860> Coto<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.370> don't<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:50.730> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
advantage to Coto I don't think it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.569 
advantage to Coto I don't think it
should<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.120> LA<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:52.160> Texas<00:00:53.160> because<00:00:53.430> it'd<00:00:53.550> be

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
should be in LA or Texas because it'd be

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
should be in LA or Texas because it'd be
an<00:00:53.730> advantage<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.840> Canelo<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.170> think

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
an advantage for for Canelo I think

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
an advantage for for Canelo I think

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
a shame i think based on what happened

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.810 
a shame i think based on what happened
with<00:02:18.780> may<00:02:18.930> second<00:02:19.440> where<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.220> average<00:02:20.400> fan

if there is an a side in this fight and
it<00:02:56.520> really<00:02:56.700> isn't<00:02:56.940> but<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.390> maybe<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.020> an

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.190 
I think team Canelo and probably golden
boy<00:03:04.860> promotions<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.990> they<00:03:07.080> would

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
boy promotions I think that they would

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.140 
boy promotions I think that they would
want<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.470> test<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.890> waters<00:03:08.310> on<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.610> east

coast<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.780> Canelo<00:03:10.200> i<00:03:10.440> would<00:03:10.620> say<00:03:10.770> i<00:03:10.800> think

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
coast with Canelo i would say i think

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.160 
coast with Canelo i would say i think
that<00:03:11.370> they<00:03:11.460> wouldn't<00:03:11.730> want<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:11.910> test<00:03:12.180> Canelo's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
that they wouldn't want to test Canelo's

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
triple G or David Lemieux but not right

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.320 
triple G or David Lemieux but not right
away<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:26.320> mean<00:05:27.250> I<00:05:27.280> think<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.880> know<00:05:28.000> whoever

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330

away I mean I think you know whoever
wins<00:05:28.780> this<00:05:28.990> fight<00:05:29.230> I<00:05:29.560> think<00:05:30.550> they<00:05:30.820> will<00:05:31.030> be<00:05:31.180> the

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
wins this fight I think they will be the

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.140 
wins this fight I think they will be the
the<00:05:31.570> lineal<00:05:32.410> middleweight<00:05:32.650> champ<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:33.970> they

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
the lineal middleweight champ but they

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.360 
the lineal middleweight champ but they
will<00:05:34.330> probably<00:05:34.660> continue<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.650> fight<00:05:35.860> closer

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
will probably continue to fight closer

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.520 
will probably continue to fight closer
to<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.120> junior<00:05:37.480> middleweight<00:05:37.840> division<00:05:37.870> and

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
like Adonis Stevenson who hasn't done as

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.860 
like Adonis Stevenson who hasn't done as
much<00:05:56.680> as<00:05:57.100> a<00:05:57.160> surrogate<00:05:57.550> Kovalev<00:05:58.210> you<00:05:58.600> have<00:05:58.720> the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
much as a surrogate Kovalev you have the

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.900 
much as a surrogate Kovalev you have the
Kovalev<00:05:59.440> situation<00:06:00.220> then<00:06:00.669> you<00:06:00.729> have<00:06:00.820> the

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
Kovalev situation then you have the

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.430 
Kovalev situation then you have the
gallatin<00:06:01.390> situation<00:06:01.960> where<00:06:02.080> I<00:06:02.110> think<00:06:02.320> guys

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
gallatin situation where I think guys

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.680 
gallatin situation where I think guys
are<00:06:02.500> consciously<00:06:03.160> avoiding<00:06:03.729> making<00:06:04.240> up<00:06:04.570> their

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
are consciously avoiding making up their

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.750 
are consciously avoiding making up their
