00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
basically you customizing it with the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.990 
basically you customizing it with the
black<00:00:46.559> course<00:00:46.829> key<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> sunrise

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
black course key and then the sunrise

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
like I mentioned the original video is a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
like I mentioned the original video is a
shame<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.590> can't<00:00:52.739> apply<00:00:53.129> more<00:00:53.489> orange<00:00:53.879> to

shame that we can't apply more orange to
the<00:00:54.239> bodywork<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> side<00:00:55.559> skirts<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.160> the

the pegassi zentorno which makes a much

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.840 
the pegassi zentorno which makes a much
better<00:02:23.810> replica<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.980> Sesto<00:02:25.820> Elemento

better replica of the Sesto Elemento

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.870 
better replica of the Sesto Elemento
from<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.720> movie<00:02:26.990> than<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.830> pegasi<00:02:28.250> Vaca<00:02:28.640> that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
from the movie than the pegasi Vaca that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.300 
from the movie than the pegasi Vaca that

are used back in march in some ways I do

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.070 
are used back in march in some ways I do
think<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.760> pegasi<00:02:32.150> Vaca<00:02:32.510> did<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.840> some

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
think the pegasi Vaca did have some

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.840 
think the pegasi Vaca did have some
better<00:02:33.500> styling<00:02:34.040> features<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.550> think<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
better styling features I think the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.210 
better styling features I think the
overall<00:02:35.120> shape<00:02:35.450> as<00:02:36.050> well<00:02:36.290> as<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.680> front

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
headlights looked a little bit more

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.690 
headlights looked a little bit more

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
accurate but the center noise obviously

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.000 
accurate but the center noise obviously
