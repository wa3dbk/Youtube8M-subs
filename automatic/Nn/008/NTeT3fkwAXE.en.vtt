so far in the house

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.160 
so far in the house
honestly<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.619> moving<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.720> was<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
honestly like moving in was kind of the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.540 
honestly like moving in was kind of the
hardest<00:01:28.500> thing<00:01:28.679> because<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.069> was<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
hardest thing because it was just it

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.790 
hardest thing because it was just it
took<00:01:29.819> so<00:01:30.090> much<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.569> get<00:01:30.840> us<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.649> got

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
took so much to get us here and I got

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.910 
took so much to get us here and I got
through<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.039> my<00:01:32.069> back<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.490> 15<00:01:32.789> times<00:01:36.920> keep

I<00:01:38.780> think<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.899> hardest<00:01:40.619> part<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:40.920> probably

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
I think the hardest part was probably

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.160 
I think the hardest part was probably
painting<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.149> whole<00:01:42.270> house<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.780> because

a tough thing to achieve and I think we

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.270 
a tough thing to achieve and I think we
did<00:03:50.100> it

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
did it
