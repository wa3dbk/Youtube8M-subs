00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.909
 if I can stay to sleep a place 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.890
 worthy clean with a good bed a 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.110
 good shower for forty euros instead of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 per hundred since the sixty that I have left 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:15.749
 he paid me a good tribute dinner or 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.850
 savings simply has not been is not 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.520
 a hotel chain that emerged in 2004 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.070
 in Barcelona that seeks to offer 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.050
 market a hotel concept in which 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.790
 you take away everything superfluous and all that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.390
 you remove it also from the price that 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.640
 pay the usual customer is a moment 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.949
 sweet for the chain in which finally 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 We have found enough size with 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.800
 10 hotels with a minimum structure and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.629
 good therefore generating good profitability 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.890
 to shareholders enough cash and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.749
 profit now they are billing us 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.609
 about seven million euros in the 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:51.829
 last line then earning some money 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.899
 if karma is a very scalable model 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.309
 then right now the openings this 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 year we have three openings three hotels 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.329
 new that means having increased 40% 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 of the size of the chain and I think that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.329
 we can continue to grow at a rate of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.439
 40 percent a year 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.510
 that means opening four hotels 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.420
 new next year 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.600
 and working hard to find good 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.150
 good contracts and good locations 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.720
 final that are profitable openings 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.980
 we have urban in madrid we have other 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.170
 34 buildings right now that could 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.090
 become next year on TV 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.830
 Sidorme had before a hostel in this 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.860
 location the hostel left in november 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.930
 of 2013 at the time the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.940
 contract in July 2013 starts at 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.830
 prepare all projects for 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.600
 application for licenses a 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.070
 basic project that later becomes 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.530
 in a project of execution to license 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.910
 at the moment we have the license and 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.710
 that they have delivered us to the hostel 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.720
 we started with all the works of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.400
 demolition when we signed this contract 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.490
 we had thought about an investment around 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.470
 to about 112 million euros the reality 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.080
 is that we are going to go to 16 or so 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.410
 fruit of the sorry state in which 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.729
 there was the building and nobody knew 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.710
 the profitability depends on the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.540
 future of the degree of acceptance that 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.470
 on the part of our clients but for 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.450
 this location in particular 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.150
 expect a return of around 10% 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.980
 It could be more than reasonable 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.260
 the minimum we would be around thirty 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900
 euros in which we have in valence in 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.849
 next to the airport in father and the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.709
 maximum I understand that it should be 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.049
 here in fuencarral and well then to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.909
 beginning the idea of ​​starting prices 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.650
 it would be around 55 or 60 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.209
 euros --iva included-- but it depends 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.650
 much of the supply and demand of the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.450
 offer of hotels that we have 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.189
 around as they are already offering the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.470
 room and the demand that gives the 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.459
 zone at the moment there is an event 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.209
 important and all the hotels are filled 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.209
 for the prices go up 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.010
 it's more competition than it's another kind of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.349
 competition and that in the end 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 It is also true that this type of offer 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.840
 generates another type of demand are not two 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.680
 models that can coexist 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.890
 perfectly 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.890
 Y
