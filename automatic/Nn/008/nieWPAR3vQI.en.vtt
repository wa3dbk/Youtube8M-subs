00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
it's they're not great fan so now

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.860 
it's they're not great fan so now

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
because you have a larger display you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.740 
because you have a larger display you
can<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.650> lot<00:02:33.860> more<00:02:33.920> larger<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.970> do<00:02:35.510> more

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
can do a lot more larger just do more

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.440 
can do a lot more larger just do more
large<00:02:35.989> gestures

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
large gestures

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.540 
large gestures
that<00:02:37.870> have<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> lot<00:02:38.620> more<00:02:38.739> nuanced<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.280> them<00:02:39.430> and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
that have a lot more nuanced to them and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.580 
that have a lot more nuanced to them and
we're<00:02:39.670> going<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.819> wait<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.020> lot<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.349> we

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
we're going to wait that a lot and we

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.790 
we're going to wait that a lot and we
did<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.830> here<00:02:42.040> first<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.150> photo<00:02:43.360> ops

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
did it here first and I in the photo ops

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.619 
did it here first and I in the photo ops
so<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.069> get<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.250> kind<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.610> effect<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
so you can get that kind of effect the

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.979 
so you can get that kind of effect the
other<00:02:46.750> thing<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.849> again<00:02:48.849> going<00:02:49.060> back<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
other thing is again going back to a

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.600 
other thing is again going back to a
taking<00:02:50.620> advantage<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.129> as<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:52.650> play<00:02:53.650> you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
taking advantage of this as a play you

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.479

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
can just flip through the pages that way

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.770 
can just flip through the pages that way
you<00:03:55.989> can<00:03:56.260> go<00:03:57.129> one<00:03:57.430> by<00:03:57.609> one<00:03:57.640> or<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.180> can<00:03:58.359> but<00:03:58.689> if

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
you can go one by one or you can but if

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.420 
you can go one by one or you can but if
you<00:03:58.870> really<00:03:59.049> act<00:03:59.290> if<00:03:59.469> you<00:03:59.560> really<00:03:59.799> like<00:03:59.980> he

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
faster than typically used in here idhar

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
so go over to the game screen and I said

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.430 
so go over to the game screen and I said
I've<00:05:02.400> heard<00:05:02.610> before<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:03.780> have<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.020> option<00:05:04.170> of

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
I've heard before you have the option of

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.570 
I've heard before you have the option of
doing<00:05:05.810> feel<00:05:06.810> especially<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:08.130> sound<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.550> so

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
doing feel especially the sound is so

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.280 
doing feel especially the sound is so
strong<00:05:09.090> in<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.420> there's<00:05:09.630> actually<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.140> you

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
strong in it there's actually a you

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.820 
strong in it there's actually a you
always<00:05:10.500> get<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.830> aberration<00:05:11.550> yeah

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
always get the aberration yeah

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.100 
always get the aberration yeah
but<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.490> can<00:05:13.640> switch<00:05:13.850> between<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.930> whole

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
but you can switch between the whole

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.870 
but you can switch between the whole
thing<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.530> full<00:05:15.830> screen<00:05:16.040> which<00:05:16.340> doubles<00:05:16.820> the

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
thing and full screen which doubles the

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.900 
thing and full screen which doubles the
pixels<00:05:17.360> we're<00:05:18.050> doing<00:05:18.410> just<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.550> original

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
pixels we're doing just the original

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.730 
pixels we're doing just the original
format<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:20.450> you<00:05:20.510> can<00:05:20.720> switch<00:05:20.930> between<00:05:21.080> this<00:05:21.620> is

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
format so you can switch between this is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.700 
format so you can switch between this is
an<00:05:21.860> original<00:05:21.920> iphone<00:05:22.310> app<00:05:22.640> yeah<00:05:23.000> this<00:05:23.690> is<00:05:24.410> what

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
an original iphone app yeah this is what

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.370 
an original iphone app yeah this is what
it<00:05:24.800> would<00:05:24.950> look<00:05:25.010> like<00:05:25.130> an<00:05:25.430> iPhone<00:05:26.380> doubling

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
it would look like an iPhone doubling

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.100 
it would look like an iPhone doubling
the<00:05:27.470> pics<00:05:27.650> we'll<00:05:27.830> see<00:05:28.480> we<00:05:29.480> do<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.780> game<00:05:29.810> that

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
the pics we'll see we do the game that

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.190 
the pics we'll see we do the game that
makes<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:30.770> no<00:05:31.760> these<00:05:32.180> are<00:05:32.330> all<00:05:32.510> right<00:05:33.050> off

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
makes it so no these are all right off

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.250 
makes it so no these are all right off
the<00:05:33.320> App<00:05:33.440> Store<00:05:33.470> not<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.520> not<00:05:34.670> modified

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
the App Store not the not modified

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.070 
the App Store not the not modified
better<00:05:36.260> Baghdad

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
better Baghdad

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.770 
better Baghdad
it's<00:05:38.650> just<00:05:38.919> what<00:05:39.280> it's<00:05:39.400> using<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.240> technical

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
it's just what it's using a technical

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.529 
it's just what it's using a technical
government<00:05:41.139> pixels<00:05:41.560> are<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.729> pixel<00:05:43.120> thing

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
government pixels are the pixel thing

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.460 
government pixels are the pixel thing
because<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:44.020> think<00:05:44.289> I<00:05:44.470> know<00:05:44.530> right<00:05:44.800> next<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:45.099> it

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.230 

so<00:05:48.340> you'll<00:05:48.490> find<00:05:48.670> that<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.970> performance

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
so you'll find that the performance

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.660 
so you'll find that the performance
section<00:05:49.660> really<00:05:50.110> really<00:05:50.350> good<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:51.130> the

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
section really really good and the

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.850 
section really really good and the
amazing<00:05:52.270> thing<00:05:52.300> about<00:05:52.420> it<00:05:52.720> is<00:05:52.840> for<00:05:53.500> games<00:05:53.680> that

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
amazing thing about it is for games that

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.770 
amazing thing about it is for games that
use<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.100> accelerometer<00:05:54.430> for<00:05:55.000> controlled

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
intricate change gear by slutting

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.100 
intricate change gear by slutting
everything<00:06:02.910> closes<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.690> notes<00:06:03.930> of<00:06:04.050> the

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.820 

let's<00:06:09.290> stop
