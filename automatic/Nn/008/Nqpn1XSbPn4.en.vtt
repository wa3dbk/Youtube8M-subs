tutorial for a move that Damian Lillard
did<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> Sacramento<00:00:14.940> Kings<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.389> little

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
did on the Sacramento Kings a little

did on the Sacramento Kings a little
over<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> week<00:00:16.230> ago<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:17.100> split<00:00:17.460> two<00:00:17.730> defenders

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
over a week ago to split two defenders

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.450 
over a week ago to split two defenders
as<00:00:18.539> he<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.170> about<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.590> pic<00:00:19.830> set<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.369> him

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
as he was about to get a pic set for him

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.580 
as he was about to get a pic set for him
so<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.390> cone<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.230> gonna<00:00:22.320> represent

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so this cone here is gonna represent

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.700 
so this cone here is gonna represent
your<00:00:23.130> defender<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.779> would<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.050> Miller's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
your defender and that would be Miller's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
your defender and that would be Miller's
defender<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> game<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.789> he<00:00:27.420> had<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
defender in the game and he had a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.779 
defender in the game and he had a
teammate<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.320> down<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:28.830> by<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.310> paint

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
teammate right down there by the paint

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.910 
teammate right down there by the paint
coming<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.810> set<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> pick<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.349> him<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
coming up to set a pick for him on the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.330 
coming up to set a pick for him on the
left<00:00:32.130> hand<00:00:32.369> side<00:00:32.669> however<00:00:33.510> his<00:00:34.260> teammate<00:00:34.950> did

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
left hand side however his teammate did

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.299 
left hand side however his teammate did
not<00:00:35.640> follow<00:00:36.149> him<00:00:36.630> instead<00:00:37.620> he<00:00:37.770> came<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
not follow him instead he came to the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.220 
not follow him instead he came to the
other<00:00:38.460> side<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.300> tried<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> steal<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
other side and tried to steal the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.380 
other side and tried to steal the
basketball<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.100> double-team<00:00:41.670> Lillard<00:00:42.000> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
basketball and double-team Lillard you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.430 
basketball and double-team Lillard you
know<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> pressure<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.230> trying<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
know the pressure I'm and trying to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.630 
know the pressure I'm and trying to
create<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.040> turnover

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
create a turnover

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
create a turnover
so<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.360> Lillard<00:00:45.719> did<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.079> actually<00:00:46.469> pretty

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
so what Lillard did was actually pretty

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
so what Lillard did was actually pretty
smart<00:00:47.039> he<00:00:47.250> did<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> double<00:00:47.520> between<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> legs

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
smart he did a double between the legs

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
smart he did a double between the legs
and<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.230> he<00:00:49.320> pushed<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.950> ball<00:00:50.100> real<00:00:50.399> quick

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and then he pushed the ball real quick

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.479 
and then he pushed the ball real quick
now<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.750> bit<00:00:51.960> dangerous<00:00:52.370> but<00:00:53.370> if

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
now it's a little bit dangerous but if

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
now it's a little bit dangerous but if
you<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> correctly<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> pull<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> off

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you do it correctly you can pull it off

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
you do it correctly you can pull it off
because<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> defender<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.879> running

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
because your if that defender is running

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
because your if that defender is running
at<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.739> going<00:00:58.739> against<00:00:59.190> him<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.520> be

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
at you going against him is gonna be

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.279 
at you going against him is gonna be
pretty<00:00:59.820> easy<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.270> he<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.690> doing<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> between

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
pretty easy so he was doing a between

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.779 
pretty easy so he was doing a between
the<00:01:01.379> legs<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> setting<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the legs just kind of setting up as the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.070 
the legs just kind of setting up as the
defenders<00:01:03.210> are<00:01:03.300> coming<00:01:03.510> enemy<00:01:03.750> who's<00:01:03.899> doing

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
defenders are coming enemy who's doing

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
defenders are coming enemy who's doing
the<00:01:04.170> second<00:01:04.500> between<00:01:04.680> legs<00:01:04.909> hesitated<00:01:05.909> moved

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the second between legs hesitated moved

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
the second between legs hesitated moved
slightly<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.650> did<00:01:07.830> her

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
slightly to the right and then did her

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
slightly to the right and then did her
push<00:01:08.280> forward<00:01:08.909> type<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.330> crossover<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
push forward type a crossover so it's a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080 
push forward type a crossover so it's a
crossover<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.250> he's<00:01:11.430> pushing<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.880> almost

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
crossover but he's pushing and almost

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090 
crossover but he's pushing and almost
directly<00:01:12.540> straight<00:01:12.900> forward<00:01:13.290> past<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> two

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
directly straight forward past the two

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
directly straight forward past the two
defenders<00:01:14.580> who<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.880> moving<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> exact

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
defenders who are moving in the exact

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
defenders who are moving in the exact
opposite<00:01:16.080> direction<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.460> bit

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
opposite direction so a little bit

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
opposite direction so a little bit
dangerous<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.210> once<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.540> get<00:01:18.659> past<00:01:18.930> them<00:01:19.170> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
dangerous but once you get past them you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
dangerous but once you get past them you
have<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> wide<00:01:19.740> open<00:01:20.100> lane<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> just

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
have a wide open lane because you just

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.609 
have a wide open lane because you just
cleared<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.210> those<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.600> defenders<00:01:22.080> so

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
cleared out those two defenders so

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.690 
cleared out those two defenders so
here's<00:01:22.799> another<00:01:22.950> angle<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.580> gonna

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
here's another angle where it's gonna

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.070 
here's another angle where it's gonna
look<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:23.939> double<00:01:24.509> between<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> legs

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
look like double between the legs

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660 
look like double between the legs
hesitate<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.799> second<00:01:26.340> one

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
hesitate on that second one

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.100 
hesitate on that second one
push<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> ball<00:01:27.420> straight<00:01:27.689> forward<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
push the ball straight forward the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.050 
push the ball straight forward the
crossover<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> attack<00:01:29.280> hard<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.790> first

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
crossover and attack hard on that first

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
crossover and attack hard on that first
step<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.689> final<00:01:31.049> key<00:01:31.200> points<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> make<00:01:31.829> sure

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
step to final key points to make sure

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
step to final key points to make sure
you<00:01:32.189> take<00:01:32.430> note<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.689> push<00:01:34.020> dribble

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you take note of on that push dribble

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.990 
you take note of on that push dribble
forward<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> push<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.490> fast<00:01:35.759> or

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
forward you have to push it fast or

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.039 
forward you have to push it fast or
there's<00:01:36.150> no<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.479> you're<00:01:36.630> gonna<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
there's no way you're gonna get it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.420 
there's no way you're gonna get it
through<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.770> make<00:01:38.009> sure<00:01:38.040> there's<00:01:38.369> some

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
through and to make sure there's some
