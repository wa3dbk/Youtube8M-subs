we look at admissions I think our

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.969 
we look at admissions I think our
results<00:05:32.580> speak<00:05:33.570> for<00:05:33.630> themselves<00:05:33.840> we<00:05:34.409> have<00:05:34.440> a

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
results speak for themselves we have a

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.249 
results speak for themselves we have a
high<00:05:35.669> percentage<00:05:36.210> of<00:05:36.330> our<00:05:36.449> graduates<00:05:36.990> about

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
high percentage of our graduates about

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.350 
high percentage of our graduates about
2/3<00:05:37.889> of<00:05:38.070> them<00:05:38.219> ended<00:05:38.490> up<00:05:38.580> in<00:05:38.699> Georgia<00:05:39.090> which<00:05:39.330> is

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
2/3 of them ended up in Georgia which is

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.260 
2/3 of them ended up in Georgia which is
the<00:05:39.599> most<00:05:39.780> important<00:05:40.320> thing<00:05:40.500> to<00:05:40.680> us<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:41.370> all<00:05:41.669> so

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
the most important thing to us of all so

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.390 
the most important thing to us of all so
that's<00:05:42.389> why<00:05:42.599> we<00:05:42.810> don't<00:05:42.990> even<00:05:43.139> look<00:05:43.919> at<00:05:44.070> people

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
that's why we don't even look at people

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.800 
that's why we don't even look at people
who<00:05:44.430> are<00:05:44.580> not<00:05:44.729> from<00:05:44.880> Georgia<00:05:45.300> you<00:05:45.479> have<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.719> be

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
who are not from Georgia you have to be

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.080 
who are not from Georgia you have to be
a<00:05:45.840> Georgia<00:05:46.289> resident<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:46.830> go<00:05:46.949> here<00:05:47.159> so<00:05:47.400> we<00:05:48.000> have

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
a Georgia resident to go here so we have

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.730 
a Georgia resident to go here so we have
a<00:05:48.120> high<00:05:48.330> percentage<00:05:48.750> there<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.169> of<00:05:49.289> those<00:05:49.530> who

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
a high percentage there and of those who

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.200 
a high percentage there and of those who
ended<00:05:49.919> up<00:05:50.039> in<00:05:50.190> Georgia<00:05:50.580> a<00:05:50.669> very<00:05:51.000> high

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
ended up in Georgia a very high

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.969 
ended up in Georgia a very high
percentage<00:05:51.780> of<00:05:51.930> enter<00:05:52.169> depth<00:05:52.380> in<00:05:52.500> primary

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
percentage of enter depth in primary

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.159 
percentage of enter depth in primary
care<00:05:53.219> which<00:05:53.430> has<00:05:53.460> been<00:05:53.789> our<00:05:54.360> goal<00:05:54.630> all<00:05:54.870> along

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
care which has been our goal all along

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.080 
care which has been our goal all along
so<00:05:55.380> I<00:05:55.469> think<00:05:55.530> we've<00:05:55.889> done<00:05:56.580> a<00:05:56.610> good<00:05:56.819> job<00:05:56.880> of

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
so I think we've done a good job of

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.020 
so I think we've done a good job of
satisfying<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:58.130> hopes<00:05:59.130> that<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.520> state<00:05:59.789> had

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
satisfying the hopes that the state had

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.089 
satisfying the hopes that the state had
for<00:06:00.270> us<00:06:00.419> and<00:06:00.719> the<00:06:00.840> hope<00:06:00.960> that<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.409> university

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
for us and the hope that the university

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.800 
for us and the hope that the university
had<00:06:02.280> for<00:06:02.460> this<00:06:02.580> school<00:06:02.849> when<00:06:03.120> it<00:06:03.240> was<00:06:03.360> started

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
had for this school when it was started

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.890 
had for this school when it was started
and<00:06:04.020> it's<00:06:04.199> been<00:06:04.699> a<00:06:05.699> really<00:06:06.180> good<00:06:06.389> ongoing

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
and it's been a really good ongoing

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.570 
and it's been a really good ongoing
partnership<00:06:07.440> which<00:06:07.650> we<00:06:07.800> obviously<00:06:07.979> hope<00:06:08.370> will

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
partnership which we obviously hope will

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.030 
partnership which we obviously hope will
continue
