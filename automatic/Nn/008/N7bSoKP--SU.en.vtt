00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.570 
design-wise they're pretty similar they
both<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.930> exact<00:02:18.230> ulam<00:02:18.470> barrel<00:02:18.770> then<00:02:19.430> it

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
both have the exact ulam barrel then it

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.250 
both have the exact ulam barrel then it
will<00:02:19.670> grip<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:21.010> rapid<00:02:22.010> pro<00:02:22.690> 0.5<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.960> a<00:02:23.990> little

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
will grip the rapid pro 0.5 is a little

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.080 
will grip the rapid pro 0.5 is a little
bit<00:02:24.350> bigger<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.040> think<00:02:25.310> that's<00:02:25.490> why<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.760> like

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
bit bigger and I think that's why I like

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.530 
bit bigger and I think that's why I like
it<00:02:26.270> better

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
it better

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.320 
it better
oh<00:02:26.630> my<00:02:26.870> god<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.470> know<00:02:27.550> fairly<00:02:28.550> decent-sized

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
oh my god you know fairly decent-sized

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.990 
oh my god you know fairly decent-sized
hands<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:33.440> other<00:02:33.590> thing<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.160> older

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
hands and the other thing is the older

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.440 
hands and the other thing is the older
model<00:02:35.300> does<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.450> have<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.930> retractable<00:02:36.440> tip

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
model does not have the retractable tip

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.120 
model does not have the retractable tip
so<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.480> don't<00:02:38.990> carry<00:02:39.350> around<00:02:39.500> quite<00:02:39.890> as<00:02:39.980> much

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
so I don't carry around quite as much

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.740 
so I don't carry around quite as much
with<00:02:40.340> me<00:02:40.490> because<00:02:40.730> I'm<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.210> little<00:02:41.630> concerned

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
with me because I'm a little concerned

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.390 
with me because I'm a little concerned
about<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.260> tip<00:02:42.410> bending<00:02:42.860> or<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.070> always<00:02:43.250> have

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
about the tip bending or I always have

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.640 
about the tip bending or I always have
to<00:02:43.490> have<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.640> case<00:02:43.880> for<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.350> one<00:02:45.350> thing<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
to have a case for it one thing the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.190 
to have a case for it one thing the
older<00:02:45.890> model<00:02:46.190> does<00:02:46.400> have<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.810> LED

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
older model does have is the LED

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.710 
older model does have is the LED
indicator<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.100> if<00:02:49.910> that's<00:02:50.180> important<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.630> you

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
indicator so if that's important to you

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.840 
indicator so if that's important to you
that<00:02:50.840> might<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.830> know<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.340> weight<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:52.610> from

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
that might you know just weight you from

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.820 
that might you know just weight you from
getting<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.210> newer<00:02:53.360> pencil<00:02:53.840> but<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.350> think<00:02:54.770> in

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
getting the newer pencil but I think in

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.590 
getting the newer pencil but I think in
other<00:02:54.950> respects<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.670> newer<00:02:55.820> model<00:02:56.210> law<00:02:56.360> is

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
other respects the newer model law is

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.350 
other respects the newer model law is
improved<00:02:57.790> price-wise<00:02:58.790> these<00:02:59.060> are<00:02:59.180> pretty

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
improved price-wise these are pretty

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.750 
improved price-wise these are pretty
similar<00:02:59.710> of<00:03:00.710> course<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.070> was<00:03:01.280> free<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.610> me

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
similar of course this was free to me

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.030 
similar of course this was free to me
but<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.090> looks<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.450> about<00:03:04.240> 35<00:03:05.560> pounds<00:03:06.560> on

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
but it looks to be about 35 pounds on

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.750 
but it looks to be about 35 pounds on
coal<00:03:07.460> pens<00:03:08.410> which<00:03:09.410> actually<00:03:10.310> bribed<00:03:10.550> the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
coal pens which actually bribed the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.830 
coal pens which actually bribed the
pencil<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:13.130> was<00:03:13.340> about<00:03:13.520> 25<00:03:14.000> or<00:03:14.180> $30<00:03:14.690> on

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
pencil and this was about 25 or $30 on

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.830 
pencil and this was about 25 or $30 on
ebay<00:03:15.140> ship<00:03:15.820> you<00:03:16.820> can<00:03:16.910> still<00:03:17.090> find<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.540> eBay
