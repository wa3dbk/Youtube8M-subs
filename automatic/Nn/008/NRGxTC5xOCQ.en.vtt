example<00:01:11.100> he<00:01:11.670> came<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.810> modification

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
example he came up with a modification

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
example he came up with a modification
for<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.979> 3x3<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.729> called<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> Fisher's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
for a 3x3 and called it the Fisher's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.130 
for a 3x3 and called it the Fisher's
cube<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.909> 3x3<00:01:18.570> with

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
cube so here it is it's just a 3x3 with

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.649 
cube so here it is it's just a 3x3 with
that<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> shape-shifting<00:01:20.580> puzzle<00:01:20.939> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that is now a shape-shifting puzzle so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
that is now a shape-shifting puzzle so
he<00:01:22.439> never<00:01:22.590> mass-produced<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> he<00:01:23.759> never

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
he never mass-produced it he never

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.570 
he never mass-produced it he never
patented<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.720> yet<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> company<00:01:25.740> saw<00:01:25.950> his<00:01:26.189> idea

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
patented it yet a company saw his idea

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.219 
patented it yet a company saw his idea
online<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.540> I'm<00:01:28.110> sure<00:01:28.680> saw<00:01:29.430> Fisher's<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
online and I'm sure saw Fisher's in the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.399 
online and I'm sure saw Fisher's in the
title<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.659> produced<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.840> without<00:01:34.170> his

you not to buy a knockoff but that
doesn't<00:02:16.540> apply<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.959> every<00:02:17.349> puzzle<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.310> nth

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
doesn't apply to every puzzle so nth

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.780 
doesn't apply to every puzzle so nth
number<00:02:18.909> number<00:02:19.719> two<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.260> hurts<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.219> company

chance to get a true quality cue and
number<00:02:32.379> three<00:02:32.859> it<00:02:33.159> gives<00:02:33.639> incentives<00:02:34.239> to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
number three it gives incentives to

and copy designs from other puzzles and

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.610 
and copy designs from other puzzles and
thereby<00:03:54.879> doing<00:03:55.150> more<00:03:55.449> damage<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.109> there's

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
thereby doing more damage and there's

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.259 
thereby doing more damage and there's
one<00:03:56.829> particular<00:03:57.189> set<00:03:57.669> of<00:03:57.699> puzzles<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.150> I

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
one particular set of puzzles that I

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.080 
one particular set of puzzles that I
want<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.629> get<00:03:58.780> into<00:03:59.229> that<00:03:59.709> have<00:04:00.040> been<00:04:00.280> not<00:04:00.759> off

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
want to get into that have been not off

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.409 
want to get into that have been not off
it<00:04:01.949> there's<00:04:02.949> probably<00:04:03.489> been<00:04:03.849> no

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
it there's probably been no

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.839 
it there's probably been no
revolutionary<00:04:05.349> puzzle<00:04:05.919> other<00:04:06.189> than<00:04:06.639> the

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
revolutionary puzzle other than the

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.819 
revolutionary puzzle other than the
original<00:04:07.209> Rubik's<00:04:07.389> Cube<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.019> talking<00:04:08.590> about

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
original Rubik's Cube and talking about

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:09.749 
original Rubik's Cube and talking about
the<00:04:08.979> V<00:04:09.189> cubes

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:09.759 
the V cubes

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.729 
the V cubes
I<00:04:09.789> mean<00:04:10.150> vertes<00:04:10.569> worked<00:04:10.840> very<00:04:11.169> hard<00:04:11.289> to

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
I mean vertes worked very hard to

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.099 
I mean vertes worked very hard to
produce<00:04:11.889> these<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.759> I<00:04:13.269> think<00:04:13.329> we<00:04:13.780> should

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
produce these and I think we should

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.709 
produce these and I think we should
honor<00:04:14.469> that<00:04:14.799> by<00:04:15.009> buying<00:04:15.370> their<00:04:16.000> puzzles<00:04:16.599> and

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:16.719 
honor that by buying their puzzles and

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:17.909 
honor that by buying their puzzles and
not<00:04:17.199> knock-offs

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
not knock-offs

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.269 
not knock-offs
and<00:04:18.239> not<00:04:19.239> only<00:04:19.479> have<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.169> companies<00:04:20.709> copying

and not only have the companies copying

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.610 
and not only have the companies copying
the<00:04:21.609> pieces<00:04:22.060> they<00:04:22.389> have<00:04:22.510> also<00:04:22.719> designed<00:04:23.110> their
