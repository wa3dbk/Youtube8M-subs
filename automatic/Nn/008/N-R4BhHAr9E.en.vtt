00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 Friends Member Welcome you to draw a brand haebeo body 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 Today, I was just preparing for the need for a keyword . 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.240
 Uh uh larger existing balance control k9 gold 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.750
 This is a cake pour model that will be available after the model. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.070
 I do not need a horse next to a lake. 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:37.530
 4 Look at it first . It 's not a fish marshal . I'm using vegetables. 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.590
 I should see the past, it will not be here except for the wholesale and macro key part 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 Leia was originally silver. 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 There was a silver accident in the housing itself . 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.200
 Black is a perfect fit. Oh, and why are you 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.309
 The hairline is also composed. 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:01.739
 And if you do not have these switches 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:06.149
 What was one more was always one more increase this area is now part of what led 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:12.270
 To do so in a parallel title that more complementary profile parts 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:13.830
 You can experience it yourself. So you can get more LED 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.860
 You can see it reinforced. 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.840
 Surely 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:24.080
 It is cleaner, more black, more clean, and the LED part comes out. 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 And we can you fight back 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.150
 Previously, cat and f somehow get to learn the macro switch membrane 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.650
 It's organized. 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.830
 It's 4 in Corsair 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.160
 You see 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.730
 No Jeonbuk 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:47.020
 traded mainly d-6 you see 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:50.950
 A technology that is not gonna tendency of conventional somehow more users of its disadvantages 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.290
 Now that I 've kept it right, nobody seems to have been more nervous. 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:00.610
 It seems to me that those who have broken up the old Thailand are more hungry now. 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:04.150
 I want the kids to change the concept. 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.350
 Now, if this is the case, 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.899
 In Korea, now in the online games, 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.550
 Users who use it are more comfortable. 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.840
 Or what Ford Toka write operations by pressing more developed in accordance with this section 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:23.260
 If you set the key, I'll have more macros. 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.400
 If you've used working on the side that would be great 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.560
 It's a bit far from the game . 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.910
 Because it is a little difficult 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.170
 By default, Mower game What apps do little directly nulreumyeon 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.560
 You can see that it's hard. 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.230
 When I saw it, the title of the work is Photoshop ls, 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.940
 Then what is all that you frequently use 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.590
 When specifying the job going to the same tools in CAD to the point right away everbring 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.989
 I can use it. 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.890
 If you write in such a part, it will be very useful. 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.230
 Available 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.120
 Take a change without changing too good a lucky goal of the press call methods on existing itdeon 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.519
 It is mounted as it is 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.940
 Uh Maybe these products are dwaeseo is born this macro key configuration Palace well 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.820
 You can do things that will boost your work efficiency , but the downside is 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.470
 It's too big to die a little 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.010
 1 In my opinion, those who use a desk about 1400 to 1600 frames 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.150
 I did. 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.850
 The keyboard would not have been too loud, and that part would have benefits and buttons 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.989
 That's because you are part of middle school 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.769
 I'll tell you that I have a tendency. 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:40.330
 I'm really blown Dzeko robbed in two very strenuous Money 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.739
 I heard this word do not like me at all ssibatyi the meantime, I'll admit ah 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.790
 I'll write. 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.410
 Now I know to be clean and very well led and then for more information 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.100
 I order 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.100
 I'll go in there.
