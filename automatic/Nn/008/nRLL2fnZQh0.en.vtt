that slowly and then bring it up to
tempo<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.250> let's<00:01:20.430> start<00:01:20.670> slow<00:01:22.100> one<00:01:23.100> two<00:01:24.110> three

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
tempo so let's start slow one two three

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:45.620 
tempo so let's start slow one two three
four<00:01:26.070> now<00:01:44.060> let's<00:01:45.060> try<00:01:45.179> it<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.300> little<00:01:45.330> bit

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
four now let's try it a little bit

00:01:45.630 --> 00:02:18.420 
four now let's try it a little bit
faster<00:02:01.910> stride<00:02:02.910> a<00:02:02.940> little<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.240> faster

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.420 

now<00:02:19.430> we<00:02:19.490> have<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.060> add<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.500> side<00:02:22.130> stick
