00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.189
 my experience with abbado lasts from 12 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.670
 years I had the wonderful opportunity 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.830
 to enter the gustav mahler orchestra from 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.109
 first violin and since then every year I am 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.730
 here at the Mozart Orchestra or 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.730
 to the lucerne festival orchestra 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.320
 general rehearsals open to the public 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.330
 are an opportunity to approach the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.670
 mozart orchestra before a concert 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.860
 directed by its founder claudio abbado 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.380
 together with the pianist and radu lupu with 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.989
 works ranging from aids to a neoclassical 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.050
 prokofieff the orchestra born in bologna 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.270
 in 2004 it now mixes several generations 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.250
 to the young talents who come from 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.260
 every part of the world come together 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.260
 renowned soloists from other orchestras 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.690
 Saturday is very important and silence 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:13.400
 listening not only listening to 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:15.470
 music but also mutual is a 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.500
 very important is silence e 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.240
 the freedom that drives him to musicians 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.610
 let each of us create his own 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.250
 musical idea then try to compose 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.340
 together in an overall idea that is the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.890
 his as a musician you have a lot of freedom not 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.900
 you feel in a box abbado gives you the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.240
 freedom to play and offer 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.360
 musically something that then puts 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.729
 together as in a mosaic and this is a 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.009
 very nice way to be free with 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.009
 others and in unity the relief 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:01.100
 few verbal suggestions the dialogue e 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.270
 very limited verbal dialogue 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.290
 during the test then the real 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.180
 dialogue that is with the musicians 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.730
 through the simple gesture he 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.590
 simply by looking we understand we know 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.000
 that what he wants then is a lot 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:27.200
 simple and always music is the thing 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.450
 more important, not even if to surrender 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.750
 musicians with a style of their own e 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.430
 but there is always a great personality 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.990
 composer the music and we have to do 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.990
 this at the highest level we can 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.440
 the mozart orchestra meet 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.300
 music broadcast training 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.250
 pleasure of playing with friendly performers 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.680
 according to an ethics of musical activity 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 that for years engages abbado in various two 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.860
 jets 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.940
 I go to the ability to gather 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.680
 around him wonderful musicians who 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.950
 they are also old friends for making music 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.900
 without limitations or borders the great 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.490
 difference with other orchestras and that 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.620
 here we are free 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.080
 we are here because we want to be there for the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.030
 music to find a lot of sound 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.030
 special the nong candy shop 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.160
 abbado manages to build relationships between 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.680
 very musical pages and cultural areas 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.080
 distant is always interested in new 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.880
 readings ideas listen to recordings 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.010
 a wealth of stimuli than yours 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.010
 musicians appreciate with enthusiasm 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.650
 I always find a great freshness 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.019
 a great deal of attention e 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.230
 adherence to what is written in 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:18.539
 musical text there is never freedom 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.549
 Free is a great rigor 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.440
 but within all this of this 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.690
 rigor of this attention to the text yes 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.940
 releases great strength 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:34.090
 communicative an inexhaustible source 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.770
 of musical fantasy of freshness and 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.870
 as I said before to the experience of 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.940
 mozart is a continuous becoming and its 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.720
 executions are a continuous becoming non 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.249
 there is never a fixed point there are only gods 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.989
 steps that continue 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.989
 would not be of mind 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.670
 once abbado said that the duration 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.920
 of silence 3 at the end of the concert 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.620
 at the beginning of the applause, that pause 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.540
 from the audience makes it clear what was the 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.400
 quality of listening for sure 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.340
 the reception that follows these last 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.230
 notes and affectionate and very lively as the 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.530
 final of the classical symphony of 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.530
 Prokofiev
