00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.569
 hi friends 73 for another appointment 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.970
 today's calendar today we 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.799
 are the 14th and so I'm going seven cases 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.379
 so I will not have fun every time 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.849
 back up centers my camera and I 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.219
 you the box and I show you what has 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.720
 so yesterday we had this concern that 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.380
 was not a very very surprised 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.510
 interesting 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.220
 it was combat droids but 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.980
 standard color and non- yellow color 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.780
 hearing which is a bit of a pity 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.870
 in this brief on the 14th I still ask 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:39.890
 it's just here so I'll open it and 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:42.469
 we will see what contains that day 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.010
 properly and tried the 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:50.239
 construction and Flemish parties obs 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.129
 a mini ship it's all 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:59.300
 simply to their neighborhood and to 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.979
 counterbalance mega it's besides it's 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.449
 rather ironic we have this medium this 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.479
 young son fighters I explain to you 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.479
 Why 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.869
 so I just put a little bit my on 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.579
 a support a little higher so as to 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.619
 what you see when I build 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.040
 so it's very simple take some 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.040
 plates 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.610
 the slide lever on the piano 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.010
 we 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.259
 but here it is, but here it is 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.930
 three additional lever parts 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.900
 it's always good to take so 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.770
 surprise of the day the genesis fighter so 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.170
 that here it is in all its 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.970
 splendor good it is recognized damage 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.440
 up to the plates itself right since at 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.900
 share a small aerodynamic side but 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.190
 good it's enough and laura jobs 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.840
 that I say it's ironic because everything 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.820
 just yesterday truthful 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.430
 I had fun rebuilding an old 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.709
 this star aux and it was this one the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.660
 dionysian of timmy early the ship john 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.490
 thys of 2003 because I do not have that of 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.160
 blue black but I had this version 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:51.459
 will have so I'm pretty happy to have 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.680
 a great model and the little one next so 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.670
 so here it was so today the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.820
 surprise of the day 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.070
 the fighter diagnosis well as to me 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.810
 I will meet you tomorrow paulo nature of 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.630
 the box in box here and this time 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.800
 you will see a little something and 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.330
 that's it 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.320
 because I just do not have any 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.720
 as I say I'm not going to tell myself at every 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.700
 times go down my support but 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.320
 good at least the essential thing is that you 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.760
 see small models small 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.709
 surprises we have for today 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.420
 so that's okay it's overall a good 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.220
 surprise repeats itself slightly better at 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.480
 because of the choice of it is a little 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.220
 plates that would make weird but good 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.720
 it is the home legal products it is 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.130
 quite difficult to do job # 10 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.840
 fighter whatever the leaders 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.370
 anyway 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.030
 and so that's okay so I'm 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.880
 rather happy bah voila that's all so 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.590
 So I talked more about 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.650
 that as for me I'll meet you tomorrow 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.410
 for the opening of the 15th box and I 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.410
 tell you next time go hi
