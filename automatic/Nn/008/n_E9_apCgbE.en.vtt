I have a formal police uniform with a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.840 
I have a formal police uniform with a
tie<00:01:21.310> but<00:01:22.310> he's<00:01:22.490> busy<00:01:22.759> doing<00:01:23.329> some<00:01:24.850> radar

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
tie but he's busy doing some radar

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.200

detecting<00:01:26.719> let<00:01:26.960> me<00:01:27.049> show<00:01:27.289> you<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:28.210> guess

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
detecting let me show you I guess

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.270 
detecting let me show you I guess
technically<00:01:29.659> he's<00:01:29.899> not<00:01:29.929> taking<00:01:30.649> radar<00:01:30.920> he<00:01:31.069> is

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
technically he's not taking radar he is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.029 
technically he's not taking radar he is
the<00:01:31.460> radar<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:32.090> think<00:01:32.899> this<00:01:33.049> is<00:01:33.229> his<00:01:33.439> radar<00:01:33.679> gun

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
the radar I think this is his radar gun

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.919 
the radar I think this is his radar gun
he's<00:01:34.399> working<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.270> side<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.600> road<00:01:35.780> and

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
he's working on the side of the road and

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.090 
he's working on the side of the road and
checking<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.020> speed<00:01:39.289> that<00:01:39.499> people<00:01:39.799> are<00:01:39.920> going

checking the speed that people are going

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.999 
checking the speed that people are going
it's<00:01:40.700> kind<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.999> large<00:01:41.240> device<00:01:41.740> but<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.799> think

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
it's kind of a large device but I think

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.569 
it's kind of a large device but I think
that's<00:01:43.189> what<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.819> didn't<00:01:44.689> really<00:01:44.899> say

that's what this is didn't really say

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.169 
that's what this is didn't really say

probably<00:02:17.080> had<00:02:17.230> 7236<00:02:18.010> sticker<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:18.790> they

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
probably had 7236 sticker but they

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.540 
probably had 7236 sticker but they
didn't<00:02:19.180> do<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.319> with<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:20.530> one<00:02:20.769> some<00:02:21.519> of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
didn't do that with this one some of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.430 
didn't do that with this one some of
these<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> mid-2000s<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.080> guess<00:02:23.290> they

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
these in the mid-2000s I guess they

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.860 
these in the mid-2000s I guess they
didn't<00:02:23.940> do<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:27.030> license<00:02:28.030> plate<00:02:28.239> stickers<00:02:28.690> and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
didn't do the license plate stickers and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.990 
didn't do the license plate stickers and
then<00:02:29.019> just<00:02:29.530> basically<00:02:30.069> a<00:02:30.190> typical<00:02:30.519> blue

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
then just basically a typical blue

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240 
then just basically a typical blue
steering<00:02:31.450> wheel<00:02:31.629> and<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.769> just<00:02:32.950> set<00:02:33.160> them

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
steering wheel and you just set them

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.009 
steering wheel and you just set them
down<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.549> there<00:02:33.730> no<00:02:33.940> control<00:02:34.360> panels<00:02:34.870> or

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
down in there no control panels or

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.690 
down in there no control panels or
anything<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.530> there<00:02:35.680> nothing<00:02:36.069> fancy<00:02:36.519> just

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
anything in there nothing fancy just

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.940 
anything in there nothing fancy just
have<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> couple<00:02:37.360> antennas<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.110> side<00:02:38.709> now

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
have a couple antennas on the side now

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.199 
have a couple antennas on the side now
this<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.930> simple<00:02:41.440> design<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
this is a simple design and it's for you

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.470 
this is a simple design and it's for you
know<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.480> younger<00:02:44.579> kids<00:02:45.579> part<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.060> five<00:02:46.269> to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
know the younger kids part of five to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.949 
know the younger kids part of five to
twelve<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.049> don't<00:02:47.230> have<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:48.150> age<00:02:49.150> requirement

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
twelve I don't have the age requirement

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.830 
twelve I don't have the age requirement
or<00:02:50.310> suggested<00:02:51.310> age<00:02:51.430> on<00:02:51.730> here<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.239> think

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
or suggested age on here but I think

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.080 
or suggested age on here but I think
looking<00:02:53.230> at<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:54.040> build<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.549> looks<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:54.940> it's

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
looking at the build it looks like it's

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.759 
looking at the build it looks like it's
probably<00:02:55.269> five<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.870> twelve<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:59.049> say<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
probably five to twelve and you say it

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.720 
probably five to twelve and you say it
simple<00:03:00.239> yes<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:03.160> you're<00:03:03.430> gonna<00:03:03.519> get<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
simple yes it is and you're gonna get a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.789 
simple yes it is and you're gonna get a
lot<00:03:03.970> with<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.660> set<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.290> one<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.680> your

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
lot with this set is this one of your

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.339 
lot with this set is this one of your
smaller<00:03:06.360> sets<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.599> are<00:03:07.720> more<00:03:07.900> affordable

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
smaller sets that are more affordable

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.530 
smaller sets that are more affordable
for<00:03:08.410> people<00:03:08.920> but<00:03:09.610> when<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:09.910> compare<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.390> to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
for people but when you compare it to

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.940 
for people but when you compare it to
sits<00:03:11.319> we<00:03:11.590> had<00:03:11.860> when<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.220> was<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.519> kid<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> lot

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
sits we had when I was a kid it is a lot

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.770 
sits we had when I was a kid it is a lot
better

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
better

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.580 
better

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
from 1978 and this is from a set that

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.319 
from 1978 and this is from a set that
actually<00:03:32.019> had<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.650> motorcycle<00:03:33.579> and<00:03:34.150> a

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
actually had a motorcycle and a

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.559 
actually had a motorcycle and a
motorcycle<00:03:34.870> cop<00:03:35.109> oh<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:37.569> ran<00:03:37.780> over<00:03:37.930> them

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
motorcycle cop oh just ran over them

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.039 
motorcycle cop oh just ran over them
crime<00:03:40.569> perpetrated<00:03:41.079> by<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.680> police<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:43.209> see

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
crime perpetrated by the police so see

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.909 
crime perpetrated by the police so see
the<00:03:44.200> difference<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.950> lot<00:03:45.370> simpler<00:03:46.919> minifigure

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
the difference a lot simpler minifigure

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.259 
the difference a lot simpler minifigure
it's<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.549> sticker<00:03:48.819> tour<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:50.560> cars

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
it's just a sticker tour so the cars

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.759 
it's just a sticker tour so the cars
there<00:03:52.269> really<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.660> no<00:03:52.900> comparison<00:03:53.440> even

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
there really is no comparison even

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.789 
there really is no comparison even
though<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.459> think<00:03:54.669> is<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> simple<00:03:55.389> design

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
though this I think is a simple design

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.159 
though this I think is a simple design
it<00:03:56.799> looks<00:03:56.919> a<00:03:57.099> lot<00:03:57.280> better<00:03:57.489> than<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:58.169> 1978

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
it looks a lot better than the 1978

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.539 
it looks a lot better than the 1978
version<00:03:59.549> the<00:04:00.549> 1978<00:04:01.450> version<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:02.049> got<00:04:02.260> a

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
version the 1978 version you got a

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.140 
version the 1978 version you got a
motorcycle<00:04:03.549> which<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:04.620> quite<00:04:05.620> lame<00:04:05.859> so<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.970> just
