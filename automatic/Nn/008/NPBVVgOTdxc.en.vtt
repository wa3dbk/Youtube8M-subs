00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.870
 Water 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.760
 but it does not work I do not know anything normal 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.760

 I will also give you to save 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.670
 exit is worth in case the game then 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.159
 At some point there is a lock, let's say 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.769
 the time of the download in the folder 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:43.549
 because who downloaded to when he says 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:47.659
 original files those files all 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.549
 We must copy them and we must 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.159
 paste in the folder where it was installed 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.409
 minecraft that by default would be the 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.870
 user name in this case then 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:00.409

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.090
