00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
white frame and then they did the rubber

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.220 
white frame and then they did the rubber
ear<00:03:28.980> sock<00:03:29.310> pieces<00:03:29.760> here<00:03:30.030> are<00:03:30.209> blue<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.140> was

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
ear sock pieces here are blue so it was

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.990 
ear sock pieces here are blue so it was
kind<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> blue<00:03:31.830> lens<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.820> blue

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
kinds of color combinations but I went

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.050 
kinds of color combinations but I went
with<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.930> pretty<00:03:40.620> basic<00:03:40.860> basic<00:03:41.430> thing<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:41.790> I

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
with a pretty basic basic thing I just I

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.360 
with a pretty basic basic thing I just I
really<00:03:42.300> wanted<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.830> positive<00:03:43.830> red<00:03:44.010> iridium

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
really wanted the positive red iridium

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.000 
really wanted the positive red iridium
lenses<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.510> like<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:45.959> black<00:03:46.650> frame

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
lenses and I like the the black frame

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.300 
lenses and I like the the black frame
and<00:03:47.220> everything<00:03:47.459> else<00:03:47.550> black<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.310> from

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
and everything else black so and from

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.680 
and everything else black so and from
looking<00:03:50.459> at<00:03:50.610> their<00:03:50.790> website<00:03:51.150> at<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.450> time

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
looking at their website at the time

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.310 
looking at their website at the time
they<00:03:51.930> didn't<00:03:52.230> have<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.530> as<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:53.310> combination

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
they didn't have that as a combination

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.630 
they didn't have that as a combination
already<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:55.739> that's<00:03:56.070> why<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.250> went<00:03:56.370> with<00:03:56.520> them

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
already so that's why I went with them

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.690 
already so that's why I went with them
but<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.350> other<00:03:58.470> nice<00:03:58.680> thing<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.580> know

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
but the other nice thing is you know

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.430 
but the other nice thing is you know
they're<00:04:00.060> about<00:04:00.180> ten<00:04:00.570> bucks<00:04:00.780> more<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.080> think

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
they're about ten bucks more I think

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.800 
they're about ten bucks more I think
then<00:04:01.830> standard<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:02.910> they<00:04:03.000> also<00:04:03.150> come<00:04:03.780> with

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
then standard but they also come with

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.800 
then standard but they also come with
that's<00:04:04.350> included<00:04:04.950> with<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.510> case<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.750> I

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
that's included with this case and I

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.949 
that's included with this case and I
think<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.970> Oakley<00:04:08.970> vault<00:04:09.330> or<00:04:09.630> soft

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
think this is the Oakley vault or soft

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.979 
think this is the Oakley vault or soft
vault<00:04:10.320> or<00:04:10.590> something<00:04:10.830> like<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.690> pretty<00:04:12.690> hard

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
vault or something like that pretty hard

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.660 
vault or something like that pretty hard
for<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.230> most<00:04:13.470> part<00:04:13.739> it's<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.400> know<00:04:14.489> you're

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
for the most part it's you know you're

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.070 
for the most part it's you know you're
not<00:04:14.730> gonna<00:04:14.880> crush<00:04:15.150> your<00:04:15.270> glasses<00:04:15.510> in<00:04:15.810> here<00:04:15.989> and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
not gonna crush your glasses in here and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.380 
not gonna crush your glasses in here and
it's<00:04:16.169> kinda<00:04:16.380> neat<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.709> got<00:04:17.180> really<00:04:18.180> hard

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
it's kinda neat it's got really hard

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.979 
it's kinda neat it's got really hard
foam<00:04:18.750> here<00:04:19.020> and<00:04:19.430> deep<00:04:20.430> cuts<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:21.750> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
foam here and deep cuts in it so the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.540 
foam here and deep cuts in it so the
glasses<00:04:22.410> fit<00:04:22.740> right<00:04:22.919> in<00:04:23.070> there<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.370> there's

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550

extra<00:04:23.910> slots<00:04:24.180> for<00:04:24.450> extra<00:04:24.900> pair<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.169> lenses

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
extra slots for extra pair of lenses

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.680 
extra slots for extra pair of lenses
if<00:04:26.670> you<00:04:26.760> want<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.030> add<00:04:27.150> other<00:04:27.300> different

if you want to add other different
lenses<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.170> it<00:04:28.290> and<00:04:28.410> then<00:04:28.500> there's<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.710> soft

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040

they're<00:05:00.630> getting<00:05:00.750> kind<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.140> beat<00:05:01.350> up<00:05:01.380> if<00:05:01.980> you

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
they're getting kind of beat up if you

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.670 
flaked and I've dropped these a few
times<00:05:05.669> too<00:05:05.910> so<00:05:05.940> it's<00:05:06.210> not<00:05:06.300> not<00:05:07.140> like<00:05:07.290> they<00:05:07.500> just

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
times too so it's not not like they just

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.590 
times too so it's not not like they just
wear<00:05:07.980> like<00:05:08.280> that<00:05:08.730> but<00:05:09.090> I<00:05:09.390> put<00:05:10.110> these<00:05:10.260> through

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
wear like that but I put these through

wear like that but I put these through
hell<00:05:12.630> over<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.140> past<00:05:13.350> figures<00:05:13.770> so<00:05:13.980> and<00:05:14.310> also

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
hell over the past figures so and also

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.310 
hell over the past figures so and also
the<00:05:14.940> rubber<00:05:15.150> ear<00:05:15.390> socks<00:05:15.690> on<00:05:15.870> these<00:05:15.960> are<00:05:16.080> kind
