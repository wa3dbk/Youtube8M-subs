Alaric<00:00:18.710> go<00:00:19.710> ahead<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.920> start<00:00:20.430> your<00:00:20.580> game

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.820 

when<00:00:26.750> you're<00:00:26.870> in<00:00:26.960> game<00:00:27.110> i'm<00:00:27.380> going<00:00:27.530> to<00:00:27.590> say<00:00:27.650> the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
when you're in game i'm going to say the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:37.120 
when you're in game i'm going to say the
waypoint<00:00:28.250> to<00:00:28.430> drown<00:00:28.700> temple<00:00:35.290> head<00:00:36.290> down<00:00:36.530> talk

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
waypoint to drown temple head down talk

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.560 
waypoint to drown temple head down talk
to<00:00:37.310> Alaric<00:00:39.550> skip<00:00:40.550> all<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.000> dialogue<00:00:41.360> and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
to Alaric skip all the dialogue and

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.979 
to Alaric skip all the dialogue and
we're<00:00:41.750> heading<00:00:41.930> into<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:42.380> festering<00:00:42.890> woods

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.410 

the<00:00:47.989> run<00:00:48.170> takes<00:00:48.470> a<00:00:48.710> little<00:00:48.890> bit<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.220> set<00:00:49.430> up<00:00:49.610> but

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
the run takes a little bit to set up but

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.360 
the run takes a little bit to set up but
after<00:00:50.690> that<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:51.290> teleport<00:00:51.739> straight<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.250> the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
after that you teleport straight to the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.979 
after that you teleport straight to the
Crypt<00:00:52.580> so<00:00:53.000> we'll<00:00:53.210> never<00:00:53.390> have<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.600> run<00:00:53.870> this

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
Crypt so we'll never have to run this

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.410 
Crypt so we'll never have to run this
again<00:00:54.730> now<00:00:55.730> when<00:00:55.910> you're<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.180> crypt

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
again now when you're in the crypt

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.270 
again now when you're in the crypt
essentially<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.409> run<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.860> killing

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
essentially the run is killing

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.700 
essentially the run is killing
everything<00:00:58.580> in<00:00:58.850> here<00:00:59.230> now<00:01:00.230> you've<00:01:00.440> got<00:01:00.559> two

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
everything in here now you've got two

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.380 
everything in here now you've got two
choices<00:01:00.739> when<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.280> comes<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.610> elites<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.210> can

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
choices when it comes to elites you can

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.520 
choices when it comes to elites you can
either<00:01:02.510> burn<00:01:02.809> through<00:01:03.080> them<00:01:03.230> if<00:01:03.379> you're

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
either burn through them if you're

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.210 
either burn through them if you're
capable<00:01:03.800> or<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.150> can<00:01:05.330> skip<00:01:05.630> them<00:01:05.780> entirely

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
capable or you can skip them entirely

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.830 
capable or you can skip them entirely
what<00:01:07.220> people<00:01:07.550> tend<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.909> do<00:01:08.090> for<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.480> Crip<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:08.750> the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
what people tend to do for a Crip to the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.960 
what people tend to do for a Crip to the
ancients<00:01:09.170> run<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.530> skip<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.130> elites<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:10.580> put

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
ancients run is skip the elites and put

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.120 
ancients run is skip the elites and put
it<00:01:11.060> onto<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.330> torment<00:01:11.810> difficulty<00:01:12.680> where<00:01:13.010> they

it onto a torment difficulty where they

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.850 
it onto a torment difficulty where they
can<00:01:13.370> kill<00:01:13.640> all<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.330> non<00:01:14.540> elites<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:15.409> not

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
can kill all the non elites but not

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.560 
can kill all the non elites but not
necessarily<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.550> elites<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:16.940> just<00:01:17.330> skip

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
necessarily the elites and just skip

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.320 
necessarily the elites and just skip
over<00:01:17.720> them<00:01:18.400> that<00:01:19.400> gives<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.760> highest

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
over them that gives you the highest

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.430 
over them that gives you the highest
experience<00:01:20.900> from<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.680> run<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:24.320> with

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
experience from this run so with
