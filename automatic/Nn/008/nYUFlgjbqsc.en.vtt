00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.430 
if I was to go out with these but this
is<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:16.209> way<00:04:16.330> it<00:04:16.359> is<00:04:16.630> right<00:04:17.170> now

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
is just like the way it is right now

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.159 
is just like the way it is right now
with<00:04:17.500> no<00:04:18.220> products<00:04:19.180> nothing<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.690> I<00:04:19.900> think<00:04:20.080> it

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
with no products nothing and I think it

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.890 
with no products nothing and I think it
actually<00:04:20.320> looks<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:21.450> think<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.570> looks<00:04:22.750> like

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
actually looks I think it looks like

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.840 
actually looks I think it looks like
natural<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.620> don't<00:04:24.220> think<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.430> can<00:04:24.550> tell<00:04:24.730> the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
natural I don't think you can tell the

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.300 
natural I don't think you can tell the
difference<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.680> mean<00:04:26.680> except<00:04:26.919> for<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.190> you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
difference I mean except for that you

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.270 
difference I mean except for that you
know<00:04:27.430> my<00:04:28.030> hair<00:04:28.240> isn't<00:04:28.390> curled<00:04:28.990> but<00:04:29.290> if<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:30.010> just

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
know my hair isn't curled but if I just

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.490 
know my hair isn't curled but if I just
I<00:04:30.430> would<00:04:30.700> just<00:04:30.730> style<00:04:31.180> my<00:04:31.419> hair<00:04:31.660> now<00:04:31.870> them<00:04:32.080> I'm

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
I would just style my hair now them I'm

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.750 
I would just style my hair now them I'm
putting<00:04:32.800> my<00:04:32.919> hair<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.340> with<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.610> right<00:04:33.730> now

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
putting my hair in with it right now

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.210 
putting my hair in with it right now
mushing<00:04:36.760> my<00:04:36.880> hair<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.270> with<00:04:37.419> it

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.620 

I<00:04:41.250> think<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.480> can<00:04:42.690> really<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:45.240> that's<00:04:45.420> it

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
I think that you can really so that's it

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.330 
I think that you can really so that's it
these<00:04:45.930> are<00:04:46.080> my<00:04:46.170> secret<00:04:46.530> extensions<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:49.340> yes

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
these are my secret extensions and yes

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.390 
these are my secret extensions and yes
so<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.640> think<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.150> they<00:04:51.300> really<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:52.380> think<00:04:53.160> it

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
so I think that they really I think it

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.830 
so I think that they really I think it
was<00:04:53.550> something<00:04:53.760> it<00:04:53.850> gives<00:04:53.970> extra<00:04:54.360> body<00:04:54.540> to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
was something it gives extra body to

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.620 
was something it gives extra body to
