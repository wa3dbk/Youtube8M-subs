00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.889
 you hi all today you 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.510
 explain how we do for one of 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.970
 additional assets on the map 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.939
 origins as well in solo as in Corsican 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.710
 or on board will have to find dig 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.110
 until you see the golden call for sun 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.369
 to dig 30 or long enough but when 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.869
 you will cross you 30 hole you 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.430
 go have it then you have to 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.770
 get pissed off and get out of high school 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.010
 pockets of blood and bonuses that give the 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.100
 nails you also offered to appear in 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.960
 pulling on carts on fire as well as 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.790
 that by digging so when you're in 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.890
 not to mention that you have seven poles in 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.860
 or edouard browse the mapar all 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.880
 searched all the way down to find a 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.710
 red task 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.880
 there is only one each time actually 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.860
 every time you go take a 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.210
 center are bi you always have to have 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.100
 the same hole until you 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.770
 so find out if you can not find the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.360
 hole will stay the same throughout the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.010
 part and so you will never have you 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.090
 so are you really have to explore all 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.800
 the corners of the brand 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.809
 once you have found this 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.610
 red stain if you want to renew 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.960
 the operation it will be necessary to re explore 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.759
 every corner of the avap what the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.509
 second red task can very well be 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.500
 to places you have visited 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.550
 good there I show you how we do 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.050
 to have a sense of his bi 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.640
 by drawing on the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.130
 Chariots of Fire there are three carriages 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.600
 fire there is that with the ice cream stick that it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.270
 market 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.679
 good luck the trick for the assets if 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.360
 you play again you will see a 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.340
 second is your partner will not have 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.170
 the same will not be able to recover your task 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.810
 yes you will not be able to recover the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.280
 hers makes each player each his 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.410
 red task and if you want to have some 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.119
 assets will have to find them 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.890
 once you have you will have 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.750
 found this red spot you'll get it 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.819
 dig you will have seen your little snack 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.410
 a center are bi was not going to have 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.300
 immediately an asset it will give you 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.220
 a location for an asset and for 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.959
 recover this extra asset he goes 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.640
 have to either point you to the 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.410
 asset distributor is 1 hour 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.910
 buy one to twelve on the map you 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.289
 can also buy for example pass 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.670
 pass if you have not already 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.670
 if you have an extra place 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.000
 each player will only be able to find 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.110
 four red spots a party that you 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.849
 will therefore give four locations 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.200
 additional to which are added 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.970
 four basic locations so you 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.739
 can have eight locations in total 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.610
 but you can have a ninth to 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.800
 all if you do not 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.140
 still no blocks where you use 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.310
 your reward for having spent 30 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.530
 thousand points in the game once 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.050
 you have you 8 at all to have the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.000
 famous 9th to all is unheard of in 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.980
 zombies 9 at all there were eight on 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.770
 moon is here now there are nine 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.060
 on this map 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.350
 we can say that eight or nine to 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.210
 it's all for nothing but I'm fine 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.590
 agree with them except that in solo it's 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.600
 8 to all can allow you to get 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.100
 unlimited animations so on a 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.959
 other video to explain how 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.430
 get unlimited resuscitation at this 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.620
 than another video to show you 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.730
 all the spots of the red spots 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.080
 in any case I thank you for having 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.880
 mate this one we find ourselves very 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.880
