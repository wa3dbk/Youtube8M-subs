you'll notice on the tab the notes
alternate<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.450> 1<00:01:12.380> 2<00:01:13.280> 3<00:01:24.100> just<00:01:25.100> practice

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
alternate like this 1 2 3 just practice

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.330 
alternate like this 1 2 3 just practice
that<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.600> at<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.020> very<00:01:27.200> slow<00:01:27.410> tempo<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.040> until

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
that it at a very slow tempo and until

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.999 
that it at a very slow tempo and until
you<00:01:28.460> get<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.759> syncopated<00:01:29.690> thing<00:01:30.470> happen<00:01:30.890> and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
you get that syncopated thing happen and

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.140 
you get that syncopated thing happen and
the<00:01:31.100> other<00:01:31.130> thing<00:01:31.400> I'm<00:01:31.520> doing<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:31.880> I'm<00:01:32.000> playing

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
the other thing I'm doing is I'm playing

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:42.790 
the other thing I'm doing is I'm playing
this<00:01:32.330> very<00:01:32.479> staccato

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.530 

then<00:01:43.800> it's<00:01:44.160> just<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.430> matter<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.820> moving<00:01:45.420> all

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
then it's just a matter of moving all

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.360 
then it's just a matter of moving all
the<00:01:45.690> notes<00:01:45.870> around<00:01:46.050> okay<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.250> where

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
the notes around okay so this is where

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.470 
the notes around okay so this is where
this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.820> how<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.030> goes

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
this is how it goes

00:01:48.480 --> 00:02:09.730 
this is how it goes
the<00:01:48.600> first<00:01:48.870> part<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:50.100> 3/4<00:01:50.460> section

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.330 

at<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.910> point<00:02:11.210> we're<00:02:11.930> coming<00:02:12.320> out<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.310> e

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
at that point we're coming out of the e

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.310 
at that point we're coming out of the e
mixolydian<00:02:13.970> thing<00:02:14.450> because<00:02:14.960> we're<00:02:15.050> gonna<00:02:15.140> go

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
bit tougher because we're going to use

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.949 
bit tougher because we're going to use

double stops at the right hand are

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.240 
double stops at the right hand are
actually<00:03:23.349> gonna<00:03:23.439> be<00:03:23.560> played<00:03:23.829> on<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.069> low<00:03:24.220> E

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
actually gonna be played on the low E

actually gonna be played on the low E
and<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.970> string<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.629> that's<00:03:25.840> basically<00:03:26.439> to

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
and a string and that's basically to

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.830 
and a string and that's basically to
prevent<00:03:27.129> my<00:03:27.670> hands<00:03:28.000> from<00:03:28.180> getting<00:03:28.239> all

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
prevent my hands from getting all

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.809 
prevent my hands from getting all
tangled<00:03:29.230> up<00:03:29.349> together<00:03:29.709> here<00:03:30.010> during<00:03:30.430> some<00:03:30.730> of

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
tangled up together here during some of

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.850 
tangled up together here during some of
these<00:03:30.909> changes<00:03:31.209> this<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.049> same<00:03:32.290> motion

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
these changes this is the same motion

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.220 
these changes this is the same motion
the<00:03:33.220> same<00:03:33.459> rhythmic<00:03:34.019> syncopation<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.079> should

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
the same rhythmic syncopation I should

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.649 
the same rhythmic syncopation I should
say<00:03:35.409> that<00:03:36.010> we<00:03:36.250> did<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.579> first<00:03:36.610> time<00:03:36.970> except<00:03:37.540> we

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
say that we did the first time except we

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.000 
say that we did the first time except we
are<00:03:37.690> using<00:03:37.900> double<00:03:38.260> stops<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.680> whole<00:03:38.829> time

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
are using double stops the whole time

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.800 
are using double stops the whole time
like<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:44.879> so<00:03:45.879> you<00:03:45.939> may<00:03:46.120> want<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.390> take<00:03:46.569> that
