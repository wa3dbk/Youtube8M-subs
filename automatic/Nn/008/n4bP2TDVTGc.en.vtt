00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.179
 hello hello I want to show today how 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.010
 I made my underwater worlds 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.960
 namely, I have big chains trailer 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.240
 made 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
 Here I used the medallion 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.390
 I would like to show that is convenient 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:27.480
 the medallion forms with and have 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 of course you have changed again then 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:38.329
 I changed the high voltage that is the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.329
 book multhaupt from a trailer 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:51.350
 then I have these shells too 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:58.519
 used as a trailer and of course mine 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:03.250
 beloved heart like that and I want to today 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:05.869
 show how I made this ring 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.350
 These fish swarms are all with one 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.619
 imprinted and i want you 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.330
 Show which one I used to you 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.070
 I have these for these trailers 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:23.119
 blank is used once in the rectangle and 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.140
 once in round and for this ring there 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.550
 Of course, it's just such a blank 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.229
 I would show you again that it 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:37.460
 a normal in silver here and that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.960
 is now again this mult here 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.479
 I've made a few more 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.030
 as chains 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.720
 Here I have one right away 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.390
 made like this and now wants 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.590
 I'll show which imprint I here 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.429
 used it and it was in one 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.920
 glued on flower arrangement and I have 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.729
 of course reserved and today first 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.780
 used 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.209
 I have a little piece 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.270
 cut it off so it's in a good mood 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.270
 then fits firmly pressed 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.799
 so and now it looks like small 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.799
 fish you can of course still one 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.730
 give it some color either 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.810
 green or blue 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:43.049
 then they come a little bit more 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:47.989
 to the validity so and that the fish 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:53.000
 can clearly see I give each fish 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.000
 with a needle pressed in 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:11.980
 so where I think it might look like 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:15.750
 a fish simply the needles used so 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.390
 and for me there are many fishermen now 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.620
 and so I have all made with it 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.120
 used gold powder 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.640
 and there you have many possibilities 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.700
 and you can also use many molds 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.530
 but of course also free hand like that and that 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.090
 is the ring and he looks like me 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.790
 hope you liked it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.670
