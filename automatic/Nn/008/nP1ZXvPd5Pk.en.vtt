fusion<00:00:11.360> extensions<00:00:12.280> but<00:00:13.280> first<00:00:13.580> we<00:00:14.090> need<00:00:14.180> to

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
fusion extensions but first we need to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.570 
fusion extensions but first we need to
talk<00:00:14.389> about<00:00:14.539> maintenance<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:16.010> best<00:00:16.250> thing<00:00:16.430> is

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580

talk about maintenance the best thing is
to<00:00:16.610> avoid<00:00:17.119> tangles<00:00:17.930> is<00:00:18.080> when<00:00:18.320> you<00:00:18.410> maintain

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
to avoid tangles is when you maintain

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.259 
to avoid tangles is when you maintain
and<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:19.130> brush<00:00:19.340> your<00:00:19.490> hair<00:00:19.520> twice<00:00:19.940> daily

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
and you brush your hair twice daily

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.269 
and you brush your hair twice daily
before<00:00:21.140> you<00:00:21.410> have<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.650> tangle<00:00:21.980> from<00:00:22.160> the

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
before you have the tangle from the

step-by-step fusion extensions after

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.989 
step-by-step fusion extensions after
removal<00:00:29.499> first<00:00:30.499> you<00:00:30.740> need<00:00:30.859> to<00:00:30.890> use<00:00:31.189> extension

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
removal first you need to use extension

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.850 
removal first you need to use extension

we're<00:00:43.550> going<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.730> go<00:00:43.850> ahead<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.239> spray<00:00:44.570> about

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
we're going to go ahead and spray about

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.240 
we're going to go ahead and spray about
one<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.770> trace<00:00:46.399> on<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:47.059> fusion<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.250> also

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
one to trace on the fusion and also

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.310 
one to trace on the fusion and also
we're<00:00:49.489> gonna<00:00:49.550> be<00:00:49.760> using<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.269> fusion<00:00:50.899> removal

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
we're gonna be using a fusion removal

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.029 
we're gonna be using a fusion removal
tool<00:00:51.590> it<00:00:52.129> looks<00:00:52.460> like<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:53.120> has<00:00:53.269> little

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
tool it looks like this it has little

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.610 
tool it looks like this it has little
pins<00:00:55.039> on<00:00:55.250> it<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.109> we're<00:00:57.109> gonna<00:00:57.199> go<00:00:57.410> ahead

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
pins on it and we're gonna go ahead

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.420 
pins on it and we're gonna go ahead
press<00:00:58.039> once<00:00:58.899> rotate<00:00:59.899> press<00:01:00.800> twice<00:01:01.420> rotate<00:01:02.420> and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
press once rotate press twice rotate and

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.270 
press once rotate press twice rotate and
here<00:01:04.430> we<00:01:04.519> have<00:01:04.730> it<00:01:05.440> at<00:01:06.440> this<00:01:06.710> point<00:01:07.010> in<00:01:07.160> this

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
here we have it at this point in this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.250 
here we have it at this point in this
Fusion<00:01:07.670> has<00:01:07.760> been<00:01:08.000> loosened<00:01:08.480> and<00:01:08.600> it's<00:01:09.020> very

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
Fusion has been loosened and it's very

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.850 
Fusion has been loosened and it's very
easy<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.740> remove<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:11.110> here<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:12.260> have<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.620> it's

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
easy to remove and here we have it it's

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.490 
easy to remove and here we have it it's
out<00:01:13.160> now<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.060> question<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:14.780> how<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:15.140> remove

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
out now the question is how to remove

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.040 
out now the question is how to remove
the<00:01:15.680> tango<00:01:16.100> because<00:01:16.910> we<00:01:17.150> naturally<00:01:17.630> shed

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
the tango because we naturally shed

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.380 
the tango because we naturally shed
about<00:01:18.470> fifty<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.220> hundred<00:01:19.310> strands<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.180> hair

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
about fifty to a hundred strands of hair

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.080 
about fifty to a hundred strands of hair
a<00:01:20.600> day<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:21.650> all<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.010> hair<00:01:22.220> now<00:01:22.370> is<00:01:22.550> resting<00:01:22.940> at

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
a day so all the hair now is resting at

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.200 
a day so all the hair now is resting at
this<00:01:23.300> point<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.320> we're<00:01:24.470> gonna<00:01:24.560> go<00:01:24.770> ahead<00:01:24.860> and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
this point so we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.360 
this point so we're gonna go ahead and
separate<00:01:26.210> this<00:01:26.930> section<00:01:27.440> with<00:01:27.680> our<00:01:27.710> fingers

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
separate this section with our fingers

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.300 
separate this section with our fingers
to<00:01:28.760> make<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:29.030> easier<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:30.130> then<00:01:31.130> we're<00:01:31.220> gonna

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
to make it easier and then we're gonna

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.700 
to make it easier and then we're gonna
use<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.730> small<00:01:32.120> rat<00:01:32.330> tail<00:01:32.600> comb<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.140> we're

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
use a small rat tail comb and we're

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.240 
use a small rat tail comb and we're
gonna<00:01:33.830> untangle<00:01:34.450> any<00:01:35.740> tangle<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.890> there<00:01:37.100> was

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
gonna untangle any tangle that there was

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.950 
gonna untangle any tangle that there was
left<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.980> hair<00:01:40.190> like<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:41.240> also

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
left in the hair like so and also

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.540 
left in the hair like so and also
removing<00:01:42.230> any<00:01:42.440> residue<00:01:42.860> from<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.100> protein

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
removing any residue from the protein

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.600 
removing any residue from the protein
bonds<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.170> have<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:45.830> clean

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
bonds and here we have it I clean

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.450 
bonds and here we have it I clean
sections<00:01:47.710> untangled<00:01:48.710> after<00:01:49.130> fusion

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
sections untangled after fusion

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.150 
sections untangled after fusion
