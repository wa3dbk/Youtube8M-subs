00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
need to run to each marker and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.630 
need to run to each marker and
beat<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:52.289> displayed<00:00:52.500> above<00:00:55.550> none<00:00:56.550> of

beat the time displayed above none of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.569 
beat the time displayed above none of
the<00:00:56.730> races<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.210> particularly<00:00:58.109> hard<00:00:58.370> this<00:00:59.370> one

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the races are particularly hard this one

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.240 
the races are particularly hard this one
in<00:00:59.670> my<00:00:59.699> opinion<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.890> easiest<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
in my opinion there is the easiest and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
in my opinion there is the easiest and
they'd<00:01:03.179> probably<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.659> first<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
they'd probably be the first one that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740 
they'd probably be the first one that
you<00:01:05.280> come<00:01:05.460> across<00:01:05.640> any<00:01:05.909> way

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
you come across any way

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.470 
you come across any way
it's<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.440> fairly<00:01:08.650> easy<00:01:08.860> trophy<00:01:09.370> because<00:01:09.520> all

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
it's a fairly easy trophy because all

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.980 
it's a fairly easy trophy because all
the<00:01:10.660> checkpoints<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.470> this<00:01:12.130> racer<00:01:12.670> on<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
the checkpoints and this racer on the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.940 
the checkpoints and this racer on the
rooftops<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:15.100> there's<00:01:16.090> no<00:01:16.210> people<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.710> get<00:01:17.860> in

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
rooftops so there's no people to get in

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.040 
rooftops so there's no people to get in
your<00:01:18.040> way<00:01:18.190> or<00:01:18.400> anything<00:01:18.520> like<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:19.050> you're

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
your way or anything like that you're

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.600 
your way or anything like that you're
pretty<00:01:20.229> much<00:01:20.260> just<00:01:20.440> free<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.890> run

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
pretty much just free to run

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.950 
pretty much just free to run
the<00:01:23.150> only<00:01:23.300> thing<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:23.510> could<00:01:23.660> be<00:01:23.750> annoying

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
the only thing that could be annoying

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.140 
the only thing that could be annoying
the<00:01:24.050> course<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.490> slipping<00:01:25.490> off

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.670 

and<00:01:31.630> though<00:01:31.810> you've<00:01:31.990> got<00:01:32.020> obviously<00:01:32.260> beat<00:01:32.590> the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
and though you've got obviously beat the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.090 
and though you've got obviously beat the
time<00:01:32.890> it's<00:01:33.130> best<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.730> rush<00:01:34.860> otherwise<00:01:35.860> you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
time it's best not to rush otherwise you

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.820 
time it's best not to rush otherwise you
will<00:01:36.280> fall<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.090> then<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.900> course<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.710> is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
will fall and then of course that is

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.820 
will fall and then of course that is
going<00:01:38.980> to<00:01:39.070> add<00:01:39.130> major<00:01:39.670> time<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:41.290> to<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.650> race

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
going to add major time on to the race

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.530 
going to add major time on to the race
because<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.790> have<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.030> get<00:01:43.150> back<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.330> where
