best I've felt it in there in the whole
season<00:00:36.940> cuz<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:37.750> think<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.140> I<00:00:38.379> think<00:00:39.010> everyone

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
season cuz I think that I think everyone

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.950 
season cuz I think that I think everyone
just<00:00:39.309> came<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.670> terms<00:00:39.850> with<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.329> situation<00:00:40.870> we

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
just came to terms with the situation we

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.000 
just came to terms with the situation we
were<00:00:41.050> in<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.410> think<00:00:41.590> that's<00:00:41.739> what<00:00:41.890> was

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
were in and I think that's what was

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.860 
were in and I think that's what was
needed<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.550> think<00:00:43.180> people<00:00:43.390> are<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.539> little<00:00:43.660> bit

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
needed I think people are a little bit

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.810 
needed I think people are a little bit
in<00:00:43.989> there<00:00:44.140> in<00:00:44.440> denial<00:00:44.770> about<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.399> position<00:00:45.550> we

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
in there in denial about the position we

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.399 
in there in denial about the position we
were<00:00:45.910> in<00:00:45.969> before<00:00:46.149> and<00:00:46.629> then<00:00:46.780> I<00:00:46.989> think<00:00:47.260> there

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
were in before and then I think there

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.910 
were in before and then I think there
was<00:00:47.559> some<00:00:48.429> complacent<00:00:48.999> performance<00:00:49.420> but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
was some complacent performance but

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
it was just the it was it was just the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.770 
it was just the it was it was just the
last<00:01:15.370> six<00:01:15.640> games<00:01:15.700> we<00:01:16.060> needed<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.420> do<00:01:16.540> something

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
last six games we needed to do something

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.660 
last six games we needed to do something
because<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.530> way<00:01:17.620> we<00:01:17.650> were<00:01:17.860> gone<00:01:18.040> we<00:01:18.220> were<00:01:18.340> we

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
because the way we were gone we were we

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.820 
because the way we were gone we were we
were<00:01:18.790> getting<00:01:19.000> relegated<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:20.410> job<00:01:20.590> still

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
were getting relegated and the job still

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.160 
were getting relegated and the job still
not<00:01:20.980> done<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.340> think<00:01:21.580> we<00:01:21.670> need<00:01:21.850> another<00:01:22.270> way<00:01:23.110> in

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
not done I think we need another way in

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.380 
not done I think we need another way in
another<00:01:23.470> win<00:01:23.680> or<00:01:23.890> draw<00:01:24.160> another<00:01:24.760> win<00:01:24.970> ana<00:01:25.180> draw

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
another win or draw another win ana draw

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.390 
another win or draw another win ana draw
will<00:01:25.720> definitely<00:01:26.200> secure<00:01:26.710> as<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:26.920> reckon<00:01:27.220> so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
will definitely secure as I reckon so

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.240 
will definitely secure as I reckon so
well<00:01:27.640> hopefully<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:29.320> we're<00:01:29.860> taking

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
well hopefully and but we're taking

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.730 
well hopefully and but we're taking
we're<00:01:30.460> taking<00:01:30.820> him<00:01:31.000> control<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:31.870> what<00:01:32.440> we<00:01:32.590> can

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.240 
changed their you're not making mistakes
as<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.720> team<00:01:50.050> yeah<00:01:50.440> that's<00:01:50.740> what's<00:01:50.920> changed

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
as a team yeah that's what's changed

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.970 
as a team yeah that's what's changed
yeah<00:01:51.790> but<00:01:52.390> why<00:01:52.960> did<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.320> worked<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.620> it<00:01:53.680> more

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
yeah but why did you worked on it more

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.620 
yeah but why did you worked on it more
on<00:01:54.160> training<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:54.760> was<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.150> just<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.420> mental

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
on training or was it just a mental

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.810 
on training or was it just a mental
thing<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.170> everybody<00:01:56.350> switched<00:01:56.800> on<00:01:57.040> I<00:01:57.220> think

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
thing and everybody switched on I think

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.340 
thing and everybody switched on I think
maybe<00:01:57.940> your<00:01:58.150> mental<00:01:58.420> thing<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.840> mental<00:01:59.320> thing

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
maybe your mental thing a mental thing

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.320 
maybe your mental thing a mental thing
definitely<00:01:59.680> because<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.340> think<00:02:00.910> everyone<00:02:01.240> was

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
definitely because I think everyone was

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.430 
definitely because I think everyone was
writing<00:02:01.570> us<00:02:01.660> off<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.050> I<00:02:02.080> think<00:02:02.260> that<00:02:02.410> that

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
writing us off and I think that that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.990 
writing us off and I think that that
might<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.950> upset<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.340> few<00:02:03.430> people<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.970> I

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
might have upset a few people and I

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.850 
might have upset a few people and I
think<00:02:04.150> that's<00:02:04.300> what<00:02:04.450> what<00:02:04.750> was<00:02:04.870> needed<00:02:05.020> him

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
think that's what what was needed him

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.369 
think that's what what was needed him
but<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:07.030> lads<00:02:07.210> have<00:02:07.390> definitely<00:02:08.080> answered

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379
