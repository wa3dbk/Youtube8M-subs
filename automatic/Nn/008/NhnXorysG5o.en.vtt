00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.179
 what is modern 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.480
 linoleum 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.460
 it is primarily in practically 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.080
 indelible behind it does not respond to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.370
 water 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.400
 environmentally friendly difficult 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.160
 flammable has antistatic 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 and bacteriostatic properties when 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.750
 laying linoleum base should be 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.460
 smooth and smooth and dry measurements need 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.789
 do by the greatest length and width 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.529
 premises including doorways stock 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.720
 10 centimeters on each side 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.910
 the coating is always set when 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.130
 room temperature and pre 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.840
 rolled out to smooth out the material 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.020
 camping and adjusting to the temperature 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.020
 premises 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.809
 one of the ways linoleum flooring 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.629
 glue this way we recommend on 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.120
 premises over 20 square meters or 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 high traffic linoleum 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.699
 otlekalis glue is ready and we proceed 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.289
 unscrew part of the floor covering 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.289
 apply glue to the concrete surface 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.360
 putting back and making sure that the cover 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 lay right hands smooth on 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 towards the corners 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.250
 then unscrew the second part and repeat 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:38.159
 all over again the initial stage is the same 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.289
 roll out roll we measure cut off but 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.390
 lay on and mark on so that was 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.610
 overlap 8 centimeters cover on the wall 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.039
 to dock two lanes rolls need 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.649
 adjacent surfaces lay on edge 1 on 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.569
 others on top of the lineup together 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.690
 cover cut through the codes 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.630
 surfaces turned out now remove 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.299
 circle unscrew the joint edge along the seam 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.960
 apply glue and lay double sided 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.960
 adhesive tape 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.759
 then lay again and cover 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.610
 pressing down at both ends 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.670
 mid-seam to make linoleum more 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.349
 soft use an industrial hairdryer 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.270
 warm air stream to place hard 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.810
 linoleum and it will become exactly the contour 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.810
 corner 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.920
 pay attention to the processing option 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 seam 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.610
 special nozzle for industrial 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.810
 Hairdryer cord for soldering seams will give 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.970
 quality result 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.970
 underworking 2 sections of linoleum
