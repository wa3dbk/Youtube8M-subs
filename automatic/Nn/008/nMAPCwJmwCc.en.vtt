ironically<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.200> what's<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.440> odd<00:00:40.649> about

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
ironically I think what's so odd about

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
ironically I think what's so odd about
this<00:00:41.070> whole<00:00:41.250> process<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.090> dragged

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
this whole process and how it's dragged

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.389 
this whole process and how it's dragged
on<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.930> he<00:00:43.410> never<00:00:43.649> ended<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:43.980> taking<00:00:44.190> an

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
on is he never ended up taking an

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.740 
on is he never ended up taking an
official<00:00:44.760> visit<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> either<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> those

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
official visit to either one of those

State now a two horse race for at least
six<00:00:50.640> weeks<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
six weeks so I'm kind of I'm kind of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.810 
six weeks so I'm kind of I'm kind of
perplexed<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> why<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.070> even<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
perplexed as to why it even got to this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.689 
perplexed as to why it even got to this
point<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.110> being<00:00:55.379> said<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:56.460> you're

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
point with that being said if you're

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.939 
point with that being said if you're
making<00:00:57.090> comparisons<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.960> mean<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.410> guy<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.620> an

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
making comparisons I mean the guy is an

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.760 
making comparisons I mean the guy is an
amazing<00:00:59.399> athlete<00:00:59.730> 66<00:01:00.420> 230<00:01:01.050> who<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.649> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
amazing athlete 66 230 who would you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.820 
amazing athlete 66 230 who would you
compare<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> player<00:01:02.879> Tom<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.830> think

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
compare them to as a player Tom I think

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.350 
compare them to as a player Tom I think
the<00:01:04.890> natural<00:01:05.040> comparisons<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:05.970> obviously

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the natural comparisons are obviously

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
the natural comparisons are obviously
drawn<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.869> Vince<00:01:07.080> Young<00:01:07.380> both<00:01:07.680> coming<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
drawn to Vince Young both coming out of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
drawn to Vince Young both coming out of
high<00:01:08.340> school<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.150> measurables<00:01:09.720> are<00:01:09.869> present

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
high school the measurables are present

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.289 
high school the measurables are present
better<00:01:10.740> runners<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.430> are<00:01:11.549> pastors<00:01:12.150> at

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
better runners and they are pastors at

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
better runners and they are pastors at
that<00:01:12.479> early<00:01:12.869> stage<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.070> both<00:01:14.220> need

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that early stage and I think both need

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
that early stage and I think both need
to<00:01:14.580> develop<00:01:14.880> during<00:01:15.299> their<00:01:15.570> college<00:01:15.840> ranks

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to develop during their college ranks

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.899 
to develop during their college ranks
and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.070> Vince<00:01:17.280> Young<00:01:17.490> obviously

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and I think that Vince Young obviously

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
and I think that Vince Young obviously
did<00:01:18.090> we'll<00:01:18.450> find<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.020> Terrelle<00:01:19.350> Pryor

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
did we'll find out if Terrelle Pryor

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
did we'll find out if Terrelle Pryor
will<00:01:20.280> develop<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> same<00:01:21.180> manner<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
will develop in the same manner as a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
will develop in the same manner as a
passer<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> choice<00:01:23.340> he<00:01:23.580> made

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
passer and I think the choice he made

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660 
passer and I think the choice he made
today<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.080> best<00:01:25.350> choice<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.950> aid<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
today was the best choice to aid in that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
today was the best choice to aid in that
development<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> road<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.049> he's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
development down the road because he's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
development down the road because he's
not<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.770> asked<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.220> Ohio<00:01:29.460> State<00:01:29.759> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
not going to be asked at Ohio State to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
not going to be asked at Ohio State to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
really work on his passing game the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
really work on his passing game the
footwork<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.720> throwing<00:01:49.140> motion<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:50.009> know

footwork the throwing motion you know
pick<00:01:50.399> up<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.270> progressions<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
pick up the the progressions and the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.960 
pick up the the progressions and the

tendencies in the passing game and I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.520 
tendencies in the passing game and I
think<00:01:54.240> he<00:01:54.329> needs<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.570> year<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> do<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.200> new

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
think he needs a year to do that new

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.850 
think he needs a year to do that new
great<00:01:55.770> time<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:57.020> completely<00:01:58.020> agree<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.530> don't

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
great time I completely agree I don't

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590

know<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.159> he'll<00:01:59.310> redshirt<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.479> he's

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
know if he'll redshirt I I think he's

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.060 
know if he'll redshirt I I think he's
