00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.180
 massaging set in full in the coming years 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.130
 on plug-in hybrid technology 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.660
 the brand has announced to the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 with no fewer than ten of them in the coming years 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 those models to come and we know now 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.640
 of course all the s501 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.989
 and this is model no 2 de c 350 e and this one 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.460
 car goes very much for the Netherlands 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.660
 become important 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 because of that plug-in hybrid technology 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.190
 this c 350 has a right to seven 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.190
 percent tax addition this year 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 and with that comes a very small one 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.370
 select market club certainly in the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.570
 higher segment there is not much choice yet 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.280
 and you have the mitsubishi outlander 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.470
 plugin hybrid that has seven percent 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.880
 the front has the v60 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.160
 Volkswagen has that of course 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.560
 the trade will be coming soon 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.220
 and bmw that blood on a 3 series with this one 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.450
 technology 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.310
 but then you have had it a bit 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.310
 and now this c-class 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.220
 at least it seems in the books 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.439
 a very interesting car but you have to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.600
 or immediately take it that it is determined 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.210
 no advantageous choice, it is this 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.979
 limousine costs at least 58,000 euros 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.469
 which is very popular in the Netherlands 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.789
 will be cost at least 60 backs and 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.880
 that of course remains a lot of money 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.200
 for a car 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.729
 on the other hand puts Mercedes-Benz do 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 immediately a very thick version 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.299
 have only one variant the lease edition 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.460
 and it is simply full of tasty 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.040
 stuff hey you have air suspension look one 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.470
 very sovereign chassis you have 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.710
 leather upholstery and navigation systems 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.270
 good climate control so yes you know if 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.530
 you have all those things on board 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 with that, naturally, a good buyer 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.990
 Moreover if you only have 7% of that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.680
 60,000 euros with income 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.210
 count 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.210
 yes then you have very little to wear 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.189
 mama van 7 in technicality the van 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.560
 this car 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.270
 the c 350 e is therefore a gasoline hybrid 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.520
 no diesel hybrid like you do at volvo 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.250
 gets a 2-liter for the nose 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.830
 turbo gasoline engine work with 211 hp 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.630
 it is always linked to the known 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.849
 sef and john i gearbox one 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.980
 vending machine yes he is not completely known 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.050
 because for this car mercedes-benz 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.000
 the electric motor very ingenious if 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.800
 gearbox built 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.569
 the electric motor is good for some 60 kilo 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.330
 and live together this system a total 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.459
 power of 279 hp 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.080
 and more importantly 600 multimeter one 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.630
 torque and that in turn delivers a car 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.459
 out of 100 in 5.9 seconds 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.810
 therefore also in terms of performance 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.170
 you with this car just very little 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.170
 to complain 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.379
 this c 350 e can not be done purely electrically 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.940
 more than 31 kilometers in one go 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.319
 and yes that is of course one 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.180
 absolute smile 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.739
 a pure case of symbol politics too 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.150
 because in china and those are whole 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.340
 important market for this car 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.440
 There are parents who travel more than 30 km 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.390
 being able to travel electrically 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.010
 therefore exempt from a number of fines 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.700
 terms of sale for that type of car 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.319
 there are better and therefore mercedes 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.620
 it exactly so figured out that this one 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.650
 car 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.599
 31 km can drive electric yes but in 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.420
 the netherlands hey when i go to myself 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.459
 Look I have 50 km commuting 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.690
 back and forth so that means you 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.459
 don't even go to work electrically 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.799
 collision yes it is actually one 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.329
 drop on a glowing plate but good 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.280
 important is how the hybrid system 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.390
 works and if you're so move in 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.470
 this c class 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.120
 then you notice that mercedes de 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.290
 interplay between electric motor and 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.329
 combustion engine is good 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.200
 figured out if you have a similar one 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.720
 example with the diesel hybrid 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.180
 combination in the v60 from volvo 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.260
 then you notice that the engine runs very smoothly 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.120
 and turns off 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.410
 you don't notice much vibration 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.150
 comparison with, for example, seeing set 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.440
 system that mounts lexus and with that 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.730
 central heating machine 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.859
 You notice that you have even more sophistication 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.200
 and that is mainly due to the 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.040
 saving john me because that is not always 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.040
 just relax at rest 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.040
 in theory the c class is with this 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.989
 powertrain good for an average 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.620
 fuel consumption of 2.1 liters per 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.599
 100km 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.000
 well count on that of course 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.709
 far too rosy but 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.720
 Mercedes does have a number of tricks in it 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.010
 This c-class is hidden which help you to 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.229
 to drive as economically as possible 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.240
 the first system is linked to you 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.560
 navigation system you order a 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.780
 destination in the heart for example 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.310
 Amsterdam then the car remembers it 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.500
 wise because electro power 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.210
 keep it behind you so that you will soon 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.570
 electric through a city center 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.940
 screws 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.169
 yes that could of course be that summer 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.039
 in the future, systems like that 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.870
 become mandatory 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.130
 so don't keep this car there 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.419
 take into account 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.160
 a second system and that's what 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.930
 more special because that other system 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.520
 does bmw appeal the room in the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.770
 active hybrid 5 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.630
 but Mercedes has one on this car 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.970
 She added that she had a nice touch 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.560
 word and haptic gas pedal call it 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.370
 system works together with the radar in the 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.229
 nose of the car 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.419
 he tells the behavior of the cars 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.250
 you notice the couple in front 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.850
 goes off his grass then the radar notices 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.770
 Which 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.960
 and then the system and training gives you 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.539
 in your gas pedal and you should 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.979
 to make better use of 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.570
 the deployment capacities 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.000
 as soon as you feel that someone is feeling you love it 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.130
 foot of gas and around the car without it 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.960
 that the engine turns off and that kind 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.940
 educational helpers have to go for it 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.470
 ensure that you actually economical it 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.729
 drive this car 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.120
 so in practice it works very well 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.120
 fairly 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.100
 well that kind of gimmicks are the essence 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.500
 of the mercedes-benz c 350 e 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.090
 the answer is no the most important 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.920
 that this car actually proves that 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.380
 hybrid driving is no longer a compromise 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.820
 is and what actually has this car 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.930
 everything your heart desires without it 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.930
 let you do anything for it 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.730
 well it is not entirely true because ten 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.710
 compared to other c class, this c 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.270
 350 th indeed a little less practical 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.220
 the batteries of the hybrid package 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.750
 namely lie on the rear axle and that 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.950
 ensures that the luggage space such 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.050
 bit comes up 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.880
 that saves around 135 liters so he 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.710
 is just a little less handy 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.380
 nice is that the rear seat back 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.090
 being flat can therefore be very inconvenient 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.400
 again not in front and there is city riders 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.220
 another point because there it is 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.710
 not possible to have a towbar 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.000
 combine with 7% addition that cars 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.950
 get different rear tires 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.050
 thereby the CO2 emissions rises 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.790
 above 50 grams per kilometer 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.520
 And that means you get 14 percent 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.230
 have an addition for your c 350 e estate 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.000
 so yes there are some downsides to this one 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.980
 c class but apart from that 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.570
 people who can drive a c 350 e whatever 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.380
 from now on my mouth is mostly concerned 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.210
 to hold 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.980
 because if you have this car that you secondary 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.970
 Count of employment you 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.970
 especially a lucky bastard
