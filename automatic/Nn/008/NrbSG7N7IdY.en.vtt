00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.599
 this week and that should take you 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.250
 in the north no calais at the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.600
 meeting the most beautiful quarters 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.510
 back French where the most French 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 Belgian riders elisabeth hardy en 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.000
 did I am I was born close to 1000 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.980
 so with Belgian parents so that's 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.190
 for that I have Belgian nationality 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.199
 but it's true that I live in this 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.239
 region but it's Belgium is there 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.340
 and the wb she decided to represent 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.649
 competing in his discipline 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.690
 endurance not the most popular of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.370
 equestrian disciplines elisabeth was 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.379
 far from being interested herself when 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 she started riding at the age of 6 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.820
 years old ah no banon when would be when one 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.520
 starts to ride on horseback we see everything 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.060
 immediately the first disciplines 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.570
 the jumping of dressage is sure that 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.369
 endurance 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
 we do not think about it right now but I have 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.799
 had the chance to have a monitor in the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.899
 club for which I ride and suddenly 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.460
 that's how I put myself 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.909
 at least it's true that it's a 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.969
 discipline totally apart that's all 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.069
 right away what I like is 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.219
 to be outside and then also the contact 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.380
 tale with our ditches really made of 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.909
 the race but in longer longer 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.049
 this is really a world totally 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.819
 apart and that's really what I like 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.799
 well endurance is not a 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.539
 ordinary discipline if only by 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.310
 the time spent on the horse in 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.899
 competition or training 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.670
 a parameter with which you have to 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.319
 physically compose but also in this 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.849
 which concerns the use of time not 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.709
 always easy to reconcile with his 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.520
 preparatory studies at a school of 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.049
 trade 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.579
 I have no calais to mount my choices 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.270
 between giving up my horses so you have to 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.849
 enjoy training them ourselves so 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.009
 when I start in the morning either I try 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.840
 to climb too early in the morning or late 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.829
 evening 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.549
 it's sure it's a big day 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.389
 but that's how it's passion 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.819
 it is true that it is a lot of time 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.889
 it's true that by jumping us or 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.440
 dressage we spend one hour to one hour 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:27.109
 to the max on a horse here 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.180
 it's at least an hour and a half after 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:33.340
 sometimes it can take the day 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.920
 so it's not easy to know 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.450
 juggling between studies and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.360
 workouts is good it takes when we 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.560
 wants we can 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.930
 but the sacrifices have quickly forgotten 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.489
 when the results are key 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.049
 most beautiful races that I could do 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.459
 it was still the championships 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.090
 I had made the European Championships 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:59.019
 in Germany to hollow confused second to 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.170
 in team so I'm super great 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.590
 remember after there were the championships 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.970
 of the world in Abu Dhabi where I finished 9th 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.640
 the first European individual with a 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.380
 really an exceptional horse the day 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.760
 we do not even realize how much 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.519
 we did because it's so 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.940
 hard more often there under the heat 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.410
 etc. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.730
 we do not really realize it's after 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.799
 afterwards we are we are still 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.150
 proud of the result we could do because 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.690
 that it's hours out of work 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.400
 so we are proud 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.260
 the horse following his good results 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 been sold and turned out to be a 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.220
 champion one gives with which she 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.209
 also must dial the rider even if 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.690
 it's far from easy 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.310
 Oh no it's safe especially when it's 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.350
 a little special choices often like that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.459
 or to which we attach enough 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.590
 easily 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.840
 so no, it's difficult 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.489
 behind there are the owners who 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.250
 give us horses is good it takes 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.950
 you have to know how to live a little bit of that 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.380
 that's what makes our sport live so 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.319
 it's the hazards of sport of course but 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.670
 after that, everything is alive 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.630
 behind 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.840
 fortunately for Elizabeth there are 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.760
 successors in quercy co from court 10 to 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.150
 local I introduced you horses that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.269
 I have been working for some time there 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.269
 and 6 elect then hit the clash 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.910
 I hope it's a horse 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.010
 takes 7 years I make them year deciding 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.200
 he did all the circuit young horses 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.000
 in France so that's all he did 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.510
 these qualifications in France when he 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.280
 must etc 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.660
 and I think it's a horse of the future 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.300
 so that's it he's gonna he's hoping without real 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.060
 we will try to qualify it 120 kg and 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.720
 do not know that I appreciate a lot painted 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.840
 either stormy atmosphere 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.880
 this is a very not in the blood is 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.990
 small but in the sense and that's it 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.990
 really what I like more 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.530
 so after this one it's tablets that 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.530
 always have trouble ball 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.430
 more experience and takes it takes eight 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.630
 years ago he already did and already qualified 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.220
 last year and not with me it's 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.430
 because I 'm doing it's a new one 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.010
 that I work and here we learn to 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.190
 get to know each other and it turns out that it's a 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.190
 monster 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:42.250
 so here it's at home so it's a 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.250
 little gem 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.930
 so if a large beautiful mare that I 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.220
 or trail last September 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.669
 this is a real mare anyway 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.070
 can go to show enough 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.820
 tricky to climb but for me it's 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.960
 really one of the great hopes etc 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.680
 she is a mare who has a lot of 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.570
 big fat gallop it's really 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.720
 a lot of hope for this year we 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.479
 try to ride the horses 4 5 x 6 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.660
 once a week anyway we say 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:22.960
 often it's at least an hour and a half 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:27.320
 then we go up in intensity 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.660
 the closer we get to the race and after 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.410
 we integrate sessions of gallop beach 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.169
 and so on 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.819
 more we approach the highest race 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.740
 goes up in intensity this is what is 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.840
 nice endurance that's it he goes 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.550
 still know how to know 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.819
 how can we bring such 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:48.229
 horse at the top today has the hours 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.749
 training then succeeds 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.460
 sometimes under the eyes of the owner of 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:55.639
 stud of madness and coach of 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.860
 lisabeth the feeling i think this 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.830
 sums up well the sparkling wells 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.330
 nice and very friendly have a 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.069
 girl is patente we really enjoy 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.839
 to work with her she is very 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.479
 professional level horses at the 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:11.089
 of feeling and that's really 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.860
 appreciable very light in saddle very 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:15.080
 who forgot about his horse I think 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.729
 and that's his first quality of 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.259
 do a little forget then in all 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.479
 circumstances it's okay even with a 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.129
 mare who push up like there no one has 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.810
 not too worries what if the goal 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.460
 first of this team specializing in 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.560
 racehorses and endurance and the 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.180
 marketing the 20-year-old rider 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.699
 does not lose its objectives 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.339
 sports with a dream participate one day 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:37.069
 to the world games and why not ebriés 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:39.529
 it's always dreaming you may be 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:41.949
 that one day I will have the crazy horse for 

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:44.120
 do it and it's on it's really 

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:47.110
 accessible of course I hope someday 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.110
 it will happen 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.219
