part for a housewife in the movie with a
child<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.200> thought<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.500> was<00:01:40.590> really

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
child and I thought that was really

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
child and I thought that was really
interesting<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.939> only<00:01:41.970> did<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.390> give

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
interesting because not only did it give

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.990 
interesting because not only did it give
me<00:01:42.659> any<00:01:42.810> challenges<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.979> also<00:01:44.100> makes

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
me any challenges but it also makes

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.370 
me any challenges but it also makes
Alice<00:01:45.509> more<00:01:46.259> relatable<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> people<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.610> also

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
Alice more relatable to people and also

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.600 
Alice more relatable to people and also
shows<00:01:49.380> people<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.710> different<00:01:49.860> side<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> her

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
shows people a different side of her

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.420 
shows people a different side of her
