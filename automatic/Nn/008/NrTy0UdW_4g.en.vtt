humblest people I know that's Bob from
wild<00:00:54.290> Bob's<00:00:54.500> RC<00:00:55.130> sent<00:00:56.030> me<00:00:56.270> an<00:00:56.600> RC<00:00:57.500> car<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.280> you

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
wild Bob's RC sent me an RC car and you

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.180 
wild Bob's RC sent me an RC car and you
know<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.420> is<00:00:59.600> just<00:00:59.630> not<00:01:00.080> any<00:01:00.320> RC<00:01:00.770> car<00:01:01.010> this

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
know this is just not any RC car this

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.400 
know this is just not any RC car this
one<00:01:01.460> is<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.670> four-wheel-drive<00:01:02.240> and<00:01:02.630> nitro

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
one is a four-wheel-drive and nitro

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.740 
one is a four-wheel-drive and nitro
powered<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.160> then<00:01:04.850> we<00:01:04.970> messed<00:01:05.210> with<00:01:05.300> RC<00:01:05.720> cars

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
powered and then we messed with RC cars

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.040 
powered and then we messed with RC cars
much<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:06.590> for<00:01:06.770> me<00:01:06.920> this<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.310> real<00:01:07.610> treat<00:01:08.050> so

those of you folks thinking about maybe

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.280 
those of you folks thinking about maybe
getting<00:01:11.090> one<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.420> these<00:01:11.630> I'm<00:01:11.840> going<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.080> show

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
getting one of these I'm going to show

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.990 
getting one of these I'm going to show
you<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.710> can<00:01:12.890> see<00:01:13.070> some<00:01:13.250> close-up<00:01:13.700> stills

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
you so you can see some close-up stills

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.290 
you so you can see some close-up stills
here<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.390> study<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.560> first<00:01:15.800> run<00:01:16.100> I<00:01:16.340> need

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
here to study and the first run I need

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.359 
here to study and the first run I need
to<00:01:17.390> break<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.200> little<00:01:18.680> bit<00:01:18.830> rich<00:01:19.160> at

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
to break it in a little bit rich at

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.670 
to break it in a little bit rich at
first<00:01:19.610> so<00:01:19.940> this<00:01:20.270> first<00:01:20.479> run<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.930> my<00:01:21.140> break-in

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
first so this first run is my break-in

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.310 
first so this first run is my break-in
moment<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.910> far<00:01:23.180> I<00:01:23.210> can<00:01:23.540> see<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.869> parts<00:01:24.200> of

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
moment so far I can see the parts of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.650 
moment so far I can see the parts of
machine<00:01:24.619> work<00:01:24.800> are<00:01:25.010> very<00:01:25.310> nicely<00:01:25.610> done<00:01:26.000> this

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
machine work are very nicely done this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.770 
machine work are very nicely done this
is<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.900> 1/10<00:01:27.619> scale<00:01:27.920> RC<00:01:28.520> car<00:01:28.850> called<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.390> Forza

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
is a 1/10 scale RC car called a Forza

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.890 
is a 1/10 scale RC car called a Forza
it's<00:01:30.560> new<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.100> improved<00:01:31.430> Forza<00:01:31.790> has<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.119> 18

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
it's new and improved Forza has a 18

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.570 
it's new and improved Forza has a 18
engine<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.650> new<00:01:33.800> porting<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.430> new

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
engine in it new porting and a new

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.760 
engine in it new porting and a new
crankshaft<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.810> we're<00:01:35.990> gonna<00:01:36.080> see<00:01:36.380> just<00:01:36.410> how

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
crankshaft so we're gonna see just how

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.160 
crankshaft so we're gonna see just how
well<00:01:37.009> it<00:01:37.160> runs<00:01:37.310> on<00:01:37.580> this<00:01:37.820> 2.5<00:01:38.540> millimeter

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
well it runs on this 2.5 millimeter

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.710 
well it runs on this 2.5 millimeter
chassis<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:40.430> looks<00:01:40.759> like<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.210> front<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.600> rear

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
chassis it looks like the front and rear

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.779 
chassis it looks like the front and rear
differential<00:01:42.410> design<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.920> pretty<00:01:43.190> cool<00:01:43.520> too

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
differential design is pretty cool too

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.700 
differential design is pretty cool too
because<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.390> only<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.780> few<00:01:44.929> screws<00:01:45.289> removed

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710

for<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.740> planes<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.340> alleys<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.090> didn't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
for my planes and alleys but I didn't

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
for my planes and alleys but I didn't
have<00:02:17.510> any<00:02:17.750> 20%<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.980> that's<00:02:19.220> what<00:02:19.460> Bob

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
have any 20% and that's what Bob

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.150 
have any 20% and that's what Bob
recommended<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.660> get<00:02:20.959> well<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.560> closest<00:02:22.010> I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
recommended I get well the closest I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.790 
recommended I get well the closest I
could<00:02:22.220> get<00:02:22.610> was<00:02:22.760> 25%<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.440> should<00:02:24.620> work

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
could get was 25% and that should work

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.890 
could get was 25% and that should work
just<00:02:24.830> fine<00:02:25.160> with<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.640> castor<00:02:26.060> synthetic<00:02:26.630> oil

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
just fine with the castor synthetic oil

we do in model airplanes so I've removed
the<00:03:38.810> pressure<00:03:39.590> line<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:39.950> put<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.730> line<00:03:40.969> I'm

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
the pressure line and put a line I'm

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.420 
the pressure line and put a line I'm
gonna<00:03:41.299> blow<00:03:41.510> on<00:03:41.719> it<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:42.049> fill<00:03:42.620> this<00:03:42.890> line<00:03:43.189> with

remember when this gets wet with fuel or
if<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.330> gets<00:04:50.510> wet<00:04:50.690> with<00:04:50.930> you'll<00:04:51.110> just<00:04:51.409> like<00:04:51.560> a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
if it gets wet with you'll just like a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.460 
if it gets wet with you'll just like a
helicopter<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:53.630> will<00:04:53.810> richen<00:04:54.169> up<00:04:54.289> your

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
helicopter that will richen up your

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.469 
helicopter that will richen up your
mixture<00:04:54.889> so<00:04:55.849> let's<00:04:56.030> go<00:04:56.120> ahead<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.360> see<00:04:56.449> if

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
mixture so let's go ahead and see if

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.870 
mixture so let's go ahead and see if
it'll<00:04:56.659> start<00:04:56.960> in<00:04:57.139> here<00:04:57.320> right<00:04:57.560> now<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:58.039> then

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
it'll start in here right now and then

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.430 
it'll start in here right now and then
if<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.120> does<00:04:59.300> we'll<00:04:59.539> take<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.810> outside<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.320> run

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
if it does we'll take it outside and run

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.750 
if it does we'll take it outside and run
a<00:05:00.470> little<00:05:00.680> bit<00:05:00.860> because<00:05:00.979> we<00:05:01.159> need<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.400> brake<00:05:01.580> in

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
a little bit because we need to brake in

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.050 
a little bit because we need to brake in
the<00:05:01.789> engine<00:05:02.240> okay<00:05:03.460> let's<00:05:04.460> give<00:05:04.639> it<00:05:04.669> a<00:05:04.820> shot

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
the engine okay let's give it a shot

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:20.460 
the engine okay let's give it a shot
here

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.610 

I<00:05:20.760> had<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.910> bridging<00:05:22.270> up<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.990> low<00:05:23.170> end<00:05:23.380> needle

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
I had to bridging up the low end needle

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.060 
I had to bridging up the low end needle
valve<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.220> also<00:05:24.970> tiny<00:05:25.630> up<00:05:25.930> rich<00:05:26.530> up<00:05:26.710> there<00:05:26.860> for

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
valve and also tiny up rich up there for

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.560 
valve and also tiny up rich up there for
our<00:05:27.160> altitude<00:05:27.490> okay<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.210> might<00:05:28.330> want<00:05:28.510> to

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
our altitude okay you might want to

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.300 
our altitude okay you might want to
consider<00:05:28.870> cutting<00:05:29.200> this<00:05:29.440> out<00:05:29.650> because<00:05:30.130> you

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
consider cutting this out because you

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.270 
consider cutting this out because you
see<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.990> servo<00:05:31.990> arm<00:05:32.320> is<00:05:32.590> hitting<00:05:32.890> that<00:05:33.070> I'm

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
see the servo arm is hitting that I'm

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.100 
see the servo arm is hitting that I'm
gonna<00:05:33.490> cut<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:33.850> little<00:05:34.180> spark<00:05:34.510> I'll<00:05:34.870> cut<00:05:35.080> out

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
gonna cut that little spark I'll cut out

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.750 
gonna cut that little spark I'll cut out
the<00:05:35.350> notch<00:05:35.530> there<00:05:35.830> I<00:05:36.010> know<00:05:36.100> I<00:05:36.190> can<00:05:36.430> feel<00:05:36.580> this

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
the notch there I know I can feel this

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.700 
the notch there I know I can feel this
plastic<00:05:37.300> off<00:05:37.420> and<00:05:37.480> make<00:05:37.840> this<00:05:37.960> even<00:05:38.290> shinier

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
plastic off and make this even shinier

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.320 
plastic off and make this even shinier
but<00:05:38.860> as<00:05:38.950> long<00:05:39.100> as<00:05:39.130> it's<00:05:39.340> rolling<00:05:39.490> upside<00:05:40.090> down

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
but as long as it's rolling upside down

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.630 
but as long as it's rolling upside down
I<00:05:40.360> don't<00:05:40.630> think<00:05:40.840> I'm<00:05:40.930> gonna<00:05:41.080> do<00:05:41.290> that<00:05:41.640> okay

turning down the trim on the transmitter
will<00:07:21.550> kill<00:07:21.759> the<00:07:21.910> engine<00:07:22.240> right<00:07:22.720> now<00:07:22.900> I'm<00:07:23.020> just
