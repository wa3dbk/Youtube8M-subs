I'm<00:05:14.959> not<00:05:15.139> watching<00:05:15.289> the<00:05:15.529> time<00:05:15.739> but<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.009> think

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:27.999 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.849 

it's<00:05:28.999> like<00:05:29.239> redundant<00:05:29.929> in<00:05:30.049> repetitive<00:05:30.469> and

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:30.859 
it's like redundant in repetitive and

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:32.859 
it's like redundant in repetitive and
redundant<00:05:31.399> and<00:05:31.579> repetitive<00:05:32.119> in<00:05:32.269> repetitive

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:32.869 
redundant and repetitive in repetitive

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:40.659 
redundant and repetitive in repetitive
and<00:05:33.019> redundant<00:05:33.529> and<00:05:33.709> resists<00:05:38.860> I'm<00:05:39.860> getting<00:05:40.429> so

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
and redundant and resists I'm getting so

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.459 
and redundant and resists I'm getting so
dizzy<00:05:40.909> flipping<00:05:41.569> around

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.659 
dizzy flipping around
I<00:05:44.289> should<00:05:45.289> just<00:05:45.319> mess<00:05:45.769> you<00:05:45.919> up<00:05:45.979> and<00:05:46.339> switch

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
I should just mess you up and switch

gained<00:06:29.389> my<00:06:29.719> time<00:06:30.019> at<00:06:30.649> the<00:06:30.799> beginning<00:06:30.919> with<00:06:31.339> my

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:31.369 
gained my time at the beginning with my

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.669 
gained my time at the beginning with my
jumps<00:06:31.879> does<00:06:32.029> I<00:06:32.149> speed<00:06:32.479> up<00:06:32.569> at<00:06:32.779> a<00:06:32.809> one<00:06:33.049> spot<00:06:33.409> too

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:33.679 
jumps does I speed up at a one spot too

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:36.100 
jumps does I speed up at a one spot too
like<00:06:34.069> that<00:06:34.339> and<00:06:34.879> then<00:06:34.999> he<00:06:35.179> had<00:06:35.389> a<00:06:35.419> missed<00:06:35.749> jump

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
like that and then he had a missed jump

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.949 
like that and then he had a missed jump
there<00:06:36.349> at<00:06:36.499> the<00:06:36.649> end

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:37.959
