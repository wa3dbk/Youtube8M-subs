00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.400
 belief that he is an aggressive animal 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.230
 very easily to bite when being 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.779
 human, all this is false 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.349
 in fact the rottweiler is a very animal 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.720
 docile loyal loving and obedient more than 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.060

 select the most dominant dogs 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.010
 but in reality we are facing a race 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.830
 very submissive and docile with its owner is 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.520
 inherent in the race a loyalty 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.460

 He is lovely with the family and also 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.740
 very tolerant with children the problem 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.110
 is that it has a lot of energy so there's 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.630
 to know how to control so that in their 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.030
 games do not hurt anyone 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.009
 that's what we need a good training 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.070
 to help us to dominate this courageous 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.110

 guard dog but will not attack without 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.069
 provocation under no circumstances is a
