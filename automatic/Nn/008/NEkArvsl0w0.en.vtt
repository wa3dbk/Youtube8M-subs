what<00:01:36.509> I'm<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.960> I'm<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
walk<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:38.130> through<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.939> dimensions

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
walk you through all the dimensions

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.080 
walk you through all the dimensions
starting<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> side<00:01:40.610> okay<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> height

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
starting with the side okay the height

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.050 
starting with the side okay the height
is<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> foot<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> four<00:01:43.500> inches<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.549> width<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
is a foot and four inches the width is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.600 
is a foot and four inches the width is
11<00:01:45.509> inches<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.189> angles

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
11 inches and then you have your angles

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.660 
11 inches and then you have your angles
for<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.090> piece<00:01:48.360> 135<00:01:49.259> degrees<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.399> top

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
for this piece 135 degrees and the top

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.310 
for this piece 135 degrees and the top
is<00:01:50.869> ninety<00:01:51.869> point<00:01:52.170> seven<00:01:52.619> degrees<00:01:54.170> I'm<00:01:55.170> going

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
is ninety point seven degrees I'm going

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.959 
is ninety point seven degrees I'm going
to<00:01:55.409> scroll<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:56.869> from<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> top

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
to scroll to the back from the top

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
to scroll to the back from the top
actually<00:01:59.969> let's<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.110> quite

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
actually let's see that it's not quite

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.740 
actually let's see that it's not quite
right

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.920 

okay<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.740> dimensions<00:02:06.550> on<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.850> back<00:02:07.710> are

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
okay so the dimensions on the back are

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.370 
okay so the dimensions on the back are
there<00:02:10.930> we<00:02:11.080> go

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
there we go

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.340 
there we go
10<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.460> 5/8<00:02:13.740> tall<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:16.450> foot<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.990> six

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
10 and 5/8 tall and one foot and six
