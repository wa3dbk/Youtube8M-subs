00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.540 

it's<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:00.469> much<00:01:00.589> better<00:01:00.739> than<00:01:00.980> going<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.309> gym

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
it's so much better than going to a gym

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.490 
it's so much better than going to a gym
where<00:01:01.789> all<00:01:01.940> you're<00:01:02.089> basically<00:01:02.390> doing<00:01:02.510> is<00:01:02.809> pick

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
where all you're basically doing is pick

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.049 
where all you're basically doing is pick
up<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.679> object<00:01:03.890> put<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.580> down

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
up the object put it down

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.639 
up the object put it down
instead<00:01:05.540> we're<00:01:05.689> doing<00:01:05.899> natural<00:01:06.049> movements

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
instead we're doing natural movements

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.330 
instead we're doing natural movements
such<00:01:07.130> as<00:01:07.159> climbing<00:01:08.000> jumping<00:01:08.740> running<00:01:09.740> just

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
such as climbing jumping running just

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.670 
such as climbing jumping running just
you<00:01:11.090> know<00:01:11.149> though<00:01:11.299> kids<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.750> do<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:12.350> I

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
you know though kids can do this but I

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.560 
you know though kids can do this but I
think<00:01:12.950> we've<00:01:13.159> lost<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:13.610> over<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.030> years<00:01:14.210> as

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
think we've lost this over the years as

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.570 
think we've lost this over the years as
we've<00:01:14.810> been<00:01:14.930> trained<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:15.830> sit<00:01:16.039> still<00:01:16.190> as
