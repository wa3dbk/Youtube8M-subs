enhancing<00:00:59.340> foundation<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.359> I'd<00:01:00.660> say<00:01:00.840> it's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
enhancing foundation so I'd say it's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840 
enhancing foundation so I'd say it's
light<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.320> medium<00:01:01.680> coverage<00:01:01.859> depending<00:01:02.730> on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
light to medium coverage depending on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.130 
light to medium coverage depending on
how<00:01:02.940> much<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.270> build<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:03.960> it's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
how much you build up but it's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.800 
how much you build up but it's
definitely<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.710> dewy<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.729> light<00:01:06.060> spring

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
definitely very dewy and light spring

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
definitely very dewy and light spring
summery<00:01:07.320> foundation<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.790> fingers<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
summery foundation I use my fingers to

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.820 
summery foundation I use my fingers to
apply<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.840> found<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.229> much<00:01:10.409> better<00:01:10.619> than<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
apply it I found that much better than a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
apply it I found that much better than a
brush<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.850> really<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.570> nourishing

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
brush and it's really like nourishing

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230 
brush and it's really like nourishing
and<00:01:13.350> moisturizing<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:14.250> feels<00:01:14.460> amazing<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and moisturizing it feels amazing on the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
and moisturizing it feels amazing on the
skin<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.630> feels<00:01:15.810> almost<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.530> skin<00:01:16.920> care

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
skin it feels almost like a skin care

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.859 
skin it feels almost like a skin care
product<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> finish<00:01:18.299> you're<00:01:18.450> left<00:01:18.630> with

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
product and the finish you're left with

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
product and the finish you're left with
it's<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.549> brightening<00:01:20.549> light

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it's just really brightening light

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
it's just really brightening light
enhancing<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> looks<00:01:22.799> beautiful

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
enhancing and I think it looks beautiful

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
enhancing and I think it looks beautiful
on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> skin<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.509> blend<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.810> all

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
on the skin so I just blend that all

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.570 
on the skin so I just blend that all
over<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.409> make<00:01:25.500> sure<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.799> blend<00:01:26.040> down<00:01:26.220> into<00:01:26.490> my

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
over and make sure it blend down into my

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.399 
over and make sure it blend down into my
neck<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.259> takes

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
neck and get it all in I think it takes

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.569 
neck and get it all in I think it takes
a<00:01:28.470> little<00:01:28.619> bit<00:01:28.710> longer<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.100> your<00:01:29.250> fingers

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
a little bit longer with your fingers

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
a little bit longer with your fingers
but<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.150> nice<00:01:30.390> natural<00:01:30.659> finish

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
but you get a really nice natural finish

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
but you get a really nice natural finish

your eyes and then for this tutorial I'm
going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.890> using<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.250> fingers<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.790> blend<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
going to be using my fingers to blend it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
going to be using my fingers to blend it
in<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.170> spring<00:01:46.500> summer

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
in because it is more of a spring summer

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
in because it is more of a spring summer
look<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.659> natural

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
look I like it to have more of a natural

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.660 
look I like it to have more of a natural
finish<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.290> although<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.040> takes<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> lot

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
finish and although it takes a lot

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.010 
finish and although it takes a lot
longer<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> Pat<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.899> your

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
longer to kind of Pat it in with your

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.780 
longer to kind of Pat it in with your
fingers<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.369> warmth<00:01:53.670> within

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
fingers because of the warmth within

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.090 
fingers because of the warmth within
your<00:01:53.939> finger<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> does<00:01:54.659> blend<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.350> lot<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
your finger it does blend a lot kind of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920 
your finger it does blend a lot kind of
more<00:01:56.610> natural<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.149> has<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> much<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:57.750> natural

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
me but it's very pigmented so you only

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.509 
me but it's very pigmented so you only
need<00:03:10.569> a<00:03:10.599> tiny<00:03:10.720> amount<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.620> put<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.099> just<00:03:12.250> on<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
need a tiny amount I put it just on the

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.280 
need a tiny amount I put it just on the
kind<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.760> apples<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.329> my<00:03:13.359> cheeks<00:03:13.750> slightly

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
kind of apples of my cheeks slightly

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.660 
kind of apples of my cheeks slightly
higher<00:03:14.530> because<00:03:14.859> this<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.310> slightly

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
higher because this is a slightly
