00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I chose the white and black one because

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.350 
I chose the white and black one because
i<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.810> white<00:01:31.049> iphone<00:01:31.350> 5<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> also<00:01:33.119> all

silicone<00:01:33.810> has<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.710> either<00:01:34.950> gray<00:01:35.520> or<00:01:35.549> black

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
silicone has to be either gray or black

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.350 
silicone has to be either gray or black
because<00:01:37.500> silicone<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.340> dirty<00:01:38.549> extreme<00:01:39.060> fast

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
because silicone is a dirty extreme fast

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
because silicone is a dirty extreme fast
so<00:01:39.570> how<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> put<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> case<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.829> buttons

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so how you put this case on is buttons

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.450 
so how you put this case on is buttons
first<00:01:42.030> obviously<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:43.829> want<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.130> buttons

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
first obviously you want to do buttons

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.190 
first obviously you want to do buttons
first<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.240> put<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:45.930> way<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
first because you put the other way you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.230 
first because you put the other way you
could<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:47.670> something<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.149> your

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
could like and do something with your

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
could like and do something with your
button<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.930> put<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.470> first<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
button so put it in first just to be
