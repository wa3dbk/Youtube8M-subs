spotlight now in front of me here I've

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.500 
spotlight now in front of me here I've
got<00:00:07.260> this<00:00:07.559> sludge<00:00:08.040> boiler<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:08.760> before<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.269> get

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
got this sludge boiler now before we get

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.910 
got this sludge boiler now before we get
to<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.690> let's<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.350> look<00:00:10.560> at<00:00:10.740> its

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
to that let's have a look at its

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.550 
to that let's have a look at its
crafting<00:00:11.580> recipe<00:00:11.970> then<00:00:12.480> sludge<00:00:12.900> boiler<00:00:13.260> is

some furnaces and plastic heats now

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840 
some furnaces and plastic heats now
that's<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.350> fairly<00:00:19.770> cheap<00:00:19.950> crafting<00:00:20.430> recipe

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
that's a fairly cheap crafting recipe

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.810 
that's a fairly cheap crafting recipe
the<00:00:21.770> defective<00:00:22.770> machine<00:00:22.860> block<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.369> course<00:00:23.610> is

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the defective machine block of course is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
the defective machine block of course is
made<00:00:24.150> using<00:00:24.360> some<00:00:24.660> stone<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> plastic<00:00:25.650> heats

made using some stone and plastic heats

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.010 
made using some stone and plastic heats
and<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.520> need<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.850> for<00:00:26.910> every<00:00:27.510> machine<00:00:27.660> in

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
and you need this for every machine in

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.779 
and you need this for every machine in
mine<00:00:28.199> factory<00:00:28.680> reloaded<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.310> make<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.520> couple

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
mine factory reloaded so make a couple

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.700 
mine factory reloaded so make a couple
of<00:00:29.940> those<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.990> course<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.350> plastic

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of those and of course the plastic

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.590 
of those and of course the plastic
sheets<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.099> made<00:00:32.309> using<00:00:32.640> some<00:00:32.699> raw<00:00:33.059> plastic

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
sheets are made using some raw plastic

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.360 
sheets are made using some raw plastic
which<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.079> obtained<00:00:34.440> by<00:00:34.530> smelting<00:00:34.979> rubber

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
which can be obtained by smelting rubber

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.849 
which can be obtained by smelting rubber
bars<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:36.059> well<00:00:36.809> rubber<00:00:37.199> from<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.589> the<00:00:37.710> other

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
bars or well rubber from in the other

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.329 
bars or well rubber from in the other
mod<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.909> let's<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> look<00:00:40.319> at<00:00:40.530> sludge

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
mod so let's have a look at sludge

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.160 
mod so let's have a look at sludge
before<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.449> actual<00:00:42.749> sludge

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
before we get to the actual sludge

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.529 
before we get to the actual sludge
boiler<00:00:43.649> I've<00:00:44.069> got<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> big<00:00:44.519> tank<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> sludge<00:00:45.239> set

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
boiler I've got a big tank of sludge set

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.079 
boiler I've got a big tank of sludge set
up<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:46.799> let's<00:00:47.069> quickly<00:00:47.699> switch<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
up here and well let's quickly switch to

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.149 
up here and well let's quickly switch to
daylight<00:00:48.839> so<00:00:49.049> as<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.409> see<00:00:49.589> this<00:00:49.769> is<00:00:49.979> sort

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
daylight so as you can see this is sort

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.199 
daylight so as you can see this is sort
of<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.429> dark<00:00:50.789> bluish<00:00:51.210> liquid<00:00:51.929> and<00:00:52.889> well<00:00:53.670> you

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:54.209 
of a dark bluish liquid and well you

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:56.360 
of a dark bluish liquid and well you
might<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.569> wondering<00:00:54.719> how<00:00:54.929> its<00:00:55.559> luch<00:00:55.920> made

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
might be wondering how its luch made

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.479 
might be wondering how its luch made
well<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.510> made<00:00:57.870> by<00:00:58.139> a<00:00:58.170> harvester<00:00:59.069> now<00:00:59.249> I've

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
well it's made by a harvester now I've

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
well it's made by a harvester now I've
demonstrated<00:00:59.819> this<00:01:00.449> block<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.929> another

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
demonstrated this block in another

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.559 
demonstrated this block in another
spotlight<00:01:01.639> basically<00:01:02.639> what<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.909> does<00:01:03.119> is<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
spotlight basically what it does is it

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:05.630 
spotlight basically what it does is it
harvest<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.140> crops<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
harvest some crops for you and when it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.790 
harvest some crops for you and when it
does<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.240> will<00:01:06.300> produce<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
does that it will produce a little bit a

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.280 
does that it will produce a little bit a
little<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.520> sludge<00:01:08.910> as<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.510> waste<00:01:09.870> product

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
little bit of sludge as a waste product

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.710 
little bit of sludge as a waste product
now<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.490> liquid<00:01:11.760> doctor<00:01:12.270> or<00:01:12.330> other

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
now you can use liquid doctor or other

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.620 
now you can use liquid doctor or other
types<00:01:13.230> of<00:01:13.380> liquid<00:01:13.740> pipes<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.940> this<00:01:15.300> liquid

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
types of liquid pipes to get this liquid

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.960 
types of liquid pipes to get this liquid
out<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.260> harvester<00:01:16.800> into<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> tank<00:01:17.700> or

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
out of the harvester into a tank or

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.950 
out of the harvester into a tank or
dislodge<00:01:18.450> boiler<00:01:18.900> itself<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.940> well<00:01:20.940> I've<00:01:21.720> got

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
dislodge boiler itself and well I've got

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
dislodge boiler itself and well I've got
a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.170> pull<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> sludge<00:01:22.980> set<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.670> so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
a little pull of sludge set up here so

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
a little pull of sludge set up here so
let's<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.690> creative<00:01:25.260> mode<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
let's go to creative mode and have a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.910 
let's go to creative mode and have a
quick<00:01:26.520> swim<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.940> here<00:01:27.260> okay<00:01:28.260> let's<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.740> back

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
quick swim in here okay let's get back

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.940 
quick swim in here okay let's get back
out<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.370> as<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.350> getting<00:01:31.800> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
out so as you can see we are getting a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.150 
out so as you can see we are getting a
poison<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.700> weakness<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.750> nausea<00:01:34.320> effect<00:01:34.650> so

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
poison a weakness and a nausea effect so

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.820 
poison a weakness and a nausea effect so
this<00:01:35.370> sludge<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.940> quite<00:01:36.480> nasty<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.800> is

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
this sludge is quite nasty it is

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.340 
this sludge is quite nasty it is
generated<00:01:38.820> randomly<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> world<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.050> small

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
generated randomly in the world in small

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.290 
generated randomly in the world in small
pools<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.950> look<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.370> for<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.760> so<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.030> don't

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
pools so look out for that so you don't

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.649 
pools so look out for that so you don't
fall<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.610> okay<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:45.030> let's<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.510> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
fall in there okay so now let's get to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.450 
fall in there okay so now let's get to
the<00:01:45.780> actual<00:01:46.200> sludge<00:01:46.620> ball<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.250> this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the actual sludge ball and now this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.790 
the actual sludge ball and now this
sludge<00:01:47.790> ball<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.600> has<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> gotten<00:01:49.200> liquid

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
sludge ball here has it gotten liquid

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.490 
sludge ball here has it gotten liquid
inventory<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.580> most<00:01:51.120> machines<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.110> process

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.990 
for this which is the same case for
other<00:02:06.780> machines<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.500> mod<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> course<00:02:08.099> now

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
other machines in this mod of course now

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.229 
other machines in this mod of course now
let's<00:02:09.239> let's<00:02:09.810> turn<00:02:10.049> this<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.909> you<00:02:11.909> might<00:02:12.090> be

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
let's let's turn this on so you might be

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.449 
let's let's turn this on so you might be
wondering<00:02:12.420> well<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:13.920> large<00:02:14.129> boiler

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
wondering well what is this large boiler

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.770 
wondering well what is this large boiler
boiler<00:02:15.030> doing

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
boiler doing

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.710 
boiler doing
aside<00:02:16.320> from<00:02:16.350> its<00:02:16.740> main<00:02:16.890> operation<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:18.480> is

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
aside from its main operation it is

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.540 
aside from its main operation it is
currently<00:02:19.340> poisoning<00:02:20.340> me<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.950> hunger

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
currently poisoning me so I get a hunger

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.510 
currently poisoning me so I get a hunger
and<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.970> poison<00:02:24.600> effect<00:02:24.750> now<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:26.040> happens

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and a poison effect now this happens

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.580 
and a poison effect now this happens
when<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.850> get<00:02:27.000> inside<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.870> three<00:02:28.230> block

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
when you get inside of a three block

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.280 
when you get inside of a three block
radius<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> block<00:02:29.610> when<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.480> working<00:02:30.780> so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
radius of the block when it's working so

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.199 
radius of the block when it's working so
keep<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.710> in<00:02:31.890> mind<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.670> stay<00:02:32.880> clear

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
keep that in mind you want to stay clear

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.199 
keep that in mind you want to stay clear
of<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.080> working<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.610> let's<00:02:36.030> head

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
of that when it's working and let's head

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.360 
of that when it's working and let's head
back<00:02:36.240> into<00:02:36.600> creative<00:02:37.080> mode<00:02:37.110> here<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.070> I've<00:02:38.340> got

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
back into creative mode here so I've got

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.660 
back into creative mode here so I've got
a<00:02:38.610> chest<00:02:38.970> set<00:02:39.270> up<00:02:39.420> here<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.440> see

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
a chest set up here and as you can see

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.970 
a chest set up here and as you can see
this<00:02:41.670> large<00:02:42.000> boiler<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.570> slowly<00:02:43.050> filling<00:02:43.770> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
this large boiler is slowly filling it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.670 
this large boiler is slowly filling it
up<00:02:44.100> with<00:02:44.160> several<00:02:44.730> types<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.570> items<00:02:45.780> I've<00:02:46.470> got

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
up with several types of items I've got

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.010 
up with several types of items I've got
some<00:02:46.860> clay<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.220> here<00:02:47.700> some<00:02:48.300> dirt<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.870> of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
some clay in here some dirt and of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.090 
some clay in here some dirt and of
course<00:02:49.290> I'm<00:02:49.470> sand

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
course I'm sand

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.220 
course I'm sand
now<00:02:50.790> basically<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> sludge<00:02:51.930> boiler

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
now basically what the sludge boiler

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.620 
now basically what the sludge boiler
does<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.130> processes<00:02:53.880> sludge<00:02:54.239> into

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
does is it processes sludge into

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.140 
does is it processes sludge into
something<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.530> use<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.459> case<00:02:56.790> I've

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
something you can use in this case I've

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.030 
something you can use in this case I've
got<00:02:57.209> some<00:02:57.630> sand<00:02:57.900> some<00:02:58.110> dirt<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.530> some<00:02:58.650> clay

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
got some sand some dirt and some clay

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
got some sand some dirt and some clay
however<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.030> not<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.270> only<00:03:00.420> things<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
however that's not the only things that

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.380 
however that's not the only things that
make<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.190> chances<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.700> getting<00:03:02.850> each

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
make so the chances of getting each

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.250 
make so the chances of getting each
particular<00:03:04.110> item<00:03:04.650> varies<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:05.970> sands<00:03:06.870> being

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
particular item varies with sands being

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.610 
particular item varies with sands being
the<00:03:07.830> most<00:03:08.220> likely<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.870> next

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the most likely for you to get and next

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.699 
the most likely for you to get and next
being<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.310> dirt<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:12.209> course<00:03:12.480> clay<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.170> also

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
being a dirt of course clay is also

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.820 
being a dirt of course clay is also
fairly<00:03:14.400> easy<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.030> obtain<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:16.230> those<00:03:16.500> three<00:03:16.800> are

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
fairly easy to obtain so those three are

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.920 
fairly easy to obtain so those three are
certainly<00:03:17.400> fairly<00:03:17.940> easy<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> get<00:03:18.420> which<00:03:18.900> is

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
certainly fairly easy to get which is

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.199 
certainly fairly easy to get which is
the<00:03:19.200> reason<00:03:19.470> why<00:03:19.560> I've<00:03:19.709> got<00:03:19.920> well<00:03:20.670> them<00:03:21.000> in

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the reason why I've got well them in

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.259 
the reason why I've got well them in
here<00:03:21.510> mostly<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.610> keep<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.760> mind<00:03:23.790> when<00:03:24.239> it

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
here mostly and keep in mind when it

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.600 
here mostly and keep in mind when it
generates<00:03:24.870> clay<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.620> will<00:03:25.830> give<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.160> four

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
generates clay it will give you four

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.590 
generates clay it will give you four
pieces<00:03:27.180> at<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.390> time<00:03:28.250> okay<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:30.180> less

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
pieces at a time okay so the less

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.870 
pieces at a time okay so the less
frequent<00:03:31.230> vanilla<00:03:31.769> blocks<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.519> get<00:03:32.700> from

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
frequent vanilla blocks you can get from

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.750 
frequent vanilla blocks you can get from
this<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.299> mycelium<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.890> course<00:03:35.160> also

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
this are mycelium and of course also

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.800 
this are mycelium and of course also
soul<00:03:36.090> sand<00:03:36.590> okay<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:37.650> my<00:03:38.640> selling<00:03:39.090> insults<00:03:39.660> and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
soul sand okay so my selling insults and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.509 
soul sand okay so my selling insults and
have<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> really<00:03:40.440> low<00:03:40.769> chance<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.340> being

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
have a really low chance of being

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.220 
have a really low chance of being
produced<00:03:41.910> as<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.690> see<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.870> gets<00:03:43.080> on<00:03:43.200> my

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
produced as you can see it gets on my

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.590 
produced as you can see it gets on my
selling<00:03:43.650> me<00:03:43.739> here<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.160> my<00:03:44.670> selling<00:03:45.030> even<00:03:45.390> has

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
selling me here and my selling even has

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.740 
selling me here and my selling even has
a<00:03:45.630> slightly<00:03:46.290> smaller<00:03:46.860> chance<00:03:47.400> than<00:03:48.000> soul<00:03:48.420> sand

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
a slightly smaller chance than soul sand

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.930 
a slightly smaller chance than soul sand
us<00:03:48.989> now<00:03:49.799> aside<00:03:50.070> from<00:03:50.100> being<00:03:50.400> able<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.790> produce

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
us now aside from being able to produce

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.229 
us now aside from being able to produce
these<00:03:51.269> vanilla<00:03:51.720> blocks<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.610> mod<00:03:53.790> also

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
these vanilla blocks the the mod also

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.660 
these vanilla blocks the the mod also
supports<00:03:54.690> some<00:03:54.720> other<00:03:55.049> mods<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.769> there<00:03:56.430> is

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
supports some other mods so there is

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.240 
supports some other mods so there is
support<00:03:57.120> for<00:03:57.690> for<00:03:57.959> example<00:03:58.019> Pam's<00:03:58.709> harvest

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
support for for example Pam's harvest

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.759 
support for for example Pam's harvest
craft<00:03:59.549> now<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.120> only<00:04:00.450> adds<00:04:00.810> one<00:04:01.230> additional

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
craft now this only adds one additional

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.400 
craft now this only adds one additional
item<00:04:01.980> which<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.400> salt<00:04:02.910> however<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.870> don't<00:04:04.110> have

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
item which is salt however I don't have

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.259 
item which is salt however I don't have
this<00:04:04.530> mod<00:04:04.739> installed<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.850> won't<00:04:06.060> be

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
this mod installed so I it won't be

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.479 
this mod installed so I it won't be
producing<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.840> at<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.890> same<00:04:08.100> thing<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.370> true

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
producing that at the same thing is true

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.150 
producing that at the same thing is true
for<00:04:08.549> forestry<00:04:09.420> only<00:04:09.750> one<00:04:09.959> item<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.950> will

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
for forestry only one item so this will

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.120 
for forestry only one item so this will
also<00:04:11.549> produce<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.120> Pete<00:04:12.540> item<00:04:13.320> from<00:04:13.620> forestry

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
also produce the Pete item from forestry

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.280 
also produce the Pete item from forestry
also<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> very<00:04:15.510> low<00:04:15.690> chance<00:04:15.720> where<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
also with a very low chance where I

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.400 
also with a very low chance where I
solved<00:04:16.829> in<00:04:16.950> Pam's<00:04:17.280> harvest<00:04:17.640> grass<00:04:18.079> has<00:04:19.079> a

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
solved in Pam's harvest grass has a

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.650 
solved in Pam's harvest grass has a
fairly<00:04:20.130> decent<00:04:20.579> chance<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.180> being<00:04:21.329> produced

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
fairly decent chance of being produced

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.260 
fairly decent chance of being produced
so<00:04:22.290> low<00:04:22.830> chance<00:04:23.160> for<00:04:23.370> Pete<00:04:23.580> but<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.060> does

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
so low chance for Pete but it does

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.719 
so low chance for Pete but it does
produce<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.020> do<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.500> forestry<00:04:26.039> install<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:26.610> we

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
produce it I do a forestry install so we

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.360 
produce it I do a forestry install so we
might<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.200> that<00:04:28.200> pop<00:04:28.500> up<00:04:28.680> at

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
might have that pop up at

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.960 
might have that pop up at
point<00:04:29.669> ok<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:30.630> next<00:04:31.199> up<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.979> also<00:04:32.220> have<00:04:32.699> extra

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
point ok so next up we also have extra

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.520 
point ok so next up we also have extra
biomes<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.919> mod<00:04:35.250> adds<00:04:35.760> two<00:04:36.270> items<00:04:36.840> which

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
biomes so this mod adds two items which

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.950 
biomes so this mod adds two items which
can<00:04:38.220> be<00:04:38.370> produced<00:04:38.729> by<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:39.300> village<00:04:39.630> boiler

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
can be produced by this village boiler

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.750 
can be produced by this village boiler
which<00:04:40.590> is<00:04:40.830> quicksand<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.790> cracks<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:42.960> now

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
which is quicksand and cracks and now

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.420 
which is quicksand and cracks and now
these<00:04:44.760> have<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.860> well<00:04:47.630> above<00:04:48.630> above<00:04:49.590> low<00:04:49.949> like

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
these have a well above above low like

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.219 
these have a well above above low like
somewhat<00:04:50.970> average<00:04:51.419> chance<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.080> being

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
somewhat average chance of being

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.760 
somewhat average chance of being
produced<00:04:52.590> but<00:04:52.949> about<00:04:53.340> half<00:04:53.699> that<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.780> clay<00:04:55.380> so

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
produced but about half that of clay so

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.700 
produced but about half that of clay so
not<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.880> big<00:04:57.180> of<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.360> chance<00:04:57.660> but<00:04:57.840> it's<00:04:58.380> still

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
not that big of a chance but it's still

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.830 
not that big of a chance but it's still
it's<00:04:59.010> still<00:04:59.190> more<00:04:59.520> common<00:04:59.940> than<00:05:00.449> for<00:05:00.750> example

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
it's still more common than for example

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.450 
it's still more common than for example
my<00:05:01.350> sell<00:05:01.590> him<00:05:01.770> or<00:05:02.120> or<00:05:03.120> Pete<00:05:03.710> okay<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.010> then

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
my sell him or or Pete okay and then

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.909 
my sell him or or Pete okay and then
finally<00:05:06.090> as<00:05:06.449> farm<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:07.020> aware<00:05:07.380> this<00:05:07.650> is<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
finally as farm is aware this is the

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.279 
finally as farm is aware this is the
only<00:05:08.070> other<00:05:08.340> mod<00:05:08.699> which<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.240> supported<00:05:09.750> which

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
only other mod which is supported which

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.159 
only other mod which is supported which
is<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.770> biomes<00:05:11.160> o<00:05:11.310> plenty<00:05:11.340> mod<00:05:12.090> not<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:12.780> does

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
is the biomes o plenty mod not this does

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.210 
is the biomes o plenty mod not this does
add<00:05:13.380> several<00:05:13.979> items<00:05:14.340> being<00:05:15.150> mud<00:05:15.539> ash<00:05:15.919> dry<00:05:16.919> dirt

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
add several items being mud ash dry dirt

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.360 
add several items being mud ash dry dirt
hard<00:05:17.729> sand<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.389> hard<00:05:18.690> dirt<00:05:19.110> okay<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:19.949> these

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
hard sand and hard dirt okay so these

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.029 
hard sand and hard dirt okay so these
also<00:05:20.699> have<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.060> fairly<00:05:21.630> decent<00:05:21.810> -<00:05:22.770> average

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
also have a fairly decent - average

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.890 
also have a fairly decent - average
chance<00:05:23.760> of<00:05:24.030> being<00:05:24.780> produced<00:05:25.260> so<00:05:25.560> more<00:05:26.220> than

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
chance of being produced so more than

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.610 
chance of being produced so more than
for<00:05:27.900> example<00:05:28.190> mycelium<00:05:29.190> but<00:05:29.460> less<00:05:29.820> than<00:05:29.850> clay

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
for example mycelium but less than clay

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.650 
for example mycelium but less than clay
okay<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:31.680> that's<00:05:32.039> basically<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.789> for<00:05:33.419> this

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
okay so that's basically it for this

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.529 
okay so that's basically it for this
