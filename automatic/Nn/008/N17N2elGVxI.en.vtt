and<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.539> concept<00:00:30.900> I'd<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.619> use

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
and so for this concept I'd like to use

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.510 
and so for this concept I'd like to use
wait<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> his<00:00:33.870> skin<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.770> go

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
wait for it his skin there we go

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
wait for it his skin there we go
I'm<00:00:35.940> using<00:00:36.090> his<00:00:36.300> skin<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.800> transporter

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
I'm using his skin for this transporter

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
I'm using his skin for this transporter
so<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.219> hope<00:00:38.550> he<00:00:38.640> doesn't<00:00:38.790> mind<00:00:38.940> he<00:00:39.180> shouldn't

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
so I hope he doesn't mind he shouldn't

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
so I hope he doesn't mind he shouldn't
mind<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.219> actually

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
mind so what I'm going to do is actually

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
mind so what I'm going to do is actually
chop<00:00:41.760> his<00:00:41.879> body<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.210> into<00:00:42.329> five<00:00:42.719> pieces<00:00:42.930> with

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
chop his body up into five pieces with

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
chop his body up into five pieces with
command<00:00:44.129> blocks<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:45.450> gonna<00:00:45.629> basically

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
command blocks and I'm gonna basically

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.150 
command blocks and I'm gonna basically
run<00:00:46.500> code<00:00:47.129> within<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> game<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.920> read

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
run code within the game it's gonna read

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.250 
run code within the game it's gonna read
approximately<00:00:50.850> half<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.360> million<00:00:51.510> characters

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
approximately half a million characters

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.959 
approximately half a million characters
of<00:00:52.440> code<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> might<00:00:53.430> lag<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> little<00:00:53.850> bit

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
of code so it might lag a little bit

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 
of code so it might lag a little bit
especially<00:00:54.750> I'm<00:00:55.020> recording<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.500> well<00:00:55.530> but

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
especially I'm recording as well but

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
especially I'm recording as well but
hopefully<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> work<00:00:57.059> out

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
hopefully this is all going to work out

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.959 
hopefully this is all going to work out
so<00:00:58.219> basically<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.489> gonna<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.730> is

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so basically what I'm gonna do is

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150 
so basically what I'm gonna do is
transport<00:01:00.629> his<00:01:01.109> body<00:01:01.320> through<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> portal

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
transport his body through the portal

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.670 
transport his body through the portal
which<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> chop<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.750> his<00:01:04.260> by<00:01:04.439> into

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
which is going to chop up his by into

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
which is going to chop up his by into
five<00:01:04.860> pieces<00:01:05.070> run<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.180> line<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.479> code<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
five pieces run the line of code and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.960 
five pieces run the line of code and
basically<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.250> command<00:01:08.430> blocks<00:01:08.610> gonna<00:01:08.790> fall

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
basically the command blocks gonna fall

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
basically the command blocks gonna fall
from<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> sky<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.560> his<00:01:11.130> body

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
from the sky and it's gonna be his body

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
from the sky and it's gonna be his body
condensed<00:01:11.939> into<00:01:12.299> five<00:01:12.600> command<00:01:12.900> blocks<00:01:13.170> so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
condensed into five command blocks so

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.090 
condensed into five command blocks so
let's<00:01:14.100> press<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> button<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.479> go

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
let's press this button and here we go

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.950 
let's press this button and here we go
this<00:01:17.100> assembling<00:01:17.549> structure<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> his<00:01:18.659> body's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
this assembling structure and his body's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.660 
this assembling structure and his body's
gone<00:01:19.110> through<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> bottle<00:01:19.740> thanks<00:01:20.340> wait<00:01:20.490> for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.429 
gone through the bottle thanks wait for
it<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> command<00:01:21.119> blocks<00:01:21.299> should<00:01:21.600> today<00:01:22.229> go

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it the command blocks should today go

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.399 
it the command blocks should today go
his<00:01:22.860> body<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.670> within<00:01:24.450> five<00:01:24.960> Camille

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
five command blocks simultaneously so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:55.330 
five command blocks simultaneously so
three<00:01:46.320> two<00:01:47.070> one

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.120 
right back okay so I have now copied all
five<00:02:15.270> command<00:02:15.600> blocks<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:16.140> all<00:02:16.290> are<00:02:16.530> full<00:02:17.010> of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
five command blocks they all are full of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.820 
five command blocks they all are full of
code<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.580> ice<00:02:18.270> need<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.540> run<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.140> code<00:02:19.410> that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
code and ice need to run this code that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.170 
code and ice need to run this code that
I've<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:19.980> put<00:02:20.160> in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180
