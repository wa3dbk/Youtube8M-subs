that fast and I haven't been such a fan
of<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.350> now<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.070> be<00:02:38.370> quite<00:02:38.610> honest<00:02:38.970> after<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> got

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
of it now to be quite honest after I got

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.420 
of it now to be quite honest after I got
it<00:02:39.780> gold<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.230> don't<00:02:40.410> know<00:02:40.530> why<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:40.980> doesn't

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
it gold I don't know why it just doesn't

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.720

seem<00:02:41.610> as<00:02:41.790> powerful<00:02:42.270> now<00:02:42.420> um<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.580> is

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
seem as powerful now um but that is

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.060 
seem as powerful now um but that is
definitely<00:02:44.910> worth<00:02:45.390> buying<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:46.170> honestly

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
definitely worth buying and honestly

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.560 
definitely worth buying and honestly

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
it's gotten to the point where you have

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.780 
it's gotten to the point where you have
a<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.350> know<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.890> an<00:02:49.980> edge<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.640> you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
a you know you have an edge up if you

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.150 
a you know you have an edge up if you
actually<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.360> buy<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.630> dlc<00:02:51.930> because<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.890> so

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
actually do buy the dlc because it is so

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.740 
actually do buy the dlc because it is so
overpowered<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:55.080> like<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.150> don't<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.360> that

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
overpowered so like I don't think that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.080 
overpowered so like I don't think that
that's<00:02:57.870> too<00:02:58.140> bad<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.830> dlc<00:02:59.280> gun<00:02:59.850> is

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that's too bad that the dlc gun is

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.120 
that's too bad that the dlc gun is
overpowered<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:02.040> know

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
overpowered I just think that you know

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.420 
overpowered I just think that you know
