so i have some blush brushes i put the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.049 
so i have some blush brushes i put the
mac<00:00:43.020> 129<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.520> kind<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.789> smaller

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
mac 129 in this but it's kind of smaller

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.520 
mac 129 in this but it's kind of smaller
and<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> blush<00:00:46.230> brush

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and I think it's more of a blush brush

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.920 
and I think it's more of a blush brush
this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> 129<00:00:48.000> m<00:00:48.390> SE<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:51.660> totally

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
this is a 129 m SE and it's totally

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.200 
this is a 129 m SE and it's totally
different<00:00:52.710> than<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:54.270> 129<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.030> going

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
different than the 129 so I'm just going

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.680 
different than the 129 so I'm just going
to<00:00:57.270> use<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.989> eco<00:00:58.590> tools<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.690> essence

to use the eco tools and it is essence

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450

skin they both have uncover a lot of
area<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.799> once<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.939> it'll<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.210> good<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.510> your

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
powder I won't use it for blush because

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.289 
powder I won't use it for blush because
it<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.630> does<00:01:12.900> cover<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.650> big<00:01:14.130> area<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.700> at

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it really does cover a big area there at

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:24.289 
it really does cover a big area there at
one<00:01:15.570> time<00:01:21.049> foundation<00:01:22.049> brushes<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:23.060> only<00:01:24.060> have

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
one time foundation brushes I only have

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.740 
one time foundation brushes I only have
a<00:01:24.330> mac<00:01:25.280> 190<00:01:26.280> SE<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.500> then<00:01:28.500> i<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.070> CVS

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
a mac 190 SE and then i have this CVS

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.160 
a mac 190 SE and then i have this CVS
essence<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.900> beauty<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.600> same<00:01:33.869> size

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
essence of beauty and it's the same size

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.560 
essence of beauty and it's the same size
so<00:01:34.590> we're<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.130> saying<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.759> feels<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> same<00:01:36.299> as

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
so we're not saying it feels the same as

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
so we're not saying it feels the same as
the<00:01:37.790> 190<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.150> huge<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the 190 but it's huge I think that it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.210 
the 190 but it's huge I think that it
feels<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> same<00:01:42.829> looks<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> same<00:01:44.159> just

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
feels the same looks the same just

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.969 
feels the same looks the same just
bigger<00:01:45.119> maybe<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> half<00:01:46.259> times<00:01:46.380> bigger

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
bigger maybe one and a half times bigger

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.069 
bigger maybe one and a half times bigger
so<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> carry<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.240> more<00:01:48.450> area<00:01:48.840> done

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
so to carry you get more area done

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.190 
so to carry you get more area done
faster<00:01:49.710> um<00:01:50.270> maybe<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.509> might<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.960> problems

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
faster um maybe it might have problems

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590 
faster um maybe it might have problems
with<00:01:52.470> small<00:01:52.740> areas<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.360> this

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
with small areas but I think that this

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
with small areas but I think that this
is<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.869> great<00:01:55.409> substitute<00:01:55.860> if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.700> don't<00:01:56.850> want

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
is a great substitute if you don't want

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.240 
is a great substitute if you don't want
to<00:01:57.090> spend<00:01:57.360> money<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.049> mat<00:01:58.259> brush<00:02:01.009> this<00:02:02.009> one

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
to spend money on the mat brush this one

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.690 
to spend money on the mat brush this one

at<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> top<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.239> thought<00:03:23.720> since<00:03:23.959> they<00:03:24.170> were<00:03:24.230> so

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
at the top I thought since they were so

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.289 
at the top I thought since they were so
soft<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.889> wouldn't<00:03:25.160> get<00:03:25.280> any<00:03:25.489> color<00:03:25.730> pale<00:03:26.030> but

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
soft you wouldn't get any color pale but

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.330 
soft you wouldn't get any color pale but
I<00:03:26.329> use<00:03:26.630> them<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.959> do<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.200> swatches<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.799> my<00:03:27.920> hand

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
I use them to do the swatches on my hand

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.059 
I use them to do the swatches on my hand
and<00:03:28.819> got<00:03:29.299> excellent<00:03:29.720> color<00:03:30.049> pale<00:03:30.319> so<00:03:30.680> these

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
and got excellent color pale so these

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.009 
and got excellent color pale so these
are<00:03:31.130> only<00:03:31.340> two<00:03:31.609> dollars<00:03:31.910> each<00:03:32.120> at<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.840> end

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
are only two dollars each at the end

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.530 
are only two dollars each at the end
there's<00:03:33.260> those<00:03:33.500> foam<00:03:33.769> smudgy<00:03:34.280> things<00:03:34.549> but<00:03:35.209> you

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
there's those foam smudgy things but you

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.660 
there's those foam smudgy things but you
can<00:03:35.720> transfer<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.739> put<00:03:36.950> one<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.250> these<00:03:37.340> on

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
which we all hate but I think these are

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.759 
which we all hate but I think these are
a<00:03:40.730> good<00:03:40.940> deal<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.510> two<00:03:42.109> dollars<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.590> he'll

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
a good deal for two dollars and he'll

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.470 
a good deal for two dollars and he'll
probably<00:03:42.889> on<00:03:43.220> makeup<00:03:43.639> bag<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.150> keep<00:03:44.299> in<00:03:44.450> my

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
probably on makeup bag that I keep in my

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.140

of them is called the smoky why it's a

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.420
