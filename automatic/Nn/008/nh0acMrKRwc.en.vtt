match<00:00:59.709> and<00:01:00.039> also<00:01:00.819> has<00:01:00.969> occurred<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.359> me<00:01:01.510> that

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
match and also has occurred to me that

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.469 
match and also has occurred to me that
when<00:01:01.899> we<00:01:02.109> remove<00:01:02.409> this<00:01:02.589> pump<00:01:02.999> that<00:01:03.999> the

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
when we remove this pump that the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.050 
when we remove this pump that the
windshield<00:01:05.470> washer<00:01:05.650> fluid<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:06.700> probably

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
windshield washer fluid is probably

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.260 
windshield washer fluid is probably
going<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.330> pour<00:01:07.540> out<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:07.960> I've<00:01:08.080> got<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
going to pour out so I've got it and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.610 
going to pour out so I've got it and
gallon<00:01:10.270> jug<00:01:10.480> with<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.690> top<00:01:10.870> cut<00:01:11.110> off<00:01:11.260> in<00:01:11.440> the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
gallon jug with the top cut off in the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.220 
gallon jug with the top cut off in the
back<00:01:11.800> up<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:13.150> here<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.630> collect<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.020> fluid

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
back up over here to collect the fluid

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.400 
back up over here to collect the fluid
because<00:01:14.740> when<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.220> pump<00:01:15.610> stops<00:01:15.910> working<00:01:16.410> the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
because when the pump stops working the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.550 
because when the pump stops working the
reservoir<00:01:18.370> was<00:01:18.550> full<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.290> first<00:01:20.290> thing<00:01:20.440> we're

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
reservoir was full so first thing we're

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.340 
reservoir was full so first thing we're
going<00:01:20.650> to<00:01:20.710> do<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.070> pop<00:01:21.340> those<00:01:21.870> wires<00:01:22.870> off<00:01:23.200> the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
going to do is pop those wires off the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.370 
going to do is pop those wires off the
top<00:01:23.530> here<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.820> right<00:01:25.060> there<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:26.140> we're

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
top here that's right there and we're

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.340 
top here that's right there and we're
going<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.560> pop<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:26.710> off<00:01:27.870> just<00:01:28.870> pop<00:01:29.170> those

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
going to pop that off just pop those

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.890 
going to pop that off just pop those
wires<00:01:29.680> out<00:01:29.980> that<00:01:30.280> harness<00:01:30.940> off<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.690> have<00:01:31.810> to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
wires out that harness off we have to

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.410 
wires out that harness off we have to
lift<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.260> red<00:01:32.620> piece<00:01:33.130> up<00:01:33.400> right<00:01:33.610> there<00:01:36.420> it's

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
lift that red piece up right there it's

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.760 
lift that red piece up right there it's
going<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.600> allow<00:01:37.720> that<00:01:37.750> piece<00:01:38.260> to<00:01:38.410> come<00:01:38.560> loose

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
going to allow that piece to come loose

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.270 
going to allow that piece to come loose
so<00:01:39.220> you<00:01:39.310> can<00:01:39.490> see<00:01:39.670> I've<00:01:39.820> disconnected<00:01:40.150> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so you can see I've disconnected the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.670 
so you can see I've disconnected the
electrical<00:01:42.280> part<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:42.970> filled<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.500> two

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
electrical part and I filled the two

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.330 
electrical part and I filled the two
hoses<00:01:44.950> off

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
hoses off

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.810 
hoses off
it's<00:01:46.520> now<00:01:46.790> during<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.250> ship<00:01:49.250> wash<00:01:49.460> it<00:01:49.640> threw

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
it's now during the ship wash it threw

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.440 
it's now during the ship wash it threw
it<00:01:49.970> into<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.299> bucket<00:01:51.549> in<00:01:52.549> about<00:01:52.759> five<00:01:53.060> minutes

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
it into the bucket in about five minutes

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.810 
it into the bucket in about five minutes
you<00:01:53.600> can<00:01:53.659> see<00:01:53.899> it's<00:01:54.020> still<00:01:54.229> draining<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:55.640> my

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
you can see it's still draining and my

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.069 
you can see it's still draining and my
buckets<00:01:56.149> getting<00:01:56.329> full<00:01:56.570> someone<00:01:56.930> switched

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
buckets getting full someone switched

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.310 
buckets getting full someone switched
that<00:01:57.259> out<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:58.570> imagine<00:01:59.570> we<00:01:59.689> could<00:01:59.840> just<00:02:00.020> pull

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
that out I imagine we could just pull

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.919 
that out I imagine we could just pull
the<00:02:00.530> pump<00:02:01.030> from<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.149> reservoir<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.840> would

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
the pump from the reservoir and it would

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.560 
the pump from the reservoir and it would
come<00:02:03.080> out<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.200> lot<00:02:03.380> faster<00:02:03.409> but<00:02:04.100> I'm<00:02:04.939> trying<00:02:05.450> to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
come out a lot faster but I'm trying to

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.389 
come out a lot faster but I'm trying to
collect<00:02:05.750> all<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:07.130> my<00:02:07.610> fluid<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.599> reuse<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.399> with

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
collect all of my fluid to reuse so with

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.610 
collect all of my fluid to reuse so with
a<00:02:10.429> draining<00:02:10.789> slow<00:02:11.000> way<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.290> amount<00:02:12.530> of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
a draining slow way so the amount of

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.020 
a draining slow way so the amount of
fluid<00:02:13.010> coming<00:02:13.130> out<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.400> there<00:02:13.519> exceeded<00:02:13.940> my

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
fluid coming out of there exceeded my

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.720 
fluid coming out of there exceeded my
expectations<00:02:14.660> were<00:02:14.950> well<00:02:15.950> over<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> gallon

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
expectations were well over a gallon

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.009 
expectations were well over a gallon
right<00:02:16.760> now<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:18.280> had<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.400> get<00:02:19.519> another

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
right now and had to get another

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.449 
right now and had to get another
container<00:02:21.019> but<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.620> happens<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.280> you

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
container but if that happens to you you

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.270 
container but if that happens to you you
can<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.790> plug<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:23.600> hose<00:02:24.470> back<00:02:24.799> up<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
can just plug that hose back up to the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.100 
can just plug that hose back up to the
pump<00:02:25.489> while<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.569> run<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.959> get<00:02:27.080> some

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
pump while you run and get some

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.110 
pump while you run and get some
something<00:02:27.739> else<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.130> hold<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.459> fluid<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.850> so

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
something else to hold the fluid in so

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.320 
something else to hold the fluid in so
we'll<00:02:30.110> check<00:02:30.290> back<00:02:30.319> in<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> few<00:02:30.709> minutes

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
we'll check back in a few minutes

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.670 
we'll check back in a few minutes
fluid<00:02:32.330> has<00:02:32.510> quit<00:02:32.810> draining<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.319> now<00:02:33.470> we're

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
fluid has quit draining so now we're

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.140 
fluid has quit draining so now we're
just<00:02:33.709> going<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.040> pull<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.400> old<00:02:34.610> pump<00:02:34.819> out<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
just going to pull this old pump out and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.199 
just going to pull this old pump out and
it<00:02:35.209> really<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.630> pulls<00:02:35.930> right<00:02:36.200> out<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.440> there

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
it really just pulls right out of there

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.630 
it really just pulls right out of there
I've<00:02:38.209> noticed<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.900> one<00:02:39.080> pulls<00:02:39.290> out

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
I've noticed when this one pulls out

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.000 
I've noticed when this one pulls out
that<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:41.000> appears<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.480> have<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.780> filter<00:02:42.650> there

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
that it appears to have a filter there

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.660 
that it appears to have a filter there
on<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.209> end<00:02:44.440> whereas<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.560> new<00:02:45.709> one<00:02:48.280> does<00:02:49.280> not

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
on the end whereas the new one does not

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.490 
on the end whereas the new one does not
but<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.180> looks<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:50.870> hold<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.290> old

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
but it looks like it will hold that old

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.900 
but it looks like it will hold that old
filter<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.070> I'm<00:02:52.160> going<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.340> go<00:02:52.459> ahead<00:02:52.609> and<00:02:52.730> put

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
filter so I'm going to go ahead and put

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.599 
filter so I'm going to go ahead and put
the<00:02:53.060> old<00:02:53.209> filter<00:02:53.590> back<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.799> there<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.190> then

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
the old filter back in there and then

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.340 
the old filter back in there and then
we'll<00:02:55.850> start<00:02:56.090> putting<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.390> back<00:02:56.480> together<00:02:56.630> so

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
we'll start putting it back together so

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.069 
we'll start putting it back together so
I've<00:02:57.440> got<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.859> filter<00:02:58.519> in<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.420> new<00:02:59.570> pump<00:02:59.840> and

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
I've got the filter in the new pump and

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.069 
I've got the filter in the new pump and
something<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.100> note<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.750> new<00:03:02.750> pump

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
something to note is that new pump

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.710 
something to note is that new pump
shipped<00:03:03.560> with<00:03:03.799> this<00:03:03.980> black<00:03:04.549> rubber<00:03:05.090> gasket

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
shipped with this black rubber gasket

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.650 
shipped with this black rubber gasket
which<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:07.340> piece<00:03:08.590> right<00:03:09.590> there<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.660> this

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
which is just piece right there and this

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.940 
which is just piece right there and this
can<00:03:11.870> come<00:03:12.079> out<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.230> there<00:03:12.470> but<00:03:12.650> it's<00:03:12.799> pretty

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
can come out of there but it's pretty

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.860 
can come out of there but it's pretty
soft<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.670> feels<00:03:13.850> like<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.150> been<00:03:14.329> good

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
soft and it feels like it's been good

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.170 
soft and it feels like it's been good
shape<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.340> I'm<00:03:16.340> just<00:03:16.579> going<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.760> leave<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:16.970> in

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
shape so I'm just going to leave it in

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.830 
shape so I'm just going to leave it in
and<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.930> think<00:03:18.769> it'll<00:03:18.950> be<00:03:19.069> fine<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.450> put<00:03:20.720> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
and I think it'll be fine so I put the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.140 
and I think it'll be fine so I put the
new<00:03:20.959> pump<00:03:21.200> in<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.889> was<00:03:21.980> really<00:03:22.010> easy<00:03:22.310> all

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
new pump in and it was really easy all

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.949 
new pump in and it was really easy all
you've<00:03:23.420> got<00:03:23.569> to<00:03:23.660> do<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:23.930> make<00:03:24.260> sure<00:03:24.290> that

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
you've got to do is just make sure that

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.819 
you've got to do is just make sure that
this<00:03:26.959> piece<00:03:27.819> right<00:03:28.819> here<00:03:28.880> goes<00:03:29.269> up<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.959> then

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
this piece right here goes up and then

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.240 
this piece right here goes up and then
that<00:03:31.750> white<00:03:32.750> part<00:03:33.019> goes<00:03:33.170> into<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:34.130> the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
that white part goes into the to the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.490 
that white part goes into the to the
gasket<00:03:34.670> form<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:35.690> there<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.350> we're

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
gasket form so there it is and we're

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.039 
gasket form so there it is and we're
going<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.650> put<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:36.920> hoses<00:03:37.220> back<00:03:37.370> on<00:03:37.639> and<00:03:38.049> the

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
going to put the hoses back on and the

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.449 
going to put the hoses back on and the
electrical<00:03:39.410> back<00:03:39.590> up<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.010> we<00:03:40.069> should<00:03:40.250> be<00:03:40.340> good

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
electrical back up and we should be good

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.449 
electrical back up and we should be good
to<00:03:40.549> go<00:03:40.670> pump<00:03:40.880> this<00:03:41.000> back<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:41.450> we<00:03:42.410> connected<00:03:43.340> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
to go pump this back in we connected the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.300 
to go pump this back in we connected the
electrical<00:03:44.170> wires<00:03:45.170> put<00:03:45.560> our<00:03:45.650> red<00:03:45.829> clip<00:03:46.100> back

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
electrical wires put our red clip back

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.420 
electrical wires put our red clip back
down<00:03:46.549> in<00:03:46.760> there<00:03:46.880> connected<00:03:47.660> our<00:03:47.780> tubes<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.430> I

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
down in there connected our tubes and I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.699 
down in there connected our tubes and I
wrapped<00:03:49.639> a<00:03:49.760> piece<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:50.410> electrical<00:03:51.410> tape

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
wrapped a piece of electrical tape

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.550 
wrapped a piece of electrical tape
around<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.489> wiring<00:03:52.700> harness<00:03:53.120> because

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
around that wiring harness because

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.740 
around that wiring harness because
that's<00:03:54.560> how<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.799> was<00:03:54.920> when<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.129> found<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.750> we're

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
that's how it was when I found it we're

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.110 
that's how it was when I found it we're
going<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.170> put<00:03:57.409> our<00:03:57.530> fluid<00:03:57.890> back<00:03:58.040> in

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
going to put our fluid back in

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.699 
going to put our fluid back in
and<00:03:59.209> try<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.750> out<00:04:01.959> after<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.080> moment<00:04:03.230> of<00:04:03.470> truth

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.759

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
we have a clean winch line windshield

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.880 
we have a clean winch line windshield
