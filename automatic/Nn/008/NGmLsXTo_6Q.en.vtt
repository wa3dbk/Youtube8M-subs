the data that came out rich it was a
little<00:00:22.020> shy<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.350> our<00:00:22.920> expectations<00:00:23.910> however

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420

the revision kind of made up for the

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.910 
the revision kind of made up for the
differential<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.900> found<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> pretty

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
differential I found a pretty

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.790 
differential I found a pretty
interesting<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.939> number<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.929> saw<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
interesting on the number we saw the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.600 
interesting on the number we saw the
10-year<00:00:32.189> note<00:00:32.940> yields<00:00:33.809> drop<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:35.190> bit<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
10-year note yields drop a little bit so

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.970 
10-year note yields drop a little bit so
there<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> safety

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
there is a little bit of a safety

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.639 
there is a little bit of a safety
feature<00:00:37.980> safe<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> trade<00:00:38.969> happening

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649

above<00:00:42.719> 1300<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.680> i<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.200> number

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
above 1300 and i think that the number

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380 
above 1300 and i think that the number
wasn't<00:00:46.800> quite<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.550> good<00:00:47.760> enough<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
wasn't quite as good enough as the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
wasn't quite as good enough as the
market<00:00:48.690> expected<00:00:49.289> i<00:00:49.440> still<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:49.950> there's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
market expected i still think there's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.439 
market expected i still think there's
going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.670> volatility<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
going to be some volatility in the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
going to be some volatility in the
equities<00:00:51.899> even<00:00:52.289> though<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> markets<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
equities even though the markets up and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
equities even though the markets up and
i<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.850> there's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> safety

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
i think there's a little bit of a safety

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959 
i think there's a little bit of a safety
play<00:00:55.110> happening<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.829> now<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.129> gold<00:00:56.610> and

keep<00:01:19.950> bringing<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.939> is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
keep bringing that up because this is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
keep bringing that up because this is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
all the way to the top of 1392 and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.380 
all the way to the top of 1392 and
change<00:01:48.630> however<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:50.009> dropped<00:01:50.280> too<00:01:50.549> quickly<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
change however it dropped too quickly it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
change however it dropped too quickly it
was<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.170> oversold<00:01:52.710> right<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> the

hundred a moving average support came in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
hundred a moving average support came in
I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.250> still<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.490> value<00:01:56.909> by<00:01:57.060> today's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
I think it's still a value by today's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.670 
gold prices and in fact gold turned
lower<00:02:12.150> afterwards<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.349> also

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
lower afterwards you also

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.140 
lower afterwards you also
mentioned<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.010> you're<00:02:14.189> putting<00:02:14.549> your<00:02:14.670> focus

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
mentioned that you're putting your focus

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.880 
mentioned that you're putting your focus
on<00:02:15.299> Treasury<00:02:15.870> yield<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.319> how<00:02:16.469> do<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.680> see

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
on Treasury yield so how do you see

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.800 
on Treasury yield so how do you see
interest<00:02:17.219> rates<00:02:17.359> affecting<00:02:18.359> gold<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.719> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
interest rates affecting gold in the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.280 
interest rates affecting gold in the
short<00:02:19.109> term<00:02:19.319> now<00:02:19.650> rich<00:02:19.890> well<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:21.299> think<00:02:21.900> overall

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
short term now rich well I think overall

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
short term now rich well I think overall
i'm<00:02:22.799> expecting<00:02:23.579> interest<00:02:24.000> rates<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.390> creep

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
i'm expecting interest rates to creep

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.420 
i'm expecting interest rates to creep
higher<00:02:25.079> through<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> remainder<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.219> the<00:02:26.400> year

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
higher through the remainder of the year

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.880 
higher through the remainder of the year
we're<00:02:27.209> in<00:02:27.359> a<00:02:27.450> bit<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.870> range<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.500> same

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
we're in a bit of a range here same

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.160 
we're in a bit of a range here same
thing<00:02:28.920> over<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.579> a<00:02:29.640> bit<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:29.969> range<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
thing over in a bit of a range so you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.319 
thing over in a bit of a range so you
have<00:02:31.379> to<00:02:31.590> take<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.799> look<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.159> the<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.909> yields<00:02:33.239> on

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
have to take a look at the the yields on

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.170 
have to take a look at the the yields on
the<00:02:33.420> 10-year<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.379> were<00:02:34.469> to<00:02:34.560> pull<00:02:34.769> up<00:02:34.889> a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the 10-year if you were to pull up a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.929 
the 10-year if you were to pull up a
five<00:02:36.180> minute<00:02:36.480> bar<00:02:36.689> chart<00:02:37.079> on<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:38.099> 10-year

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
five minute bar chart on the 10-year

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.679 
five minute bar chart on the 10-year
note<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.840> gold<00:02:40.079> today<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.829> would<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.189> a

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
note and the gold today you would see a

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.690 
note and the gold today you would see a
complete<00:02:42.689> inverse<00:02:43.170> relationship<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.579> way

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
complete inverse relationship so the way

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.460 
complete inverse relationship so the way
I'm<00:02:44.879> gauging<00:02:45.299> gold<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:45.900> looking<00:02:46.019> at<00:02:46.319> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
I'm gauging gold is I'm looking at the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.960 
I'm gauging gold is I'm looking at the
rates<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.889> think<00:02:47.340> ultimately<00:02:47.430> they're<00:02:47.849> going

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
rates I think ultimately they're going

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.300 
rates I think ultimately they're going
to<00:02:48.030> go<00:02:48.120> higher<00:02:48.359> however<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.409> think<00:02:49.590> bold<00:02:50.040> has

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
to go higher however I think bold has

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.869 
to go higher however I think bold has
great<00:02:50.669> support<00:02:50.909> in<00:02:51.299> 1180<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.349> even<00:02:52.760> 1270<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
great support in 1180 and even 1270 the

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.089 
great support in 1180 and even 1270 the
108<00:02:54.389> moving<00:02:54.629> average<00:02:54.900> i'm<00:02:55.079> currently<00:02:55.620> long

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
108 moving average i'm currently long

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.490 
108 moving average i'm currently long
looking<00:02:56.879> for<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> market<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.510> go<00:02:57.720> up<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.109> rates

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
looking for the market to go up as rates

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.679 
looking for the market to go up as rates
pull<00:02:58.829> back<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.430> equity<00:02:59.849> market<00:03:00.239> i<00:03:00.299> think<00:03:00.569> is

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
pull back the equity market i think is

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.839 
pull back the equity market i think is
reaching<00:03:01.109> an<00:03:01.439> inflection<00:03:01.980> point<00:03:02.280> where<00:03:02.700> we

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
reaching an inflection point where we

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.789 
reaching an inflection point where we
probably<00:03:03.120> pull<00:03:03.599> back<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> little<00:03:04.049> bit<00:03:04.349> i<00:03:04.560> think

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
probably pull back a little bit i think

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.009 
probably pull back a little bit i think
gold<00:03:05.340> has<00:03:05.549> good<00:03:05.790> shot<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.419> continue<00:03:06.750> its

gold has good shot here to continue its
iron<00:03:07.260> momentum<00:03:07.919> up<00:03:08.430> because<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.909> was<00:03:09.030> just

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
iron momentum up because it was just

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.209

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
think this is a solid trait it's very

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.330 
think this is a solid trait it's very
similar<00:03:58.979> to<00:03:59.129> the<00:04:00.060> gold<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.259> look<00:04:01.439> at<00:04:01.560> your<00:04:01.590> 108
