here and I feel that stretching like

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.270 
here and I feel that stretching like
crazy<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.900> side<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.560> let<00:01:37.799> me<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.040> poke

on so here I'll go out here around here

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.540 
on so here I'll go out here around here
that<00:01:47.940> I'll<00:01:48.060> use<00:01:48.090> these<00:01:48.600> hip<00:01:48.900> flexors

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
that I'll use these hip flexors

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.500 
that I'll use these hip flexors
contracting<00:01:50.550> those<00:01:50.700> will<00:01:51.030> help<00:01:51.060> these

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
contracting those will help these

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.010 
contracting those will help these
muscles<00:01:52.020> relax<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:57.060> feel<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.330> really<00:01:57.690> nice

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
muscles relax and I feel a really nice

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.100 
muscles relax and I feel a really nice
stretch<00:01:58.470> on<00:01:58.800> this<00:01:59.670> side<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.960> new

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
stretch on this side so there's a new

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.290 
stretch on this side so there's a new
way<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.220> are<00:02:02.370> figure<00:02:02.760> 4<00:02:03.060> or

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
way that you can do you are figure 4 or

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.570 
way that you can do you are figure 4 or
pretzel<00:02:03.780> stretch<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.380> think<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.400> way<00:02:05.550> more

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
pretzel stretch I think it's way more

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.820 
pretzel stretch I think it's way more
effective<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.510> love<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:07.260> idea<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
effective and I love that idea of

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.940 
effective and I love that idea of
activating<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.240> hip<00:02:09.660> flexor<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.410> side<00:02:10.710> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
activating the hip flexor on one side to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.730 
activating the hip flexor on one side to
get<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> glue<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.030> relax<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.600> little<00:02:12.750> bit<00:02:13.020> which

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
get the glue to relax a little bit which

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.440 
get the glue to relax a little bit which
