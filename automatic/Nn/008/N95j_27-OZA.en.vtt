00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:04.109
 or 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.070
 I'm going to show you how to do that with the return of m 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.199
 in 68 hundredths September diameter 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.429
 a news 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.519
 to achieve for example head of line 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.400
 also 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.079
 with a steady pace 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.260
 I will realize 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.430
 which will allow 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.950
 to link the carbon fluorine 70 hundredth the four services 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.220
 to do this to use a lighter 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 and good for the club 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.740
 it was a little ball 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.280
 how beautiful is the capital 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 then 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.700
 I take my place 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150
 but with the press 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.980
 I close for the euro like this 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.600
 by the waves 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.520
 what to do 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.520
 which gift 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.830
 since the age of five days 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.440
 we see very well the spurs 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.070
 I'm going now together with his laws 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.020
 I'm passing 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.280
 the piece of press in the loop 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.800
 I know the sum 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 the usher so that the choice tight 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.810
 and now the whole tea 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.810
 against the team whose carbon price 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.430
 finish it 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.100
 I have more money 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 the excellent press that exceeds 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.070
 and this year 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.510
 to realize this the the most holy prophet knows 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.300
 so I'm taking it shortly 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.710
 the carbon fluo 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.940
 and I'm going with a lighter 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.840
 bulls and spurs 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.929
 so we see here 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.260
 its small political form 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.609
 and it's only odd jobs that will allow cereals 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.719
 it is very very resistant 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.899
 I will take my plant 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.959
 inside 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.809
 ranked at risk this idea 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.779
 a small amount of sugar for large mobility between regions 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.739
 rebel 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.449
 the most alcoholic according to them 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:33.839
 I will actually go through 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.259
 the carbon fluo 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.669
 inside the ring 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.849
 we see very well here 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.159
 and here I want to do better 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.179
 he remains more 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.569
 who shot on stage 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 to those thibault faurecia who blocked together 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.349
 so that's beefy I draw all the forms all the mouths
