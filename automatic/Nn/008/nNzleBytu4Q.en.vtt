00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.110

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.440
 they can also stop good names 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.449
 of the games that you want me 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.399
 I can try in the terminal is difficult 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.180
 see really well or at least they are 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.100
 playable I'll bring it in a video 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.649
 some when they do not download the apple 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.629
 store it seems that the language in English 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.489
 then you can go there where it says 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.720
 system and in this part it is worth if the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.399
 language 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.860
 where they are going to give to be able to change 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.960
 I'm going to leave a language for the moment 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.380
 small example of what senado by 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 hundred 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.480
 I already have what is a save 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.490
 so it will not be repeated 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.890
 for me this game is one of those that 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.930
 better you can not and not play the best 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 terminal is the engine of the moto gp and in 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.900
 My car 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.570
 for now I will play with my control and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.430
 hit some that have those types of 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.790
 controls and makes of playstation those of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.640
 xbox or some with bluetooth system 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.380
 to be able to connect I can leave in 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.330
 a comment and in the next video they 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.310
 can teach how to map it to be able to 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.579
 play it well 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.540
 let's continue I've had a game 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.120
 saved 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.950
 Now let's play 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:04.140
 with scenarios chapter first so 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.020
 and we are going to leave this 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.479
 different equipment users only 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.380
 we have four then let's leave 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.360
 these 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.910
 as we can see it has nothing of the and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.730
 you can play very well we can also 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.970
 do the combos to be able to illuminate what 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.280
 easier we can fill our chaco and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.250
 we get the phases above in the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.270
 right part you can see the health of 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.850
 our mates 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.120
 we can destroy some of those here 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.120
 Latin 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.040
 we can turn what the mission has done 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.410
 towards our easier with control 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.410
 because you can move easier 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.730
 we'll see 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.010
 we will not want to turn away extra 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.780
 start the game I think they own it 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.099
 let's make thousands of apples because 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.099
