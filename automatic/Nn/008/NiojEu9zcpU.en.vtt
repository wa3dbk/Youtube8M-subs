00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 I don't know if it can be called yes 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 the important I in the preparation for 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.519
 I had asked the boys about 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.269
 continue on what was the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.520
 last Sunday's performance 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.609
 let's say that apart from the first ten minutes 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 where it was not so because we have 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 played with fear 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.000
 we have committed naivety la 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.289
 team has grown and then the came 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.789
 performance because we have anyway 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.650
 we have created the field well 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.130
 also of the occasions while suffering 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.130
 because we know who we were facing 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.670
 in the neck with numerical inferiority 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.860
 we suffered but it was normal that 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 we could suffer but there is good that 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.649
 we bring home a very important point 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 which must make a leap in quality a 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.129
 mentality level to make it clear that 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.960
 however, at other times I said that there 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.699
 we can be in this category to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320
 understand to the boys that not only 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.320
 we can be there but we can also 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 take great satisfaction 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 even in times of difficulty we 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.390
 we must put ourselves in the head that in 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.790
 any time with any play 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:23.490
 we can be more important 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.290
 in the do zone in the goal zone 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.330
 in the management of the ball in the in 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.370
 also catch the defense because not 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.400
 we can play an action and suffer an action 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.400
 other 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.320
 many times the management difference 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.630
 the ball is run to empty the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.190
 opponents so you have to start from there 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.870
 wickedness also on the part of 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.570
 attackers to make a defensive phase 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:52.690
 in the beginning of the most opposing action 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.110
 I wouldn't know how to define it more badly 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.600
 not to be overcome must leave 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.119
 from there because he defends himself in eleven and yes 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.660
 attacks in eleven we cannot 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.009
 allow us deadlock where 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.230
 maybe i know ok 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.880
 we defend in 7 then the ball comes to me 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.190
 in fact we did it in fact of 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.810
 this are are satisfied are 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.550
 agree on the fact of the defense that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.970
 it must rise but we must not 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.930
 forget that maybe we had in the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.280
 eyes and head and some goals taken 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.920
 with the ball behind you 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.560
 if we make the defensive line like 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.980
 we have done in the past in the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.380
 past static games then not 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.630
 we can go up we must stay low but 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.440
 if the defensive line is dynamic then 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.640
 go up and run then I agree with 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.070
 she 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.330
 I disagree that today was the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.560
 best performance because I believe that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.420
 that of last Sunday 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.440
 I think it was a very good performance 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.000
 but very important and clear that the le 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.940
 opportunities we have suffered in goals 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.830
 they certainly go to conditioning 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.880
 a thought, however, as we have held 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.600
 the field the performance on Sunday 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.209
 last one was a beautiful one 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.510
 beautiful performance 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.130
 however no because we always ie 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.530
 we are almost always gone 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.230
 below and the team also last Sunday 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.380
 he never gave up always reacting today 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.380
 more and more 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.300
 the fact of bringing home something makes 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.880
 surely grow in conviction 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.860
 but first we did an example of 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.050
 whole of goats if they had the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.370
 belief to be better than 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.959
 those who eventually are not talking 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.190
 of presumption but precisely in the desire 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.840
 to do something more important 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.630
 then we can surely grow the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.790
 Ball management is essential 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.590
 crucial in this know-how to 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.230
 right thing at the right time if you play it 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.239
 to get it or to bet the opponent in 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.140
 we did part of it but also a lot 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.390
 well today we must not forget that 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.110
 even with the man less 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.120
 I think the rigor on the hole was 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.540
 important there was I don't know it seemed to me 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.630
 from my perspective that there was one 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.900
 team that even in in one less man 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.979
 although he suffered he still searched 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.330
 to go to the opponent's goal field 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.150
 taking into account however that they had of 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.129
 face of the important team for 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.139
 made a great parade then face to face 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:41.559
 yes yes yes but pelizzoli is training 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:45.349
 very well and we have it in the sense that 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.819
 yes yes yes or the numbers one that they are in 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.769
 bench 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:52.149
 I see it this way here why 

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:52.149
 he is training really well
