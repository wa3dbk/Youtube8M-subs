00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
put a plate on top of the coil and then

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.700 
put a plate on top of the coil and then
lay<00:01:03.050> down<00:01:04.360> shake<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.390> little<00:01:05.750> bit<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.050> then

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.510 

the<00:01:16.120> next<00:01:16.420> step<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.870> to<00:01:17.080> put<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.950> warm<00:01:18.220> water

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
the next step is to put the warm water

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.510 
the next step is to put the warm water
into<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.180> coil<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.680> wait<00:01:20.680> for<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.010> mati

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
into the coil and wait for the mati

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:30.440 
into the coil and wait for the mati
to<00:01:21.670> absorb

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 

after<00:01:31.200> about<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.770> minute<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.729> matter<00:01:33.000> has

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
after about one minute the matter has

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.460 
after about one minute the matter has
absorbed<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.960> water<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.330> now<00:01:36.330> you're<00:01:37.320> going

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
absorbed the water and now you're going

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.820 
absorbed the water and now you're going
to<00:01:37.560> set<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.830> Bamba<00:01:38.340> into<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> queer<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.550 
thumb in the end and gently you insert
the<00:01:46.979> Bamba<00:01:47.369> into<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.880> queer<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.380> don't

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the Bamba into the queer but you don't

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.609 
the Bamba into the queer but you don't
have<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.430> bottom<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
have to go to the bottom and then you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.260 
have to go to the bottom and then you
twist

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.580 

this<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.450> what<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.780> action<00:01:57.170> should<00:01:57.680> look<00:01:57.950> like

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.380 

and<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.310> put<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> hot<00:02:02.759> water<00:02:03.030> into

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and now we can put the hot water into

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.300 
and now we can put the hot water into
the<00:02:03.600> Shema<00:02:03.810> how<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.470> must<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.130> water

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the Shema how you must know the water

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.460 
the Shema how you must know the water
must<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> hot<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.360> boiling<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
must be hot but not boiling because it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:17.309 
must be hot but not boiling because it
can<00:02:07.680> burns<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.190> Martin

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.599 

and<00:02:17.709> I'll<00:02:18.010> enjoy<00:02:18.189> it<00:02:18.519> must<00:02:19.390> watch<00:02:19.569> it
