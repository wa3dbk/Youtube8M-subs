represent<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.880> player<00:03:57.120> characters<00:03:58.190> I'm

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
represent the player characters I'm

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.400 
represent the player characters I'm
guessing<00:03:59.810> even<00:04:00.810> though<00:04:00.989> there's<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.260> whole

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
guessing even though there's a whole

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.740 
guessing even though there's a whole
bunch<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.160> them<00:04:02.310> there<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.790> no<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.239> would<00:04:03.570> just

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
bunch of them there and no I would just

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.140 
bunch of them there and no I would just
maybe<00:04:04.350> they're<00:04:04.590> representing<00:04:05.310> like<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.700> team

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
maybe they're representing like a team

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.550 
maybe they're representing like a team
of<00:04:06.510> player<00:04:07.440> characters<00:04:08.570> coming<00:04:09.570> together<00:04:09.720> to

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
of player characters coming together to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.289 
of player characters coming together to
defend<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> pale<00:04:11.250> tree<00:04:11.610> since<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.030> looks

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
defend the pale tree since that looks

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.819 
defend the pale tree since that looks
like<00:04:12.480> what<00:04:12.630> we're<00:04:12.750> doing<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:15.329> just

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
that's gonna be that would be a much

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.770 
that's gonna be that would be a much
bigger<00:05:04.290> event<00:05:04.740> than<00:05:04.830> just<00:05:05.610> seeing<00:05:06.510> something

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
bigger event than just seeing something

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.900 
bigger event than just seeing something
come<00:05:07.140> down<00:05:07.380> on<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.680> pale<00:05:07.860> tree<00:05:07.890> like<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.400> dragon

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
come down on the pale tree like a dragon

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.750 
come down on the pale tree like a dragon
rising<00:05:09.510> means<00:05:10.170> like<00:05:10.500> water<00:05:10.980> levels<00:05:11.460> rise

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
rising means like water levels rise

hounds<00:05:12.570> get<00:05:12.750> destroyed<00:05:13.130> continents<00:05:14.130> Islands

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
get destroyed when a dragon rises so I

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.320 
get destroyed when a dragon rises so I
don't<00:05:17.130> think<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.700> that's<00:05:17.940> what<00:05:18.120> we're

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
don't think that that's what we're

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.540 
don't think that that's what we're
seeing<00:05:18.570> here<00:05:18.930> is<00:05:19.140> as<00:05:19.410> actual<00:05:19.830> mordremoth

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550

seeing here is as actual mordremoth
rising<00:05:21.260> maybe<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:23.450> maybe<00:05:24.450> a<00:05:24.510> champion<00:05:25.110> of

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
rising maybe a maybe a champion of

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.860 
rising maybe a maybe a champion of
mordremoth's<00:05:26.070> will<00:05:27.030> rise<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.480> attack<00:05:27.750> the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
mordremoth's will rise and attack the

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.760 
mordremoth's will rise and attack the
pale<00:05:28.050> tree<00:05:28.080> directly<00:05:29.210> that's<00:05:30.210> that's<00:05:30.770> that's

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
pale tree directly that's that's that's

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.860 
pale tree directly that's that's that's
my<00:05:31.980> prediction<00:05:32.190> is<00:05:32.610> we're<00:05:33.330> just<00:05:33.510> gonna<00:05:33.630> see

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
my prediction is we're just gonna see

quaddle or the Shatterer or the claw of
Jorah<00:05:39.060> mag<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:40.260> think<00:05:41.190> that<00:05:41.430> might<00:05:41.850> be<00:05:42.180> what

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
Jorah mag I think that might be what

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.440 
Jorah mag I think that might be what
we're<00:05:42.690> looking<00:05:43.050> at<00:05:43.200> but<00:05:43.920> something<00:05:44.880> like<00:05:45.060> just

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
we're looking at but something like just

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.470 
we're looking at but something like just
one<00:05:45.810> of<00:05:45.840> his<00:05:46.170> champions<00:05:47.160> is<00:05:47.430> so<00:05:47.700> powerful<00:05:48.240> that

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480
