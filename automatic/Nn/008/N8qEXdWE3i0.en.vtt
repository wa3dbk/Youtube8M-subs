00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
then it's going to be placed on a yeah

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.830 
then it's going to be placed on a yeah
watch<00:05:55.280> I've<00:05:55.520> got<00:05:55.640> the<00:05:55.729> yeast<00:05:55.850> there<00:05:56.120> Young's<00:05:56.479> I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
watch I've got the yeast there Young's I

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.120 
watch I've got the yeast there Young's I
can<00:05:57.710> do<00:05:57.830> it<00:05:57.890> that<00:05:59.169> just<00:06:00.169> do<00:06:00.290> I<00:06:00.560> say<00:06:00.710> yeast<00:06:00.919> a

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
can do it that just do I say yeast a

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.060 
can do it that just do I say yeast a

touched up put a little bit sugar in
with<00:06:18.830> that<00:06:18.919> as<00:06:19.040> well<00:06:19.220> it's<00:06:20.120> enough<00:06:20.300> things<00:06:20.510> to

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
with that as well it's enough things to

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.500 
with that as well it's enough things to
be<00:06:21.370> it<00:06:22.370> just<00:06:22.580> means<00:06:22.820> that<00:06:22.910> when<00:06:23.090> that<00:06:23.240> yeast

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
be it just means that when that yeast

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.210 
be it just means that when that yeast
goes<00:06:23.720> into<00:06:24.200> the<00:06:24.849> another<00:06:25.849> to<00:06:26.060> expand

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
goes into the another to expand

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.680 
goes into the another to expand
when<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:27.910> yeast<00:06:28.060> goes<00:06:28.300> into<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.720> wine<00:06:28.900> later

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
when the yeast goes into the wine later

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.000 
when the yeast goes into the wine later
there's<00:06:31.690> not<00:06:31.870> wireless<00:06:32.110> juice<00:06:32.470> earlier<00:06:32.830> than

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
there's not wireless juice earlier than

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.670 
there's not wireless juice earlier than
but<00:06:33.190> when<00:06:34.030> it<00:06:34.150> goes<00:06:34.270> in<00:06:34.480> later<00:06:34.660> it's<00:06:35.110> going<00:06:35.470> to

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
but when it goes in later it's going to

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.050 
but when it goes in later it's going to
it<00:06:36.720> just<00:06:37.720> add<00:06:37.870> the<00:06:38.020> opportunity<00:06:38.800> to<00:06:39.580> expand<00:06:39.940> a

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
it just add the opportunity to expand a

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
it just add the opportunity to expand a
little<00:06:40.270> bit<00:06:40.360> it<00:06:40.450> won't<00:06:40.540> get<00:06:40.750> overwhelmed<00:06:43.080> and

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
little bit it won't get overwhelmed and

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.550 
little bit it won't get overwhelmed and
won't<00:06:44.290> get<00:06:44.440> overwhelmed<00:06:45.010> by<00:06:45.190> the<00:06:45.250> earth<00:06:46.560> you

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
won't get overwhelmed by the earth you

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.110 
won't get overwhelmed by the earth you
know<00:06:47.620> a<00:06:47.650> sudden<00:06:48.070> shock<00:06:48.580> they're<00:06:48.760> going<00:06:48.940> in<00:06:49.030> a

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
know a sudden shock they're going in a

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.510 
know a sudden shock they're going in a
different<00:06:49.390> temperature<00:06:50.190> that<00:06:51.190> won't<00:06:51.430> grow

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
different temperature that won't grow

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.550 
different temperature that won't grow
we'll<00:06:51.760> see<00:06:51.880> it<00:06:51.940> like<00:06:52.090> an<00:06:52.210> Iraqi<00:06:52.840> later<00:06:53.140> okay

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
we'll see it like an Iraqi later okay

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.440 
we'll see it like an Iraqi later okay
that's<00:06:54.250> all<00:06:54.370> I<00:06:54.490> can<00:06:54.610> do<00:06:54.790> at<00:06:54.880> this<00:06:54.940> stage<00:06:55.000> now

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
that's all I can do at this stage now

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.250 
that's all I can do at this stage now
until<00:06:56.520> till<00:06:57.520> that's<00:06:57.640> cooled<00:06:57.940> down<00:06:58.180> and<00:06:58.960> all<00:06:59.140> of

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
until till that's cooled down and all of

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.020 
until till that's cooled down and all of
it<00:06:59.350> I<00:06:59.380> do<00:06:59.530> basically<00:06:59.830> then<00:07:00.400> let's<00:07:00.640> take<00:07:00.790> two

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
it I do basically then let's take two

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.230 
it I do basically then let's take two
bags<00:07:01.270> out<00:07:01.860> strain<00:07:02.860> them<00:07:03.010> into<00:07:03.220> a<00:07:03.280> demijohn<00:07:03.820> few

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
bags out strain them into a demijohn few

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.630 
bags out strain them into a demijohn few
things<00:07:04.480> to<00:07:04.690> to<00:07:05.410> know<00:07:05.560> about<00:07:05.710> that<00:07:06.040> but<00:07:06.520> I'll

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
things to to know about that but I'll

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.100 
things to to know about that but I'll
show<00:07:06.790> you<00:07:06.820> later<00:07:07.000> but<00:07:07.600> it's<00:07:07.750> already

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
show you later but it's already

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.570 
show you later but it's already
promising<00:07:08.590> cuz<00:07:08.800> it<00:07:08.890> smells<00:07:09.190> nice<00:07:09.490> and<00:07:11.580> they're

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
promising cuz it smells nice and they're

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.150 
promising cuz it smells nice and they're
so<00:07:12.760> easy<00:07:12.970> so<00:07:13.840> this<00:07:13.990> is<00:07:14.110> part<00:07:14.350> one<00:07:14.590> part<00:07:14.830> see<00:07:15.100> you

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
so easy so this is part one part see you

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.000 
so easy so this is part one part see you
later<00:07:15.370> for<00:07:15.490> part<00:07:15.760> two
