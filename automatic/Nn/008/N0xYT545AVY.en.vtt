the fifth hidden weight gain factor

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.829 
the fifth hidden weight gain factor
which<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.489> impacts<00:00:41.999> so<00:00:42.149> many<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.539> us<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
which I think impacts so many of us in

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.000 
which I think impacts so many of us in
this<00:00:42.960> day<00:00:43.199> and<00:00:43.230> time<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:44.659> cortisol<00:00:45.659> which<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
this day and time is cortisol which is a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.160 
this day and time is cortisol which is a
fat<00:00:47.609> promoting<00:00:48.210> hormone<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.140> secreted

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
fat promoting hormone that is secreted

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.770 
fat promoting hormone that is secreted
by<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> adrenals<00:00:50.609> when<00:00:50.909> you're<00:00:51.269> under<00:00:51.749> stress

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
by the adrenals when you're under stress

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.009 
by the adrenals when you're under stress
and<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.859> this<00:00:52.980> day<00:00:53.249> and<00:00:53.280> time<00:00:53.489> who<00:00:54.390> isn't<00:00:54.780> under

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
and in this day and time who isn't under

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.590 
and in this day and time who isn't under
stress<00:00:55.409> so<00:00:56.159> the<00:00:56.249> question<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.909> what<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.479> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
stress so the question is what do you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.590 
stress so the question is what do you
practically<00:00:58.319> do<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.159> well<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> identify

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
practically do about it well I identify

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.649 
practically do about it well I identify
several<00:01:01.190> lifestyle<00:01:02.190> factors<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.569> are

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
several lifestyle factors I think are

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.149 
several lifestyle factors I think are
very<00:01:03.839> important<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.530> terms<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> controlling

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
very important in terms of controlling

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
very important in terms of controlling
stress<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.300> them<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> getting<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> bed<00:01:07.200> by

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
stress one of them is getting to bed by

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.710 
stress one of them is getting to bed by
at<00:01:07.530> least<00:01:07.680> 10<00:01:08.040> o'clock<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.580> evening<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
at least 10 o'clock in the evening so

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
at least 10 o'clock in the evening so
that<00:01:09.870> your<00:01:09.990> body's<00:01:10.380> circadian<00:01:10.860> rhythm

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that your body's circadian rhythm

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.940 
that your body's circadian rhythm
becomes<00:01:11.880> normalized<00:01:12.710> oftentimes<00:01:13.710> when

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
becomes normalized oftentimes when

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.740 
becomes normalized oftentimes when
people<00:01:13.979> wake<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.549> intermittently<00:01:15.509> it's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
people wake up intermittently it's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
people wake up intermittently it's
because<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.259> cortisol<00:01:16.890> surges<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> middle

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
because of cortisol surges in the middle

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.300 
because of cortisol surges in the middle
of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> night<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.719> then<00:01:19.590> another<00:01:19.950> very

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
of the night and then another very

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.010 
of the night and then another very
important<00:01:20.820> factor<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.390> bet<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> haven't

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
important factor that I bet you haven't

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.529 
important factor that I bet you haven't
considered<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.070> intake<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> proper

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
considered is the intake of the proper

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.649 
considered is the intake of the proper
kinds<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.079> fats<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.880> fat<00:01:27.180> whether

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
kinds of fats I think that fat whether

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.100 
kinds of fats I think that fat whether
it's<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.200> coconut<00:01:28.979> oil<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.640> raw<00:01:30.210> butter<00:01:30.719> or

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
it's from coconut oil or raw butter or

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.929 
it's from coconut oil or raw butter or
the<00:01:31.140> GLA<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.310> mentioned<00:01:32.789> in<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the GLA that I mentioned in the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.209 
the GLA that I mentioned in the
beginning<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> those<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.859> so

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
beginning I think all of those are so

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.609 
beginning I think all of those are so
important<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> stabilize<00:01:36.240> blood<00:01:36.840> sugar<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
important to stabilize blood sugar and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.130 
important to stabilize blood sugar and
if<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:37.950> blood<00:01:38.189> sugar<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.609> stabilized<00:01:39.420> you're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
if your blood sugar is stabilized you're

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.789 
if your blood sugar is stabilized you're
not<00:01:40.289> as<00:01:40.469> likely<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:41.130> become<00:01:41.280> stressed<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.420> or

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
not as likely to become stressed out or

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
not as likely to become stressed out or
physiologically<00:01:43.799> stressed<00:01:44.219> in<00:01:44.659> addition<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
physiologically stressed in addition to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.690 
physiologically stressed in addition to
that<00:01:45.990> there's<00:01:46.320> certain<00:01:46.680> food<00:01:46.950> substances

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that there's certain food substances

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.840 
that there's certain food substances
primarily<00:01:48.329> alcoholic<00:01:49.289> beverages<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.130> well<00:01:50.189> as

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
primarily alcoholic beverages as well as

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.260 
primarily alcoholic beverages as well as
coffee<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.469> seem<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.280> excite<00:01:53.969> those

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
coffee that seem to really excite those

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
coffee that seem to really excite those
cortisol<00:01:54.929> levels<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:55.799> produce<00:01:56.070> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
cortisol levels and then produce this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
cortisol levels and then produce this
fat<00:01:56.969> promoting<00:01:57.600> hormone<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.590> has<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
fat promoting hormone that has a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.099 
fat promoting hormone that has a
penchant<00:01:59.880> for<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.420> middle<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.929> body

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
penchant for the middle of your body

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.760 
penchant for the middle of your body
where<00:02:01.530> there's<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:02.009> receptor<00:02:02.640> sites<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.770> so

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
where there's more receptor sites and so

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.649 
where there's more receptor sites and so
I<00:02:04.799> think<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.729> important<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.539> if

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
I think it's very important that if

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.300 
I think it's very important that if
you're<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.109> be<00:02:07.200> drinking<00:02:07.679> coffee<00:02:07.710> at

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you're going to be drinking coffee at

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.780 
you're going to be drinking coffee at
all<00:02:08.520> or<00:02:08.850> taking<00:02:09.300> an<00:02:09.420> alcohol<00:02:10.160> caffeine<00:02:11.160> or

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
all or taking an alcohol caffeine or

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.210 
all or taking an alcohol caffeine or
alcohol<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.230> important<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.040> when

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
alcohol I think it's important that when

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
alcohol I think it's important that when
you<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.060> do<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.720> when<00:02:15.900> you're<00:02:16.019> eating<00:02:16.409> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you do so you do so when you're eating a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.100 
you do so you do so when you're eating a
full<00:02:16.800> meal<00:02:17.099> not<00:02:17.730> between<00:02:18.239> meals<00:02:18.690> which<00:02:18.989> is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
full meal not between meals which is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.790 
full meal not between meals which is
going<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.409> spa

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
going to spa

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.460 
going to spa
those<00:02:20.100> cortisol<00:02:20.730> levels<00:02:21.150> one<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> other

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
those cortisol levels one of the other

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.070 
those cortisol levels one of the other
areas<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.220> terms<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.670> cortisol<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.810> think

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
areas in terms of cortisol and I think

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.690 
areas in terms of cortisol and I think
it's<00:02:25.230> very<00:02:25.440> important<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.040> all<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.400> us<00:02:26.490> to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
it's very important for all of us to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.880 
it's very important for all of us to
practice<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.330> daily<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.050> sufficient<00:02:28.800> amount

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
of exercise to kind of burn up that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920

to get that out of your system daily

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.150 
to get that out of your system daily
exercise<00:02:48.870> whether<00:02:49.200> that's<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.590> half<00:02:49.830> an<00:02:50.010> hour

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160

exercise whether that's a half an hour
on<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.640> treadmill<00:02:50.880> or<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> brisk<00:02:51.810> walk<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.440> think

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
on the treadmill or a brisk walk I think

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.950 
on the treadmill or a brisk walk I think
is<00:02:52.800> imperative<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.610> terms<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.300> getting<00:02:54.570> some

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
is imperative in terms of getting some

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.520 
is imperative in terms of getting some
of<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.110> hormonal<00:02:55.770> imbalance<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:57.140> get<00:02:58.140> itself

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
of that hormonal imbalance to get itself

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.010 
of that hormonal imbalance to get itself
equalized<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.910> when<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.270> comes<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.690> stress

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
equalized and so when it comes to stress

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
kind of fat that's going to keep you

secreting too much cortisol the fat
maker<00:03:28.080> which<00:03:28.380> i<00:03:28.530> think<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.920> one<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.190> the

maker which i think is one of the
underlying<00:03:29.580> causes<00:03:30.570> of<00:03:30.690> why<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:31.440> are<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:31.709> such
