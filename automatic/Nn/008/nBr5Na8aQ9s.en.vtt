 I think that the price of brand coffee shops is expensive.

 The cost of the bean-snacks amounted to 123

 Even if it is given the duties and labor costs, including rent and drinking coffee at the coffee shop company 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.100
 It's a lot different than the value. 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:03.080
 I can sell 1 to 3 cups in a row and continue to sell for 500 won. 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:07.250

 If you sell smaller than that, the cost is 320 won 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.090
 If you sell for 500 won, you will still have 185. 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.320
 Why do people buy brand-name coffee at an expensive price? 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.590

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:01.900
 We have been able to make the right price for coffee quality. 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.900
