all<00:00:01.770> right<00:00:01.860> as<00:00:01.949> you<00:00:02.010> may<00:00:02.250> or<00:00:02.399> may<00:00:02.460> not<00:00:02.730> have

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
all right as you may or may not have

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.280 
all right as you may or may not have
noticed<00:00:03.270> this<00:00:03.360> little<00:00:03.659> hill<00:00:03.810> over<00:00:03.840> here<00:00:04.049> that

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
noticed this little hill over here that

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.249 
noticed this little hill over here that
I<00:00:04.319> did<00:00:04.560> not<00:00:04.650> notice<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:05.240> can<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.690> go<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
I did not notice so can you do is go and

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.900 
I did not notice so can you do is go and
put<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.189> block<00:00:08.400> up<00:00:08.610> over<00:00:08.820> there<00:00:09.590> jump<00:00:10.910> do

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
put that block up over there jump do

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.820 
put that block up over there jump do
some<00:00:12.090> fancy<00:00:12.420> footwork<00:00:12.660> get<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.200> up<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
some fancy footwork get this up and I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.240 
some fancy footwork get this up and I
don't<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:14.099> what's<00:00:14.280> past<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.700> honestly

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
don't know what's past this honestly

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.740 
don't know what's past this honestly
there's<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.430> gravity<00:00:17.940> which<00:00:18.300> apparently

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
there's the gravity which apparently

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.070 
there's the gravity which apparently
doesn't<00:00:19.050> really<00:00:19.260> affect<00:00:19.590> us<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:20.340> some<00:00:20.520> reason

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
doesn't really affect us for some reason

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
doesn't really affect us for some reason
so<00:00:22.080> now<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.730> we're<00:00:23.730> able<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.029> stop

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
so now we're up here we're able to stop

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.179 
so now we're up here we're able to stop
the<00:00:24.480> Box<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:25.199> up<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> ladder<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:26.010> need

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the Box get up the ladder like we need

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.919 
the Box get up the ladder like we need
to<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:30.060> don't<00:00:30.210> want<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> sliding

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
to and I really don't want it sliding

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.359 
to and I really don't want it sliding
back<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.109> when<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.710> done<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.070> because

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
back down when I'm done with it because

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.380 
back down when I'm done with it because
I<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:33.000> need<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.360> for

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
I don't know what I'm gonna need it for

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.100 
I don't know what I'm gonna need it for
after<00:00:33.750> this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
after this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.670 
after this
at<00:00:34.800> any<00:00:34.950> rate<00:00:35.600> we've<00:00:36.600> gotten<00:00:36.930> past<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> for

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
at any rate we've gotten past that for

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
at any rate we've gotten past that for
the<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:40.340> we'll<00:00:41.340> deal<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.610> whatever<00:00:41.820> comes

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the now we'll deal with whatever comes

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.959 
the now we'll deal with whatever comes
our<00:00:42.390> way<00:00:42.420> after<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> ladder<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
our way after and we have a ladder a

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
our way after and we have a ladder a
ladder<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.149> leads<00:00:48.329> us<00:00:48.629> back<00:00:48.899> down<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.410> where

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
ladder that leads us back down to where

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
ladder that leads us back down to where
I<00:00:49.649> came<00:00:49.800> from<00:00:54.559> okay

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 

maybe<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.650> solution<00:01:05.100> will<00:01:05.220> work<00:01:05.250> twice<00:01:05.760> for

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
maybe that solution will work twice for

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:24.670 
maybe that solution will work twice for
some<00:01:06.330> reason<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:11.220> oh<00:01:14.600> hey<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.610> box<00:01:23.210> and

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
some reason and oh hey this box and

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.050 
some reason and oh hey this box and
possibly<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:26.330> holed<00:01:27.330> up

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.800 

it's<00:01:30.900> where<00:01:31.050> I<00:01:31.080> needed<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:32.990> if<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:35.509> can<00:01:36.509> reach

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it's where I needed to go if I can reach

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.490 
it's where I needed to go if I can reach
it<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.020> pull<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:38.119> then<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:40.040> may<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.759> able

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
it and pull it then I may just be able

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
it and pull it then I may just be able
to<00:01:43.500> pull<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.160> it<00:01:44.190> for<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.580> here<00:01:47.360> all

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
to pull it and use it for up here all

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.320 
to pull it and use it for up here all
right<00:01:48.950> hopefully<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.100> works<00:01:53.000> I'm<00:01:54.000> pretty

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
right hopefully this works I'm pretty

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.370 
right hopefully this works I'm pretty
sure<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.600> grab<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.369> can<00:01:56.369> grab<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:57.380> look

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
sure I can grab that I can grab it look

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.109 
sure I can grab that I can grab it look
at<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.590> thing<00:01:58.800> go<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:59.160> God<00:01:59.940> knows<00:02:00.180> where

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.430 

except<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.330> have<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.720> problem<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:09.289> me

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.540 

getting<00:02:13.440> on<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:15.080> box<00:02:18.890> because<00:02:19.890> once<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.400> hit

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
getting on that box because once I hit

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.980 
getting on that box because once I hit
this<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.970> gravity<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.540> gonna<00:02:21.860> activate<00:02:23.990> that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
this the gravity is gonna activate that

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.620 
this the gravity is gonna activate that
would<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.290> Sol<00:02:25.800> trying<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.550> box<00:02:26.819> I'm

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
would be Sol trying to get that box I'm

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.790 
would be Sol trying to get that box I'm
trying<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.959> get<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.140> top<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.560> well

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
trying to get on top of that well

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.150 
trying to get on top of that well
actually<00:02:30.230> I'll<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.470> enough<00:02:31.650> time<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.980> get<00:02:32.040> on

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
actually I'll have enough time to get on

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.339 
actually I'll have enough time to get on
top<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.640> before<00:02:33.209> anything<00:02:33.720> happens<00:02:34.230> -

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
top of it before anything happens -

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.620 
top of it before anything happens -
never<00:02:34.500> mind<00:02:35.599> just<00:02:36.599> jump<00:02:37.170> off<00:02:37.349> before<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.630> fall

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
never mind just jump off before I fall

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.370 
never mind just jump off before I fall
off<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.319> smashed<00:02:41.750> either<00:02:42.750> case<00:02:42.959> we<00:02:43.170> have

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
off or I get smashed either case we have

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.180 
off or I get smashed either case we have
one<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:43.950> now<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.650> we'll<00:02:46.650> deal<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:46.980> another

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
one for now and we'll deal with another

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.270 
one for now and we'll deal with another
magnets<00:02:51.890> mm-hmm

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
magnets mm-hmm

okay<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.480> one<00:02:55.780> was<00:02:55.960> simple<00:02:56.320> enough<00:02:59.070> we

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
okay that that one was simple enough we

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.890 
okay that that one was simple enough we
have<00:03:00.160> another<00:03:00.310> box<00:03:00.640> up<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:01.090> great<00:03:01.450> just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
have another box up there great just

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.580 
have another box up there great just
what<00:03:02.020> I<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:04.120> box<00:03:04.420> puzzles<00:03:04.900> why<00:03:05.410> not

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
what I like I like box puzzles why not

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.160 
what I like I like box puzzles why not
oh<00:03:05.710> my<00:03:06.010> god<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.430> laser<00:03:06.670> think<00:03:07.050> shot<00:03:08.050> in

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
oh my god it's that laser think shot in

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.590 
oh my god it's that laser think shot in
the<00:03:08.230> ass

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
the ass

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.840 
the ass
should<00:03:10.600> have<00:03:10.660> been<00:03:10.780> an<00:03:10.900> achievement<00:03:11.790> okay<00:03:12.790> so

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
should have been an achievement okay so

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.490 
should have been an achievement okay so
it<00:03:13.180> looks<00:03:13.209> like<00:03:13.450> I'm<00:03:13.540> gonna<00:03:13.690> need<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.959> box<00:03:14.200> to

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it looks like I'm gonna need the box to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.690 
it looks like I'm gonna need the box to
get<00:03:14.620> through<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:19.209> makes<00:03:19.600> sense

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
get through that that makes sense

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.520 
get through that that makes sense
potentially<00:03:22.860> come<00:03:23.860> on<00:03:25.020> that<00:03:26.020> potentially

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
potentially come on that potentially

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.160 
potentially come on that potentially
makes<00:03:26.739> some<00:03:26.920> sense<00:03:27.360> there's<00:03:28.360> also<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.660> gun<00:03:28.989> up

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
makes some sense there's also a gun up

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:37.650 
makes some sense there's also a gun up
there<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.620> appears<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:35.850> how<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.910> get<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.270> down

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
there it appears so how to get this down

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:45.740 
there it appears so how to get this down
Oh<00:03:38.160> Oh<00:03:39.330> No<00:03:40.770> okay<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.930> far<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.320> good

Oh Oh No okay so far so good

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.210 
Oh Oh No okay so far so good
hopefully<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:46.930> box<00:03:47.260> blocks<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.920> bullets

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
hopefully this box blocks the bullets

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.170 
hopefully this box blocks the bullets

okay well we've possibly established

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.490
