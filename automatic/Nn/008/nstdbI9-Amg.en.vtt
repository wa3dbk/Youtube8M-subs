vinegar<00:00:38.579> luckily<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.930> two<00:00:40.469> small<00:00:40.680> bottles

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
vinegar luckily I have two small bottles

vinegar luckily I have two small bottles
of<00:00:41.550> seventy<00:00:42.329> percent<00:00:42.480> vinegar<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:44.100> are<00:00:44.190> not

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
of seventy percent vinegar there are not

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459 
of seventy percent vinegar there are not
easy<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.690> look<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.079> them<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
easy to get but if you look for them you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860 
easy to get but if you look for them you
can<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.860> some<00:00:47.329> because<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
can get some because of the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.229 
can get some because of the
concentration<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> vinegar<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> solution

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
concentration of vinegar in the solution

in<00:00:51.360> these<00:00:51.570> battles<00:00:51.780> i<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.100> safety

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
in these battles i have to use safety

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.119 
in these battles i have to use safety
glasses<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.480> were<00:00:54.600> done<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.680> time<00:00:55.890> so

screening process we are going to use an
acid<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.650> seventy<00:01:13.650> percent<00:01:13.770> vinegar<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
acid and seventy percent vinegar this is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
acid and seventy percent vinegar this is
seventy<00:01:16.049> percent<00:01:16.170> acetic<00:01:16.979> acid<00:01:17.340> solution<00:01:17.820> in

seventy percent acetic acid solution in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.080 
seventy percent acetic acid solution in
water<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.930> quite<00:01:19.650> dangerous<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.909> very

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
to be very careful if you want to dilute

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
to be very careful if you want to dilute
acid<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.860> today<00:01:29.159> for

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
acid as we're going to do it today for

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520 
acid as we're going to do it today for
this<00:01:30.000> spinning<00:01:30.360> process<00:01:30.570> remember<00:01:31.320> always

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this spinning process remember always

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.910 
this spinning process remember always
add<00:01:32.159> acid<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.759> water<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.900> other<00:01:34.140> way

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
add acid to water not the other way

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.359 
add acid to water not the other way
round<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.229> pour<00:01:37.439> some<00:01:37.680> water<00:01:37.829> water

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
round so we will pour some water water

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.560 
round so we will pour some water water
into<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> bucket

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.020 

so<00:01:46.570> we<00:01:47.229> have<00:01:47.409> added<00:01:47.619> water<00:01:47.979> almost<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.820> top

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
so we have added water almost to the top

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.969 
so we have added water almost to the top
now<00:01:49.570> it's<00:01:49.960> time<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.439> go<00:01:50.590> outside<00:01:52.979> because

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
now it's time to go outside because

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.370 
now it's time to go outside because
concentrated<00:01:54.880> acetic<00:01:55.270> acid<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.750> very<00:01:56.020> stinky

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
concentrated acetic acid is very stinky

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.160 
concentrated acetic acid is very stinky
we'll<00:01:56.950> have<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.310> do<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.460> outside<00:01:59.399> as<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:02.020> can

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
we'll have to do it outside as you can

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.950 
we'll have to do it outside as you can
see<00:02:02.380> we<00:02:02.530> have<00:02:02.560> reaction<00:02:03.220> straightaway<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
can see all the bubbles this is the

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.940 
can see all the bubbles this is the
actual<00:02:09.310> cleaning<00:02:09.729> process

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.750 

that's<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.970> first<00:02:16.209> heat<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.840> asset<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that's the first heat of the asset and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.000 
that's the first heat of the asset and
you<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:18.940> see<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.450> bubbles<00:02:19.629> are<00:02:19.989> created<00:02:20.530> only

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
you can see the bubbles are created only

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.100 
you can see the bubbles are created only
where<00:02:21.700> we<00:02:22.180> have<00:02:22.360> scammed<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:23.050> lime<00:02:23.260> scale<00:02:25.110> so

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
where we have scammed the lime scale so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.860 
where we have scammed the lime scale so
we<00:02:26.410> leave<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.769> like<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.040> for<00:02:27.220> about<00:02:27.550> maybe<00:02:28.360> 20

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
we leave it like that for about maybe 20

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.570 
we leave it like that for about maybe 20
maybe<00:02:28.989> 40<00:02:29.440> minutes<00:02:29.709> we'll<00:02:29.890> see<00:02:30.069> how<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.250> looks

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
maybe 40 minutes we'll see how it looks

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.089 
maybe 40 minutes we'll see how it looks
in<00:02:31.030> about<00:02:31.300> 20<00:02:31.750> minutes<00:02:31.900> as<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.769> can<00:02:32.890> see<00:02:33.069> I

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
in about 20 minutes as you can see I

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.949 
in about 20 minutes as you can see I
have<00:02:33.220> removed<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.880> rubber<00:02:34.090> gaskets<00:02:34.630> because

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
have removed the rubber gaskets because

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.800 
have removed the rubber gaskets because
they<00:02:35.140> might<00:02:35.380> get<00:02:35.650> affected<00:02:36.190> by<00:02:36.569> staying<00:02:37.569> in

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
they might get affected by staying in

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.740 
they might get affected by staying in
acetic<00:02:38.470> acid<00:02:38.739> for<00:02:38.920> too<00:02:39.099> long<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:40.030> I'm<00:02:40.390> going<00:02:40.720> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
acetic acid for too long so I'm going to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.839 
acetic acid for too long so I'm going to
dip<00:02:41.080> them<00:02:41.349> in<00:02:41.560> acetic<00:02:41.950> acid<00:02:42.220> for<00:02:42.400> about<00:02:42.610> maybe

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
dip them in acetic acid for about maybe

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.869 
dip them in acetic acid for about maybe
five<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.330> ten<00:02:43.510> minutes<00:02:43.769> after<00:02:44.769> 20<00:02:45.489> maybe<00:02:45.640> 30

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
five to ten minutes after 20 maybe 30

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.870 
five to ten minutes after 20 maybe 30
minutes<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.360> can<00:02:46.510> give<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.349> quick<00:02:47.590> &amp;<00:02:47.920> fresh

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
minutes you can give it a quick &amp; fresh

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.210 
minutes you can give it a quick &amp; fresh
clean<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.720> then<00:02:49.900> leave<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.230> for<00:02:50.440> another<00:02:50.530> 20

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
clean and then leave it for another 20

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.130 
clean and then leave it for another 20
maybe<00:02:51.340> 30<00:02:51.580> minutes<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.239> see<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.540> 30

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
maybe 30 minutes I can see that 30

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.650 
maybe 30 minutes I can see that 30
minutes<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.650> minimum<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.519> this<00:02:54.670> case<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
minutes is a minimum in this case the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.960 
minutes is a minimum in this case the
rubber<00:02:55.870> gaskets<00:02:56.410> were<00:02:56.590> fooled<00:02:56.890> for<00:02:57.160> around<00:02:57.430> 15

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
rubber gaskets were fooled for around 15

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.330 
rubber gaskets were fooled for around 15
minutes<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:59.019> cleaning<00:02:59.380> process<00:02:59.530> took<00:03:00.069> around

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
minutes the cleaning process took around

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.000 
minutes the cleaning process took around
two<00:03:00.700> hours<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.269> as<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.780> can<00:03:01.959> see<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.620> parts

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
two hours and as you can see the parts

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.670 
two hours and as you can see the parts
the<00:03:03.489> items<00:03:03.880> are<00:03:04.180> clean<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:04.989> ready<00:03:05.410> for

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
the items are clean and ready for

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.039 
the items are clean and ready for
inspection<00:03:06.269> these<00:03:07.269> are<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.569> effects<00:03:07.900> of

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
inspection these are the effects of

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.080 
inspection these are the effects of
cleaning<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:08.950> am<00:03:09.069> very<00:03:09.280> happy<00:03:09.760> with<00:03:09.910> them
