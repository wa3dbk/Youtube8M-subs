00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the tank it's just a weird picture and I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.319 
the tank it's just a weird picture and I
don't<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> at<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:40.910> ordered<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.059> one

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
don't like it at all so ordered this one

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.360 
don't like it at all so ordered this one
it<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> clear<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.770> camera<00:00:44.100> will<00:00:44.280> be

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it is to clear so the camera will be

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.529

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
this at harbor freight it's like 20

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.639 
this at harbor freight it's like 20
bucks<00:01:43.640> $25<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.570> wheeled<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.380> tire

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bucks $25 you just wheeled the back tire

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.160 
bucks $25 you just wheeled the back tire
on<00:01:46.829> there<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.600> things<00:01:48.630> allow

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
on there and these little things allow

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.880 
on there and these little things allow
the<00:01:49.229> tire<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> spin<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:52.470> definitely<00:01:52.619> makes

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the tire the spin so it definitely makes

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.910 
the tire the spin so it definitely makes
it<00:01:53.040> easier<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> stands<00:01:54.270> are<00:01:54.740> way<00:01:55.740> better

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it easier but the stands are way better

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.429 
it easier but the stands are way better
definitely<00:01:56.880> recommend<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> stands<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.899> I'm

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
definitely recommend the stands and I'm

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.800 
definitely recommend the stands and I'm
probably<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:58.979> redoing<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
probably going to be redoing the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.600 
probably going to be redoing the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
striping on my wheels because I did not

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
striping on my wheels because I did not
have<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.880> stamina<00:02:03.149> i<00:02:03.299> did<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.229> just
