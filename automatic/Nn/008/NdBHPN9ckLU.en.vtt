00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.799
 my channel of that short saw I'll talk to you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.170
 about the configuration of the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.780
 sounds of our samsung galaxy s 6 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.059
 are basically tips or trick of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.400
 configuration that we can do in your 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.539
 phone has nothing to do with sound 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.150
 that occur when we visit we go to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.390
 type a phone number suddenly 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.740
 we do not want this sound we are in a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.410
 where we should not be doing 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.080
 the sounds and this is a sound that is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.790
 configured differently from how it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 set the sound that has to do 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 with the keyboard that is this this is another 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.340
 distinct sound even sounds different 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.920
 and another sound that is also 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.750
 configurable has to do with sound 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.700
 every time we edit or enter 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.230
 for example to an option of these from 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.780
 configuration that is the sound of 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.270
 screen this is a third sound that is 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.000
 set apart and there are also the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.280
 sounds of ringtones and notifications 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.020
 then all that is made of the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.740
 next way we enter here by 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.440
 nutite notifications adjustments we are going to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.660
 the option of sounds notifications and 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.940
 below are all these sounds that we 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.900
 interested in this moment let's go here 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.900
 where says 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.180
 Volume all tones and sounds 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.740
 we enter here for all its sounds and 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.930
 in this option of all the sounds that 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.330
 the third is in these options 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.490
 then we have all the tactiles 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.440
 play sounds to the effect to the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.850
 screen selection for example if 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.380
 select here sounds style is active 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.930
 it does not sound when it goes up when 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.850
 select a screen option on 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.460
 keypad tone and is another option 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.290
 play the tone when you press the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.570
 keyboard dialing keyboard 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.150
 Dialing is the phone when you 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.880
 will call and deactivate it let's 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.940
 leave yells when I'm going to call here 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.000
 it does not sound like it used to sound before now 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.170
 we come back again for the options of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 sound 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.759
 sound and notifications and all 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.739
 sounds since disabled 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.069
 and the other sound of blocking sound 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.040
 screen 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.640
 so if you heard it, we're going to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.890
 activate it 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.830
 blocking sound 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.620
 and it has already been deactivated and finally 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.180
 the sound of the keyboard that is the screw 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 which is used when writing something too 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.740
 what turns off basically are the four 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.810
 main sounds that can be 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.550
 set up on our phone apart from 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.320
 what are the ringtones opens then 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.480
 something that suddenly many times that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.810
 Many people already know how to do it that in 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.330
 this case is all without sounds and up 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.890
 there are the ringtones and messages 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.890
 let's see what we have at this moment 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.370
 that's how a thirtysomething is configured 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.630
