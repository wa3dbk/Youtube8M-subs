because<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> saw<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.779> little

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
because when you saw it the little

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.420 
because when you saw it the little
shards<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.410> off<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:26.039> can<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.340> even

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
shards get off and they can be even

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
shards get off and they can be even
microscopic<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.300> will<00:00:27.510> still<00:00:27.689> get

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
microscopic but they will still get

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.599 
microscopic but they will still get
under<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.289> skin<00:00:28.320> irritate<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.130> skin<00:00:29.400> or

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
under your skin irritate your skin or

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.550 
under your skin irritate your skin or
cut<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.720> need<00:00:30.960> gloves<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.470> eye

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
cut you so you need gloves and eye

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
cut you so you need gloves and eye
protection<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.360> sunglasses

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
protection because you know sunglasses

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840 
protection because you know sunglasses
will<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.440> once<00:00:34.890> when<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> cut<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
will do but once when you cut it the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.990 
will do but once when you cut it the
little<00:00:36.090> shards<00:00:36.450> fly<00:00:36.750> off<00:00:36.960> everywhere<00:00:38.000> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
little shards fly off everywhere and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.130 
little shards fly off everywhere and
they<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.540> eye<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:40.020> hurt

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
they can get in your eye and really hurt

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
they can get in your eye and really hurt
you<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> take<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> wine

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you so what you do is you take the wine

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.979 
you so what you do is you take the wine
bottle<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.469> hold<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.829> down<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:45.690> take

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
bottle and you hold it down and you take

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.979 
bottle and you hold it down and you take
a<00:00:46.020> small<00:00:46.890> hand<00:00:47.309> saw<00:00:47.750> something<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
a small hand saw something to that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.779 
a small hand saw something to that
effect<00:00:49.289> our<00:00:49.469> glass<00:00:49.710> cutter<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.520> easier

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
effect our glass cutter is a lot easier

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.279 
effect our glass cutter is a lot easier
but<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> didn't<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> take<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
but I didn't have one if you take a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.319 
but I didn't have one if you take a
handsaw<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.100> make<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.850> line<00:00:54.030> around<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
handsaw and you make a line around the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.209 
handsaw and you make a line around the
edge<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.440> sawing<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.800> completely

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
edge like just sawing it completely

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.470 
edge like just sawing it completely
around<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> saw<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.390> then

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
around so you know where to saw and then

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.930 
around so you know where to saw and then
you<00:00:57.570> saw<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> long<00:00:58.230> time<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.890> keep<00:00:59.760> going

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you saw for a long time and keep going

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.270 
you saw for a long time and keep going
until<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.539> hole<00:01:00.690> gets<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.859> deep<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
until the hole gets really really deep I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
until the hole gets really really deep I
mean<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.579> takes<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.420> while

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
mean this takes like a while

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.160 
mean this takes like a while
but<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.210> probably<00:01:06.390> won't<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.689> able<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> cut<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
but you probably won't be able to cut it

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.840 
but you probably won't be able to cut it
immediately<00:01:07.710> once<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> once<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.520> gets<00:01:08.640> deep

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
immediately once you once it gets deep

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.850 
immediately once you once it gets deep
but<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.450> break<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.810> bottle<00:01:10.140> off<00:01:11.090> and

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
but you have to break the bottle off and

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.960 
but you have to break the bottle off and
you're<00:01:13.860> gonna<00:01:14.040> break<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.670> then<00:01:14.790> there

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
you're gonna break it and then there

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.039 
you're gonna break it and then there
might<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.299> jagged<00:01:15.479> edge<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
might be a little jagged edge you can

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.390 
might be a little jagged edge you can
just<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> tap<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.040> until<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.310> little

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
just kind of tap it until a little

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.620 
just kind of tap it until a little
jagged<00:01:17.700> edges<00:01:18.000> come<00:01:18.330> off<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.509> not

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
jagged edges come off and it will not

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
jagged edges come off and it will not
look<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.380> look<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.799> bit<00:01:22.979> like

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
look like this so look a little bit like

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
look like this so look a little bit like
a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:23.909> jagged<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.479> won't

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
a little bit more jagged it just won't

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.870 
a little bit more jagged it just won't
be<00:01:24.689> smooth<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> touch<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.549> order<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
be smooth to the touch but in order to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
be smooth to the touch but in order to
smooth<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.720> sandpaper<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.439> what

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
smooth it out you get sandpaper or what

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
smooth it out you get sandpaper or what
I<00:01:28.770> did<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.520> rubbed<00:01:29.700> against<00:01:29.939> concrete

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
I did was I just rubbed against concrete

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.289 
I did was I just rubbed against concrete
until<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:30.930> smooth<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:32.119> that's<00:01:33.119> how<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
until it was smooth and that's how you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080
