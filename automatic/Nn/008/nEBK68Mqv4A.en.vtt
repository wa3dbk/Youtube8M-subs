with our dogs I have to make that leap
and<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.259> true<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:47.040> only<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
and think it's also true not only that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.100 
and think it's also true not only that
I've<00:01:47.520> witnessed<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.360> own<00:01:48.509> dog<00:01:48.689> Nova

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I've witnessed it with my own dog Nova

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.920 
I've witnessed it with my own dog Nova
by<00:01:49.920> getting<00:01:50.189> him<00:01:50.280> tired<00:01:50.579> you're<00:01:51.060> encouraging

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
by getting him tired you're encouraging

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539 
by getting him tired you're encouraging
him<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.500> edge<00:01:52.710> off<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.340> that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
him to get that edge off to get that

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.460 
him to get that edge off to get that
extra<00:01:53.790> anxiety<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.780> his<00:01:54.899> body<00:01:55.110> therefore

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
extra anxiety out of his body therefore

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
extra anxiety out of his body therefore
he's<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:55.950> likely<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> either<00:01:56.399> sleep<00:01:56.880> or

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
he's more likely to either sleep or

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.219 
he's more likely to either sleep or
relax<00:01:57.450> when<00:01:57.689> you're<00:01:57.780> gone

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
relax when you're gone

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.109 
relax when you're gone
or<00:01:58.560> he<00:01:58.649> has<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.070> satisfaction<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.090> that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
or he has that satisfaction in that

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
or he has that satisfaction in that
outlet<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.259> makes<00:02:01.560> other<00:02:01.860> type<00:02:02.130> other<00:02:02.399> parts

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
outlet that makes other type other parts

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.190 
outlet that makes other type other parts
of<00:02:02.880> life<00:02:03.000> more<00:02:03.270> manageable<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.899> hope<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
of life more manageable I hope that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.679 
of life more manageable I hope that
makes<00:02:04.409> sense<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> getting<00:02:05.969> your<00:02:06.060> dog<00:02:06.210> tired<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
makes sense so getting your dog tired is

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
makes sense so getting your dog tired is
great<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.229> try<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> make<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.399> too<00:02:08.640> big<00:02:08.759> a
