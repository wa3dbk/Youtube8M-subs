00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.099 
acne scarring it does look like a nice
kind<00:02:30.469> of<00:02:30.650> satiny<00:02:31.249> luminous<00:02:31.819> finish<00:02:32.120> not<00:02:32.629> super

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
kind of satiny luminous finish not super

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.220 
kind of satiny luminous finish not super
dewy<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.859> you<00:02:34.069> can<00:02:34.189> definitely<00:02:34.340> see<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
dewy but it you can definitely see the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.140 
dewy but it you can definitely see the
luminosity<00:02:36.230> I'm<00:02:36.889> going<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.099> go<00:02:37.189> ahead<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.819> use

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
luminosity I'm going to go ahead and use

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.640 
luminosity I'm going to go ahead and use
the<00:02:38.329> Beauty<00:02:38.599> Blender<00:02:38.689> for<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.170> other<00:02:39.290> half<00:02:39.500> of

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
the Beauty Blender for the other half of

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.959 
the Beauty Blender for the other half of
my<00:02:39.739> face<00:02:40.959> I've<00:02:41.959> used<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.439> total<00:02:42.769> of<00:02:43.010> two<00:02:43.639> pumps

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969 
my face I've used a total of two pumps

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.550 
my face I've used a total of two pumps
so<00:02:44.060> far<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.419> I<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.659> put<00:02:44.780> another<00:02:44.989> two<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:45.319> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
so far and I just put another two on the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.199 
so far and I just put another two on the
back<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:51.400> feel<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.819> Beauty<00:02:53.120> Blender

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
back I feel like the Beauty Blender

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.149 
back I feel like the Beauty Blender
might<00:02:53.659> give<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> little<00:02:54.260> bit<00:02:54.500> better<00:02:54.739> of

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
might give a little bit better of

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.520 
might give a little bit better of
coverage<00:02:55.639> than<00:02:56.389> the<00:02:56.419> brush<00:02:56.780> side<00:02:57.019> this<00:02:57.230> time

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
coverage than the brush side this time

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.039 
coverage than the brush side this time
this<00:02:58.040> definitely<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:59.030> less<00:02:59.629> coverage<00:02:59.989> than

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
this definitely is less coverage than

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.759 
this definitely is less coverage than
I'm<00:03:00.349> used<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.620> wearing<00:03:02.379> all<00:03:03.379> right<00:03:03.469> so<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.680> is

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
I'm used to wearing all right so this is

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.619 
I'm used to wearing all right so this is
how<00:03:03.980> much<00:03:04.099> coverage<00:03:04.519> we<00:03:04.730> get<00:03:04.879> with<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.359> layer

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
how much coverage we get with one layer

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.990 
how much coverage we get with one layer
the<00:03:05.989> shade<00:03:06.199> is<00:03:06.319> actually<00:03:06.739> fine<00:03:06.980> whenever<00:03:07.519> I've

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
the shade is actually fine whenever I've

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.789 
the shade is actually fine whenever I've
tried<00:03:08.030> covergirl<00:03:08.780> foundations<00:03:09.349> before<00:03:09.680> they

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
tried covergirl foundations before they

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.979 
tried covergirl foundations before they
do<00:03:09.859> oxidize<00:03:10.639> on<00:03:10.849> me<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.209> I'm<00:03:11.299> hoping<00:03:11.629> this

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
do oxidize on me so I'm hoping this

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.809 
do oxidize on me so I'm hoping this
doesn't<00:03:12.319> oxidize<00:03:12.469> I'm<00:03:13.040> gonna<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.609> with<00:03:13.639> a

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
doesn't oxidize I'm gonna go in with a

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.459 
doesn't oxidize I'm gonna go in with a
second<00:03:14.209> layer<00:03:14.359> and<00:03:14.599> see<00:03:14.780> how<00:03:15.019> much<00:03:15.199> this

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
second layer and see how much this

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:24.069 
second layer and see how much this
covers<00:03:15.859> and<00:03:16.219> see<00:03:16.340> if<00:03:16.430> it's<00:03:16.579> buildable<00:03:23.079> all

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
covers and see if it's buildable all
