00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello and welcome to the 85th 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.509
 issue the best next week here 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.040
 from galaxy and as usual I have 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.840
 of course, five cool again today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.849
 selected apps for you and wishes 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.090
 Of course you have a lot of fun with this 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.090
 Video 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.590
 The first app for today is called 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
 blocked and here we have such a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.279
 small farm by a storm 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.750
 really was completely destroyed and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.060
 Now we have to return to the station 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.010
 repair and we do that by ourselves 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.480
 race and thus share, so to speak 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.070
 We have our own here 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.110
 car and you can really do that here too 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.570
 very free tune because you can clog on it 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.489
 Build how to be funny and if we are 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.079
 now look here in the game look 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 you as well as the whole on the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.770
 race track looks like this now you see 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.539
 here's how the whole then in 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.879
 game itself looks like that really looks 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.559
 very cool and we have now 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 here our car always have to stop gas 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 give or brake and thus, so to speak 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.440
 try as much as possible here too 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.059
 now and then have to come gasoline 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.199
 collect so we can get ahead and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960
 so that we do not get stuck here 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.399
 now here for example and otherwise 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 you can collect the money here with 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.780
 where you can tune the cars and the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.189
 farm can improve and I think 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.990
 that it was really very nice 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.119
 Here's the graphic that really does 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 a lot of fun to look here and that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.330
 Whole is also free 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 that's why I would say try it 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.610
 Just look at the next app yourself 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 is meant for a situation 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.970
 surely everyone of you knows and that indeed 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.009
 you are traveling with your friends 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.650
 and I want to drink the light in the coffee 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.180
 go or have something to eat and there you will notice 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.829
 at hey I have my base at home 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.570
 forget and then ask 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.850
 quickly the friend whether he did not lay something 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.470
 can and you say anja hey I'll give you 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 that too tomorrow and right here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.979
 You can rely on this app 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.659
 here with very quickly his debts 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.460
 settle and the whole thing works 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.439
 By debit this means the money is 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.970
 drawn in on your account and directly 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.750
 on the account of your buddy 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.310
 transferred 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.200
 and I think that's cool because you 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.939
 there not so annoying between account 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.530
 like paypal for example 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.969
 that works just here directly and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.930
 we can try it out here eg 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.399
 with the breath on 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.380
 For example, he has money for me 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.000
 refunded for a coffee and now 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.160
 i wrote it for example hey here 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 do you get your three euro which you give me 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.990
 Today we hate and we click 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.250
 then send on 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.810
 then we come directly to ours 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.700
 contacts can contact the adrian 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.620
 select and then first the amount 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.840
 set in our case now 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.830
 we want to send three euros and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.840
 then we can leave a comment 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.190
 So add what it is for or not 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 thank you say thank you again or something 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.900
 you can enter here and then 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.460
 you simply click on send and have to 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.530
 then enter his pin again 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.570
 and after typing his pin 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.280
 has the whole already shipped 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.510
 And that's definitely the cool one 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.520
 possibility like me very much 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.600
 Go quickly and directly from the account 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:51.850
 Account works the next happy 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.150
 nancy city ​​20 48 and is from 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.820
 gameplay similar to 20 48werthmann 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.650
 but at 20 48 equivalent numbers 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.330
 you had to combine with each other 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.100
 here are equivalent neighborhoods 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.410
 but combine with each other from the principle 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.260
 of course this is the same if 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.820
 one combined at 20 48 1 404 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.950
 you combine a little here 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.600
 house with a small house or so and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.010
 In the end, it's all here 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.930
 again at the highscore 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.130
 that means we are now seeing here 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.800
 for example, the population above 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.080
 is now our high score and that should 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.520
 Of course you have to be as high as possible 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.040
 just try to improve and to 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.080
 improve and that's what I think 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.820
 whole goal of the game and I think so 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.100
 really nice from the graphic 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.180
 made and I like that on everyone 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.190
 case very nice new 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.690
 I find a lot of variety 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.910
 more beautiful than just any 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.380
 have to pay for this and for that that 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.910
 whole is also free of charge 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.910
 you just try it yourself 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.440
 the next app is called two line 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.060
 should facilitate us to fall asleep and 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.830
 Although this app is based on a 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.360
 scientific study the surrendered 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.400
 has that blue light in the evening and his 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.500
 car so influences that stop 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.569
 hormone is secreted what us awake 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.430
 should make or keep awake 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.830
 and this is where this app comes in 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.709
 so to speak and filters out of ours 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.270
 Display the blue lights and that knows 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.739
 certainly everyone in the evening before falling asleep 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.050
 I just happened again a video of 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.359
 or in any case looks up somehow 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.370
 mobile phone and can not fall asleep afterwards 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.190
 and that's where this app comes in 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.370
 and here you can adjust how strong 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.530
 this app, so to speak, these blue lights 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.610
 to filter out one pulls then also 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.560
 in what way then can the display 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.660
 also changed that has everything then one 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.070
 Rotstich you can stop here 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.050
 adjust how strong you have that 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.669
 want and when that should happen 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.440
 the app can be automatic, so to speak 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.660
 recognize when the sun goes down and 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.669
 then this filter will be the same 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.639
 used automatically or you say hey 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.080
 from 15 o'clock to 20 o'clock that is supposed to say 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.120
 then it should be done that you can here 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.650
 stop synonymous manually adjust everything 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.060
 and i think this app is on everyone 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.380
 a good idea and it should be 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.180
 Just give it a try if it is one 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.950
 helps yourself and for the whole 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.820
 you should give it to everyone for free 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.820
 case try it 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.700
 the next apple is called pancake and 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.050
 is like me very very simple but has 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.460
 I had a lot of fun 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.410
 and you just have to 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.419
 Try the pancake as often as you can 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.400
 possible to turn around and you see I have 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.350
 only a highscore of 5 so I have it 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.729
 but not far from here 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.810
 I enjoyed it a lot because that 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.440
 whole is really more difficult than 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.300
 thought 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.610
 and we always have to try here 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.680
 the pancake so in the height 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.240
 hurl I say that he possible 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.830
 again centered on our flag on 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.450
 so that we get him halt again 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.070
 can beat and for every time that 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.440
 we beat the phantoms and so to speak 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.490
 we get a point and for ours 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.720
 high score and that is really 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.450
 more difficult than expected 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.520
 and you really have to go here just like that 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.960
 somehow consider a tactic as 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.370
 all the time it works that way 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.590
 always nice in the middle of his 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.030
 get back banner and that can 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.830
 Just give it a try and more there 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.880
 times your highscore in the comments 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.440
 really really write it 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.670
 interested because I think five times 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.930
 is not that good 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.790
 then you could just join them 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.870
 his friends, so to speak, competition 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.640
 I'll do that first 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.020
 Hundreds of people would take care of me 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:09.970
 so let's take a look at the book now 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:11.250
 Just once yourself from youtuber were 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.780
 long time of which I say 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.760
 traditional media not really 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.380
 taken seriously that you are always those 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.210
 the ones at home in their little ones 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.340
 in front of the camera 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.590
 have your eyes made up or what 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.880
 I know what I did 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.560
