these days okay and a step has been
built<00:02:19.150> into<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.480> room<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:20.460> remains

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
built into the room that remains

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.340 
built into the room that remains
completely<00:02:21.850> independent<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.750> floor<00:02:23.260> of

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350

of the studios is actually floated and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.750 
of the studios is actually floated and
here<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.970> walnut<00:02:32.070> wood<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.489> down

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
here the walnut wood is going down

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.410 
here the walnut wood is going down
you'll<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.300> they<00:02:34.989> start<00:02:35.350> from<00:02:36.070> a

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
you'll see that they start from a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.810 
you'll see that they start from a
straight<00:02:37.420> line<00:02:37.690> before<00:02:38.380> going<00:02:38.590> back<00:02:38.950> into<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
straight line before going back into the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.210
