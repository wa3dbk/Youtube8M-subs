00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.929 
directly to this computer you can choose
the<00:01:45.930> first<00:01:46.259> option<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.369> demo<00:01:47.640> we're

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the first option but in this demo we're

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.880 
the first option but in this demo we're
demoing<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.960> net<00:01:49.140> print<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
demoing the net print so I'm going to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.670 
demoing the net print so I'm going to
choose<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> second<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.470> we<00:01:52.470> know

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
choose a second one here and we know

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.580 
choose a second one here and we know
from<00:01:52.920> our<00:01:53.130> prior<00:01:53.790> screen<00:01:54.240> over<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.659> firefox

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
from our prior screen over on firefox

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.200 
from our prior screen over on firefox
that<00:01:56.100> we've<00:01:56.189> got<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.399> dymo<00:01:56.909> printer

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that we've got that dymo printer

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.380 
that we've got that dymo printer
connected<00:01:57.450> directly<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> we'll<00:01:59.640> choose<00:02:00.000> our

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
connected directly so we'll choose our

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
connected directly so we'll choose our
dymo<00:02:00.930> template<00:02:01.409> we'll<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.890> use<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
dymo template we'll just use the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.620 
dymo template we'll just use the
children's<00:02:02.579> check<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.149> number<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.450> labels

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
children's check in the number of labels

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.749 
children's check in the number of labels
the<00:02:04.079> information<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.710> want<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.189> we'll

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the information that we want and we'll

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.639 
the information that we want and we'll
go<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.030> sign<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.450> screen<00:02:06.570> again<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.530> get

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
go to the sign in screen again we get

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.020 
go to the sign in screen again we get
that<00:02:07.799> warning<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.250> it'll<00:02:08.459> lock<00:02:08.700> down<00:02:08.940> the

that warning that it'll lock down the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.410 
that warning that it'll lock down the
computer<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> now<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.979> begin<00:02:11.420> checking

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
computer and now I can begin checking

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.620 
computer and now I can begin checking
people<00:02:12.840> in

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
people in

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.330 
people in
nobody<00:02:15.630> matches<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.050> let's<00:02:16.560> try<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:16.950> one

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
nobody matches that let's try this one

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.380 
nobody matches that let's try this one
there<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.480> go<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.920> click<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:20.820> somebody's<00:02:21.150> name

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
there we go so click on somebody's name

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
there we go so click on somebody's name
and<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.020> says<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.320> labels<00:02:22.710> will<00:02:22.860> print

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
and it just says your labels will print

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.700 
and it just says your labels will print
at<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.250> net<00:02:23.520> print<00:02:23.850> station<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.080> within<00:02:25.320> 10

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
at the net print station so within 10

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.260 
at the net print station so within 10
seconds<00:02:26.160> those<00:02:26.400> labels<00:02:26.760> will<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.060> spit<00:02:27.240> out

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
seconds those labels will just spit out

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.190 
seconds those labels will just spit out
of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.510> printer<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:29.390> basically<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.720> takes<00:02:30.990> 10

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
of the printer if basically it takes 10

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.420 
of the printer if basically it takes 10
seconds<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.680> nothing<00:02:31.950> has<00:02:32.070> happened<00:02:32.100> recently

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
seconds if nothing has happened recently

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.790 
seconds if nothing has happened recently
otherwise<00:02:33.150> they<00:02:33.420> print<00:02:33.690> immediately<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.770> I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
otherwise they print immediately so I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.030 
otherwise they print immediately so I
can<00:02:35.160> actually<00:02:35.660> see<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.870> hear<00:02:37.140> those<00:02:37.350> labels

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
can actually see and hear those labels

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.350 
can actually see and hear those labels
coming<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.520> printer<00:02:38.670> right<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
coming out of the printer right now and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.870 
coming out of the printer right now and
that's<00:02:40.290> all<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.530> need<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.740> do<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.550> check<00:02:41.760> in

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
that's all I need to do I can check in

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.920 
that's all I need to do I can check in
lots<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.210> people<00:02:42.450> quickly<00:02:44.600> there<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:45.750> go<00:02:45.900> i

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
lots of people quickly there we go i

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.770 
lots of people quickly there we go i
signed<00:02:46.320> somebody<00:02:46.590> else<00:02:46.740> in<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.600> can

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
signed somebody else in and I can

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.250 
signed somebody else in and I can
continue<00:02:49.080> checking<00:02:49.770> people<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:51.260> multiple

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
continue checking people in on multiple

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.890 
continue checking people in on multiple
different<00:02:52.380> computers<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.900> Firefox

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
different computers and this Firefox

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.900 
different computers and this Firefox
which<00:02:55.350> represents<00:02:55.950> our<00:02:56.040> net<00:02:56.490> print<00:02:56.730> station

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
which represents our net print station

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.760 
which represents our net print station
is<00:02:57.240> just<00:02:57.450> sitting<00:02:57.630> there<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.110> refreshing

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
is just sitting there and refreshing

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.490 
is just sitting there and refreshing
constantly<00:02:59.540> printing<00:03:00.540> labels<00:03:00.870> as<00:03:01.080> they<00:03:01.290> come

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
constantly printing labels as they come

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.740 
constantly printing labels as they come
in<00:03:01.820> so<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.000> probably<00:03:03.150> hear<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.480> label

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
in so you can probably hear that label

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.630 
in so you can probably hear that label
printer<00:03:04.020> going<00:03:04.230> off<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.500> background<00:03:04.640> so

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
printer going off in the background so

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.820 
printer going off in the background so
that's<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.090> example<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.960> new<00:03:07.110> net<00:03:07.470> print

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
that's the example of the new net print

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.970 
that's the example of the new net print
functionality<00:03:08.520> thanks
