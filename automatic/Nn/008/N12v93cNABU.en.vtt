games now this game isn't just
mindlessly<00:01:49.530> running<00:01:49.979> around<00:01:50.250> pressing<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
mindlessly running around pressing a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.359 
mindlessly running around pressing a
button<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.450> kill<00:01:51.720> an<00:01:51.840> animal<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.369> running

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
button to kill an animal and running

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.679 
button to kill an animal and running
somewhere<00:01:53.670> else<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.149> kill<00:01:54.329> another<00:01:54.570> animal

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
somewhere else to kill another animal

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.399 
somewhere else to kill another animal
there's<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.920> factors<00:01:56.490> involved<00:01:57.149> in

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
there's a lot of factors involved in

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.319 
there's a lot of factors involved in
surviving<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.500> mean<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> frozen<00:01:59.579> tundra

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
surviving I mean it is a frozen tundra

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.499 
surviving I mean it is a frozen tundra
so<00:02:00.780> there's<00:02:01.079> two<00:02:01.409> meters<00:02:01.770> there's<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.509> wharf

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
so there's two meters there's a wharf

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.959 
so there's two meters there's a wharf
meter<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.229> food<00:02:04.619> meter<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> game

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
meter and a food meter now in the game

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.730 
meter and a food meter now in the game
this<00:02:06.180> meter<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:06.960> called<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> stamina

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
this meter is actually called a stamina

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
this meter is actually called a stamina
meter<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:08.910> fits<00:02:09.330> better

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
meter and it actually fits better

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.690 
meter and it actually fits better
because<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.259> doesn't<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.770> go<00:02:10.950> down<00:02:11.190> from

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
because it doesn't just go down from

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.620 
because it doesn't just go down from
being<00:02:12.030> hungry<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.599> also<00:02:12.870> goes<00:02:13.080> down

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
being hungry it also goes down

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.200 
being hungry it also goes down
as<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.170> run<00:02:14.440> really<00:02:14.770> fast<00:02:14.800> but<00:02:15.520> for<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
as you run really fast but for the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.120 
as you run really fast but for the
purposes<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.960> review<00:02:17.080> I'll<00:02:17.620> be<00:02:17.830> calling

purposes of this review I'll be calling

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.090 
purposes of this review I'll be calling
it<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.310> food<00:02:18.550> meter<00:02:18.820> just<00:02:19.300> because<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.440> deal

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
it a food meter just because I can deal

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.520 
it a food meter just because I can deal
with<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.310> says<00:02:22.000> Stan<00:02:22.390> as<00:02:22.690> he<00:02:23.080> gets<00:02:23.350> on<00:02:23.470> his

with it says Stan as he gets on his

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.470 
with it says Stan as he gets on his
Harley<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.310> drives<00:02:24.910> off<00:02:25.120> with<00:02:25.330> your

coat you can also kill animals and
collect<00:02:30.820> their<00:02:31.540> pelts<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.470> make<00:02:32.800> your<00:02:33.010> code

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
collect their pelts to make your code

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.760 
collect their pelts to make your code
stronger<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.510> warm<00:02:34.780> up<00:02:34.960> faster<00:02:35.260> and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
stronger so you can warm up faster and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.250 
stronger so you can warm up faster and
things<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.610> was<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.630> kill<00:02:37.840> animals

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
you can also of course get their meat

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.690 
you can also of course get their meat

wharf meter and your food meter you can
also<00:02:48.190> alternatively<00:02:49.090> raise<00:02:50.020> your<00:02:50.290> warmth

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
also alternatively raise your warmth

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.970 
also alternatively raise your warmth
meter<00:02:51.040> by<00:02:51.550> running<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.270> your<00:02:52.570> coat<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:53.260> walking

meter by running in your coat or walking

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.100 
meter by running in your coat or walking
in<00:02:54.340> your<00:02:54.520> coat<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.270> can<00:02:55.420> only<00:02:55.540> hunt<00:02:55.810> when<00:02:56.020> you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
in your coat you can only hunt when you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.020 
in your coat you can only hunt when you
take<00:02:56.320> your<00:02:56.500> coat<00:02:56.800> off<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.400> as<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.760> take<00:02:58.000> your

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
take your coat off and as you take your

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.600 
take your coat off and as you take your
coat<00:02:58.420> off<00:02:58.450> you're<00:02:59.290> basically<00:02:59.530> losing<00:03:00.130> both

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
coat off you're basically losing both

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.350 
coat off you're basically losing both
food<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.380> warmth<00:03:02.380> at<00:03:02.620> an<00:03:03.330> accelerated<00:03:04.330> rate

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
food and warmth at an accelerated rate

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.080 
food and warmth at an accelerated rate
so<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.710> hunt<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> animal<00:03:06.760> really

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
so you have to hunt the animal really

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.210 
so you have to hunt the animal really
quickly<00:03:07.570> by<00:03:07.990> basically<00:03:08.620> holding<00:03:09.010> down<00:03:09.160> your

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
quickly by basically holding down your

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.880 
quickly by basically holding down your
mouse<00:03:09.550> button<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.150> aiming<00:03:11.050> your<00:03:11.260> spirit<00:03:11.770> the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
mouse button and aiming your spirit the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.290 
mouse button and aiming your spirit the
animal<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.340> then<00:03:12.460> throw<00:03:12.700> in<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.880> spirit<00:03:13.210> the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
animal and then throw in the spirit the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.990 
animal and then throw in the spirit the
animal<00:03:13.690> are<00:03:14.020> picking<00:03:14.560> up<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.740> food<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.580> or

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
animal are picking up the food and or

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.380 
animal are picking up the food and or
the<00:03:16.630> actual<00:03:17.280> pelt<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.820> animal<00:03:19.180> drops

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
the actual pelt if the animal drops

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.050 
the actual pelt if the animal drops
upheld<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.900> running<00:03:20.590> as<00:03:20.740> fast<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:21.160> can<00:03:21.220> back

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
upheld and running as fast you can back

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.630 
upheld and running as fast you can back
to<00:03:22.630> your<00:03:22.810> coat<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.290> putting<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:23.920> back<00:03:24.100> on<00:03:24.160> and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
just praying either one of your meters

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.910 
just praying either one of your meters
doesn't<00:03:28.660> run<00:03:28.780> out<00:03:28.930> because<00:03:29.350> then<00:03:29.560> you'll<00:03:29.710> just

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
doesn't run out because then you'll just

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.950 
doesn't run out because then you'll just
die<00:03:30.100> now<00:03:30.550> if<00:03:30.670> you're<00:03:30.850> worth<00:03:31.150> meter<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.630> low<00:03:31.660> you

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
die now if you're worth meter is low you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.440 
die now if you're worth meter is low you
can<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:32.470> run<00:03:32.710> a<00:03:32.740> little<00:03:32.980> bit<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.460> replenish

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
can just run a little bit and replenish

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.630 
can just run a little bit and replenish
some<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.050> but<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.800> course<00:03:36.040> as<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.370> run

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
some of that but of course as you run

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.360 
some of that but of course as you run
the<00:03:36.940> game<00:03:37.090> follows<00:03:37.720> rational<00:03:38.260> sense<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.800> your

and<00:04:03.520> then<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.150> run<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.570> pick<00:04:04.750> up<00:04:04.900> everything

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
and then you run to pick up everything

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.110 
and then you run to pick up everything
but<00:04:05.350> some<00:04:05.680> animals<00:04:05.980> don't<00:04:06.220> die<00:04:06.490> right<00:04:06.730> away<00:04:06.880> as

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
but some animals don't die right away as

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.090 
but some animals don't die right away as
you<00:04:07.240> throw<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.480> spear<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:07.900> them<00:04:08.260> some<00:04:08.740> animals

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
you throw a spear in them some animals

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.010 
you throw a spear in them some animals
are<00:04:09.400> so<00:04:09.730> big<00:04:10.090> they<00:04:10.120> actually<00:04:10.540> start<00:04:10.780> chasing

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.449 
are so big they actually start chasing
you<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.350> of<00:04:11.500> course<00:04:11.709> some<00:04:11.860> animals<00:04:12.310> have

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
you and of course some animals have

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.440 
you and of course some animals have
packs

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
packs

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.150

so<00:04:13.599> if<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.840> kill<00:04:14.110> one<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.590> others<00:04:14.830> will<00:04:15.010> be

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
so if you kill one the others will be

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.979 
so if you kill one the others will be
like<00:04:15.280> hey<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.520> just<00:04:15.849> killed<00:04:16.329> my<00:04:16.510> second
