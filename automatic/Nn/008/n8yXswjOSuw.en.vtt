 Blessings 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.340
 I greet your brother, ute kiel 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.240
 Dear brothers in the bible, we read that the inhabitants of Nazareth 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.480
 talking about jesus 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.369
 they said this is the carpenter's son and his mother is Maria 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.169
 he is brother of santiago 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.420
 Simon and Judas 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.909
 and her sisters also live here among us 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.060
 matteo 13 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.380
 55 and 56 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.060
 in another part of the bible 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.929
 read 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.240
 one day Jesus was preaching and those who were sitting around him 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:31.840
 they said 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.230
 your mother and your brothers are out and looking 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.380
 frames 3 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.160
 32 those who do not know the bible 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.670
 well they draw from these texts the hasty and erroneous conclusion of 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.850
 that Maria had more children and that for this reason she could not have remained a virgin 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.020
 we believe Catholics 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.000
 indeed many evangelical brothers speak like this 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.820
 not all 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.100
 but apparently not out of love for the truth but simply to disorient the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.950
 Catholics or any simple people to abandon the true faith in 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.550
 Christ 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.230
 in his church and in the Virgin Mary 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.380
 I will explain to you when they are wrong these people who think that Jesus 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.880
 had brothers and whoever wants to see you see 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.070
 the bible tells us knows that a virgin will conceive and give birth to a son 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.800
 I kill one 23 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.340
 It is true that the Gospels speak about the brothers and sisters of Jesus 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.430
 but that does not mean they are blood brothers of Jesus today said 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.690
 seijas of the virgin maría 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.130
 in Aramaic the same word is used to designate cousins 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.460
 nephew cousin second etcetera and to indicate this kinship 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.460
 they simply used the word brother or sister 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.040
 abraham from hama brother to his nephew the oit 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.450
 genesis 12 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 e 8 and genesis 14 to 16 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.350
 Laban says brother to his nephew Jacob 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.180
 genesis 29 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.049
 that is to say 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.850
 in the bible the words are not used that I or nephew but to those who 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.020
 they are descended from the same grandfather they are called brothers 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.869
 in the gospel of lucas we read that jesus went up to jerusalem along with 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.119
 Maria and Jose 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.659
 the boy Jesus was 12 years old 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.260
 this story does not mention any brother of Jesus in the strict sense 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.400
 so the text of lucas 2 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.260
 41 to 52 makes us understand that Jesus is the only son of Mary 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.279
 I remind you brothers and sisters who listen to this audio that the bible 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.140
 names four supposed brothers of Jesus and we can read it in Matthew 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.799
 chapter 13 verses 55 and 56 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.029
 here we can read their names 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.039
 santiago jacobo 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.589
 e simón and judas 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.650
 of these four brothers of Jesus 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.079
 two were apostles 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.659
 santiago - the brother of the Lord 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.039
 Galatians 1 19 is the Apostle James the Younger 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.209
 frames 15 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.309
 40 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.409
 and you play server of Jesus Christ and brother of Santiago 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.949
 the mother of the apostle santiago the youngest is called Maria and she is Maria mother of 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:08.229
 santiago said I know I was next to the cross of Jesus and this we can read in 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.339
 frames 15 40 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:13.519
 and Mary's sister was the mother of Jesus 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.419
 lean juan 19 25 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.339
 and aunt of Jesus 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.930
 is the one that the evangelist calls maría de cleofás juan 19 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.649
 25 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.959
 Jesus was the first to use the word brother not in a carnal sense if 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.429
 not figuratively in the gospel and this we see in John 20 17 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.659
 Jesus calls his disciples and apostles my brothers and in the letter to 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.759
 the Hebrews 2 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.759
 all those retained by Christ are his brothers 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.749
 Christ is the firstborn of these brothers 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.319
 I remind you that Catholics, like evangelicals, have the 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.949
 custom of calling us brothers and sisters 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.029
 means that we are all brothers according to the flesh 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.139
 no way 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.719
 but we use the word brother or sister figuratively 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.909
 to this is added the Christian and constant faith of the church that considers 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.699
 Mary as the always virgin 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.089
 virgin before childbirth in childbirth 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.669
 and forever after childbirth 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.030
 and finally my Catholic and evangelical brothers I also named them with 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.190
 the word brother 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.629
 I ask you to ignore palaver 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.789
 if not they are able to live this great dream of Jesus build the kingdom 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.789
 of God in which all men will be brothers again 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.129
 his brother is dismissed in christ le ute kiel 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.929
 Blessings
