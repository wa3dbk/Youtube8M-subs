00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just 10 minutes on a bug or I believe

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
just 10 minutes on a bug or I believe
fifty<00:01:00.449> percent<00:01:00.780> charge<00:01:01.050> after<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> half

fifty percent charge after just a half

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.799 
fifty percent charge after just a half
hour<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.460> awesome<00:01:02.789> they're<00:01:02.940> 3.5

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
galaxy s6 it's on the right hand side

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.950 
galaxy s6 it's on the right hand side
then<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> IR<00:01:17.640> blaster<00:01:18.210> I'm<00:01:18.689> so

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
then you have the IR blaster I'm so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109 
then you have the IR blaster I'm so
speaking<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> sim<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.909> yet

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
speaking of the sim we don't know yet

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
speaking of the sim we don't know yet
where<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.080> sold<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.770> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
where this is going to be sold with this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.530 
where this is going to be sold with this
kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> configuration<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> mean<00:01:24.420> by

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
kind of configuration what I mean by

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
kind of configuration what I mean by
that<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> under<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> hood<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> samsung

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that is under the hood we have a samsung

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
that is under the hood we have a samsung
exynos<00:01:26.580> seven<00:01:27.570> series<00:01:27.840> processor<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.590> that's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
exynos seven series processor so that's

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.700 
exynos seven series processor so that's
64-bit<00:01:29.490> octa-core<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> global

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
64-bit octa-core and that's the global

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.929 
64-bit octa-core and that's the global
variance<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.250> don't<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.520> that's

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
variance so we don't know if that's

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.640 
variance so we don't know if that's

to be able to add a micro SD card or
remove<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.689> battery<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.770> built

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

remove the battery so that's all built
in<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> cool<00:01:48.360> thing<00:01:48.390> about<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.869> battery

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
in but the cool thing about the battery

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
in but the cool thing about the battery
is<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.409> supports<00:01:49.799> both<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.729> biggest

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
is it supports both of the biggest

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.429
