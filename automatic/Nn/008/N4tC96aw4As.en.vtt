00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 to have 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.000
 so people what georg ismar again at the start 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.680
 for you and i can land you yet 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.480
 do not say anything in the background 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.130
 would play the same server now even 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.059
 it probably will not be known then 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.739
 again at the black ops 2 gameplays 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.870
 maybe the nuclear maybe none 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.450
 just a normal black ops 2 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.270
 but definitely want to bring 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 I comment today for one year 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.230
 I am currently dedicating a topic to this topic 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.340
 actually met every day and that 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.230
 I am concerned as well as you and the wood 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.410
 not really a riot or something 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.310
 I'm actually direct myself 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.680
 involved but I still want times 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:13.240
 pick up on this topic and talk 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.490
 me from the controllern so what me 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.729
 At the moment, it has been noticed that extremely 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 Many people own a controller 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:27.400
 be it from lvr small so in my lvl 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.810
 not even in my fl it was the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.229
 normal opponents or yes I mean 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.909
 really what every game that beside 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.370
 game you can see that people with 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.290
 to play a natural gas controller 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.880
 and that honestly told me something 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.430
 to think of devices 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.800
 when I bought the gas control times 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.810
 have and I have since the same 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.270
 be more precise because I have not 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.020
 once a controller itself but 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.750
 I have a racer sabertooth which 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.470
 yes actually identical to one 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 controller one may such panels at the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.160
 back I can also sometimes the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.130
 racer sabertooth I own and the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.380
 normal controller in the description 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.620
 So you have the difference 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.490
 but could say yes the farewell it 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.460
 Actually, there are almost none 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.710
 I would definitely different 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.280
 yes I'm just really stop 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.700
 that many opponents repeatedly in the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.370
 church then especially amrums box are 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.670
 let's jump around the corner 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.070
 come or be it then 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.310
 quite that they suddenly peak us yes 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.230
 lagomorphs such movements do 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.450
 and somehow I find that right now 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.060
 already pretty crass because if you 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.239
 that's what all of these players imagine 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.100
 own a scart controller 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.610
 I do not suppose that this 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.980
 player somehow 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.010
 youtube channel or have it for 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.740
 be extremely important to pattern them 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.190
 pull good gameplay because was with me 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.700
 it's like this I have the racer 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.130
 controller just bought it with me 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.860
 yes partly has something better 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.120
 can achieve gameplays 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.830
 and I really thought that 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.410
 I do something with my normal controller 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.690
 limited and somehow not 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.510
 came forward and came about 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.690
 my decision then a raid 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.959
 I buy the controller by the way 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.080
 Do not regret and people today 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.209
 then also complied who has since 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.970
 for a few weeks on us controller 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.450
 but I would appreciate it too 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.660
 just because he is active on youtube and 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.550
 because he helps us with the whole channel 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.830
 on or at very fast with too 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:01.850
 But now works for normal casual 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.230
 Player I would be really interested 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.560
 maybe you feel right now 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.660
 addressed if you are a normal 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.299
 casual players since the occasional one 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.220
 bit cod does not really play 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.669
 a youtube channel has and not 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.660
 really great value on extremely good 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.669
 gameplays would put you a staff 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.120
 Buy controller when I do that duty 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.729
 costs so I do not know anyway 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.290
 200 swiss francs which converted 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.610
 are that somehow so 150 euro 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.530
 something and that pretty expensive 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.729
 and that's why it will interest me 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.479
 whether he is already a player to the cape controller 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.060
 to have 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.250
 if that is any question is the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.220
 ask these casual players or 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.680
 if that really only everything yes I say 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.900
 now a little bit eaten 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.570
 rockers are the ones scart 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.150
 controllers have but yes as already 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.360
 said more and more players own one 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.949
 controller us 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.289
 I just wanted this one 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.870
 ask general question in the room like you 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.000
 this is how it stands or what do you think 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.939
 actually people with a substance 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.590
 controller to it for you who do not 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.520
 own controller is it for you 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.030
 unfair 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.129
 So the era thinks we have one 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.870
 unexpected advantage over you as 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.629
 I would also be interested because 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.349
 I think I have it 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:32.199
 Of course, several possibilities for movement 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:35.020
 there was not one of sÃ³ller owners 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.919
 but nothing has finally 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.930
 everyone is fighting as a controller and it is 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.849
 not really an unfair advantage 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.150
 There was really something for everyone 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:49.990
 accessible so before he yes I give 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.770
 not really a big one 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.009
 sack on the opinion or on the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.539
 raiders who are against the schola but 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.719
 yes I have a great one in the 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.449
 comments to keep the controllers 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:07.779
 you have found one you find it cool 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.819
 it would be unfair and yes otherwise it would be 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.719
 People have been close to me again 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.719
 and peace
