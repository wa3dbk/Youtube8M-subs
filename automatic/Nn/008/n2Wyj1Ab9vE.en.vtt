00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.580
 how about youtube friends greet you in 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.430
 the Rodriguez this time I bring you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.010
 information about the meaning of 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.150
 low level format when and how 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.150
 we should do it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 a low-level format resets a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.730
 storage device as if 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.210
 this one out fresh from the factory is 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.910
 something similar not literally but it 's 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.360
 something similar do a hard reset with a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.480
 with a cell phone does not reset factory 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.340
 when do a format of this type 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.160
 It is highly recommended to do this 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.720
 procedure when some of the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.450
 sectors some of the sectors of 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.820
 our hard drive are failing those 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.040
 sectors are going to be made and 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 these are restored as if they were 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.480
 factory as they came from factory 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 also another very important thing 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.860
 many of us on occasion 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.440
 we want to sell our hard drive and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.570
 either because we do not need it or because 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.310
 we just need something more 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.930
 capacity 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.690
 well then when selling our device 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.420
 It is highly recommended to do so as 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.280
 there would be very few probabilities ok 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.080
 so it's going to be impossible for the data 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.080
 stored can be recovered 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.790
 as we will do it there 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.860
 different there is different software 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.770
 with which we can make a 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.200
 low level formatting 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.030
 in fact windows 3 its same tool 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.760
 to perform a low level format 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.660
 but we are going to use this software that 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.660
 It is one of the most used 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.380
 and let's see how we are going to do it 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.380
 out there I leave the link of the download 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.870
 when we already have installed what 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.680
 we open and we will appear here the 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.030
 next information here here we will 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.490
 appear all the devices of 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.700
 storage that we have connected in 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.910
 our 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.319
 on our computer and here I have three 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:25.180
 which are two hard drives and a memory 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.940
 usb because us to the hard drive that 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.510
 let's go through this formatting what 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.150
 we select and we continue 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.849
 to whom we see here three tabs in the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.840
 first gives us a general information 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.480
 of what is our device 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.819
 in this that says smart 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.310
 smart is a technology that was included 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.099
 on hard drives and this allows us 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.310
 Detecting future disk failures 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.849
 so that a user can take their 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.709
 data make a copy of your data 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.799
 we go here we give here and we 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.340
 the detailed information of the 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.700
 status of our hard drive 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.170
 well once you call me let's go to 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.410
 perform the training under one level 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.710
 we have this tab that does not say format 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.470
 at a low level 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.880
 here we see this that says person 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.520
 week white 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.410
 here it tells us that we can make a 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.910
 fast formatting but we do not 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.620
 we want to perform fast formatting 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.770
 we want to perform the formatting at low 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.990
 level then when they are already safe 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.630
 that selected on the correct disk 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.210
 Well, we are going to give you the format of the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.830
 device 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.980
 here I know to have a little patience 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.830
 because as it is a low level format 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.790
 then the hard drive in this in this 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.040
 procedure the hard drive is very slow 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.900
 can be carried in depends on the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.099
 capacity of your hard drive too 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.069
 depends on the sectors you have 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.620
 damaged may take an hour two 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.239
 three hours but I've used 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.129
 this procedure and I have taken a little 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.049
 more life on some hard drives 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.780
 I hope that the information has 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.480
 liked if you have any doubt send a 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.500
 message leave me a comment 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.500
 and we go in our education
