sitting<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.240> shelf<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.539> who<00:00:24.689> knows<00:00:24.779> how

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
sitting on a shelf for who knows how

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.650 
sitting on a shelf for who knows how
long<00:00:25.019> -<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:26.160> don't<00:00:26.220> give<00:00:26.400> enough<00:00:26.490> fiber<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.300> our

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
long - we don't give enough fiber in our

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.509 
long - we don't give enough fiber in our
meals<00:00:27.869> either<00:00:28.140> right<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> takes<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.369> long

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
meals either right so it takes a long

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.440 
meals either right so it takes a long
time<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:30.179> food<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> run<00:00:30.960> from<00:00:31.439> A<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.890> B<00:00:32.450> because

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
time for food to run from A to B because

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330 
time for food to run from A to B because
don't<00:00:33.870> forget<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.800> tube<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.219> your

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
don't forget there is one tube in your

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.119 
don't forget there is one tube in your
body<00:00:35.570> it's<00:00:36.570> 30<00:00:37.020> feet<00:00:37.140> long<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.829> starts

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
body it's 30 feet long and it starts

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.520 
body it's 30 feet long and it starts
right<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.420> ends<00:00:39.750> right<00:00:39.899> here

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
right here and it ends right here

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.740 
right here and it ends right here
so<00:00:41.280> here's<00:00:41.700> deep<00:00:41.850> remember<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.420> tube<00:00:42.629> is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
so here's deep remember that tube is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
so here's deep remember that tube is
flexible<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.620> put<00:00:43.829> things<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.250> there

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
flexible and when we put things in there

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
flexible and when we put things in there
that<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:44.730> travel<00:00:45.090> through<00:00:45.450> very<00:00:45.660> smoothly

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that don't travel through very smoothly

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889 
that don't travel through very smoothly
they<00:00:46.980> start<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> clog<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.969> things<00:00:48.539> start<00:00:48.840> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
they start to clog up things start to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.500 
they start to clog up things start to
expand<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.800> start<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.270> belly

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
expand and we start to get the belly

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
expand and we start to get the belly
right<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.320> start<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> expand<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.489> ourselves

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
right we start to expand in ourselves

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
right we start to expand in ourselves
because<00:00:54.030> our<00:00:54.329> food<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.170> way

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350

because our food and make it all the way
through<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.949> where<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.100> needs<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.460> right

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
through to where it needs to go right

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.119 
through to where it needs to go right
they<00:00:57.510> even<00:00:57.719> did<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> study<00:00:58.109> back<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.800> 30s

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
they even did a study back in the 30s

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.150 
they even did a study back in the 30s
right<00:00:59.969> doctor<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.930> doctor<00:01:01.199> figured<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.649> that

food<00:01:16.470> modifies<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.240> body

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
food modifies it so much your body

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
process and it does not react as if it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.899
