the<00:01:03.920> reason<00:01:04.159> i<00:01:04.220> put<00:01:04.399> another<00:01:04.580> two<00:01:04.789> in<00:01:04.940> there

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
the reason i put another two in there

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.590 
the reason i put another two in there
because<00:01:05.269> other<00:01:05.539> upgraded<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:07.030> fifth<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.330> AL

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
because other upgraded to fifth the AL

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.999 
because other upgraded to fifth the AL
wimmer<00:01:09.380> which<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:10.039> a<00:01:10.750> 64-bit<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.259> you<00:01:12.710> get<00:01:12.890> to

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
wimmer which is a 64-bit so you get to

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.550 
wimmer which is a 64-bit so you get to
use<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.190> full<00:01:13.780> amount<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.960> random<00:01:15.289> got<00:01:15.500> in

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
use the full amount of random got in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.899 
use the full amount of random got in
your<00:01:15.850> pc<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.840> i<00:01:17.869> get<00:01:18.530> out<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.740> 5.8<00:01:19.369> score<00:01:19.700> last

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
your pc so i get out of 5.8 score last

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.899 
your pc so i get out of 5.8 score last
time<00:01:20.270> that's<00:01:20.509> because<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.810> dual-core

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
time that's because it's a dual-core

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.880 
time that's because it's a dual-core
