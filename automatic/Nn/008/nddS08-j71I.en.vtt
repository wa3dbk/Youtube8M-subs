00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
for the case itself you'll notice it's

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
for the case itself you'll notice it's
got<00:01:00.090> these<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.390> clips<00:01:00.750> mine<00:01:01.530> came<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

got these little clips mine came with a
clip<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.609> was<00:01:03.149> made<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.719> Malta<00:01:04.470> tablet

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
clip it was made for that Malta tablet

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.700 
clip it was made for that Malta tablet
and<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> covered<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> USB<00:01:07.170> port<00:01:07.200> which

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and so it covered up the USB port which

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
and so it covered up the USB port which
you<00:01:08.400> need<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.210> able<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> plug<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.170 
you need to be able to plug in the
keyboard<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.830> i<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.369> took<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> razor

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
keyboard so i actually just took a razor

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.770 
keyboard so i actually just took a razor
blade<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.220> notched<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.580> own<00:01:14.780> little

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
blade and just notched out my own little

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
blade and just notched out my own little
notch<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:17.520> fix<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.119> fairly

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
notch here to to fix that it was fairly

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.030 
notch here to to fix that it was fairly
easy<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.409> pry<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.710> open

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
easy to do because you can pry this open

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.850 
easy to do because you can pry this open
and<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.610> used<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.909> two-part<00:01:21.380> epoxy<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and i just used a two-part epoxy and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
and i just used a two-part epoxy and
just<00:01:22.979> popped<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> back<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.540> fixing<00:01:24.930> within

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
just popped it back it was fixing within

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
just popped it back it was fixing within
10<00:01:25.380> minutes<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.460> wasn't<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.939> big

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
10 minutes so it wasn't really a big

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.300 
10 minutes so it wasn't really a big
issue<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.509> me<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> i<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.650> clips<00:01:29.189> on

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
issue to me and i also like the clips on

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.100 
issue to me and i also like the clips on
the<00:01:29.369> top<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.759> got<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> top<00:01:30.360> two

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the top so it's got one on the top two

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.719 
the top so it's got one on the top two
on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> bottom<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> side<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.430> be

lock it works pretty well so let's see
if<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.390> do<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> quick<00:02:09.720> demo<00:02:10.310> I've<00:02:11.310> noticed

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
if we can do a quick demo I've noticed

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.420 
if we can do a quick demo I've noticed
the<00:02:11.849> one<00:02:12.030> thing<00:02:12.239> i<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:13.080> when<00:02:13.349> I'm

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
little pretty little device works with

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.900 
little pretty little device works with
the<00:03:07.540> with<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.959> viewsonic<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.530> tablet<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.040> if

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
the with the viewsonic you tablet so if

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.809 
the with the viewsonic you tablet so if
you're<00:03:10.299> wondering<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:11.440> only<00:03:11.670> negatives<00:03:12.670> i

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
you're wondering the only negatives i

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.060 
you're wondering the only negatives i
saw<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.299> were<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:15.660> weight<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.070> girth

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
saw in it were the weight and the girth

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.810 
saw in it were the weight and the girth
i<00:03:18.280> guess<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:18.700> thing<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.269> can<00:03:19.420> see<00:03:19.630> it's

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
i guess of this thing you can see it's

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.690 
i guess of this thing you can see it's
have<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.850> ruler<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.329> me<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:23.700> probably

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
have a ruler with me but it's probably

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.520 
have a ruler with me but it's probably
doubles<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.390> size<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> thickness<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.410> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
doubles the size of the thickness of the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.180 
doubles the size of the thickness of the
tablet<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.359> could<00:03:28.480> be<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.630> downer<00:03:28.900> but

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
tablet so that could be a downer but

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.770 
tablet so that could be a downer but
really<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.819> feels<00:03:31.090> like<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.329> book<00:03:31.569> you're

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
really it's it feels like a book you're

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.530 
really it's it feels like a book you're
just<00:03:31.959> carrying<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.290> book<00:03:32.440> it's<00:03:32.680> not<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:34.390> know

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
just carrying a book it's not you know

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.960 
just carrying a book it's not you know
it's<00:03:34.780> not<00:03:35.319> absurdly<00:03:35.980> huge<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:36.730> can<00:03:36.850> see

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
it's not absurdly huge and you can see

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.699 
it's not absurdly huge and you can see
it<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.269> don't<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.840> huge<00:03:38.140> hands<00:03:38.440> or<00:03:38.590> anything

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
it I don't have huge hands or anything

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.280 
it I don't have huge hands or anything
it's<00:03:39.430> not<00:03:39.910> too<00:03:40.090> bad<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:42.519> could<00:03:43.510> be<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:44.230> could

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
it's not too bad it could be it could

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.430 
it's not too bad it could be it could
actually<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.889> better<00:03:45.190> fit<00:03:45.579> than<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.139> so

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
actually be a better fit than it is so

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.180 
actually be a better fit than it is so
that<00:03:47.829> could<00:03:47.980> be<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.130> negative<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:48.760> this<00:03:48.940> little

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
that could be a negative but this little

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.559 
that could be a negative but this little
little<00:03:51.190> stand<00:03:51.609> is<00:03:51.760> kind<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.060> nice<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.239> little

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
little stand is kind of nice a little

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.080 
little stand is kind of nice a little
kickstand<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.109> kind<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.410> nice<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.889> I<00:03:54.130> haven't

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
kickstand is kind of nice and I haven't

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.490 
kickstand is kind of nice and I haven't
really<00:03:55.180> had<00:03:55.329> any<00:03:55.389> problems<00:03:56.019> using<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:59.230> I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
really had any problems using it the I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.410 
really had any problems using it the I
usually<00:03:59.980> when<00:04:00.160> I'm<00:04:00.579> using<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:00.880> on<00:04:00.940> my<00:04:01.060> lap<00:04:01.239> I

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
usually when I'm using it on my lap I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.500 
usually when I'm using it on my lap I
usually<00:04:01.750> clip<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.850> keyboard<00:04:03.850> underneath<00:04:04.239> and

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
usually clip the keyboard underneath and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.039 
usually clip the keyboard underneath and
then<00:04:04.739> flip<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:07.560> flip<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:09.630> little<00:04:10.630> kickstand

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
up it's not it's not as easy to use when

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.800

angled for it but it I've also noticed
it<00:04:17.440> because<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:18.310> angle<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.239> keeps<00:04:19.840> it

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it because of the angle that it keeps it

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.750 
it because of the angle that it keeps it
it's<00:04:20.289> kind<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.470> like<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.650> laptop<00:04:21.100> since<00:04:21.310> it's<00:04:21.489> a

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
it's kind of like a laptop since it's a

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.080 
it's kind of like a laptop since it's a
laptop<00:04:22.270> screen<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:24.130> viewing<00:04:24.460> angles<00:04:24.760> pretty

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
laptop screen the viewing angles pretty

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.110 
laptop screen the viewing angles pretty
pleasant<00:04:25.599> when<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.169> use<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:26.289> on

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
pleasant when you use it on

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.270 
pleasant when you use it on
the<00:04:27.350> this<00:04:28.350> up<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:28.650> your<00:04:28.830> eye<00:04:28.860> level<00:04:29.130> would

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
the this up so your eye level would

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.790 
the this up so your eye level would
probably<00:04:29.550> be<00:04:29.639> about<00:04:29.760> right<00:04:29.910> there<00:04:30.680> then<00:04:31.680> it

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
probably be about right there then it

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.680 
probably be about right there then it
loads<00:04:31.919> up<00:04:32.160> fine<00:04:32.340> also<00:04:33.120> if<00:04:33.180> you're<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.419> case

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690
