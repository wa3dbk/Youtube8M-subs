so I've just made up an Aki piece of the
just<00:00:10.320> little<00:00:10.530> Aki<00:00:10.769> strap<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.389> had<00:00:12.389> lying<00:00:12.570> around

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
just little Aki strap I had lying around

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.530 
just little Aki strap I had lying around
it's<00:00:13.620> running<00:00:14.040> from<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.670> couple<00:00:15.059> little<00:00:15.269> hooks

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
it's running from a couple little hooks

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.740 
it's running from a couple little hooks
here<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.460> hooks<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.630> coat

rope through go under there runs up I've

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.660 
rope through go under there runs up I've
made<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.470> hook<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> sit<00:00:25.920> over<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.220> not

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
made a little hook to sit over there not

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
made a little hook to sit over there not
there<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.990> tearing<00:00:28.439> through

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
there just so this not tearing through

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.339 
there just so this not tearing through
on<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> thread<00:00:29.310> around<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.090> hook<00:00:30.269> back<00:00:31.080> down

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
on the thread around the hook back down

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.170 
on the thread around the hook back down
on<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> other<00:00:31.859> side<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.550> from

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
there up to that bolt and back again now

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.660 
there up to that bolt and back again now
if<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.399> pull<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> handbrake<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:40.670> six

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
if I pull the handbrake on now six

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.740 
if I pull the handbrake on now six
clicks<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.540> let<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.090> release

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
clicks on I let it off now if I release

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.220 
clicks on I let it off now if I release
this<00:00:46.340> you'll<00:00:47.340> notice<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> spring<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.510> monkey

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
this you'll notice the spring the monkey

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.779 
this you'll notice the spring the monkey
strap<00:00:49.500> isn't<00:00:49.860> strong<00:00:50.160> enough<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.550> pull<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
strap isn't strong enough to pull it

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.910 
strap isn't strong enough to pull it
back<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.110> when<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.289> pull<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> handbrake<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
back so now when I pull a handbrake on a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
back so now when I pull a handbrake on a
12<00:00:55.920> 13<00:00:56.160> clicks<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.820> almost<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
12 13 clicks and almost right to the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.709 
12 13 clicks and almost right to the
stop<00:00:57.920> but<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> leave<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> button

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
stop but I'm going to leave the button

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
stop but I'm going to leave the button
in<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.930> doesn't<00:01:01.170> clump<00:01:01.350> every<00:01:01.620> time<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
in so doesn't clump every time as I

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.570 
in so doesn't clump every time as I
actually<00:01:03.719> I'll<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.260> show<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
actually I'll just show you this if I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
actually I'll just show you this if I
push<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> back<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:06.750> watch<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
push that back up so now watch the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.740 
push that back up so now watch the
position<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.280> spring<00:01:08.610> relevant<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
position of this spring relevant to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
position of this spring relevant to
there<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> handbrake<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
there when the handbrake is down like it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
there when the handbrake is down like it
is<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.810> pull<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> first<00:01:13.470> time

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
is now so I pull it up the first time

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.880 
is now so I pull it up the first time
drop<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> back<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> moved<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.830> each<00:01:16.830> time

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
drop it back to moved a little each time

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.859 
drop it back to moved a little each time
I<00:01:17.220> pull<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> drop<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.390> Madison

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
I pull it up and drop it in Madison

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
I pull it up and drop it in Madison
moves<00:01:19.590> back<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.220> little<00:01:20.400> bit<00:01:20.549> more

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
moves back just that little bit more

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.969 
moves back just that little bit more
so<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> offi<00:01:21.509> straps<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.020> helping<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.830> pull

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so the offi straps just helping and pull

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.249 
so the offi straps just helping and pull
back<00:01:23.130> into<00:01:23.400> tension<00:01:23.640> after<00:01:24.630> about<00:01:24.900> half<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
back into tension after about half a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.830 
back into tension after about half a
dozen<00:01:25.350> left<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.700> moved<00:01:26.970> from

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
dozen left you can see it's moved from

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
dozen left you can see it's moved from
here<00:01:28.140> right<00:01:28.619> back<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.240> back

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
here right back to here and now I'm back

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.520 
here right back to here and now I'm back
to<00:01:32.900> six<00:01:33.900> clicks<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> handbrake<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:36.530> don't

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to six clicks on the handbrake I don't

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.899 
to six clicks on the handbrake I don't
like<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> big<00:01:37.829> bother<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.159> getting<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> spring

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
like a big bother going getting a spring

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.190

center console back on of course the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.760 
center console back on of course the
handbrake<00:01:47.759> now<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.119> goes<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.479> high

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
handbrake now when it goes to this high
