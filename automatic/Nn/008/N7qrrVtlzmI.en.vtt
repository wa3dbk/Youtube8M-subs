this<00:00:43.320> we're<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> variant<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.520> we're<00:00:45.030> doing<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this we're a variant and we're doing the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.229 
this we're a variant and we're doing the
full<00:00:45.660> circuit<00:00:46.110> she's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> lap<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.879> standing

full circuit she's a lap from a standing

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
full circuit she's a lap from a standing
start<00:00:48.300> its<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> case<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.219> all

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
start its is we what the case is for all

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000 
start its is we what the case is for all
the<00:00:50.309> cars<00:00:51.260> when<00:00:52.260> we're<00:00:52.379> doing<00:00:52.469> flying<00:00:52.770> laps

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the cars when we're doing flying laps

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
the cars when we're doing flying laps
just<00:00:53.640> balloon<00:00:53.910> standish<00:00:54.690> dart<00:00:54.899> laps<00:00:55.140> gives

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
just balloon standish dart laps gives

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.830 
just balloon standish dart laps gives
everybody<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.949> bit<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.360> equal<00:00:57.360> running<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
everybody a bit more equal running and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080 
everybody a bit more equal running and
allows<00:00:58.680> forward<00:00:59.160> wild<00:00:59.430> course<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> compete

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
allows forward wild course to compete

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
allows forward wild course to compete
properly<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.570> well<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
properly as well so this is a bit of a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.520 
properly as well so this is a bit of a
test<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> yellow<00:01:03.840> bird<00:01:04.049> around<00:01:04.199> here

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
test for the yellow bird around here

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
test for the yellow bird around here
doesn't<00:01:04.979> great<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> handling<00:01:06.210> anyway<00:01:06.510> it's

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
doesn't great and handling anyway it's

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.950 
doesn't great and handling anyway it's
got<00:01:06.840> great<00:01:07.409> acceleration<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.750> great<00:01:09.750> top

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
got great acceleration and great top

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.090 
got great acceleration and great top
speed<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:11.570> handling<00:01:12.570> wars<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.170> not<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
speed but handling wars it's not the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.530 
speed but handling wars it's not the
best<00:01:14.250> there's<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.760> better<00:01:14.880> s-class<00:01:15.299> cars

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
best there's a lot better s-class cars

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.530 
best there's a lot better s-class cars
out<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.520> see<00:01:17.520> approaching<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.090> corn<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
out there see approaching this corn and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.450 
out there see approaching this corn and
they're<00:01:18.689> only<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.380> yellow<00:01:19.950> bird<00:01:20.130> winning

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
they're only as the yellow bird winning

there<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> grass<00:01:24.140> went<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.290> into<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
there on the grass went down into the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.109 
there on the grass went down into the
faunal<00:01:26.070> corn<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> they're<00:01:26.610> trying<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> keep

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
faunal corn and they're trying to keep

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.600 
faunal corn and they're trying to keep
it<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.659> apex<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.799> power<00:01:29.070> down<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it on the apex get that power down to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.649 
it on the apex get that power down to
use<00:01:30.360> acceleration<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.110> its<00:01:31.200> full<00:01:31.409> potential

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
use acceleration to its full potential

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.060 
use acceleration to its full potential
sit<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> flat<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.350> power<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
sit to a flat on the power now all the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.590 
sit to a flat on the power now all the
way<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> finish<00:01:35.850> line

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
way to the finish line

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.679 
way to the finish line
get<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.840> much<00:01:37.229> speed<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:38.420> come<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
get as much speed as you can come up to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.469 
get as much speed as you can come up to
the<00:01:39.780> line<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.560> yeah<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.759> that's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the line and yeah there we go that's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.640 
the line and yeah there we go that's
57.2<00:01:43.290> right<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:43.799> seconds<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> laptop

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
57.2 right one seconds for the laptop

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.370 
57.2 right one seconds for the laptop
and<00:01:46.650> now<00:01:46.830> on<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.130> round<00:01:47.310> three<00:01:47.610> top<00:01:47.909> speed<00:01:48.380> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and now on to round three top speed so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.070 
and now on to round three top speed so
for<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.649> we're<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.000> Mons<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.960> old
