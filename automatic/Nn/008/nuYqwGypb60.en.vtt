00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:13.500
 No one talks about the beauty she had here. 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 I have processes but the video this time 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.160
 He has processes but I got lost in the clear. 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.350
 the channel this time in a clear 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 cicarelli I do not remember but I think 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.310
 I did not bring any company with this weapon. 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.720
 until today the channel and at last was very good 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 also there with this new one as they do 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.429
 cyborg you guys have an expensive notion I 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.439
 I'm so connected in the news that I set 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.450
 etc that I just went to know they had 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.920
 this advantage to that other is of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.710
 dragon scales when your name 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 today and in a hurry, neither do they today. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 I found it very interesting if I did not 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 mistake out to a vote there on I 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.170
 that facebook a site I do not know about ardi is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 that they went back there to find out what 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 who can be more beautiful and is under that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.390
 cyborg language won and found it well 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.760
 interesting with fred is very cool is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.860
 for those who enjoy snow play as they do not 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.250
 has a lot of custom already with tracks but I know 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.660
 over there 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.609
 I wanted to buy it there for some 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.070
 reason had a few dots there some 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.080
 microsoft points left and who likes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.760
 then play with which ones I recommend 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.500
 by custom the short count but play 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 with the default blackmail let's say so 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.560
 that gray tone of guns but 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.900
 I'm finally face is a good time without 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 post video for you I know I 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.409
 I have been pulling many of 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.720
 of course the channel is neither going 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.640
 read here and this guy is honestly 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.290
 very in benfica could not kill more 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 I know it has pulled very clean to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 nuclear crisis on the canal and I wanted to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.140
 I would like to see your suggestions from you 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
 So what do you think of these lines? 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 nuclear cleaners are fixing etc. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.869
 because I honestly think much more 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.060
 interesting to watch a clean and the guy 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.890
 takes more than the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.479
 more risks because clicks because 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.700
 You guys are not guys that sports this. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.259
 scott dixon game was you seem a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.710
 Asshole to correct me, but I did it 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.329
 My case is the guy that is trix schools 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.560
 game are very strong, especially the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.450
 higher back 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.360
 you pity for it to get built 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.439
 but it's when you also get a 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.630
 obturation one absurd thing from another 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.340
 depends on the room because it has 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 A lot of solos to please the network guys. 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.509
 wi fi but anyway my case and I do not know 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.190
 What I find most interesting is not 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.920
 same feeling I already commented that you 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.770
 the end of the mob but it is very interesting the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.810
 names have taken multiple locations 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.910
 so I had enough is mainly 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.380
 home alone and philosophical betrays standards 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.180
 They are investing very dear, I am. 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.070
 finding it much nicer to play is the trump card 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.170
 to play with this marquinho gum 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.150
 because sincerely in the face cssm jesus 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.760
 were destroyed with this last pet and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.310
 face record increase was minimal damage 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.770
 disgrace if the pet and other curiosities 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.660
 Nuclear, guys, it's because he did well. 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.790
 Running man, I got my 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.680
 Finally the missing face or whatever 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.020
 faces two points in that match 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.450
 Domain think the team was with 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.100
 keppel group with two flags my team 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.900
 is doing any direct this 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.190
 sharing is absurd and this is because 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.780
 tava not seeing the girl's father was 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.670
 very alone then it turned out not 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.350
 appeared the nuclear symbol soon 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.570
 after I got but it's just you do 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.400
 the count is five of the finals 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.020
 after I caught the brutal is 25 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.910
 but the banks have finally 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.570
 liked and employment company is already almost 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.700
 at the end 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.260
 if you like or do not like to be boring also 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.270
 favorite organization and appears in a 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.130
 video on twitter said on twitter 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.930
 on page facebook us not forget 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.410
 That's it, I hope to see you next time. 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.410
 both together
