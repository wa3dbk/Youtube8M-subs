00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.680
 me this case is not built 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.930
 tuner 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.060
 I like to put such a prefix on 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.120
 the helicopter is full of shelves 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:06.049
 Well, let's continue here I connected this 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.049

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.560
 let's wait out how to tune the TV here 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:41.140
 check on the internet here is a list of examples 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:45.970
 here that channel number wants and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.520
 approximately the range of the antenna 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:55.550
 for watching digital television 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:01.039
 for example the channel number is 39 radius 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:06.050
 actions of thousands of kilometers but this is a plot 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.789
 how to install it and this is the channel list 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.560
 who at the moment with them kind of 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:16.130
 broadcasts free package continue 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.510
 installation and viewing on TV 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.110
 and so including the TV that is 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.110
 prefix 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:39.840
 and take out the bet loaded wheels 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:44.859

00:02:44.859 --> 00:03:10.870
 just here it goes union so you can 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:03:15.720

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.720
 from here and you live 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.030

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:47.950
 no volumes will arrive said that here 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.170
 just no word suits the role 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.550
 element deter further 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:59.600
 the channel is planned and here the setup is like 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:04.580
 here the channels are very simple like me 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.540
 spoke from the channel need to know the number on 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.960
 who do you live in the region? 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.960
 antennas 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:19.780
 manual channel search 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:27.460
 Here I have this case, that's the range of 44 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:34.350
 leads and for here the signal strength is ninety 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:39.759
 three percent a qualitative force 67 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:42.970
 This will remind ordinary wire which 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:45.280
