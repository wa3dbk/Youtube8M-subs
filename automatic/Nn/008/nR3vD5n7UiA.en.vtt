00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
think or is the age I can't really see

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.270 
think or is the age I can't really see
because<00:03:10.910> my<00:03:11.390> dad<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:11.989> turned<00:03:12.350> out<00:03:12.500> pretty<00:03:12.739> low

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
because my dad is turned out pretty low

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.660 
because my dad is turned out pretty low
and<00:03:13.489> this<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.570> our<00:03:14.690> well<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:16.010> spawn<00:03:16.310> i<00:03:16.340> think

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670
