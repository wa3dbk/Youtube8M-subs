00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
lately because I'm replace that one

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510 
lately because I'm replace that one
crutch<00:00:57.539> again<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.440> they're<00:00:58.980> pretty<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
crutch again and they're pretty much the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.840 
crutch again and they're pretty much the
Antichrist<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.660> play<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.050> Christ

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
Antichrist when we play them on Christ

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
Antichrist when we play them on Christ
but<00:01:02.850> unable<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.840> fit<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.409> know<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> place<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
but unable to fit if we know a place you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070 
but unable to fit if we know a place you
said<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.850> we've<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.479> more<00:01:06.630> about<00:01:06.689> them

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
said and we've a bit more about them

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
said and we've a bit more about them
from<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> match<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.430> think<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> could

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
from that match so I'm I think it could

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.480 
from that match so I'm I think it could
either<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.930> rather<00:01:10.380> than<00:01:10.560> hinder<00:01:10.740> so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
either actually rather than hinder so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.130 
either actually rather than hinder so
you<00:01:11.580> reckon<00:01:11.909> districts<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> better<00:01:12.750> map<00:01:12.960> for

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you reckon districts a better map for

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.070 
you reckon districts a better map for
you<00:01:13.200> against<00:01:13.470> TCM<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.570> lot<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> fair<00:01:15.900> guess

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you against TCM a lot of the fair guess

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.640 
you against TCM a lot of the fair guess
because<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> probably<00:01:16.560> look<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> yeah<00:01:18.650> so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
because it probably look at that yeah so

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
because it probably look at that yeah so
what<00:01:20.130> did<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.759> gonna<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.330> bit

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
what did you think I'm gonna go a bit

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
what did you think I'm gonna go a bit
more<00:01:21.630> controversial<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:23.070> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
more controversial because that's you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.880 
more controversial because that's you
