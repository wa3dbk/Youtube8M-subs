00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.510 

why<00:00:08.260> sort<00:00:08.590> of<00:00:10.530> departments<00:00:11.530> of<00:00:11.680> some<00:00:11.920> new<00:00:12.100> cars

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
why sort of departments of some new cars

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.070 
why sort of departments of some new cars
that<00:00:12.700> are<00:00:12.790> coming<00:00:12.820> out<00:00:13.150> I<00:00:13.180> mean<00:00:13.330> right<00:00:13.870> now<00:00:13.900> I

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
that are coming out I mean right now I

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.480 
that are coming out I mean right now I
think<00:00:14.260> probably<00:00:14.590> your<00:00:14.800> best<00:00:14.920> value<00:00:15.160> for<00:00:15.429> money

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
think probably your best value for money

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.260 
think probably your best value for money
is<00:00:15.700> the<00:00:15.960> 290<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.200> AMD<00:00:17.650> one<00:00:17.920> which<00:00:18.220> is<00:00:18.640> I<00:00:18.910> think

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
is the 290 the AMD one which is I think

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.060 
is the 290 the AMD one which is I think
even<00:00:19.540> you<00:00:20.110> know<00:00:20.230> value<00:00:20.619> for<00:00:20.770> money<00:00:20.890> it's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
even you know value for money it's

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.560 
even you know value for money it's
better<00:00:21.250> value<00:00:21.550> for<00:00:21.580> money<00:00:21.730> in<00:00:21.939> the<00:00:22.060> RX<00:00:22.390> which

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
better value for money in the RX which

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.569 
better value for money in the RX which
is<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.840> more<00:00:23.020> expensive<00:00:23.590> powerful<00:00:24.250> one<00:00:24.399> but

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
is the more expensive powerful one but

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.109 
is the more expensive powerful one but
the<00:00:24.720> 291<00:00:25.720> like<00:00:25.989> dollar<00:00:26.560> per<00:00:26.910> whatever<00:00:27.910> you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
the 291 like dollar per whatever you

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.429 
the 291 like dollar per whatever you
want<00:00:28.239> to<00:00:28.329> call<00:00:28.419> it<00:00:28.570> jig<00:00:28.689> or<00:00:28.779> flop<00:00:28.989> is<00:00:29.169> actually

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
want to call it jig or flop is actually

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.180 
want to call it jig or flop is actually
a<00:00:29.470> really<00:00:29.590> good<00:00:29.800> deal<00:00:30.930> so<00:00:31.930> it's<00:00:32.590> sort<00:00:32.800> of<00:00:32.829> old<00:00:33.010> I

monitor and I have to say 4k is now I'm

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.560 
monitor and I have to say 4k is now I'm
not<00:01:06.790> sure<00:01:06.820> like<00:01:07.240> at<00:01:07.450> home<00:01:07.659> for<00:01:08.140> TV<00:01:08.680> will<00:01:09.250> be<00:01:09.570> as

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
not sure like at home for TV will be as

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.110 
not sure like at home for TV will be as
big<00:01:10.960> but<00:01:11.170> for<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.590> computer<00:01:12.520> use<00:01:12.670> it's<00:01:12.880> really

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
big but for the computer use it's really

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.610 
big but for the computer use it's really
good<00:01:13.300> because<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.600> have<00:01:13.630> huge<00:01:14.260> amount<00:01:14.530> of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
good because you have huge amount of

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.730 
good because you have huge amount of
screen<00:01:15.130> real<00:01:15.370> estate<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:17.470> know<00:01:17.560> our

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
screen real estate and you know our

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.469 
screen real estate and you know our
models<00:01:18.130> look<00:01:18.280> really<00:01:18.520> beautiful<00:01:18.729> in<00:01:19.030> 4k<00:01:19.300> but

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
models look really beautiful in 4k but

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.200 
models look really beautiful in 4k but
also<00:01:19.810> just<00:01:20.140> for<00:01:20.290> like<00:01:20.440> having<00:01:21.250> email<00:01:21.850> and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
also just for like having email and

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.560 
also just for like having email and
doing<00:01:22.630> my<00:01:22.720> coding<00:01:23.080> it's<00:01:23.200> good<00:01:23.409> too<00:01:23.620> so<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:25.479> ya

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
doing my coding it's good too so but ya

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.730 
doing my coding it's good too so but ya
know<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.810> mean<00:01:25.930> I<00:01:25.990> would<00:01:26.140> say<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.350> would<00:01:26.560> say<00:01:26.590> I

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
know I mean I would say I would say I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.530 
know I mean I would say I would say I
would<00:01:26.950> sort<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.190> probably<00:01:27.580> go<00:01:27.820> with<00:01:28.090> something

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
would sort of probably go with something

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.170 
would sort of probably go with something
like<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.960> 290<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:32.190> probably<00:01:33.190> in<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.610> know

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
like a 290 and then probably in it know

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.080 
like a 290 and then probably in it know
the<00:01:34.330> Intel<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:36.070> like<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:37.000> know

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
the Intel probably like that you know

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.190 
the Intel probably like that you know
kind<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.930> I<00:01:38.040> sort<00:01:39.040> of<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.900> equivalent<00:01:40.900> of

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
kind of the I sort of a equivalent of

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.260 
kind of the I sort of a equivalent of
the<00:01:41.320> a5<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:42.250> current<00:01:42.610> what<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:42.940> in<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.119> house

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
the a5 I current what it is in the house

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.600 
the a5 I current what it is in the house
wall<00:01:43.479> now<00:01:43.690> but<00:01:44.350> like<00:01:44.590> typically<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.159> very<00:01:45.340> top

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
wall now but like typically the very top

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.580 
wall now but like typically the very top
end<00:01:45.820> stuff<00:01:46.150> for<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.420> gaming<00:01:46.630> applications

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
end stuff for the gaming applications

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.740 
end stuff for the gaming applications
isn't<00:01:47.890> as<00:01:48.010> important<00:01:48.520> because<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:49.330> tend<00:01:49.600> to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
isn't as important because you tend to

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.170 
isn't as important because you tend to
it's<00:01:50.049> more<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:53.619> more<00:01:53.680> a<00:01:53.830> GPU<00:01:54.250> issue<00:01:54.549> in<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:55.060> lot

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
it's more it's more a GPU issue in a lot

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's more it's more a GPU issue in a lot
of<00:01:55.210> cases<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.460> would<00:01:57.640> say<00:01:57.790> that<00:01:58.030> be<00:01:58.450> good

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
of cases so but I would say that be good

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.880 
of cases so but I would say that be good
I<00:01:58.630> mean<00:01:58.840> we're<00:01:58.930> going<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.110> support<00:01:59.350> mantle<00:01:59.770> on

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
I mean we're going to support mantle on

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.890 
I mean we're going to support mantle on
the<00:01:59.979> AMD<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.670> we're<00:02:01.210> going<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.570> extra

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
the AMD so we're going to get extra

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.390 
the AMD so we're going to get extra
performance<00:02:02.049> gains<00:02:02.710> from<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.130> fact<00:02:03.310> that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
performance gains from the fact that

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.890 
performance gains from the fact that
we're<00:02:03.549> going<00:02:03.700> straight<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.210> hardware<00:02:04.630> and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
we're going straight to the hardware and

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.420 
we're going straight to the hardware and
then<00:02:05.439> on<00:02:05.590> top<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:05.890> having<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.250> really

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
then on top of that having a really

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.100 
then on top of that having a really
powerful<00:02:06.610> card<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.150> think<00:02:07.180> would<00:02:07.750> be<00:02:07.780> pretty

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
powerful card I think would be pretty

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.020 
powerful card I think would be pretty
good<00:02:08.379> for<00:02:08.560> people<00:02:08.799> I<00:02:09.009> would<00:02:09.369> recommend<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:09.879> mean

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
good for people I would recommend I mean

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.670 
good for people I would recommend I mean
our<00:02:10.450> minimum<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.869> going<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.049> be<00:02:11.110> 8<00:02:11.200> gigabytes

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
our minimum is going to be 8 gigabytes

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.710 
our minimum is going to be 8 gigabytes
but<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.040> would<00:02:12.159> say<00:02:12.310> 16<00:02:12.730> gigabytes<00:02:13.239> will<00:02:13.510> be<00:02:13.689> a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
but I would say 16 gigabytes will be a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.390 
but I would say 16 gigabytes will be a
minimum<00:02:14.140> recommendation<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:15.189> you<00:02:15.279> have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
minimum recommendation just so you have

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.980 
minimum recommendation just so you have
all<00:02:15.579> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
all the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.250 
all the
headroom<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.440> operating<00:02:16.890> system<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.330> you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
headroom the operating system and you

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.810 
headroom the operating system and you
know<00:02:19.350> magma<00:02:19.650> shooting<00:02:19.920> around<00:02:20.010> 32<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:20.760> I'm

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
know magma shooting around 32 but I'm

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.430 
know magma shooting around 32 but I'm
not<00:02:20.970> saying<00:02:21.210> everyone<00:02:21.450> he's<00:02:21.570> 32<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.140> just

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
not saying everyone he's 32 I just

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.520 
not saying everyone he's 32 I just
compiled<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.760> 3dsmax<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.230> whole<00:02:25.350> bunch

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
compiled have 3dsmax have a whole bunch

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.560 
compiled have 3dsmax have a whole bunch
of<00:02:25.590> other<00:02:25.770> stuff<00:02:25.800> open<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.310> same<00:02:26.460> time<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
of other stuff open at the same time and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.050 
of other stuff open at the same time and
you<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.800> would<00:02:28.980> say<00:02:29.130> an<00:02:29.220> SSD<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.760> mean

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
you know then I would say an SSD I mean

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.280 
you know then I would say an SSD I mean
they're<00:02:30.150> become<00:02:30.390> really<00:02:30.660> cheap<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:31.050> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
they're become really cheap now and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.740 
they're become really cheap now and
they're<00:02:31.440> absolutely<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:32.450> lifesaver<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.570> mean

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
they're absolutely a lifesaver I mean

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.660 
they're absolutely a lifesaver I mean
when<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> machine<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.620> an<00:02:34.830> SSD<00:02:35.130> like

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
when you have a machine with an SSD like

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.820 
when you have a machine with an SSD like
Windows<00:02:36.030> 7<00:02:36.060> boots<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.990> mean<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.290> boots<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.620> fast

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
Windows 7 boots I mean it boots as fast

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.480 
Windows 7 boots I mean it boots as fast
as<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.130> console<00:02:39.060> does<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.380> SSDs<00:02:41.010> make<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> big

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
as a console does so SSDs make a big

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.070 
as a console does so SSDs make a big
difference<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.970> terms<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.390> quality<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.870> life

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
difference in terms of quality of life

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.380 
difference in terms of quality of life
on<00:02:43.350> your<00:02:43.530> computer<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.070> stuff<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.850> those<00:02:45.270> are

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
on your computer and stuff so those are

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.600 
on your computer and stuff so those are
the<00:02:45.510> things<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.870> would<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.200> would<00:02:46.440> recommend<00:02:47.070> SSD

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
the things I would I would recommend SSD

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.870 
the things I would I would recommend SSD
it's<00:02:48.450> decent<00:02:48.840> Maniram<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.520> know<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> good

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
it's decent Maniram and you know a good

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.650 
it's decent Maniram and you know a good
video<00:02:51.030> card<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.630> you'd<00:02:52.320> be<00:02:52.470> good
