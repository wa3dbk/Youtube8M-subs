when<00:00:18.090> our<00:00:18.270> prior<00:00:18.539> segment<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.170> were<00:00:19.289> staying

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
when our prior segment we were staying

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.130 
when our prior segment we were staying
the<00:00:19.800> 5030<00:00:20.460> standard<00:00:20.970> 3-cushion<00:00:21.510> kick<00:00:21.720> system

the 5030 standard 3-cushion kick system

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.840 
the 5030 standard 3-cushion kick system
and<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.740> had<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.980> use<00:00:23.100> those<00:00:23.310> numbers<00:00:23.519> with

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
and we had to use those numbers with

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.560 
and we had to use those numbers with
subtraction<00:00:24.650> I'm<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> try<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.570> refine

subtraction I'm going to try to refine
the<00:00:27.750> system<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> little<00:00:28.439> bit<00:00:28.590> where<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.859> don't

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the system a little bit where you don't

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.769 
the system a little bit where you don't
have<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> use<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.580> numbers<00:00:29.939> when<00:00:30.179> cue<00:00:30.630> ball

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
have to use the numbers when cue ball

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.569 
have to use the numbers when cue ball
shifts<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.470> corner<00:00:31.769> pocket<00:00:32.189> this

shifts out of this corner pocket this
come<00:00:32.790> eight<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> little<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.329> easier<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> get

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
come eight is a little bit easier to get

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660 
come eight is a little bit easier to get
the<00:00:33.870> numbering<00:00:34.170> system<00:00:34.520> we're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the numbering system we're going to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.310 
the numbering system we're going to
start<00:00:36.000> again<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> standards<00:00:36.989> setup<00:00:37.200> we

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
start again with the standards setup we

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.139 
start again with the standards setup we
had<00:00:37.469> before<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> object-ball<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
had before we have the object-ball in

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
had before we have the object-ball in
this<00:00:39.270> corner<00:00:39.660> which<00:00:39.870> has<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> value<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> 20<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
value of 50 and if you remember when I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
value of 50 and if you remember when I
shot<00:00:45.510> down<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.440> line<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> had<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
shot down this line I had to make the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.920 
shot down this line I had to make the
half<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> diamond<00:00:47.850> adjustment<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> short

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
half a diamond adjustment for the short

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.270 
half a diamond adjustment for the short
angle<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> table<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.950> no<00:00:50.100> problem

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
angle of the table which is no problem

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.150 
angle of the table which is no problem
that<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.960> normal<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.320> no<00:00:53.010> matter

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that that's a normal thing no matter

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.670 
that that's a normal thing no matter
where<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> travel<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.320> again<00:00:55.500> be

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
where you travel so you have to again be

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.380 
where you travel so you have to again be
in<00:00:55.770> touch<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.129> those<00:00:56.280> elements<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.030> where

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
in touch with those elements that where

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
in touch with those elements that where
you<00:00:57.480> play<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.809> raining<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.410> you're

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you play if it's raining more you're

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.619 
you play if it's raining more you're
going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> adjust<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.730> shorter<00:01:00.030> tables<00:01:00.449> if

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
going to adjust for shorter tables if

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.299 
going to adjust for shorter tables if
it's<00:01:01.079> real<00:01:01.260> dry<00:01:01.559> sometimes<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.219> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
it's real dry sometimes you have to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.039 
it's real dry sometimes you have to
compensate<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:02.969> direction<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.449> just

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
compensate the other direction so just

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.340 
compensate the other direction so just
be<00:01:04.199> aware<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.439> those<00:01:04.619> things<00:01:05.299> when<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.570> move

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
be aware of those things when you move

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.460 
be aware of those things when you move
this<00:01:07.590> cue<00:01:07.890> ball<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> rail<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.000> way<00:01:09.470> or

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this cue ball down the rail this way or

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
this cue ball down the rail this way or
you<00:01:10.530> move<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> cue<00:01:11.430> ball<00:01:11.640> down<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.659> short

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
you move the cue ball down this short

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
you move the cue ball down this short
rail<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.220> value<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> cue<00:01:15.240> ball

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
rail this way the value of the cue ball

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.020 
rail this way the value of the cue ball
changes<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> somehow<00:01:17.610> come<00:01:18.000> up

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
changes so we have to somehow come up

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
changes so we have to somehow come up
with<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> value<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> cue<00:01:19.020> ball<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.799> moves

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
with a value of the cue ball as it moves

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
with a value of the cue ball as it moves
but<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> subtract<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> value

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
but then you have to subtract the value

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
but then you have to subtract the value
of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> algebra<00:01:22.530> from<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> gets<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.340> bit

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
of the algebra from it gets a little bit

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.499 
of the algebra from it gets a little bit
complicated<00:01:23.729> you're<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> heat<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.390> battle

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
complicated you're in the heat of battle

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.050 
complicated you're in the heat of battle
to<00:01:25.229> make<00:01:25.380> those<00:01:25.560> subtractions<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:26.970> an

still should hit the ball so in order to
do<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.659> we're<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.200> move<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
do this we're just going to move the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020 
do this we're just going to move the
cube<00:01:46.799> up<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> table<00:01:47.399> somewhere<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.850> in

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
cube up the table somewhere about in

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.899 
cube up the table somewhere about in
this<00:01:48.149> area<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.509> could<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.720> anywhere<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.320> all

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
this area it could be anywhere at all

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.940 
this area it could be anywhere at all
and<00:01:50.909> from<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.960> corner<00:01:52.290> where<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> cue<00:01:52.799> ball

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and from this corner where the cue ball

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.560 
and from this corner where the cue ball
was<00:01:53.040> originally<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.700> remember<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> line<00:01:54.329> we

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
was originally we remember the line we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
was originally we remember the line we
had<00:01:54.780> where<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.020> calculated<00:01:55.710> from<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> corner

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
had where we calculated from the corner

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.209 
had where we calculated from the corner
fifty<00:01:56.939> thirty<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.810> move<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.710> half<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
fifty thirty we move down a half a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.310 
fifty thirty we move down a half a
diamond<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.850> you've<00:02:00.509> got<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
diamond all you've got to do when you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130 
diamond all you've got to do when you
get<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.619> calculation<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.490> take<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.840> line

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
get this calculation is take the line

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
get this calculation is take the line
that<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.560> shoot<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.180> table

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that you shoot down off the table

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719 
that you shoot down off the table
through<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.049> half<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.409> diamond<00:02:07.729> adjustment

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
through that half a diamond adjustment

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
through that half a diamond adjustment
and<00:02:08.879> go<00:02:09.330> off<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.750> table<00:02:10.110> about<00:02:10.259> seven<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.739> ten

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and go off the table about seven to ten

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.250 
and go off the table about seven to ten
feet<00:02:11.220> now<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.819> happens<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
feet now it just so happens that in this
