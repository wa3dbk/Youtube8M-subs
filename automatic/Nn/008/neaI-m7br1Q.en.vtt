 the staff of today's video commemorating the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.970
 more than one million views of the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.319
 simple pavÃª recipe that was one of the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.130
 first videos we did here in the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.929
 channel 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.000
 the video link're up here the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.660
 side if you want to check it out as it was 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.910
 before 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.719
 the style of our video the scene and everything 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.220
 more 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.930
 here's the side of a picadinha you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 you will see that you have changed 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.519
 enough thing and today I'm going to redo 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 this recipe for you so to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.880
 celebrate this 1 million views 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.140
 the first step in the blender knots 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 Let's put a can of milk. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 condensed a can of sour cream 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.719
 without whey a can of milk that I used to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.969
 can of condensed milk as a measure 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:50.960
 two tablespoons of starch soup 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.960
 corn and a yolk that was sieved and 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.340
 Now I'm going to hit these ingredients until 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.760
 be homogeneous approximately 12 thousand 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.409
 Just chill until well organized and now I'm going 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.909
 add this mixture in a pan 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.670
 on low heat 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.340
 We're always mixing until she 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.290
 start to thicken 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 so when it starts to boil 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 already begins to thicken and is 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.240
 It's important that we continue mixing 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 always the desired point by memorizing the 20 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.490
 minutes then delete the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.810
 fire and that's the ideal point he gets 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 seeming to now show me against the woman 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 He looks like Miguel hour and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.159
 they spoil the spoon well you can notice it here 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.320
 he is well to spoon he gets it fixed 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.000
 in the woman and when you pass your finger 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.649
 so he makes a way 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.970
 if I 'm wrong it's not going to 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.159
 to do this you're 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.259
 and another important detail is you do not 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.329
 try to give the point in the pan it is so 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.439
 soft even looking like porridge 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 but later when he was arrested and 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.100
 it will thicken and will acquire 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.619
 the desired consistency and will be fine 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.869
 creamy 70 to the point of it in the pan 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.369
 leaving it too thick when later 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.530
 If you take the refrigerator and it will 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.450
 're very hard so it's ideal for him 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.250
 look very creamy later 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.170
 so for the assembly is that I have 200 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 grams of biscuit or starch biscuit 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.940
 of corn and I 'm going here 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.730
 quickly in the milk and I put it in the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.090
 The bottom of the refractory is now a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.090
 cream 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:41.040
 they will all give three layers of 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:44.330
 wafer three layers of cream plus one 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.330
 cookie layer 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.650
 I'll finish the last layer of skin 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.800
 It may be that there is a 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.060
 cookies 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.950
 but this will now depend on the will 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.230
 once if you want a young man with more 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.230
 layers with less layers or more 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.300
 biscuit and cream - and there goes your own 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.950
 criterion is but only about 200 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.350
 cookie grams that we use the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.480
 recipes and now I'll finish 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.210
 with dry grated coconut but you can 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.980
 put you prefer over 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.810
 I like to do so with grated coconut 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.160
 because it was always how to move the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.160
 do at home for us 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.520
 then it brings a remembrance 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.580
 for me and that's all it is to take the 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.370
 pause for the refrigerator and leave it on 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.620
 refrigerator is cooling approximately 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.660
 six hours minimum of six to eight 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.190
 hours're preferably if you have 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.410
 patience still leaves a day for the 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.100
 other it will get cooler still 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.100
 It will get better 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.690
 this people was part of my childhood. 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.640
 my aunt always did at home is in 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.889
 year-end parties always in 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.359
 see everyone liked and I like 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.130
 enough of this revenue because in addition to 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.650
 simple he looks very good the same 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.480
 and even since you want to receive a 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.169
 visit you do not know who dessert 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.790
 Do or it's you it's not very good 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.310
 in the kitchen I'm sure any 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.930
 person can do this power and it is 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.820
 This is the personal recipe for today. 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.740
 I hope you have enjoyed it very much. 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.340
 Thank you for coming to the next. 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.340
 such 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.080
 when it starts to boil 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.189
 When it starts to boil, it will already 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:06.330
 begin to thicken as well and continue 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.979
 always mixing when to start 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.469
 to boil and it will start to thicken 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.919
 they also continue to mix 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:15.919
 it's on the farm 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.270
 so when to start when to start 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:28.889
 boil 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:31.819
 there old lady is almost at the point when 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.819
 start to boil 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.279
 also is not the life we was one 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.649
 a short time ago here recording only us 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:47.939
 two dead the void had no noise 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:50.550
 no one took a mobile with silence now 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:52.999
 you're recording there's a little something there that 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.999
 keep talking
