very wide

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.819 
very wide
or<00:02:14.159> very<00:02:14.340> different<00:02:15.030> color<00:02:15.689> from<00:02:16.200> warm<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
or very different color from warm to

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.250 
or very different color from warm to
dark<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:17.969> think<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.299> color<00:02:18.540> alone<00:02:18.900> is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
dark but I think the color alone is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.410 
dark but I think the color alone is
absolutely<00:02:20.040> amazing<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.670> will<00:02:21.000> look<00:02:21.180> great

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
absolutely amazing and will look great

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.140 
absolutely amazing and will look great

darker blue is the cold and the lighter

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.430 
darker blue is the cold and the lighter
blue<00:04:20.639> is<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.299> hot<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.620> I'll<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.010> dip<00:04:23.219> it<00:04:23.400> into

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
blue is the hot so I'll just dip it into

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.760 
blue is the hot so I'll just dip it into
the<00:04:24.650> hot<00:04:24.830> water<00:04:25.040> again<00:04:25.250> so<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.170> hot

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
the hot water again so that is the hot

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.720 
the hot water again so that is the hot
color<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.810> there<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:29.930> have<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.850> cold<00:04:31.850> color

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
color and there we have the cold color

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.290 
color and there we have the cold color
now<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.790> last<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.390> creams<00:04:35.810> is<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:37.640> bright

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
now the last of the creams is the bright

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.670 
now the last of the creams is the bright
pink<00:04:38.660> change<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:41.330> darker<00:04:41.720> pink<00:04:41.870> is<00:04:42.230> the

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
pink change so the darker pink is the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.630 
pink change so the darker pink is the
cold<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:44.090> lighter<00:04:44.330> pink<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.870> warm

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
cold and the lighter pink is the warm

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.720 
cold and the lighter pink is the warm
it's<00:04:46.640> really<00:04:46.850> hot<00:04:47.120> pink<00:04:47.540> that<00:04:48.440> is<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:49.190> warm

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.630 
it's really hot pink that is the warm
color<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:52.900> then<00:04:53.900> at<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.170> tip<00:04:54.350> there<00:04:54.590> is<00:04:55.220> the

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
color and then at the tip there is the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.450 
color and then at the tip there is the
cool<00:04:55.850> color<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:57.350> next<00:04:57.530> two<00:04:57.980> colors<00:04:58.310> are

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
cool color the next two colors are

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.130 
cool color the next two colors are
actually<00:04:58.550> glitter<00:04:59.150> colors<00:04:59.570> so<00:04:59.840> I'll<00:04:59.960> show

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
actually glitter colors so I'll show

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.460 
actually glitter colors so I'll show
them<00:05:00.320> together<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.790> first<00:05:02.120> is<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.960> glitter

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
them together the first is the glitter

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.530 
them together the first is the glitter
blue<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.460> second<00:05:04.850> is<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.300> glitter

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
blue and the second is the glitter

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.380 
blue and the second is the glitter
purple<00:05:05.920> so<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.040> brita<00:05:07.280> blue<00:05:07.580> goes<00:05:07.850> from<00:05:08.120> dark

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
purple so the brita blue goes from dark

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.190 
purple so the brita blue goes from dark
to<00:05:08.510> light

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
to light

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.070

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
so that's cold to warm and the purple

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.250 
so that's cold to warm and the purple
goes<00:05:12.260> from<00:05:12.560> purple<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.100> pink<00:05:13.720> so<00:05:14.720> I've<00:05:14.990> got

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.290 

these<00:05:24.320> ones<00:05:24.620> change<00:05:25.250> quite<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.060> bit

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
these ones change quite a bit

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.720 
these ones change quite a bit
most<00:05:27.020> of<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.260> purple<00:05:27.650> the<00:05:27.800> purple<00:05:27.830> change<00:05:28.370> is

most of the purple the purple change is
is<00:05:29.240> definitely<00:05:29.870> noticeable<00:05:31.720> so<00:05:32.720> this<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:32.990> the

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
is definitely noticeable so this is the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.700 
is definitely noticeable so this is the
warm<00:05:33.380> colors<00:05:33.830> we've<00:05:34.670> got<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.180> purple<00:05:36.110> pink

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.659 
warm colors we've got the purple pink
and<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.550> blue<00:05:37.820> at<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.330> top<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:39.250> they<00:05:40.250> are<00:05:40.550> the

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
and the blue at the top and they are the

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.730 
and the blue at the top and they are the
cool<00:05:40.880> colors<00:05:41.060> at<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.480> tips<00:05:41.690> there<00:05:41.960> if<00:05:42.380> I<00:05:42.560> had

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
cool colors at the tips there if I had

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.080 
cool colors at the tips there if I had
to<00:05:42.830> pick<00:05:42.980> a<00:05:43.010> favorite<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.669> would<00:05:43.730> definitely

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
to pick a favorite it would definitely

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.370 
to pick a favorite it would definitely
be<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.990> purple<00:05:45.530> I<00:05:45.740> think<00:05:46.550> it's<00:05:47.419> because<00:05:48.260> the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
be the purple I think it's because the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.440 
be the purple I think it's because the
Purple's<00:05:48.770> are<00:05:48.860> really<00:05:49.160> nice<00:05:49.340> purple<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:50.000> the

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
Purple's are really nice purple and the

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.690 
Purple's are really nice purple and the
color<00:05:50.690> change<00:05:51.050> itself<00:05:51.590> is<00:05:52.010> definitely

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
color change itself is definitely

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.560 
color change itself is definitely
noticeable<00:05:53.380> down<00:05:54.380> from<00:05:54.680> that<00:05:54.919> is<00:05:55.430> 3<00:05:55.910> the

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
noticeable down from that is 3 the

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.310 
noticeable down from that is 3 the
salmon<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.320> pink<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.790> blue<00:05:59.390> or<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.050> teal

cold because it's really cold in this

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.530 
cold because it's really cold in this
room<00:06:12.860> so<00:06:13.160> that's<00:06:13.640> what<00:06:13.790> they<00:06:13.880> look<00:06:14.060> like<00:06:14.120> cold

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.659 
anyway and yeah I really really like the
way<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.770> they<00:06:18.919> turned<00:06:19.160> out

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
way that they turned out

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.360 
way that they turned out
they're<00:06:20.300> very<00:06:20.419> opaque<00:06:20.900> they<00:06:21.350> apply<00:06:21.680> very<00:06:22.070> well

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
they're very opaque they apply very well

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.950 
they're very opaque they apply very well
they're<00:06:22.700> very<00:06:22.730> creamy

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
they're very creamy

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.440

um so that's no plus when you're only
paying<00:06:26.750> like<00:06:27.320> four<00:06:27.680> dollars<00:06:27.830> five<00:06:28.340> dollars

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669
