scratch maybe you didn't notice in the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.570 
scratch maybe you didn't notice in the
frame<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.710> needs<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.040> touched<00:01:11.310> up

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
frame that needs to be touched up

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.040 
frame that needs to be touched up
there's<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.120> of<00:01:12.300> dirt<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.870> made<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
there's a lot of dirt on it you made it

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.530 
there's a lot of dirt on it you made it
not<00:01:13.380> pick<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.800> on<00:01:13.979> stuff<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.640> another

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
not pick up on stuff like that another

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
not pick up on stuff like that another
reason<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.440> electrolyte<00:01:17.040> drinks<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
reason is the electrolyte drinks that we

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.760 
reason is the electrolyte drinks that we
all<00:01:17.820> carry<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.570> often<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.409> lots<00:01:19.590> of

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
all carry in here often have lots of

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830 
all carry in here often have lots of
sugar<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.370> and<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:21.120> do<00:01:21.180> tend<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
sugar in them and they do tend to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140 
sugar in them and they do tend to
dribble<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.620> then<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.640> find<00:01:23.940> their

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
dribble and then they they find their

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.050 
dribble and then they they find their
way<00:01:24.180> right<00:01:24.900> down<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.830> underside<00:01:26.460> into<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
way right down the underside into the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
way right down the underside into the
bottom<00:01:27.390> bracket<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.870> they<00:01:28.110> start<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bottom bracket and they start to kind of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
bottom bracket and they start to kind of
chunk<00:01:29.820> stuff<00:01:30.120> up<00:01:30.330> down<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.500> actually

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
chunk stuff up down here I can actually

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.600 
chunk stuff up down here I can actually
feel<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.940> droplets<00:01:33.690> here<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.400> put

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
feel little droplets here you know put

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.250 
feel little droplets here you know put
some<00:01:35.760> spit<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.390> fingers<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.170> can

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
some spit on my fingers and see if I can

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.899 
some spit on my fingers and see if I can
get<00:01:37.380> rid<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> way<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.790> help

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
get rid of them that way that will help

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.340 
get rid of them that way that will help
dissolve<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:39.690> think<00:01:39.930> lemon<00:01:40.170> plush

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
dissolve and I don't think lemon plush

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.890 
dissolve and I don't think lemon plush
can<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.830> okay<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.810> was

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
can do that okay there they go that was

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
and how quickly this frame can get dusty

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.450 
and how quickly this frame can get dusty
there's<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.830> other<00:01:58.979> things<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.430> should

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
look at in terms of lubrication and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.830 
look at in terms of lubrication and
there<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.850> derail<00:02:03.180> your<00:02:03.390> front

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
there and that is the derail your front

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.039 
there and that is the derail your front
and<00:02:04.020> rear<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.860> also<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.060> some<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.330> simple

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and rear and also just some very simple

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.199 
and rear and also just some very simple
tire<00:02:08.039> care<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.049> let's<00:02:10.049> talk<00:02:10.229> about<00:02:10.409> that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
tire care and let's talk about that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.850 
tire care and let's talk about that
let's<00:02:12.540> start<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:12.900> lubrication<00:02:13.439> for<00:02:13.769> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
let's start with lubrication for the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.429 
let's start with lubrication for the
front<00:02:14.099> derailleur<00:02:14.930> really<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
front derailleur really all you have to

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.569 
front derailleur really all you have to
worry<00:02:16.470> about<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> front<00:02:17.129> derailleur<00:02:17.220> is

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
worry about in the front derailleur is

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.789 
worry about in the front derailleur is
oiling<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.269> pivot<00:02:18.569> points<00:02:18.989> if<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.620> don't

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
oiling the pivot points if you don't

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.949 
oiling the pivot points if you don't
know<00:02:19.890> where<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.099> pivot<00:02:20.400> points<00:02:20.760> are<00:02:20.939> there<00:02:21.810> in

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
know where the pivot points are there in

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.660 
know where the pivot points are there in
this<00:02:22.079> area<00:02:22.439> one<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.769> easy<00:02:22.980> ways<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.280> find

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
this area one of the easy ways to find

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.970 
this area one of the easy ways to find
it<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.909> just<00:02:23.939> to<00:02:24.319> move<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.379> derailleur<00:02:25.950> back

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it is just to move the derailleur back

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.520 
it is just to move the derailleur back
and<00:02:26.370> forth<00:02:26.579> with<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.879> shift<00:02:27.120> lever<00:02:27.530> its

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and forth with the shift lever its

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.580 
and forth with the shift lever its
pivoting<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.400> its<00:02:30.060> pivoting<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:30.989> there's

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
pivoting here its pivoting here there's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.339 
pivoting here its pivoting here there's
some<00:02:31.739> pivoting<00:02:32.099> going<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.519> down<00:02:32.730> there<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.930> all

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
some pivoting going on down there so all

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.809 
some pivoting going on down there so all
I<00:02:34.409> want<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.799> do<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.040> just<00:02:35.189> add<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> little<00:02:35.640> bit<00:02:35.790> of

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
I want to do is just add a little bit of

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.569 
I want to do is just add a little bit of
oil<00:02:35.970> now<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.170> usually<00:02:37.890> use<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> product

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
a little bit in there now after you're

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.309 
a little bit in there now after you're
done<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.799> what<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.099> should<00:03:08.310> do<00:03:08.489> is

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
done with this what you should do is

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.129 
done with this what you should do is
just<00:03:10.319> take<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> paper<00:03:10.799> towel<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:12.299> dab<00:03:12.510> off<00:03:12.840> any

just take a paper towel and dab off any

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.159 
just take a paper towel and dab off any
of<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.439> excess<00:03:13.889> because<00:03:14.629> oil<00:03:15.629> tends<00:03:16.019> to

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
of the excess because oil tends to

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.250 
of the excess because oil tends to
attract<00:03:16.500> dirt<00:03:17.269> dirt<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.449> what<00:03:18.629> causes<00:03:19.049> wear

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
attract dirt dirt is what causes wear

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.890 
attract dirt dirt is what causes wear
and<00:03:19.440> tear<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:21.120> want<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.389> get<00:03:21.510> rid<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.780> that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
and tear so we want to get rid of that

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.979 
and tear so we want to get rid of that
the<00:03:22.049> best<00:03:22.199> we<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:23.329> all<00:03:24.329> right<00:03:24.480> now<00:03:24.629> let's<00:03:24.930> move

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
the best we can all right now let's move

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.479 
the best we can all right now let's move
on<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.500> rear<00:03:25.650> derailleur<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.220> take<00:03:26.459> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
on to the rear derailleur and take a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.089 
on to the rear derailleur and take a
look<00:03:26.730> at<00:03:26.849> that<00:03:27.560> here's<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.709> rear<00:03:28.889> derailleur

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
look at that here's the rear derailleur

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.460 
look at that here's the rear derailleur
and<00:03:29.730> again<00:03:30.239> an<00:03:30.359> easy<00:03:30.480> way<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.780> find<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.139> pivot

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and again an easy way to find the pivot

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.960 
and again an easy way to find the pivot
points<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.889> just<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.220> shift<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.609> back<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
points is just to shift it back and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.979 
points is just to shift it back and
forth<00:03:33.180> but<00:03:33.389> you<00:03:33.480> can<00:03:33.599> see<00:03:33.750> I'm<00:03:33.870> pretty

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
do too is I also dampen the tire like

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.170 
do too is I also dampen the tire like
this<00:04:49.169> Nate<00:04:49.620> reason<00:04:50.190> I'm<00:04:50.310> doing<00:04:50.490> this<00:04:50.850> I<00:04:51.030> mean

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
this Nate reason I'm doing this I mean

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.520 
this Nate reason I'm doing this I mean
it<00:04:51.270> looks<00:04:51.419> like<00:04:51.479> it's<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.750> really<00:04:51.990> grotty<00:04:52.229> thing

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
it looks like it's a really grotty thing

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.020 
it looks like it's a really grotty thing
to<00:04:52.620> do<00:04:52.770> why<00:04:52.979> would<00:04:53.039> you<00:04:53.220> want<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.490> do<00:04:53.580> that

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
to do why would you want to do that

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.689 
to do why would you want to do that
it's<00:04:54.750> because<00:04:55.110> I<00:04:55.139> can<00:04:55.560> look<00:04:55.800> now<00:04:56.070> at<00:04:56.550> the

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
it's because I can look now at the

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.540 
it's because I can look now at the
surface<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.330> tire<00:04:57.570> very<00:04:58.410> clearly<00:04:58.979> and

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
surface of this tire very clearly and

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.120 
surface of this tire very clearly and
see<00:04:59.789> if<00:04:59.880> there<00:05:00.060> any<00:05:00.210> nicks<00:05:00.539> in<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:00.930> if<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.830> picked

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
see if there any nicks in it if I picked

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.790 
see if there any nicks in it if I picked
up<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.400> shard<00:05:02.729> of<00:05:02.940> glass<00:05:03.080> thorn<00:05:04.080> something<00:05:04.650> like

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
up a shard of glass thorn something like

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.740 
up a shard of glass thorn something like
that<00:05:05.180> find<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.330> problem<00:05:06.600> before<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.229> happens

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
that find the problem before it happens

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.650 
that find the problem before it happens
just<00:05:09.750> go<00:05:09.930> around<00:05:10.229> and<00:05:10.410> clean<00:05:10.500> everything<00:05:11.039> up<00:05:11.160> I

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
just go around and clean everything up I

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.879 
just go around and clean everything up I
think<00:05:12.660> you<00:05:12.720> can<00:05:12.870> see<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:13.260> on<00:05:13.470> this<00:05:13.590> camera

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
think you can see this on this camera

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.180 
think you can see this on this camera
but<00:05:14.190> one<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:14.970> things<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.389> just<00:05:15.660> uncovered

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
but one of the things I just uncovered
