oil treatment on my skin cancer as you

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.629 
oil treatment on my skin cancer as you
can<00:00:12.179> see<00:00:12.420> well<00:00:12.900> there's<00:00:13.170> not<00:00:13.650> much<00:00:13.710> evolution

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
can see well there's not much evolution

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.740 
can see well there's not much evolution
happening<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> scab<00:00:16.859> has<00:00:17.789> gone<00:00:18.180> from<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
happening the scab has gone from the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.650 
happening the scab has gone from the
leftmost<00:00:19.170> part<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.400> lesion<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.449> on

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
leftmost part of the lesion but not on

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.189 
leftmost part of the lesion but not on
the<00:00:21.779> rightmost<00:00:21.960> part<00:00:23.330> skin<00:00:24.330> cancer<00:00:24.720> after

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the rightmost part skin cancer after

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.800 
the rightmost part skin cancer after
it's<00:00:25.609> been<00:00:26.609> surgically<00:00:27.090> removed<00:00:27.570> or

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's been surgically removed or

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's been surgically removed or
otherwise<00:00:29.840> incised<00:00:30.840> or<00:00:31.669> suffered<00:00:32.669> any<00:00:32.969> kind

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
otherwise incised or suffered any kind

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.830 
otherwise incised or suffered any kind
of<00:00:33.300> wound<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:34.079> creates<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.739> scab<00:00:35.070> which

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
of wound just creates a scab which

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.060 
of wound just creates a scab which
thickens<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.050> thickens<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.649> eventually

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
thickens and thickens and eventually

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
thickens and thickens and eventually
falls<00:00:38.309> off<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.860> it<00:00:40.860> never<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.370> heals<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
falls off but it never actually heals so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.990 
falls off but it never actually heals so
anyway<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> scab<00:00:43.590> has<00:00:43.890> fallen<00:00:44.430> off<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
anyway the scab has fallen off on the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.319 
anyway the scab has fallen off on the
left<00:00:45.180> side<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:46.129> not<00:00:47.129> seeing<00:00:47.640> much<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.239> an

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
left side I not seeing much of an

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.560 
left side I not seeing much of an
improvement<00:00:48.660> yet<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:50.329> there<00:00:51.329> might<00:00:51.539> be

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
improvement yet at all there might be

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.380 
improvement yet at all there might be
some<00:00:52.079> slight<00:00:52.230> modification<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
some slight modification of of the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
some slight modification of of the
lesion<00:00:54.750> itself<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.829> nothing<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
lesion itself but really nothing that I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.090 
lesion itself but really nothing that I
can<00:00:56.820> call<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.930> outright<00:00:58.320> improvement<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
can call an outright improvement so

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.290 
can call an outright improvement so
anyway<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.660> week<00:01:01.070> plus<00:01:02.300> while

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
anyway it's just one week plus while

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.299 
anyway it's just one week plus while
looking<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> Internet<00:01:04.500> while<00:01:04.710> why

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
looking up on the Internet while why

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700 
looking up on the Internet while why
this<00:01:05.729> would<00:01:05.909> work<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.680> work

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this would work and how it would work

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.730 
this would work and how it would work
well<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.820> came<00:01:09.330> across<00:01:09.450> information<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.500> it's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
well I came across information that it's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
well I came across information that it's
that<00:01:10.950> cannabidiol<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:12.270> does<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.840> work<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that cannabidiol that does the work so

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.469 
that cannabidiol that does the work so
you<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> pure<00:01:15.060> cannabidiol

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you know kind of be the pure cannabidiol

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.440 
you know kind of be the pure cannabidiol
would<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.830> ideal<00:01:17.220> item<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.270> with

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
would be the ideal item to do this with

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.310 
would be the ideal item to do this with
but<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.560> also<00:01:19.830> extremely<00:01:20.280> expensive<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
but it's also extremely expensive and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.399 
but it's also extremely expensive and
you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.490> may<00:01:23.490> not<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.909> available<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:25.080> pure

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you know may not be available as a pure

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.660 
you know may not be available as a pure
oil<00:01:25.650> or<00:01:26.100> something<00:01:26.700> applicable<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.810> anyway

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
oil or something applicable so anyway

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.620 
oil or something applicable so anyway
the<00:01:30.110> hemp<00:01:31.110> oil<00:01:31.380> contains<00:01:32.070> cannabidiol<00:01:32.880> with

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the hemp oil contains cannabidiol with

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.419 
which is what is active by taking it
internally<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.780> other<00:02:07.649> molecule<00:02:08.160> would<00:02:08.369> be

internally that other molecule would be
cleaved<00:02:08.879> by<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.209> digestive<00:02:09.899> system<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.800> it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
cleaved by the digestive system but it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.089 
cleaved by the digestive system but it
seems<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.340> cleaving<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.360> beforehand

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
seems that cleaving it beforehand

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.739 
seems that cleaving it beforehand
through<00:02:13.489> eating<00:02:13.879> would<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.269> required<00:02:14.659> for

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
through eating would be required for

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.619 
through eating would be required for
activity<00:02:15.409> on<00:02:15.939> topical<00:02:16.939> application<00:02:17.510> like

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
activity on topical application like

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.289 
activity on topical application like
this<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:17.959> I've<00:02:18.019> done<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.530> my<00:02:18.650> oil<00:02:19.299> it's

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
this so I've done this to my oil it's

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.890 
this so I've done this to my oil it's
slightly<00:02:20.989> brownish<00:02:21.439> now<00:02:22.180> I'll<00:02:23.180> show<00:02:23.719> you<00:02:23.749> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
slightly brownish now I'll show you the
