watching<00:03:51.850> this<00:03:52.150> movie<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.570> thought<00:03:52.900> of

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
watching this movie I thought of

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.860 
watching this movie I thought of
Halloween<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.190> way<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:55.540> guy<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
Halloween like the way the guy in the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.650 
Halloween like the way the guy in the
mask<00:03:55.989> ear<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:57.100> way<00:03:57.220> he<00:03:57.400> stalks<00:03:57.790> Liv<00:03:58.090> Tyler<00:03:58.510> is

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
mask ear the way he stalks Liv Tyler is

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.530 
mask ear the way he stalks Liv Tyler is
so<00:03:58.870> reminiscent<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.560> michael<00:04:00.010> myers<00:04:00.160> um<00:04:00.540> him

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
so reminiscent of michael myers um him

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.880 
so reminiscent of michael myers um him
in<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.720> background<00:04:01.959> kind<00:04:02.350> of<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.590> shape

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
in the background kind of like a shape

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.770 
in the background kind of like a shape
you<00:04:03.160> don't<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:04.060> see<00:04:04.239> him<00:04:04.359> there<00:04:04.540> but<00:04:04.690> you

true<00:05:37.640> events<00:05:37.669> I<00:05:38.060> don't<00:05:38.330> think<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:38.570> actually<00:05:38.690> is

I<00:05:39.140> think<00:05:39.200> that's<00:05:39.500> just<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.800> little<00:05:40.070> tag<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.580> make

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
I think that's just a little tag to make

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.450 
I think that's just a little tag to make
the<00:05:40.850> movie<00:05:41.410> more<00:05:42.410> appealing<00:05:42.770> to<00:05:43.190> the

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
the movie more appealing to the

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.370 
the movie more appealing to the
generation<00:05:43.820> or<00:05:44.060> whatever<00:05:44.300> anything<00:05:45.169> with<00:05:45.290> the

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
generation or whatever anything with the

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.870 
generation or whatever anything with the
true<00:05:45.530> story<00:05:45.740> attached<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.130> it<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.730> know

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
true story attached to it you know

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.670 
true story attached to it you know
people<00:05:47.690> are<00:05:47.840> going<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:48.020> go<00:05:48.110> see<00:05:48.140> it<00:05:48.350> because

people are going to go see it because

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.409 
people are going to go see it because
stuff<00:05:49.100> that's<00:05:49.340> true<00:05:49.580> is<00:05:49.730> a<00:05:49.760> lot<00:05:49.970> more<00:05:50.120> scary

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
stuff that's true is a lot more scary

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.510 
stuff that's true is a lot more scary
which<00:05:50.930> I<00:05:51.169> think<00:05:51.680> that's<00:05:52.070> why<00:05:52.220> they<00:05:52.370> did<00:05:52.490> that

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
which I think that's why they did that

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.999 
which I think that's why they did that

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.579 
this movie feels like
it<00:05:54.219> could<00:05:54.400> really<00:05:54.639> happen<00:05:54.939> so<00:05:55.779> once<00:05:56.469> again

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:56.589
