public release of iOS 4.3 aside from
that<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.150> going<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.360> go<00:02:20.420> over<00:02:20.540> what<00:02:20.930> I

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
that I'm just going to go over what I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.250 
that I'm just going to go over what I
think<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> ipad<00:02:21.920> 2<00:02:22.190> will<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.850> do<00:02:23.840> not

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
think the ipad 2 will have I do not

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.790 
think the ipad 2 will have I do not
think<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.709> will<00:02:24.920> have<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> Retina<00:02:25.610> display<00:02:26.270> or<00:02:26.569> a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
think it will have a Retina display or a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.110 
think it will have a Retina display or a
display<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:27.830> has<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> better<00:02:28.850> resolution

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
display that has a better resolution

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.050 
display that has a better resolution
than<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.900> current<00:02:30.410> ipad<00:02:30.920> right<00:02:31.160> now<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.640> think

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
than the current ipad right now I think

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.720 
than the current ipad right now I think
that<00:02:32.450> will<00:02:32.600> stay<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> same<00:02:33.580> there<00:02:34.580> are<00:02:34.640> also

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
that will stay the same there are also

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.290 
that will stay the same there are also
reports<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.420> having<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.870> USB<00:02:36.800> port<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.430> also

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
reports of it having a USB port and also

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.670 
reports of it having a USB port and also
a<00:02:38.709> an<00:02:39.709> SD<00:02:40.640> card<00:02:40.670> slot<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.569> think<00:02:42.050> both<00:02:42.319> of<00:02:42.350> those

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
a an SD card slot I think both of those

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.729 
a an SD card slot I think both of those
are<00:02:42.920> false<00:02:43.360> there<00:02:44.360> happens<00:02:44.780> reports<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.590> a

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
are false there happens reports of a

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.160 
are false there happens reports of a
actual<00:02:46.370> mystery<00:02:46.850> port<00:02:47.239> on<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.569> side<00:02:47.780> are<00:02:48.019> on

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
actual mystery port on the side are on

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.040 
actual mystery port on the side are on
the<00:02:48.290> top<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.830> ipad<00:02:49.220> now<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.060> think<00:02:50.720> that

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
the top of the ipad now I think that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.350 
the top of the ipad now I think that
port<00:02:51.380> could<00:02:51.830> be<00:02:52.069> for<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.519> news<00:02:52.730> Thunderbolt

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
port could be for the news Thunderbolt

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.140 
port could be for the news Thunderbolt
connection<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.470> was<00:02:54.680> recently<00:02:55.190> released<00:02:55.730> in

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
connection that was recently released in

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.900 
connection that was recently released in
the<00:02:56.330> new<00:02:56.720> macbook<00:02:56.989> pros<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.280> think<00:02:58.580> that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
the new macbook pros so I think that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.080 
the new macbook pros so I think that
that<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> strong<00:02:59.900> possibility<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:01.090> they

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
that is a strong possibility that they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.570 
that is a strong possibility that they
will<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.840> new<00:03:03.019> Thunderbolt<00:03:03.709> port<00:03:04.069> on

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
will have that new Thunderbolt port on

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.979 
will have that new Thunderbolt port on
the<00:03:05.150> iPad<00:03:06.080> second<00:03:06.620> generation<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.630> also

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
the iPad second generation so I also

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.780 
the iPad second generation so I also
think<00:03:09.290> there<00:03:09.500> will<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.769> front<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.489> rear

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
think there will be a front and rear

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.600 
think there will be a front and rear
facing<00:03:11.090> camera<00:03:11.720> on<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.870> ipad<00:03:12.290> 2<00:03:12.590> however<00:03:13.430> i

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
facing camera on the ipad 2 however i

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.220 
facing camera on the ipad 2 however i
think<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.030> resolution<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.660> both<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.110> those

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
think the resolution of both of those

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.020 
think the resolution of both of those
cameras<00:03:15.739> will<00:03:15.980> be<00:03:16.010> similar<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:16.850> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
cameras will be similar to that of the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.349 
cameras will be similar to that of the
ipod<00:03:17.450> touch<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:17.959> not<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.980> iphone<00:03:19.430> 4<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.299> i

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
ipod touch and not of the iphone 4 so i

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.000 
ipod touch and not of the iphone 4 so i
think<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.660> front<00:03:20.930> camera<00:03:21.140> will<00:03:21.470> be<00:03:21.590> somewhere

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
think the front camera will be somewhere

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.280 
think the front camera will be somewhere
around<00:03:22.040> point<00:03:22.579> 5<00:03:22.880> megapixel<00:03:23.690> which<00:03:23.870> is<00:03:23.989> really

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
around point 5 megapixel which is really

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.530 
around point 5 megapixel which is really
horrible<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.609> back<00:03:25.790> camera<00:03:26.120> will<00:03:26.420> be

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
horrible and the back camera will be

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.560 
horrible and the back camera will be
somewhere<00:03:26.870> around<00:03:26.930> 1<00:03:27.320> megapixel<00:03:27.760> or<00:03:28.760> 1.3

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
somewhere around 1 megapixel or 1.3

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.599 
somewhere around 1 megapixel or 1.3
megapixels<00:03:30.260> but<00:03:30.530> either<00:03:30.799> way<00:03:31.070> that's<00:03:31.280> still

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
megapixels but either way that's still

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.060 
megapixels but either way that's still
pretty<00:03:32.030> bad<00:03:32.480> but<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.410> mean<00:03:33.709> you're<00:03:33.829> not<00:03:33.920> going

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
pretty bad but I mean you're not going

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.530 
pretty bad but I mean you're not going
to<00:03:34.130> be<00:03:34.190> walking<00:03:34.370> around<00:03:34.609> with<00:03:34.790> your<00:03:34.880> iPad<00:03:35.299> just

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
to be walking around with your iPad just

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.750 
to be walking around with your iPad just
randomly<00:03:35.959> taking<00:03:36.290> pictures<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.739> things<00:03:37.100> it'll

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
randomly taking pictures of things it'll

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.849 
randomly taking pictures of things it'll
only<00:03:37.820> be<00:03:38.090> for<00:03:38.120> basically<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:39.049> like<00:03:39.140> FaceTime

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
only be for basically just like FaceTime

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.039 
only be for basically just like FaceTime
conversations<00:03:40.760> where<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:41.660> have<00:03:41.840> to

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
conversations where you just have to

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.860 
conversations where you just have to
record<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.620> front<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.180> sometimes<00:03:44.180> also<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
record the front and sometimes also the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.680 
record the front and sometimes also the
back<00:03:45.049> out<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.500> back<00:03:45.680> camera<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:47.390> that

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
back out of the back camera so that

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.710 
back out of the back camera so that
covers<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.590> part<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.280> also<00:03:49.730> think<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.269> will

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
covers that part I also think that will

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.319 
covers that part I also think that will
the<00:03:51.140> screen<00:03:51.530> despite<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.489> fact<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.090> will

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
the screen despite the fact that it will

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.110 
the screen despite the fact that it will
not<00:03:53.540> have<00:03:53.959> that<00:03:53.989> Retina<00:03:54.680> display<00:03:55.130> I<00:03:55.370> think

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
not have that Retina display I think

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.180 
not have that Retina display I think
that<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.390> will<00:03:56.510> most<00:03:56.840> likely<00:03:57.200> feature<00:03:57.709> some

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that it will most likely feature some

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.620 
that it will most likely feature some
kind<00:03:58.579> of<00:03:59.079> sunlight<00:04:00.079> resistant<00:04:00.890> material<00:04:01.819> so

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
kind of sunlight resistant material so

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.080 
kind of sunlight resistant material so
that<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:03.500> will<00:04:03.650> not<00:04:03.829> get<00:04:04.069> that<00:04:04.220> glare<00:04:04.609> on<00:04:04.640> it

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
that you will not get that glare on it

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.990 
that you will not get that glare on it
so<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.769> strong<00:04:07.190> possibility<00:04:07.220> as<00:04:07.970> well

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
so that is a strong possibility as well

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.319 
so that is a strong possibility as well
we<00:04:08.930> will<00:04:09.170> see<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.470> dual-core<00:04:10.310> processor<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.209> it

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
we will see a dual-core processor in it

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.750 
we will see a dual-core processor in it
at<00:04:11.959> least<00:04:12.169> I<00:04:12.320> hope<00:04:12.500> we<00:04:12.709> will<00:04:12.919> that<00:04:13.489> would<00:04:13.639> be<00:04:13.729> a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
at least I hope we will that would be a

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
at least I hope we will that would be a
really<00:04:13.970> nice<00:04:14.180> improved

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
really nice improved

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.800 
really nice improved
and<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.620> will<00:04:15.770> only<00:04:16.010> get<00:04:16.280> an<00:04:16.370> upgrade<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.810> 512

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
and it will only get an upgrade to 512

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.199 
and it will only get an upgrade to 512
megabytes<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.500> RAM<00:04:18.799> which<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.700> actually<00:04:19.940> what

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
megabytes of RAM which is actually what

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.970 
megabytes of RAM which is actually what
the<00:04:20.329> iphone<00:04:20.720> 4<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.320> which<00:04:21.530> is<00:04:21.709> probably

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
the iphone 4 is that which is probably

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.260 
the iphone 4 is that which is probably
one<00:04:22.220> of<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> main<00:04:22.520> reasons<00:04:22.910> why<00:04:23.030> I'm<00:04:23.120> not

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
one of the main reasons why I'm not

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.110 
one of the main reasons why I'm not
going<00:04:23.419> to<00:04:23.480> buy<00:04:23.660> it<00:04:23.690> because<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:25.400> don't<00:04:26.000> know<00:04:26.060> it

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
going to buy it because I don't know it

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.000 
going to buy it because I don't know it
just<00:04:26.150> seems<00:04:26.300> pointless<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.990> do<00:04:27.260> that<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.620> don't

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
just seems pointless to do that I don't

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.260 
just seems pointless to do that I don't
know<00:04:28.100> why<00:04:28.220> they<00:04:28.400> wouldn't<00:04:28.610> just<00:04:28.790> upgrade<00:04:29.150> it

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
know why they wouldn't just upgrade it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.879 
know why they wouldn't just upgrade it
to<00:04:29.300> one<00:04:29.600> gig<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.930> ram<00:04:29.960> which<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:30.470> probably<00:04:30.710> what

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
to one gig of ram which is probably what

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.340 
to one gig of ram which is probably what
the<00:04:31.010> iphone<00:04:31.400> five<00:04:31.700> will<00:04:31.730> have<00:04:32.240> anyway<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:33.320> I

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
the iphone five will have anyway so I

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.750 
the iphone five will have anyway so I
don't<00:04:33.590> understand<00:04:34.010> why<00:04:34.070> they<00:04:34.220> don't<00:04:34.340> just<00:04:34.460> do

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
don't understand why they don't just do

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.240 
don't understand why they don't just do
that<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.970> would<00:04:35.240> make<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.360> lot<00:04:35.690> more<00:04:35.750> sense<00:04:36.320> so

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
that I would make a lot more sense so

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.909 
that I would make a lot more sense so
that's<00:04:37.700> basically<00:04:37.850> all<00:04:38.180> i<00:04:38.389> have<00:04:38.810> for<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.440> ipad

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
that's basically all i have for the ipad

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.920 
that's basically all i have for the ipad
second<00:04:40.400> generation<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.060> mean<00:04:41.510> it's<00:04:41.660> not<00:04:41.780> going

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
second generation I mean it's not going

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.480 
second generation I mean it's not going
to<00:04:42.020> be<00:04:42.110> much<00:04:42.290> of<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.560> change<00:04:42.830> it's<00:04:43.130> just<00:04:43.310> going

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
to be much of a change it's just going

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.909 
to be much of a change it's just going
to<00:04:43.520> be<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.730> couple<00:04:44.570> simple<00:04:44.930> upgrades<00:04:45.560> aside

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
to be a couple simple upgrades aside

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.560 
to be a couple simple upgrades aside
from<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.250> camera<00:04:46.639> that<00:04:46.940> will<00:04:47.120> be<00:04:47.270> kind<00:04:47.480> of

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
from the camera that will be kind of

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.990 
from the camera that will be kind of
cool<00:04:47.840> but<00:04:48.710> other<00:04:48.980> than<00:04:49.220> that<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.430> mean<00:04:49.550> it's<00:04:49.820> not

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
cool but other than that I mean it's not

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.370 
cool but other than that I mean it's not
going<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.210> be<00:04:50.300> anything<00:04:50.570> that's<00:04:50.900> going<00:04:51.260> to

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
going to be anything that's going to

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.159 
going to be anything that's going to
surprise<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.520> whole<00:04:52.940> lot<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.150> people<00:04:53.600> that's

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
surprise a whole lot of people that's

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.870 
surprise a whole lot of people that's
just<00:04:54.380> what<00:04:54.560> I<00:04:54.650> think<00:04:54.919> is<00:04:55.010> going<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.190> happen<00:04:55.250> on

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
just what I think is going to happen on

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.540 
just what I think is going to happen on
march<00:04:56.510> second<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.230> that's<00:04:58.010> what<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.280> think<00:04:58.490> is

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
march second and that's what I think is

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.070 
march second and that's what I think is
going<00:04:58.669> to<00:04:58.730> happen<00:04:58.790> as<00:04:59.180> far<00:04:59.330> as<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.630> ipad

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
going to happen as far as the ipad

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.500 
going to happen as far as the ipad
second<00:05:00.650> generation<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.790> now<00:05:02.060> I'm<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:02.419> going

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
second generation so now I'm just going

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.720 
second generation so now I'm just going
to<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.780> ahead<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.050> tell<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.590> guys<00:05:03.830> what's

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
to go ahead and tell you guys what's

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.780 
to go ahead and tell you guys what's
been<00:05:04.940> happening<00:05:05.360> with<00:05:05.390> me<00:05:05.690> today<00:05:06.280> hi<00:05:07.280> its<00:05:07.580> kind

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
been happening with me today hi its kind

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.190 
been happening with me today hi its kind
of<00:05:07.850> her<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.030> see<00:05:08.180> me<00:05:08.300> because<00:05:08.510> like<00:05:08.540> son<00:05:09.050> is

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
of her to see me because like son is

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.510 
of her to see me because like son is
right<00:05:09.500> there<00:05:09.800> pretty<00:05:10.400> bright<00:05:10.669> so<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:13.250> main

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
right there pretty bright so the main

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.850 
right there pretty bright so the main
part<00:05:13.940> of<00:05:14.090> my<00:05:14.240> day<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:15.110> there's<00:05:15.350> snow<00:05:15.680> on<00:05:15.710> the

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
part of my day so there's snow on the

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.520 
part of my day so there's snow on the
ground<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.460> as<00:05:16.760> you<00:05:16.880> guys<00:05:16.940> saw<00:05:17.270> earlier<00:05:17.690> still

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
ground and as you guys saw earlier still

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.100 
ground and as you guys saw earlier still
snow<00:05:18.830> on<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.040> ground<00:05:19.070> so<00:05:19.850> I<00:05:20.090> thought<00:05:20.870> it<00:05:21.050> was

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
snow on the ground so I thought it was

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.950 
snow on the ground so I thought it was
going<00:05:21.260> to<00:05:21.320> snow<00:05:21.470> last<00:05:21.800> night<00:05:21.919> and<00:05:22.490> again<00:05:23.450> and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
going to snow last night and again and

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.250 
going to snow last night and again and
we'd<00:05:24.140> be<00:05:24.290> out<00:05:24.380> of<00:05:24.410> school<00:05:24.650> again<00:05:25.190> but

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
we'd be out of school again but

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.140 
we'd be out of school again but
unfortunately<00:05:27.260> it<00:05:27.380> didn't<00:05:27.710> snow<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.310> I

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
unfortunately it didn't snow and I
