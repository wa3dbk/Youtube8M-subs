00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.539 
you want to do you can write a parameter
C<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.090> write<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:39.200> you<00:03:40.200> want<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.680> make<00:03:40.890> sure<00:03:40.920> if

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
C and write it you want to make sure if

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.390 
C and write it you want to make sure if
all<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.790> parameters<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.860> successfully<00:03:43.860> then

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
all the parameters a successfully then

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.220 
all the parameters a successfully then
you<00:03:44.580> can<00:03:44.849> withstand<00:03:45.450> inside

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
you can withstand inside

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.490 
you can withstand inside
n<00:03:47.510> yeah<00:03:48.510> here<00:03:49.019> we<00:03:49.170> go<00:03:49.819> then<00:03:50.819> is<00:03:51.060> finished<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
n yeah here we go then is finished the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.950 
n yeah here we go then is finished the
computer
