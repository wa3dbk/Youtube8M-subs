the<00:01:57.060> bottom<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.569> this<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.679> what

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the bottom of this so you can see what

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.010 
the bottom of this so you can see what
it<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.989> make<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.349> every<00:02:01.890> morning<00:02:03.020> with

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
it is and I make this every morning with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.820 
it is and I make this every morning with
some<00:02:04.200> traveling

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.550 

in<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.520> juicer<00:02:08.910> gets<00:02:09.150> a<00:02:09.300> whole<00:02:09.630> bunch<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.229> juice

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
in my juicer gets a whole bunch of juice

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860 
in my juicer gets a whole bunch of juice
out<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.190> produce<00:02:11.460> but<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.150> will<00:02:12.210> say<00:02:12.390> it's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
out of the produce but I will say it's

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.500 
out of the produce but I will say it's
slower<00:02:13.470> than<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.770> Breville<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.550> lot<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.210> people

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
slower than the Breville a lot of people

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.610 
slower than the Breville a lot of people
like<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.840> Breville<00:02:16.610> because<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:17.790> faster

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
like the Breville because it's faster

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.680 
like the Breville because it's faster
but<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.830> creates<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.730> juice<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
but this creates more juice and the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.990 
but this creates more juice and the
juice<00:02:21.720> last<00:02:22.260> longer<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.890> doesn't<00:02:23.220> oxidize<00:02:23.430> as

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
juice last longer it doesn't oxidize as

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.120 
juice last longer it doesn't oxidize as
fast

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.560 

we're<00:02:31.550> going<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.730> put<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.090> little<00:02:32.330> bit<00:02:32.450> of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
we're going to put in a little bit of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:41.450 
we're going to put in a little bit of
the<00:02:32.660> gingers<00:02:33.140> for<00:02:33.560> far<00:02:33.830> more<00:02:37.030> ginger

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.230 

I<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.320> use<00:03:01.440> organic<00:03:01.710> produce<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.880> at<00:03:03.120> all
