00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it in the back I think that it's kind of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
it in the back I think that it's kind of
a<00:01:28.320> fun<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.460> come<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.060> demonstrate<00:01:30.180> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
a fun way to come and demonstrate this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.240 
a fun way to come and demonstrate this
technique<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.229> otherwise<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.100> might

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
technique because otherwise it might

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.140 
technique because otherwise it might
take<00:01:32.549> me<00:01:32.810> 20<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.990> 40<00:01:34.320> matches<00:01:34.470> maybe<00:01:35.430> 20<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> 30

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
take me 20 to 40 matches maybe 20 to 30

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
take me 20 to 40 matches maybe 20 to 30
matches<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.689> depends<00:01:37.079> how<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.650> from

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
