00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.010
 preheat your oven at 90 Â° separate 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.090
 carefully the whites of the yellows 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.330
 they must not have traces of 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.110
 yellow otherwise they do not show well 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.420
 when the eggs are at temperature 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.980
 ambient the less fragile day it is 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.320
 so easier to separate the whites 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.030
 yellows without breaking them 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.080
 using an electric mixer 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.670
 the whites by incorporating 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.670
 gradually half of the sugar 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.530
 continue to beat to squeeze 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.130
 whites then gradually add the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.130
 remaining sugar 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.520
 the meringue must be firm enough smooth 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.020
 and brilliant 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.850
 you can add at that moment the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.210
 flavorings or food coloring your 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.210
 choice 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.900
 put the meringue in a pocket 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.490
 socket deposited in the form that you 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.790
 want the meringue on a buttered plate 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.790
 and floured 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.110
 if you wish to have a cooking 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.850
 uniform of meringues 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.240
 it's best to make them from the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240
 same size 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.250
 cook the meringues for 30 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.660
 minutes to one hour depending on their size 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.450
 and if you want it to be still 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.650
 melting inside here we made them 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.650
 run away for 40 minutes
