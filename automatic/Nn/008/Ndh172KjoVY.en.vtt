00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
footage which I actually like a lot

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.170 
footage which I actually like a lot
better<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:35.890> personally<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.610> think<00:02:36.790> it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
better because personally I think it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.660 
better because personally I think it
looks<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.780> lot<00:02:38.110> better<00:02:38.500> um<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.310> design<00:02:39.580> just

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
looks a lot better um the design just

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.070 
looks a lot better um the design just
looks<00:02:39.760> better<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.090> want<00:02:40.360> rather<00:02:40.510> than<00:02:40.660> having<00:02:40.900> a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
looks better I want rather than having a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.170 
looks better I want rather than having a
flap<00:02:41.380> going<00:02:41.710> everywhere<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:42.910> think<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
flap going everywhere I just think it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.800 
flap going everywhere I just think it
looks<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.510> lot<00:02:43.990> nicer<00:02:44.370> smoother<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.580> better

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
looks a lot nicer smoother and better

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.630 
looks a lot nicer smoother and better

them I could wear these out normally and
it'd<00:03:28.630> be<00:03:28.780> fine<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.140> just<00:03:29.170> has<00:03:29.740> some<00:03:30.040> cosmetic

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
it'd be fine it just has some cosmetic

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.310 
it'd be fine it just has some cosmetic
things<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.270> could<00:03:31.570> be<00:03:31.660> easily<00:03:31.690> fixed

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
things that could be easily fixed
