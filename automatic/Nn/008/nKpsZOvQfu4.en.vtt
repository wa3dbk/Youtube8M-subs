anything a long long time ago I was

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.740 
anything a long long time ago I was
brought<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.710> Lego<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.820> then<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.420> many

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
brought up on Lego and then for many

many years take things apart bit later
on<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> stopped<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:30.900> together<00:00:31.050> again<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
on I stopped it back together again and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.780 
on I stopped it back together again and
I<00:00:31.740> kind<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> ended<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.250> here<00:00:32.489> actually

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
I kind of ended up here actually

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.760 
I kind of ended up here actually
building<00:00:33.270> stuff<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.600> scratch<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.200> think<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
building stuff from scratch I think the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.620 
building stuff from scratch I think the
first<00:00:34.980> thing<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.309> made<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.700> any<00:00:35.820> note<00:00:36.090> really

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
first thing I made of any note really

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.119 
first thing I made of any note really
you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.230> sort<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> epitomizes<00:00:37.950> my

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you know sort of epitomizes my

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.250 
you know sort of epitomizes my
philosophy<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.910> course<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.570> casual<00:00:39.930> over

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
philosophy was of course the casual over

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.410 
philosophy was of course the casual over
the<00:00:40.440> driving<00:00:40.710> sofa<00:00:41.340> car<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.969> until<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.360> point

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the driving sofa car up until that point

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
the driving sofa car up until that point
hadn't<00:00:43.050> been<00:00:43.170> done<00:00:43.320> before<00:00:43.379> strangely<00:00:44.309> but

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
hadn't been done before strangely but

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.670 
hadn't been done before strangely but
actually<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.840> kind<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.320> more<00:00:46.500> about

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
actually it's kind of it was more about

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
actually it's kind of it was more about
could<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.640> build<00:00:47.879> something<00:00:48.120> within<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
could I build something within the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.020 
could I build something within the
confines<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.680> law<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.430> actually<00:00:50.879> would

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
confines of the law but actually would

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.520 
confines of the law but actually would
never<00:00:51.239> ever<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.629> expected<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> road

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
never ever be expected to be on the road

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
never ever be expected to be on the road
and<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> course<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> actually<00:00:53.850> built<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and of course one that actually built it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.729 
and of course one that actually built it
I've<00:00:54.510> had<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.110> much<00:00:55.260> fun<00:00:55.320> driving

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I've had it was so much fun driving

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.189 
I've had it was so much fun driving
around<00:00:56.219> town<00:00:56.460> everybody<00:00:56.820> loves<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.480> sort

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
around town everybody loves it so sort

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
around town everybody loves it so sort
of<00:00:58.230> seeing<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> world<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.980> Prozac<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.609> quite

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
of seeing the world on Prozac it's quite

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.009 
of seeing the world on Prozac it's quite
a<00:00:59.850> special<00:01:00.239> thing<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:02.539> when<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.629> comes<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
a special thing to do when it comes to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.840 
a special thing to do when it comes to
coming<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.799> ideas<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.760> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
coming up with ideas where all this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
coming up with ideas where all this
creativeness<00:01:06.270> comes<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.110> it's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
creativeness comes from like this it's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
creativeness comes from like this it's
just<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.890> pick<00:01:08.159> up<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.430> stuff<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> ether<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
just I pick up on stuff in the ether it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
just I pick up on stuff in the ether it
sounds<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:09.990> weird<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:11.010> kind<00:01:11.070> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
sounds a bit weird but it's kind of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
sounds a bit weird but it's kind of
there's<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.610> kinds<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> little<00:01:12.150> things<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
there's all kinds of little things a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.660 
there's all kinds of little things a
little<00:01:12.810> stimulus<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.530> sort<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.430> kind

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
little stimulus and it sort of you kind

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
little stimulus and it sort of you kind
of<00:01:14.729> packaging<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> way<00:01:15.479> perhaps<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
of packaging the way perhaps and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920 
of packaging the way perhaps and
eventually<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.009> kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.030> mold<00:01:18.270> together<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
eventually I kind of mold together and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
eventually I kind of mold together and
it<00:01:19.020> sounds<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:19.560> strange<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.100> starts<00:01:20.400> very

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it sounds very strange it starts very

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.890 
it sounds very strange it starts very
fuzzy<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> kind<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.479> end<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.720> with

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
fuzzy and then you kind of end up with

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
fuzzy and then you kind of end up with
these<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:22.020> sort<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.740> forms<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.520> again

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
these little sort of forms and again

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
these little sort of forms and again
something<00:01:23.939> pop<00:01:24.240> there's<00:01:24.509> an<00:01:24.630> idea<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> it's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
something pop there's an idea and it's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.749 
something pop there's an idea and it's
usually<00:01:25.470> ridiculous<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> more

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
usually ridiculous but I make it more

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.520 
usually ridiculous but I make it more
fun<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.210> certainly<00:01:27.630> haven't<00:01:27.840> planned<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> fact
