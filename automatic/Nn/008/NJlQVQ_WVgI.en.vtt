 versions of windows been the stick 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 usb to do it we just need to download 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.969
 initially the iso for example the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 famous web site master where I am 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.680

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.280
 here I have already opened windows in this case 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.649
 8.1 already youth day 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.700
 clicking the downloads will take you to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.070
 post site in this case will be 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 we have to wait 35 seconds to you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.610
 then just click continue to go 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.299
 directly to the download link 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 see square 27 parts to download the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.640
 180 megabytes moon if you count that site up 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.030
 which they are strongly encouraged to download 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.439
 one every three hours a stuff will come out 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.420
 in fact very long to do I think that in 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.630
 description we will put you a link of ours 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.490
 with less party to download a little more 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.520
 great I think five or six 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.979
 now let's see with the entourage at 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.329
 instructions of what you need to do that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.390
 you must follow the letter so yes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.189
 perfectly installs the 32 version 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.470
 which we load already has office installed 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.470
 is the 64 version no 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 because they are two relays that have that 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.399
 we did it before and after me anyway 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.470
 I recommend if I want to download from the web 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.560
 master you have to click on this link 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.080
 here because if you haven't changed one 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.300
 parameter that on the computer that much 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.489
 the one in this guide will show you not 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.130
 allows you to download some sites from 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.840
 file hosting 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.880
 once you download the iso anyway 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.370
 just download another program 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.280
 that the classic from the mountains that everyone 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.569
 you know and in this case diamonds 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.519
 ultra because it has a very interface 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.049
 easy to use 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.060
 once downloaded you can 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.060
 quietly open 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.060
 here it is put a usb key 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.850
 empty preferably go up 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.890
 tools writes bootable images from 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.650
 usb click your dongle 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.930
 give a name click on the path of 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.880
 pictures and you have to give them the select 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.810
 of the iso you downloaded that you want 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.859
 install on the flash drive 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.989
 mainly after which it rewrites mbr 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.000
 because he must rewrite it otherwise than 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.299
 windows are law as for the regal 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.390
 viable format it and consequently it is 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:14.320
 included then remove the stuff above 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:17.019
 as ntfs filesystem because otherwise 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.310
 after tot of space life error and there vi 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.530
 finish the process 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.260
 give a name is a new name to the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.079
 stick and move forward 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.569
 wait until it ends after that 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.109
 just restart your computer 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.390
 select from boot minutes that I have f8 and 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.680
 click the flash drive or going to the al 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.299
 bios with canc or backspacer that would be 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.840
 proxies and select the key 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.700
 after which the game is installed 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.519
 been in order to install windows only 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.680
 but as formatting called 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.780
 computerized clean that is not 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.480
 possible to upgrade it must 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.230
 maybe to erase everything first 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.700
 installation with the key 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.030
 a 2002 task that I installed 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.250
 it took twenty minutes then on pc 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.250

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.650
 there is nothing else to tell you because it is one thing 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.769
