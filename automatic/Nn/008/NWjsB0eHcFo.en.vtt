00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
now is we're going to grab our half-inch

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.780 
now is we're going to grab our half-inch
impact<00:01:32.960> has<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> currently<00:01:34.860> has<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> 19

millimeter<00:01:36.229> six-point<00:01:37.229> socket<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
millimeter six-point socket on it you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.210 
millimeter six-point socket on it you
want<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> try<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> fitting

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
want to try to use this good a fitting

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
want to try to use this good a fitting
socket<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.600> try<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> prevent

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
socket as you can to try to prevent

rounding<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.640> inner<00:01:45.000> nut<00:01:45.950> okay<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.009> now

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
rounding on this inner nut okay so now

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.480 
rounding on this inner nut okay so now
that<00:01:47.909> she's<00:01:48.299> got<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.920> on<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that she's got that on there and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.469 
that she's got that on there and
actually<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:51.649> incorrect<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.280> 19<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
actually I'm incorrect it's not 19 it is

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.910 
actually I'm incorrect it's not 19 it is
a<00:01:58.520> 22<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.909> believe

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:12.520 

okay<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.659> a<00:02:06.970> 22<00:02:07.970> okay<00:02:11.050> hold<00:02:12.050> on<00:02:12.319> we'll

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
okay so it is a 22 okay hold on we'll

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.979 
okay so it is a 22 okay hold on we'll
get<00:02:12.680> there<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.069> go<00:02:13.190> now<00:02:13.580> we'll<00:02:13.790> stay<00:02:14.599> straight

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
get there we go now we'll stay straight

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.870 
get there we go now we'll stay straight
on<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.560> go<00:02:16.069> ahead<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.489> perfect<00:02:16.959> drop<00:02:18.880> it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
on it and go ahead and perfect drop it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.110 
on it and go ahead and perfect drop it
add

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.410 

okay<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.569> now<00:02:27.510> she<00:02:28.510> has<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.870> top<00:02:29.080> cap<00:02:29.410> off

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
okay so now she has the top cap off

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.059 
okay so now she has the top cap off
we'll<00:02:31.420> set<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> side<00:02:32.410> here<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
we'll set it to the side here in the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.030 
we'll set it to the side here in the
bucket<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:34.750> I'm<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.500> going<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> leave

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
bucket and now I'm just going to leave

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.330 
bucket and now I'm just going to leave
this<00:02:36.220> sucker<00:02:37.180> on<00:02:37.330> there<00:02:37.599> for<00:02:37.750> now<00:02:38.010> okay<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.069> now

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340

bottom of the cap surface when this is

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.880 
bottom of the cap surface when this is
installed<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.840> we<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:59.140> go<00:02:59.590> ahead<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.739> proceed

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
installed so we can go ahead and proceed

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.699 
installed so we can go ahead and proceed
on<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.459> next<00:03:00.700> step<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.180> disassembly<00:03:01.840> we're

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
on to the next step of disassembly we're

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.990 
on to the next step of disassembly we're
going<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.890> go<00:03:03.040> ahead<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.459> take<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.970> upper
