00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
these a month early so I mean when when

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.190 
these a month early so I mean when when
Nike<00:05:08.340> did<00:05:08.670> or<00:05:08.910> Jordan<00:05:09.270> Brand<00:05:09.390> did<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.900> flat

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
Nike did or Jordan Brand did the flat

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.990 
Nike did or Jordan Brand did the flat
when<00:05:10.350> they<00:05:10.470> flared<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:11.070> shoe<00:05:11.250> that's<00:05:11.490> when<00:05:11.730> I

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
when they flared this shoe that's when I

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.050 
when they flared this shoe that's when I
had<00:05:12.390> to<00:05:12.420> call<00:05:12.720> back<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:12.990> shoe<00:05:13.260> because<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.860> know

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
had to call back a shoe because you know

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.760 
had to call back a shoe because you know
major<00:05:15.060> problem<00:05:15.600> with<00:05:15.750> it<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.380> problem

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
major problem with it and the problem

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.720 
major problem with it and the problem
was<00:05:16.920> this<00:05:18.350> Japanese<00:05:19.350> flag<00:05:21.200> right<00:05:22.280> inside<00:05:23.280> as

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
was this Japanese flag right inside as

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.840 
was this Japanese flag right inside as
you<00:05:23.940> can<00:05:23.970> see<00:05:24.300> there<00:05:25.110> was<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.260> problem<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:26.010> guess

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
you can see there was a problem I guess

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.110 
you can see there was a problem I guess
Japanese<00:05:27.330> people<00:05:27.600> gotta<00:05:27.900> hold<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:29.580> news<00:05:29.790> or

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
Japanese people gotta hold the news or

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.400 
Japanese people gotta hold the news or
what<00:05:30.270> was<00:05:30.420> going<00:05:30.630> on<00:05:30.750> with<00:05:30.930> this<00:05:31.020> Jordan

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
what was going on with this Jordan

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.490 
what was going on with this Jordan
release<00:05:31.730> and<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:32.880> was<00:05:33.000> a<00:05:33.030> problem<00:05:33.510> so<00:05:33.540> Nike<00:05:34.350> had

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
release and it was a problem so Nike had

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.220 
release and it was a problem so Nike had
the<00:05:34.620> collar<00:05:34.860> back<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.400> flat<00:05:35.780> so<00:05:36.780> that<00:05:36.990> meant

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
the collar back and flat so that meant

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.990 
the collar back and flat so that meant
that<00:05:37.440> every<00:05:37.830> store<00:05:38.100> that<00:05:38.130> got<00:05:38.430> these<00:05:38.580> shoes

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
that every store that got these shoes

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
that every store that got these shoes
had<00:05:39.240> this<00:05:39.420> in<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.750> back<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.910> and<00:05:42.020> actually

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
had this in the back and and actually

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.510 
had this in the back and and actually
that's<00:05:43.170> probably<00:05:43.560> around<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.950> same<00:05:44.190> time

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
that's probably around the same time

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.160 
that's probably around the same time
that<00:05:45.290> they<00:05:46.290> stopped<00:05:47.240> giving<00:05:48.240> me<00:05:48.480> shoes<00:05:48.720> like

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.170 
that they stopped giving me shoes like

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.120 
that they stopped giving me shoes like
early<00:05:49.500> like<00:05:49.680> that

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
early like that

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.830 
early like that
because<00:05:50.850> they<00:05:50.940> probably<00:05:51.060> got<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.390> don't<00:05:51.720> know

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
because they probably got I don't know

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.270 
because they probably got I don't know
what<00:05:52.020> happened<00:05:52.440> with<00:05:52.470> them<00:05:52.740> with<00:05:53.100> that

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
what happened with them with that

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.000 
what happened with them with that
situation<00:05:53.900> but<00:05:54.900> that's<00:05:55.410> probably<00:05:55.620> one<00:05:55.890> of<00:05:55.920> the

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
situation but that's probably one of the

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.770 
situation but that's probably one of the
main<00:05:56.190> reasons<00:05:56.670> why<00:05:56.880> I<00:05:56.910> start<00:05:57.450> getting<00:05:57.660> my

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
main reasons why I start getting my

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.709 
main reasons why I start getting my
shoes<00:05:57.990> either

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
shoes either

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:00.779 
shoes either
like<00:05:59.259> exactly<00:05:59.739> probably<00:06:00.159> about<00:06:00.279> two<00:06:00.519> months

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
like exactly probably about two months

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.699 
like exactly probably about two months
after<00:06:00.909> that<00:06:01.059> they<00:06:01.659> stopped<00:06:02.049> giving<00:06:02.259> me<00:06:02.439> my

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:02.709 
after that they stopped giving me my

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:07.889 
after that they stopped giving me my
shoes<00:06:02.949> like<00:06:03.219> a<00:06:03.629> month<00:06:04.629> earlier<00:06:05.669> so<00:06:06.669> yeah<00:06:06.909> um

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:07.899 
shoes like a month earlier so yeah um

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.469 
shoes like a month earlier so yeah um
the<00:06:08.799> ones<00:06:09.009> that<00:06:09.219> they<00:06:09.399> released<00:06:09.699> after<00:06:10.059> this<00:06:10.209> I

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
the ones that they released after this I

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.789 
the ones that they released after this I
believe<00:06:10.959> they<00:06:11.199> could<00:06:11.319> have<00:06:11.379> been<00:06:11.529> like<00:06:11.709> the

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:11.799 
believe they could have been like the

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:13.589 
believe they could have been like the
same<00:06:12.009> ones<00:06:12.369> more<00:06:12.789> than<00:06:12.969> likely<00:06:13.149> they<00:06:13.360> just

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
same ones more than likely they just

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.629 
same ones more than likely they just
