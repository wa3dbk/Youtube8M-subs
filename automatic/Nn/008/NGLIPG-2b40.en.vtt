00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 you often have to wipe off the stove 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.279
 run away unakit 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 and then boil broth for a long time at a slow 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.830
 fire you tired but run away 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 milk then try cooking with 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.139
 the cap does not go soldering is real 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 breakthrough in kitchen technology 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.770
 silicone cap do not go soldering 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.109
 arranged in such a way that penny soup 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 raging stream goes to the top of the lid 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.260
 through special petals leaving 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.939
 cooking surface dry and clean al 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.800
 do you even know what it means to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 every modern owner of the acquisition 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 Here is such a cover, do not get out the soldering I 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.790
 only today saw this mug and already 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
 understood how much it will simplify our lives 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.510
 Well, for those who have not yet figured out 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.100
 what a wonderful subject today 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.320
 will be discussed and of course for you 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 my dear, I asked to cook 5 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.710
 pans that are cooked foods 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 having boil properties or like 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.059
 say our dear housewives run away 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.250
 so my risk is cooking peas here 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.770
 pasta dumplings and even milk 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.399
 words like not this terrible it's dirty 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.530
 dishes 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.350
 it's a dirty pot a dirty stove a 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 if boiling broth or milk boils then 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.700
 have to cook all over again nothing 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 come to brew my dear again if 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 there will be no cover in your kitchen 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.150
 boils away and you just think about 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.890
 the cap name does not come out soldering 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.750
 and that's why she him and ration you 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 I'll tell you now the cover is made of 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.909
 high strength silicone but most importantly 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 she has these petals inside and now 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 watch carefully how it works 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.860
 my friends when you put the cover on 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.900
 a pot in which something is brewed 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.030
 foaming flow rises to the top 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.329
 passes through the petals and settles 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.130
 inside the cover the excess Science 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.259
 foam we now control salute 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.640
 probably what is being cooked inside 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.220
 pots even at the highest 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.930
 temperatures continuing going on without 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.780
 your participation you no longer need 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.060
 follow the process but this is not the most 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.520
 the most important thing is that the lid is not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.130
 Bikini in your kitchen will always be 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.810
 purely 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.240
 for those who want to keep cooking 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.210
 the surface is clean for those who are forced 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.860
 leave the stove unattended 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.500
 annoying overflow more 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.000
 won't bother you 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.399
 no matter what you cook on the stove 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.380
 everything stays in the pan and cooks on 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.470
 highest possible temperature 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.180
 saving you time and energy here we are 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.950
 you have been here for about ten minutes 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.319
 something boils we talk well you 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.390
 don't sit at all behind the foam process 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.700
 ravil on but the process is under control 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.799
 the lid doesn't boil away and but if you're expensive 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.569
 my think that this is all capable of 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.580
 this is a miracle cover I'll surprise you now 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.799
 how do you think that i have here 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.019
 preparing this steamed shrimp my 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.360
 favorite dish but cooked them 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.190
 the help of the same cap does not go soldering 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 I took a pot of water brought it to 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.910
 boiling top put the lid not you 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.410
 a pile of q on it and put the products 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.260
 who want to steam and 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.660
 covered the usual lid amazing but also 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.579
 it 's not all cover don't get out soldering 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.739
 ideal for frying in a pan 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.720
 In the vegetable oil you ever 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.060
 burned with boiling oil to very 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.859
 unpleasant you even said hurt so here 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.269
 it's all in the past firstly the cap is not 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.220
 go soldering keep temperature 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.200
 mode inside the pan or will not allow 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.569
 oil splash you said that the cap 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.700
 silicones and we really love silicone on 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.980
 the kitchen because it is not harmful at all 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.989
 durable flexible and very well cleaned 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.209
 either under the tap or with a dishwasher 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.250
 car and even silicone is resistant to even 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.079
 he retains the highest temperatures 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.530
 its fantastic properties when 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.450
 temperature up to 260 degrees which means 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.459
 that the cap does not arch to will perform 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.769
 their work not only on the stove but also 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.019
 and in the oven and in the microwave 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.730
 as well as great to save 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.310
 fresh food in the fridge 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.769
 the cover does not get out the bike is amazing 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.739
 alternative to the usual covers with her you 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.930
 run away nothing will not boil away 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.569
 spray hot oil all 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.489
 stay in the pan and get ready on 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.500
 highest possible temperature 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.500
 saving you time and energy
