00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.070
 very good to all people how are you? 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.350
 researched theses and fire management because 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.050
 today I bring you the trophy guide of the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 revolution map pack good we're going to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.860
 start first with what are the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.300
 trophies old and rise today I bring you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.630
 face to face with the dragon that is a 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.660
 very very simple trophy to perform here 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.730
 I 'm going to teach it in round 1 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.100
 and it's super simple basically it's about 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.300
 the only thing to activate the electricity we 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.849
 we are going to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.940
 to what is the roof and there we look 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.410
 to the dragon that there is and nothing and with that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.270
 we will have the trophy so what are we going 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.220
 to do first is going to be to draw a 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.920
 little bit of pasta to be able 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.010
 open the doors that are needed but 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.659
 well we will not take anything and ya 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.460
 I say that round 1 can be done 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.530
 perfectly here I was recording it 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.879
 with biden but you can also 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.250
 get alone the trophy is worth not 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.199
 you need is two or three or four 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.420
 players can only do it 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.820
 it's also very easy so once you 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.219
 let's have enough money we jump 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.899
 here a little bit in the elevator we go down and 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.179
 let's jump to the next building 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.380
 It's worth to activate the electricity 

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:14.020
 so here we go away we jump and we 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.810
 we go directly to electricity 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.280
 to activate it so nothing 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.700
 we open this door where you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.429
 needs and we activate electricity 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.619
 it's worth to the right now we have both 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.270
 elevators we upload it in which first 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.550
 are we have in this for 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.100
 luck already placed to climb 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.860
 and climbed up to the roof worth 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.500
 and nothing once we add to those here 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.880
 you will see it make sure to go up 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.680
 ok because here down without wanting the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.290
 elevator so look is up and 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.100
 I according to the edite of that up to 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.500
 up therefore the moving knife and nothing 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.680
 you have to as I say to go up 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.590
 up is worth and nothing basically once 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.039
 you are up we went up here 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.750
 double equis pim pam and we throw everything to 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.539
 forward everything to the front we turn 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.490
 here and nothing we climb up here we look 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.289
 to the face of the dragon and he will give us the 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.780
 trophy is worth here you see it we look at the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.700
 heel face and it appears cut so 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.180
 nothing very very simple and I tell you this 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.100
 super easy achievement and none of this has been 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.510
 a whole pole and episode 1 of this 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.110
 guide and not us in the next up 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.110
 approximate
