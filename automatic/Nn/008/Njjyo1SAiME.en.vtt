they be more excited about what happened
high-scoring<00:01:48.299> affair<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> fight<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
high-scoring affair and then a fight to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.069 
high-scoring affair and then a fight to
end<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.369> off<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.210> best<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.659> both<00:01:51.750> world

of October I don't think BYU fans are
BYU<00:02:28.920> themselves<00:02:29.490> thought<00:02:29.640> they<00:02:29.760> were<00:02:29.820> ever

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090

there's<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.220> lot<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.520> optimism<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.470> when<00:02:40.470> they

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
there's a lot of optimism and when they

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
come around next year I I expect

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.380 
come around next year I I expect
expectations<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.460> pick<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.790> exactly<00:02:44.940> where

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
expectations to pick up exactly where

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.860 
expectations to pick up exactly where
they<00:02:45.720> were<00:02:46.580> before<00:02:47.580> october<00:02:48.270> hey<00:02:48.570> i<00:02:48.810> think

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
they were before october hey i think

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.740 
they were before october hey i think
they're<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.380> expect<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.890> top<00:02:50.100> 20<00:02:50.750> Heisman

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
they're going to expect a top 20 Heisman

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.870 
they're going to expect a top 20 Heisman
performance<00:02:52.350> from<00:02:52.590> Taysom<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.670> think

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
performance from Taysom I think

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.400 
performance from Taysom I think
expectations<00:02:54.660> are<00:02:54.720> going<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:54.990> through<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
expectations are going to be through the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.020 
expectations are going to be through the
roof<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.130> think<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.520> probably<00:02:56.760> pretty

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
roof and I think it's probably pretty

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.730 
roof and I think it's probably pretty
valid<00:02:57.360> assuming<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.200> those<00:02:58.320> two<00:02:58.530> players

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
valid assuming that those two players

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.500 
valid assuming that those two players
can<00:02:59.010> come<00:02:59.040> back<00:02:59.370> healthy<00:02:59.580> with<00:03:00.000> their<00:03:00.210> healthy

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
can come back healthy with their healthy

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.510 
can come back healthy with their healthy
even<00:03:00.630> with<00:03:00.900> their<00:03:01.140> health<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.830> schedule<00:03:02.400> in

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
even with their health that schedule in

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.210 
even with their health that schedule in
2015<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.570> daunting<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:04.680> they've<00:03:04.950> got<00:03:05.130> an

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
2015 is daunting but they've got an

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.740 
2015 is daunting but they've got an
offseason<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.880> ready<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.510> get

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
offseason to get ready for it to get

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.300 
offseason to get ready for it to get
healthy<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.350> get<00:03:07.470> fired<00:03:07.710> up<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.100> punch

healthy and to get fired up and punch

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.190 
healthy and to get fired up and punch
obviously<00:03:08.820> yes<00:03:09.210> this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> bitter<00:03:09.960> way<00:03:10.140> to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
obviously yes this is a bitter way to
