landscape<00:00:58.390> mode<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.840> much<00:00:59.079> easier<00:00:59.130> because

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
landscape mode is much easier because

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.740 
landscape mode is much easier because
the<00:01:00.370> keys<00:01:00.550> are<00:01:00.730> larger<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.149> this<00:01:01.510> really

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
the keys are larger and this really

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.920
