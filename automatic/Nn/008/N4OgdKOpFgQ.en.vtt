00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
and from what I see with interviews of

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.350 
and from what I see with interviews of
mark<00:04:03.990> Cerny<00:04:04.260> he's<00:04:04.620> not<00:04:04.830> either<00:04:05.070> now<00:04:06.030> could<00:04:06.330> it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
mark Cerny he's not either now could it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.180 
mark Cerny he's not either now could it
be<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.750> Sony<00:04:07.050> doesn't<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.740> money<00:04:07.920> to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
be that Sony doesn't have the money to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.740 
be that Sony doesn't have the money to
do<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.490> whole<00:04:08.640> cloud<00:04:08.880> computing<00:04:09.420> thing<00:04:09.600> like

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
do the whole cloud computing thing like

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.810 
do the whole cloud computing thing like
Microsoft<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.440> could<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:10.770> -<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.640> could<00:04:11.790> be

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
Microsoft that could be - that could be

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.690 
Microsoft that could be - that could be
mine<00:04:12.090> why<00:04:12.390> they're<00:04:12.600> downplaying<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:14.310> you

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
mine why they're downplaying it but you

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
mine why they're downplaying it but you
know<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.850> lot<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.090> people<00:04:15.360> saying<00:04:15.540> Ritchie

mainframe to do the calculations like I

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.430 
mainframe to do the calculations like I
said<00:04:34.980> hundreds<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.460> miles<00:04:35.610> away<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.020> mean

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
said hundreds of miles away so I mean

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.200 
said hundreds of miles away so I mean
I'm<00:04:37.530> not<00:04:37.650> saying<00:04:37.950> cloud<00:04:38.340> computing<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.030> not<00:04:39.060> a

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
I'm not saying cloud computing is not a

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.850 
I'm not saying cloud computing is not a
thing<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:39.780> in<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.930> future<00:04:40.290> it's<00:04:40.470> not<00:04:40.680> going

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
thing and in the future it's not going

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.250 
thing and in the future it's not going
to<00:04:40.920> be<00:04:41.100> optimal<00:04:41.610> but<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.390> don't<00:04:42.630> see<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:42.900> coming

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
to be optimal but I don't see it coming

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.950 
to be optimal but I don't see it coming
for<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.710> long-ass<00:04:44.490> time<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:45.270> like<00:04:45.450> even<00:04:45.660> when

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
for a long-ass time and like even when

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.380 
for a long-ass time and like even when
like<00:04:46.230> Google<00:04:46.620> Fiber<00:04:47.000> become<00:04:48.000> super

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
like Google Fiber become super

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.940 
like Google Fiber become super
mainstream<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:49.110> don't<00:04:49.230> even<00:04:49.320> think<00:04:49.440> that'll<00:04:49.920> be

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
mainstream I don't even think that'll be

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.220 
mainstream I don't even think that'll be
enough<00:04:50.100> bandwidth<00:04:50.790> for<00:04:51.030> that<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:52.110> know<00:04:52.200> I

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
enough bandwidth for that you know I

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.360 
enough bandwidth for that you know I
know<00:04:52.350> people<00:04:52.440> are<00:04:52.770> gonna<00:04:52.830> see<00:04:53.070> rich<00:04:53.190> they

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
know people are gonna see rich they

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.100 
know people are gonna see rich they
already<00:04:53.490> had<00:04:53.730> like<00:04:53.880> on<00:04:54.060> live<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.720> people<00:04:54.870> are

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
already had like on live and people are

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.680 
already had like on live and people are
playing<00:04:55.260> games<00:04:55.740> through<00:04:56.640> cloud<00:04:56.910> services<00:04:57.510> but

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
playing games through cloud services but

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.430 
playing games through cloud services but
when<00:04:58.530> when<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:59.240> processor<00:05:00.240> needs<00:05:01.050> or<00:05:01.410> a

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
when when a processor needs or a

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.100 
when when a processor needs or a
graphics<00:05:02.190> processor<00:05:02.760> needs<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.390> task

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
graphics processor needs a task

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.210 
graphics processor needs a task
completed<00:05:04.710> they<00:05:04.830> need<00:05:04.980> it

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
completed they need it

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.460 
completed they need it
right<00:05:05.430> then<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:05.790> there<00:05:05.990> they<00:05:06.990> can't<00:05:07.260> wait

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
right then and there they can't wait

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.490 
right then and there they can't wait
even<00:05:07.860> that<00:05:08.160> nanosecond<00:05:09.090> for<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.540> go<00:05:09.720> be

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
even that nanosecond for it to go be

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.960 
even that nanosecond for it to go be
transferred<00:05:11.160> through<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.520> internet<00:05:11.820> and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
transferred through the internet and

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.060 
transferred through the internet and
then<00:05:12.120> be<00:05:12.300> sent<00:05:12.600> back<00:05:12.750> after<00:05:13.230> its<00:05:13.380> processed<00:05:13.620> by

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
then be sent back after its processed by

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.730 
then be sent back after its processed by
some<00:05:14.400> mainframes<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.540> don't<00:05:16.320> know<00:05:16.440> man<00:05:16.710> I

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
some mainframes so I don't know man I

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.380 
some mainframes so I don't know man I
mean<00:05:16.980> I'm<00:05:17.100> in<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.370> future<00:05:17.790> yeah<00:05:18.030> it'll<00:05:18.240> be<00:05:18.360> a

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
mean I'm in the future yeah it'll be a

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.970 
mean I'm in the future yeah it'll be a
viable<00:05:18.690> option<00:05:19.080> but<00:05:19.380> I'm<00:05:19.470> thinking<00:05:19.830> like

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
viable option but I'm thinking like

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.940 
viable option but I'm thinking like
it'll<00:05:20.850> be<00:05:20.970> after<00:05:21.180> this<00:05:22.020> next<00:05:22.380> console

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
it'll be after this next console

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.060 
it'll be after this next console
generation<00:05:23.610> that<00:05:24.030> cloud<00:05:24.750> computing<00:05:25.380> will<00:05:25.950> be

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
generation that cloud computing will be

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.070 
generation that cloud computing will be
beneficial<00:05:26.760> at<00:05:26.880> least<00:05:27.090> that's<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.690> way<00:05:27.870> I'm

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
beneficial at least that's the way I'm

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.260 
beneficial at least that's the way I'm
