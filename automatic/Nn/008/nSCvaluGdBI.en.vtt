00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.470
 here I am very happy today I have the luck and the privilege of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.450
 meet 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.200
 a great writer who comes from belgium m yes and montaigu today it's 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.380
 sir patrick head 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.839
 baby 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.120
 this visit pronounced at the risk of being alone with the empty goal 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390
 what you want 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.940
 everyone was waiting for his life and going into his life 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.820
 pm yes you can find him so we found him 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.510
 besides 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 but I think that art 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.600
 the first lady of france 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.569
 and here it is no dirty photos waiting danone in alabama 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.860
 even if the cyclist is an exemplary job 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.370
 I worked a lot 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.540
 it captures only thing 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.489
 after launch 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.619
 yes the idea is to tell a little bit what I think the queen because 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.299
 the adjustment carla bruni returns to the tradition of 22 francs are scared in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300
 that sense that 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.140
 she is married to the lace president and the lawns of the ruler 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 losses of the order of 0 3% 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.950
 like a queen and what I'm trying to explain in the book is that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.460
 she's maybe not necessarily the queen we're waiting for so besides she 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.590
 is maybe 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.300
 kg say a little back when we really think it 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.950
 breastfeeds 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.100
 gold in the foreground that she was going to play her star role between guinea 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.929
 by the way and basically we have the pressure 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.680
 she is rather discreet and I think that 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.899
 at mondeville the beginning of a misunderstanding with the french 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.109
 and then more than sir 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.140
 the baby was also invited is ordinary 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.480
 advice to all 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.020
 on the viking back it's a saga india-sized of such a key level that speaks of 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.590
 millions of difference to be run 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.850
 the establishment of victims in France and then there 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.820
 recovery the Germans took a happy fire during during the 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.740
 World War II 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.869
 ouanna i will show you the book for our friends 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.009

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.729
 as well 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:14.579
 I can not 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.180
 yes but for me it's just for me what I do not want to speculate on 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.180
 authors of this shot passes the details of this case keep time 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.869
 and the devil in Rome corsets and then this one that is a lot 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.239
 that I was lucky to have read 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.399
 it's the maiden of bruges 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.599
 for those who do not know, you really have to 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
 that's what happens in 10 775 euros here 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.969
 I was very happy to get you back 5 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.099
 you and I too I wrote the confidences of carla but of course 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.569
 it is 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.220
 confidences in my own way 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.439
 because I could do if these gestures and comedian 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.249
 she was acting to cook 10 to 6 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.249
 the artificer and here it is to laugh 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:57.859
