00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.490
 we are now here in the third video of 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.789
 our white testimony is 106 for 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.760
 look at the software and interfaces of this 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.369
 tuffani here 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.029
 As you can see we have the screen 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:25.750
 from the to the 106 on the fifth 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.009
 through the lock screen that has this 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.630
 aspect 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.570
 one of the things we want to see too 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.560
 later in this video is equal and 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:39.760
 offers many themes that allow 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.920
 customize is the ophone is the theme that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.910
 will come in favor and against the way 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.240
 can see we have here is a theme made in the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.370
 total and very looking not being that 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.000
 to unlock the typhoon we have to spend 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.560
 to the right to go to the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.650
 main or here for home to be 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.700
 directly to the camera is that 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.500
 then we have the main screen of a 106 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.620
 with that with a widget that the avaÃ­ created 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.400
 for your interface showing will i am 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.310
 1.6 keka team and is estimated phone and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:22.380
 that works on android 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:25.840
 4.2.1 2 directly include the time and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.409
 technology and the time of our city of 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.229
 origin for example the be here another one 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.150
 location where we are what gives 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.800
 very well when we are traveling that 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.280
 does this mother directly here the reader 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.860
 music are two predefined contacts 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.200
 and we did more and here is also a 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.000
 Tennis was show it passes the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.880
 images stored in the forum 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.680
 here we have access to some 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.409
 rapid application and remains 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.060
 when we navigate the main screens 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.430
 of this equipment 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.950
 one of the peculiarities of hemosul 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.020
 online of water is that we have not 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.970
 traditional list of applications ie 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.540
 we do not have any place here where we can 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.610
 go 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.259
 the list of applications 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.850
 applications that are here in the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.670
 main screens and then it is very 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.700
 if the deviation by pass 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.340
 example is tool management pastor or 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.690
 of google applications is a concept 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.330
 a little different from what we are 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.410
 accustomed to seeing on android the principle 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.360
 to cause any strangeness 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.110
 numbers in the background have worked quite 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.340
 well and it's this interface seems to be 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.250
 also used for the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:40.610
 quad-core processor Giant 1.5 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.500
 team the seat six years already 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.130
 traditional beard for notifications with 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.680
 some quick shortcuts we can 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.430
 economize or is it easy enough 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:03:01.430
 from here in the settings 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:04.670
 here you will find many options and 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.220
 is in a while then customizing the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.440
 quick details of the notification bar 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.990
 make it more convenient as the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.360
 to make it faster 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.870
 the settings that are most involved in day 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.420
 the day as you can see here too 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.180
 so long awaited definitions we the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.700
 coaches here the general and all being 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.860
 which in general as one can calculate 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.440
 here we have the functions that most 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.390
 are often used and 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.150
 and also faster 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.830
 these parts aquino all time 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.870
 then access to all typhoon missions 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.450
 who came here just to so we're even 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:50.270
 both are always personal with four 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:59.930
 1.5 Giant bodies with 2 gb of ram and 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:04:03.080
 android which is 4.2.1 2011 as is the 56 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:08.350
 some management tools both outside 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.350
 such as a permissions manager 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.660
 that allows us 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.940
 say is that applications get access 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.079
 notification or 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.750
 Updates 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.390
 This really works out well, we can not. 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.120
 to further protect our forum and 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:29.169
 we have a case control of what is done 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.690
 and who serves what is the term we have 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.150
 here also done by a manager of 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.940
 energy that the days here how long and 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.340
 not of the autonomy network and we have three 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.800
 schemes we can use in this case 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.580
 everything was okay everything intelligently 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.560
 that can control the speed of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.440
 the taste to also save money. 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.110
 a little and battery we have here a normal 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.510
 in a long-lasting way between only 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.640
 We have the same functions also 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.550
 permanent operation we have functions 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.020
 Basic how calls the messages 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.690
 that these things not notifications 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.090
 work will not have a screen on but 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.860
 allows you as you can see also get more 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.660
 autonomy which in this case appreciably 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 an hour and a half more inside nobody 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.730
 said the mother there are people who already 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.440
 had two hours of a cut more than 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.590
 normal mode and we also study here 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.120
 to define some functions with those of 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.540
 energy as well as set the 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:36.340
 than the ranking in the air with the 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:40.360
 system in terms of interface is is to see is 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.550
 really very fluid as it and has 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.680
 here a series of concepts a little 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.890
 different from what we are 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.400
 accustomed to no android 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:53.050
 still works very well it's very 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.729
 interesting and I was already thinking 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:00.430
 we also have part of the themes that 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:05.260
 allows us to change the theme is any 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:08.620
 height o the 106 comes with five pre- 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.460
 pre story sakimoto way but also 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.140
 we can search for more topics in 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.449
 internet there are many one of the themes 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.270
 available, which is also 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:23.180
 For me, when we believe we can 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.819
 very quickly change the appearance of the 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:30.199
 phone and so almost to have this 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:32.749
 decision we have a new forum in relation to 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.059
 software, so I hope everything 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:37.009
 liked this analysis to the software and 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:39.409
 interfaces two mps 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.259
 if this is the case do not forget that for 11 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:44.479
 I like it on our youtube video and if 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:47.210
 have any questions or suggestions or 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.559
 criticism but how to always get into 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.990
 contact us 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:53.439
 many thanks and until the next video of 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.439
 digital inclusion
