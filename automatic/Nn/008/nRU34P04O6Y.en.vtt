basically<00:00:30.059> happens<00:00:30.419> on<00:00:30.570> engine<00:00:30.960> stop-start

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
basically happens on engine stop-start

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.470 
basically happens on engine stop-start
that<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> customer<00:00:32.850> pulls<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that the customer pulls up to a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.870 
that the customer pulls up to a
streetlight<00:00:34.079> stop<00:00:34.410> sign<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.460> engine<00:00:35.730> will

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
streetlight stop sign the engine will

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.330 
streetlight stop sign the engine will
power<00:00:36.120> down<00:00:36.380> once<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> customer<00:00:37.950> coming<00:00:38.160> off

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
power down once that customer coming off

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.370 
power down once that customer coming off
that<00:00:38.370> brake<00:00:38.880> pedal<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.809> engine<00:00:40.079> will<00:00:40.230> come

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
that brake pedal the engine will come

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.479 
that brake pedal the engine will come
back<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.770> okay<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.769> it<00:00:43.769> is<00:00:43.859> a<00:00:43.890> high<00:00:44.160> endurance

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
back on okay so it is a high endurance

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.209 
back on okay so it is a high endurance

another Nagler that we have on board
from<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.760> Partridge<00:01:43.120> standpoint<00:01:43.510> it's<00:01:43.840> what

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
from the Partridge standpoint it's what

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.680 
from the Partridge standpoint it's what
we<00:01:44.110> call<00:01:44.550> transdermal<00:01:45.550> management<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.630> the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
we call transdermal management and the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.920 
we call transdermal management and the
thought<00:01:47.500> process<00:01:47.950> here<00:01:47.979> was<00:01:48.400> to<00:01:48.720> take<00:01:49.720> that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
thought process here was to take that

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.200 
thought process here was to take that
heat<00:01:50.260> and<00:01:50.500> produce<00:01:51.160> from<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.550> engine<00:01:51.970> and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
heat and produce from that engine and

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.780 
heat and produce from that engine and
use<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.960> coolant<00:01:53.410> from<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.920> route<00:01:54.580> that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
use the coolant from that route that

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.700 
use the coolant from that route that
back<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.300> heat<00:01:55.630> exchanger<00:01:56.200> mounted<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.680> the

back to a heat exchanger mounted to the

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.340 
back to a heat exchanger mounted to the
transmission<00:01:57.280> what<00:01:58.270> we<00:01:58.420> have<00:01:58.540> found<00:01:58.570> in<00:01:59.200> our

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
transmission what we have found in our

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
transmission what we have found in our
testing<00:01:59.800> was<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.130> we<00:02:00.220> could<00:02:00.399> get<00:02:00.490> that

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
testing was that we could get that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.889 
testing was that we could get that

transferred to operate at 190 degrees

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.080 
transferred to operate at 190 degrees
and<00:02:04.899> maintain<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.560> basically<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.790> dropped

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
and maintain that basically you dropped

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.780 
and maintain that basically you dropped
viscosity<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.229> trans<00:02:08.649> fluid<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.489> you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
viscosity of the trans fluid and you

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.460 
viscosity of the trans fluid and you
allow<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.239> more<00:02:10.390> efficient<00:02:10.869> operations

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
allow for more efficient operations

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.800
