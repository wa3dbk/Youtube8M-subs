like color and I guess the styling as
well<00:00:56.269> we<00:00:56.449> want<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.690> keep<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:57.129> true<00:00:58.149> correct

historically<00:00:59.870> accurate<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:02.379> sketch<00:01:03.379> these<00:01:05.050> in

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
historically accurate I sketch these in

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.340 
historically accurate I sketch these in
situ<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.560> guess<00:01:06.830> in<00:01:07.340> front<00:01:07.790> of<00:01:07.940> them<00:01:09.520> the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
situ I guess in front of them the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.940 
situ I guess in front of them the
publisher<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.560> writer<00:01:12.830> people<00:01:13.760> who<00:01:14.000> are

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
can come up to a really well worked up

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.750 
can come up to a really well worked up
rough<00:01:22.360> that<00:01:23.360> then<00:01:24.230> I<00:01:24.470> take<00:01:24.710> home<00:01:24.980> and<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.550> will
