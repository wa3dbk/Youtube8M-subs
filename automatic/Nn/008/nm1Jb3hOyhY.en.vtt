new<00:00:42.839> in<00:00:43.260> version<00:00:43.820> 0.23<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:45.660> let's<00:00:45.900> go<00:00:46.050> ahead

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
new in version 0.23 well let's go ahead

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.790 
new in version 0.23 well let's go ahead
and<00:00:46.350> take<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> look<00:00:47.190> around<00:00:47.900> inversion<00:00:48.900> 0.23

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and take a look around inversion 0.23

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
and take a look around inversion 0.23
they've<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.940> restructured<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.019> whole

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
they've really restructured the whole

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.590 
they've really restructured the whole
science<00:00:52.829> gathering<00:00:53.400> system<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.360> can't

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
science gathering system you can't

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
science gathering system you can't
really<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.930> those<00:00:55.110> big<00:00:55.470> missions<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.129> gather

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
really do those big missions to gather

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.540 
really do those big missions to gather
6,000<00:00:57.239> science<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> endlessly<00:00:58.469> send<00:00:59.309> back

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
6,000 science and endlessly send back

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.639 
6,000 science and endlessly send back
report<00:01:00.030> after<00:01:00.329> report<00:01:00.359> after<00:01:00.899> report<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
report after report after report and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.040 
report after report after report and
that's<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.120> thought<00:01:03.690> I'd<00:01:03.870> like

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
that's kind of what I thought I'd like

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.119 
that's kind of what I thought I'd like
when<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.289> made<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.800> first<00:01:04.979> place

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
when they made this in the first place

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.490 
when they made this in the first place
and<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:07.020> structured

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and now it it's a little more structured

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020 
and now it it's a little more structured
it<00:01:07.680> does<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:08.009> a<00:01:08.039> little<00:01:08.190> more<00:01:08.369> time<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> get

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it does take a little more time to get

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
it does take a little more time to get
through<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.869> whole<00:01:10.050> science<00:01:10.500> thing<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
through the whole science thing but I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090 
through the whole science thing but I
think<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.660> better<00:01:13.009> after<00:01:14.009> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
think it's for the better after you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
think it's for the better after you
collected<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.670> science<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.390> gathered<00:01:15.780> some

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
collected some science and gathered some

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.960 
collected some science and gathered some
data<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.800> to<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.100> new<00:01:17.520> science

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
data you can go to this new science

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.180 
data you can go to this new science
archive<00:01:18.539> screen<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.410> all<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> stuff

that you've done so far in career mode
this<00:01:24.090> new<00:01:24.539> update<00:01:24.780> didn't<00:01:25.679> add<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> whole<00:01:26.429> lot

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
this new update didn't add a whole lot

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
this new update didn't add a whole lot
of<00:01:26.880> gameplay<00:01:27.450> elements<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.079> game<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.350> new

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of gameplay elements to the game or new

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.069 
of gameplay elements to the game or new
parts<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:29.220> anything<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.689> more

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
parts or anything like that it was more

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
parts or anything like that it was more
of<00:01:31.110> under<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.890> hood<00:01:32.250> kind<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.700> thing

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
of under the hood kind of thing

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
of under the hood kind of thing
balancing<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.049> science<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.920> making<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.280> make

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
balancing out science and making it make

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.670 
balancing out science and making it make
more<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> sense<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.200> did<00:01:37.439> do

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
more kind of sense but what they did do

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
more kind of sense but what they did do
is<00:01:37.950> give<00:01:38.130> us<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> couple<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.729> new<00:01:38.850> parts<00:01:39.210> one

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
is give us a couple of new parts one

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.730 
is give us a couple of new parts one
this<00:01:40.290> new<00:01:40.799> engine<00:01:41.399> here<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.240> basically

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
this new engine here that basically

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.539 
this new engine here that basically
switches<00:01:43.740> from<00:01:44.390> in<00:01:45.390> orbit<00:01:46.020> flight<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.979> kind

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
switches from in orbit flight that kind

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
switches from in orbit flight that kind
of<00:01:47.670> acts<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.090> jet<00:01:48.390> engine<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
of acts like a jet engine and then it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.310 
of acts like a jet engine and then it
switches<00:01:49.979> when<00:01:50.460> there's<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:50.790> oxygen<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.930> turn

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
switches when there's no oxygen to turn

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
switches when there's no oxygen to turn
into<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> rocket<00:01:52.890> motor<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:54.000> Space<00:01:54.360> Flight

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
into a rocket motor for Space Flight

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780 
into a rocket motor for Space Flight
which<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.950> neat<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.670> not

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
which is really really neat so not

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
which is really really neat so not
exactly<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> most<00:01:57.509> efficient<00:01:58.259> engine<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.770> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
exactly the most efficient engine but it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.190 
exactly the most efficient engine but it
definitely<00:01:59.100> makes<00:01:59.600> getting<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:00.840> single

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
definitely makes getting your single

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
definitely makes getting your single
stage<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.500> orbit<00:02:01.740> craft<00:02:02.369> into<00:02:02.610> orbit<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.180> more

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
stage to orbit craft into orbit a more

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.570 
stage to orbit craft into orbit a more
simple<00:02:04.020> task

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.160 

the<00:02:08.580> second<00:02:09.030> part<00:02:09.209> they<00:02:09.390> added<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.989> new

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the second part they added in this new

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.130 
the second part they added in this new
update<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> lab<00:02:11.760> module<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.690> kind

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
update is the lab module and this kind

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.380 
update is the lab module and this kind
of<00:02:13.290> mitigates<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> whole<00:02:14.430> science

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of mitigates the whole science

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.390 
of mitigates the whole science
restructuring<00:02:16.230> as<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.590> will<00:02:16.709> allow<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.040> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
restructuring as it will allow you to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.030 
restructuring as it will allow you to
reset<00:02:18.390> some<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.690> your<00:02:18.900> experiments<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.890> just

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
reset some of your experiments you just

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.890 
reset some of your experiments you just
got<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.190> make<00:02:20.340> sure<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> need<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.090> man

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
got to make sure that you need to man

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.949 
got to make sure that you need to man
this<00:02:22.170> with<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.709> crew<00:02:23.069> men<00:02:23.340> because<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:24.750> won't

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
this with two crew men because it won't

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.839 
this with two crew men because it won't
work<00:02:25.110> unless<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.340> need<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
work unless you do so you need to have a

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.490 
work unless you do so you need to have a
pod<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.330> more<00:02:27.569> than<00:02:27.690> two<00:02:27.840> crewmen<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.410> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
pod with more than two crewmen so you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410 
pod with more than two crewmen so you
can<00:02:28.650> bring<00:02:28.830> them<00:02:29.010> aboard<00:02:29.130> or<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.970> load<00:02:30.269> them

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
can bring them aboard or just load them

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.080 
can bring them aboard or just load them
with<00:02:30.480> crew<00:02:30.750> before<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.140> launch<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.940> some<00:02:32.940> of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
with crew before you launch it some of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.020 
with crew before you launch it some of
the<00:02:33.299> UI<00:02:33.690> elements<00:02:34.620> got<00:02:34.890> an<00:02:35.129> update<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.849> this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the UI elements got an update in this

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.150 
the UI elements got an update in this
build<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> game<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.019> you'll<00:02:37.620> notice<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
build of the game and you'll notice that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.530 
build of the game and you'll notice that
it<00:02:38.340> shows<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> bunch<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.060> new<00:02:39.269> information

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it shows a bunch of new information

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.900 
it shows a bunch of new information
which<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.140> really<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.980> another<00:02:41.220> thing<00:02:41.730> that's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
which I really like another thing that's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.170 
which I really like another thing that's
really<00:02:42.180> cool<00:02:42.299> is<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.560> now<00:02:43.890> transfer<00:02:44.640> fuel

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
really cool is you can now transfer fuel

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.479 
really cool is you can now transfer fuel
between<00:02:45.750> parts<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.069> spin<00:02:47.370> around

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
between parts and you can spin around

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.759 
between parts and you can spin around
your<00:02:47.819> craft<00:02:48.060> without<00:02:48.410> disabling<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
your craft without disabling the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.050 
your craft without disabling the
interface<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.400> it'll<00:02:50.579> keep<00:02:50.730> transferring

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
interface and it'll keep transferring

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.180 
interface and it'll keep transferring
which<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.810> absolutely<00:02:52.079> love<00:02:52.860> that's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
which I absolutely love that's

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.120 
which I absolutely love that's
definitely<00:02:54.060> one<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.239> those<00:02:54.360> needed<00:02:54.810> things

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
definitely one of those needed things

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.250 
definitely one of those needed things
something<00:02:56.130> else<00:02:56.459> they<00:02:56.670> added<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.239> kerbals<00:02:58.019> on

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
something else they added is kerbals on

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.830 
something else they added is kerbals on
EV<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.739> are<00:02:59.069> now<00:02:59.340> able<00:02:59.640> to<00:03:00.000> collect<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.660> store

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
EV a are now able to collect and store

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.620 
EV a are now able to collect and store
data<00:03:01.349> from<00:03:01.819> experimental<00:03:02.819> modules<00:03:03.209> which<00:03:03.480> is

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
data from experimental modules which is

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.080 
data from experimental modules which is
pretty<00:03:04.230> cool<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.530> think<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.160> other<00:03:05.760> space

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
pretty cool I think and other space

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.680 
pretty cool I think and other space
containers<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.019> also<00:03:07.620> other<00:03:07.799> EVs<00:03:08.690> another

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
containers and also other EVs another

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.650 
containers and also other EVs another
new<00:03:09.870> feature<00:03:10.100> 2.23<00:03:11.100> is<00:03:11.609> we<00:03:11.850> can<00:03:12.030> now<00:03:12.209> tweak

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
new feature 2.23 is we can now tweak

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.140 
new feature 2.23 is we can now tweak
some<00:03:12.959> surface<00:03:13.350> elements<00:03:13.799> on<00:03:13.920> our<00:03:14.069> craft<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:14.940> if

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
some surface elements on our craft so if

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.000 
some surface elements on our craft so if
you<00:03:15.299> just<00:03:15.600> want<00:03:15.840> your<00:03:16.019> wings<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.530> say<00:03:16.709> roll

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
you just want your wings to say roll

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.680 
you just want your wings to say roll
your<00:03:17.220> plane<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.790> want<00:03:17.970> your<00:03:18.030> elevator<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
your plane and you want your elevator to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.780 
your plane and you want your elevator to
just<00:03:18.900> say<00:03:19.079> picture<00:03:19.500> plane<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.190> can<00:03:20.430> set<00:03:20.639> those

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
just say picture plane you can set those

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.240 
just say picture plane you can set those
parts<00:03:21.150> up<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.750> do<00:03:21.959> those<00:03:22.200> things<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.069> can

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
parts up to just do those things you can

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.550 
parts up to just do those things you can
also<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.790> your<00:03:23.970> landing<00:03:24.329> gear<00:03:24.569> deployed<00:03:25.049> in

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
also have your landing gear deployed in

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.650 
also have your landing gear deployed in
build<00:03:26.010> mode<00:03:26.100> or<00:03:26.519> retracted<00:03:27.209> it's<00:03:27.450> pretty

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
build mode or retracted it's pretty

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.629 
build mode or retracted it's pretty
awesome<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.590> tinker<00:03:29.220> around<00:03:29.250> with

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
awesome that you can tinker around with

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.280 
awesome that you can tinker around with
a<00:03:29.730> lot<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> parts<00:03:30.359> before<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.900> go<00:03:31.049> ahead

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
a lot of the parts before you go ahead

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.580 
a lot of the parts before you go ahead
and<00:03:31.500> launch<00:03:31.769> your<00:03:31.980> craft<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:34.019> new<00:03:34.350> update

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and launch your craft so this new update

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.400 
and launch your craft so this new update
isn't<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.430> huge<00:03:35.850> one<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.569> does<00:03:36.780> add<00:03:36.810> some

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
isn't a huge one but it does add some

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.370 
isn't a huge one but it does add some
interesting<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.220> cool<00:03:38.639> new<00:03:38.819> parts<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.510> it

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
interesting and cool new parts and it

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.140 
interesting and cool new parts and it
does<00:03:41.069> a<00:03:41.100> lot<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.430> stuff<00:03:41.639> that<00:03:41.670> was<00:03:41.850> kind<00:03:42.030> of

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
does a lot of the stuff that was kind of

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.699 
does a lot of the stuff that was kind of
needed<00:03:42.329> especially<00:03:42.750> with<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.230> science<00:03:43.590> it

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
needed especially with the science it

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.759 
needed especially with the science it
definitely<00:03:44.130> needed<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.609> rebalanced<00:03:45.269> as

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
definitely needed to be rebalanced as

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.809 
definitely needed to be rebalanced as
doing<00:03:46.769> those<00:03:46.889> missions<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.579> pretty<00:03:47.760> much

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
doing those missions and pretty much

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.120 
doing those missions and pretty much
gathering<00:03:48.480> ninety<00:03:49.349> percent<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.799> science

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
gathering ninety percent of the science

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.800 
gathering ninety percent of the science
you<00:03:50.250> need<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.609> unlock<00:03:50.910> most<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.420> parts

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
you need to unlock most of the parts

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.589 
you need to unlock most of the parts
it's<00:03:52.079> kind<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:52.769> not<00:03:52.980> cool<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.819> it's<00:03:54.060> good<00:03:54.569> that

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
it's kind of not cool so it's good that

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.770 
it's kind of not cool so it's good that
they<00:03:54.840> adjusted<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.209> say<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.389> every<00:03:57.750> time

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
they adjusted that I say this every time

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.140 
they adjusted that I say this every time
but<00:03:58.260> I'm<00:03:58.410> still<00:03:58.739> really<00:03:59.190> hanging<00:03:59.700> on<00:03:59.849> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
but I'm still really hanging on to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.789 
but I'm still really hanging on to
hoping<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.750> they're<00:04:00.900> going<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.260> release<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
hoping that they're going to release the

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.339 
hoping that they're going to release the
resource<00:04:02.370> patch<00:04:02.669> sometime<00:04:03.299> soon<00:04:03.630> anyways

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
resource patch sometime soon anyways
