00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.830
 the head coach of the 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.920
 monterrey carlos bar said that 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.230
 drawn away from a goal of points 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.930
 obtained from here to be the tournament them 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.580
 are focused on one goal yet 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.820
 greater than will be the proper functioning 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.490
 del monterrey in the last days of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.990
 this closing 2014 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.060
 today there are other more important things that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.210
 calculate how much we can earn 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.239
 I think you have to be thinking that 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.160
 win the match that follows bar 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.260
 He said that at the moment the group 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.269
 of players is focused on 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.550
 find a good level of game not 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.309
 so much thinking about the liguilla although 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.870
 He said that they are not afraid to think about 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.390
 the final instance of Mexican soccer 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.220
 since this Monterey team has 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.949
 proven that you can reach and step on 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.330
 strong in this instance we look for or 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.750
 We pretend we do not have right now in 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.600
 the head occupied in what can happen 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 later because thinking about the liguilla 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.420
 good 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.780
 it's not that you're afraid and say no 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 we can arrive 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.549
 because this team has already shown it 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.610
 on different occasions what you have to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.670
 demonstrate now is what is required 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.410
 for this meeting to say that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.080
 one of the main themes in these 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.270
 moments for him and his coaching staff is 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.370
 return the mood to the players the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.400
 which will be obtained week after 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.770
 week when they go getting 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.600
 important results the mood can 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.930
 be better 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.490
 and, above all, start to get excited 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 that is also important but 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.340
 I believe that 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.049
 you can not neglect 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.899
 I think we need to not think 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.980
 so much in it today that what more 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.260
 we need is 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.110
 and the three points as mentioned 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.760
 the immediate party for the raí pp 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.800
 between come this will be just your second 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.930
 league game they lead in this 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.320
 tournament and they will face the champion of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.890
