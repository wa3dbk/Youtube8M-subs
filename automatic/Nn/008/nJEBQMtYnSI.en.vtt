that<00:01:24.250> much<00:01:24.610> I<00:01:24.970> mean<00:01:25.090> every<00:01:25.330> episode<00:01:25.900> they're

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
that much I mean every episode they're

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.930 
that much I mean every episode they're
like<00:01:26.260> drive<00:01:27.010> out<00:01:27.160> of<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.340> parking<00:01:27.550> lot<00:01:27.790> or

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
like drive out of a parking lot or

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.460 
like drive out of a parking lot or
something<00:01:28.240> but<00:01:28.420> until<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.810> end<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.229> season

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
something but until the end of season

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.870 
something but until the end of season
two<00:01:29.800> where<00:01:30.130> they<00:01:30.190> did<00:01:30.340> this<00:01:30.460> kind<00:01:30.580> of<00:01:30.670> road

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
two where they did this kind of road

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.820 
two where they did this kind of road
trip<00:01:31.150> thing<00:01:31.360> they<00:01:32.050> haven't<00:01:32.290> really<00:01:32.619> rode

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
trip thing they haven't really rode

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.170 
trip thing they haven't really rode
bikes<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.280> I<00:01:33.310> think<00:01:33.490> that's<00:01:33.640> kind<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:33.880> the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
bikes and I think that's kind of the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.440 
bikes and I think that's kind of the
success<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.869> show<00:01:35.640> literally<00:01:36.640> go<00:01:36.910> to<00:01:36.970> into

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
success of the show literally go to into

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.660 
success of the show literally go to into
motorcycles<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.350> when<00:01:38.440> they<00:01:38.530> do<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.740> they

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
motorcycles and when they do that they

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.070 
motorcycles and when they do that they
tend<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:39.970> make<00:01:40.090> mistakes<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.720> throw<00:01:40.900> people

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
tend to make mistakes and throw people

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
tend to make mistakes and throw people
off<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.960> know<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.470> show's<00:01:44.680> really

off but and you know the show's really

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.980 
off but and you know the show's really
over<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.520> top<00:01:46.050> it's<00:01:47.050> super<00:01:47.649> unrealistic<00:01:48.070> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
over the top it's super unrealistic and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.260 
over the top it's super unrealistic and
just<00:01:49.990> kind<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.320> goofy<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.179> you<00:01:52.179> know

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000 
know it's not on like HBO or anything so
there's<00:02:13.660> always<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:13.990> limit<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:14.560> they<00:02:14.830> can

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
there's always a limit to what they can

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.710 
there's always a limit to what they can
do<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:16.060> that's<00:02:16.210> a<00:02:16.300> good<00:02:16.450> thing<00:02:16.660> for

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
do and I think that's a good thing for

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.550 
do and I think that's a good thing for
the<00:02:16.930> show<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.340> they<00:02:19.090> had<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.840> free

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the show because if they had like free

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.780 
the show because if they had like free
range<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.340> as<00:02:22.200> crazy<00:02:23.200> as<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:23.680> want<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.760> i

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
range to be as crazy as they want to i

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.610 
range to be as crazy as they want to i
think<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.210> show<00:02:25.390> probably<00:02:26.140> would<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.380> too

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
think the show probably would be too

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.960 
think the show probably would be too
much<00:02:26.910> three<00:02:27.910> way<00:02:29.280> now<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:31.110> do<00:02:32.110> think<00:02:32.970> overall

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
much three way now I do think overall

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.620 
much three way now I do think overall
the<00:02:34.360> show<00:02:34.600> probably<00:02:35.380> adds<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:37.060> everything<00:02:37.270> I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
the show probably adds to everything I

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.410 
the show probably adds to everything I
don't<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:38.430> about<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:41.080> mainstream<00:02:41.950> view<00:02:41.980> of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
don't like about the mainstream view of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.150 
don't like about the mainstream view of
motorcycle<00:02:43.420> culture<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.800> know<00:02:44.830> they<00:02:45.100> do

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
motorcycle culture you know they do

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.220

where the their bucket helmets you know

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.710 
where the their bucket helmets you know

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
they don't wear full gear I mean

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.390 
they don't wear full gear I mean

sometimes they were a jacket but it's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.530 
sometimes they were a jacket but it's

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
all this crap I mean it's kind of does

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.360 
all this crap I mean it's kind of does
it<00:03:28.440> make<00:03:28.920> any<00:03:28.950> sense<00:03:29.129> to<00:03:29.459> me<00:03:31.159> you're<00:03:32.159> like<00:03:32.250> The

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
it make any sense to me you're like The

Godfather<00:03:32.489> don't<00:03:32.970> get<00:03:33.060> me<00:03:33.150> wrong<00:03:33.359> but<00:03:35.000> it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
Godfather don't get me wrong but it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.199 
Godfather don't get me wrong but it
seems<00:03:36.239> kind<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.530> outdated<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.940> kind<00:03:39.120> of

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
seems kind of outdated the kind of

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.470 
seems kind of outdated the kind of
gangster<00:03:39.480> lifestyle<00:03:40.140> it's<00:03:40.470> kind<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.709> stupid

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
gangster lifestyle it's kind of stupid

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.520 
gangster lifestyle it's kind of stupid
but<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.599> show<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.900> know<00:03:43.049> their<00:03:43.500> own

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
but this show you know their own

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.520 
but this show you know their own
motorcycles<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.780> guess<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.230> big

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
motorcycles so I guess that is a big

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.729 
motorcycles so I guess that is a big
draw<00:03:46.709> for<00:03:46.829> me<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:48.060> I'm<00:03:48.629> able<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.109> put<00:03:49.319> up<00:03:49.349> with

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
draw for me and I'm able to put up with

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.729 
draw for me and I'm able to put up with
it<00:03:50.299> maybe<00:03:51.299> more<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.930> don't<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.349> it's<00:03:52.530> kind<00:03:52.709> of

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
it maybe more I don't know it's kind of

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.430

hard<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:52.980> explain

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
hard to explain
