today so I think I know what happened

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.700 
today so I think I know what happened
last<00:00:41.340> time<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.930> raining<00:00:43.260> about<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
last time I was raining about then I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.639 
last time I was raining about then I
came<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> make<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.870> faster<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.170> stuff

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
came and how to make it faster and stuff

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.950 
came and how to make it faster and stuff
and<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.450> thing<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.840> you're

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and that make the thing that you're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.450 
and that make the thing that you're
recording<00:00:49.289> lag<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> stuff<00:00:51.120> but

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
recording lag and do all that stuff but

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
recording lag and do all that stuff but
um<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> also<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> open<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.410> band

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
um so you also have to open up band

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
um so you also have to open up band
again<00:00:56.039> before<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.789> open<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> actual

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
again before you open up the actual

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.099 
again before you open up the actual
