that<00:01:09.880> they<00:01:10.000> could<00:01:10.060> all<00:01:10.270> harmoniously<00:01:10.899> exist

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
that they could all harmoniously exist

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.560 
that they could all harmoniously exist
and<00:01:11.590> interact<00:01:12.190> with<00:01:12.369> each<00:01:12.430> other<00:01:12.610> at<00:01:13.390> this

year's<00:01:13.840> CES<00:01:14.050> I'm<00:01:14.530> looking<00:01:15.070> forward<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.550> seeing

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
year's CES I'm looking forward to seeing

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.450 
year's CES I'm looking forward to seeing
how<00:01:16.060> people<00:01:16.090> have<00:01:16.479> taken<00:01:16.660> advantage<00:01:16.899> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
how people have taken advantage of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.160 
how people have taken advantage of
connectivity<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.820> kind<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.479> next<00:01:19.750> step<00:01:19.960> I

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
connectivity in kind of the next step I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.330 
connectivity in kind of the next step I
feel<00:01:20.500> like<00:01:20.619> we've<00:01:20.800> seen<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.130> first

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
feel like we've seen the first

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.090 
feel like we've seen the first
generation<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.940> connected<00:01:22.390> cars<00:01:22.630> already

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
generation of connected cars already

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.410 
generation of connected cars already
over<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.190> last<00:01:24.399> few<00:01:24.580> years<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.000> now<00:01:25.360> we're

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
over the last few years and now we're

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.660 
over the last few years and now we're
really<00:01:25.720> evolving<00:01:26.649> into<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.979> next<00:01:27.280> level<00:01:27.580> of

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
really evolving into the next level of

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.669 
really evolving into the next level of
connectivity<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.390> what's<00:01:28.570> possible<00:01:29.170> within

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
connectivity and what's possible within

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.320 
connectivity and what's possible within
a<00:01:29.890> car<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.310> has<00:01:30.429> a<00:01:30.460> persistent<00:01:30.970> internet

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
a car that has a persistent internet

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.749 
a car that has a persistent internet
connection<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.039> sharing<00:01:33.039> that<00:01:33.160> data<00:01:33.369> with

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
connection and sharing that data with

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.130 
connection and sharing that data with
the<00:01:33.789> cloud<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:34.360> leveraging<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.840> lot<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.050> those

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
the cloud and leveraging a lot of those

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.350 
the cloud and leveraging a lot of those
services<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.920> think<00:01:36.399> will<00:01:36.490> also<00:01:36.729> be<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> big<00:01:37.119> part

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
services I think will also be a big part

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.490 
services I think will also be a big part
of<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.539> automotive<00:01:37.929> industry<00:01:37.990> going<00:01:38.410> forward

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
of the automotive industry going forward

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.069 
of the automotive industry going forward
and<00:01:39.039> I'm<00:01:39.160> looking<00:01:39.369> forward<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.820> seeing<00:01:40.079> what

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
and I'm looking forward to seeing what

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.100 
and I'm looking forward to seeing what
people<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.590> developed<00:01:41.740> around<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:43.110> making

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
people have developed around that making

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.109 
people have developed around that making
these<00:01:44.229> concept<00:01:44.740> cars<00:01:44.950> requires<00:01:45.460> long<00:01:45.790> hours

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
these concept cars requires long hours

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.210 
these concept cars requires long hours
of<00:01:46.240> work<00:01:46.619> sacrifices<00:01:47.619> on<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.979> part<00:01:48.189> of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
of work sacrifices on the part of

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.830 
of work sacrifices on the part of
everyone<00:01:48.549> involved<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.150> it's<00:01:49.329> easy<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.720> get

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
everyone involved and it's easy to get

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.630 
everyone involved and it's easy to get
discouraged<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.619> lose<00:01:50.799> focus<00:01:51.040> what<00:01:51.490> they're

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
discouraged and lose focus what they're

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.210 
discouraged and lose focus what they're
actually<00:01:51.790> for<00:01:52.210> when<00:01:53.140> we<00:01:53.290> ship<00:01:53.590> them<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> show

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
actually for when we ship them to a show

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.819 
actually for when we ship them to a show
and<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.820> see<00:01:55.030> how<00:01:55.149> proud<00:01:55.450> everyone<00:01:56.079> at<00:01:56.200> qnx<00:01:56.619> is

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
and I see how proud everyone at qnx is

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.440 
and I see how proud everyone at qnx is
that<00:01:57.280> we<00:01:57.490> put<00:01:57.729> something<00:01:58.060> in<00:01:58.149> front<00:01:58.180> of<00:01:58.390> the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
that we put something in front of the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.539 
that we put something in front of the
world<00:01:58.600> which<00:01:58.930> really<00:01:59.110> showcases<00:01:59.890> our<00:02:00.009> leading

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
world which really showcases our leading

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.730 
world which really showcases our leading
technology<00:02:01.149> in

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
technology in

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.420 
technology in
I<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.759> all<00:02:02.909> worth<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:04.040> out<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.189> all<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
I see it's all worth it out of all the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
I see it's all worth it out of all the
UNIX<00:02:05.790> concept<00:02:06.210> cars<00:02:06.420> my<00:02:06.810> favorite<00:02:07.229> was<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
UNIX concept cars my favorite was the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.620 
UNIX concept cars my favorite was the
