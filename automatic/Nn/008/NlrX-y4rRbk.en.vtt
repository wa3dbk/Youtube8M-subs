00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
the contrast of your remote control by

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.969 
the contrast of your remote control by
going<00:06:22.569> to<00:06:22.689> options<00:06:22.830> configuration<00:06:23.830> and

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
going to options configuration and

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.980 
going to options configuration and
contrast<00:06:24.490> I<00:06:24.699> actually<00:06:25.270> had<00:06:25.539> a<00:06:25.569> problem<00:06:25.750> with

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
contrast I actually had a problem with

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.100 
contrast I actually had a problem with
the<00:06:26.050> contrast<00:06:26.439> in<00:06:26.560> the<00:06:26.650> v3<00:06:27.069> but<00:06:27.550> this<00:06:28.110> looking

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
the contrast in the v3 but this looking

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.079 
the contrast in the v3 but this looking
at<00:06:29.199> it<00:06:29.349> now<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.529> contrast<00:06:30.279> appears<00:06:30.849> to<00:06:30.969> be

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
at it now the contrast appears to be

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:32.339 
at it now the contrast appears to be
fine<00:06:31.300> so<00:06:31.479> I<00:06:31.539> don't<00:06:31.690> really<00:06:31.810> need<00:06:32.020> to<00:06:32.139> do<00:06:32.259> it

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
fine so I don't really need to do it

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:33.600 
fine so I don't really need to do it
this<00:06:32.440> time<00:06:32.500> but<00:06:32.830> you<00:06:32.949> might<00:06:33.159> have<00:06:33.339> that<00:06:33.430> option

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
this time but you might have that option

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.519 
this time but you might have that option
anyway<00:06:34.180> I<00:06:34.300> hope<00:06:34.509> you<00:06:34.569> liked<00:06:34.750> that<00:06:34.779> video<00:06:35.050> and
