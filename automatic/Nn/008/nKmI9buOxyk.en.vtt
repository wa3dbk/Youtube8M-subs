hello<00:00:09.900> everybody<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.410> welcome<00:00:10.770> back<00:00:11.040> today

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
hello everybody and welcome back today

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.130 
hello everybody and welcome back today
we<00:00:11.850> will<00:00:11.940> talk<00:00:12.120> about<00:00:12.270> the<00:00:12.630> pulmonary

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 
we will talk about the pulmonary

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.480 
we will talk about the pulmonary
circulation

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
circulation

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.710 
circulation
first<00:00:16.529> when<00:00:17.529> the<00:00:17.680> blood<00:00:18.210> entered<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.420> heart

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
first when the blood entered the heart

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.470 
first when the blood entered the heart
through<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.439> vena<00:00:20.860> cava<00:00:21.900> he<00:00:22.900> falls<00:00:23.260> into<00:00:23.529> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
through the vena cava he falls into the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.140 
through the vena cava he falls into the
right<00:00:25.740> after<00:00:26.740> him<00:00:26.830> then<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.419> blood<00:00:28.720> is<00:00:30.150> pumped

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
right after him then the blood is pumped

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.450 
right after him then the blood is pumped
inside<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:32.019> right<00:00:32.320> ventricle<00:00:33.070> when<00:00:33.340> the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
inside the right ventricle when the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.530 
inside the right ventricle when the
right<00:00:33.670> atrium<00:00:34.330> contracts<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:37.059> blood<00:00:37.269> is

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
right atrium contracts so the blood is

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.710 
right atrium contracts so the blood is
forced<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.430> accumulate<00:00:39.430> here<00:00:39.879> and<00:00:40.120> the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
forced to accumulate here and the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.700 
forced to accumulate here and the
tricuspid<00:00:41.470> valve<00:00:47.580> closes<00:00:49.199> then<00:00:50.199> the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
tricuspid valve closes then the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.320 
tricuspid valve closes then the
ventricle<00:00:51.280> contracts<00:00:53.640> forcing<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.760> clock<00:00:55.000> to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
ventricle contracts forcing the clock to

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.439 
ventricle contracts forcing the clock to
move<00:00:55.570> through<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.409> pulmonary<00:00:57.030> artery<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
move through the pulmonary artery the

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.039 
move through the pulmonary artery the
pulmonary<00:01:02.110> artery<00:01:03.330> begins<00:01:04.330> from<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.780> heart

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
pulmonary artery begins from the heart

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.830 
pulmonary artery begins from the heart
and<00:01:05.650> then<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.280> branches<00:01:06.520> into<00:01:06.850> smaller<00:01:07.510> and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
and then it branches into smaller and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.219 
and then it branches into smaller and
smaller<00:01:08.850> petals<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.150> then<00:01:10.689> blood

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
smaller petals and then blood

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.030 
smaller petals and then blood
capillaries<00:01:11.979> which<00:01:12.159> are<00:01:12.310> found<00:01:12.549> in<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.030> lungs

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
capillaries which are found in the lungs

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.230 
capillaries which are found in the lungs
the<00:01:15.040> blood<00:01:15.070> which<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.670> turn<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.030> heart

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
the blood which in turn the heart

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.709 
the blood which in turn the heart
through<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.750> vena<00:01:17.260> cava<00:01:17.650> is<00:01:18.210> carrying<00:01:19.210> carbon

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
through the vena cava is carrying carbon

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.560 
through the vena cava is carrying carbon
dioxide<00:01:20.259> so<00:01:21.039> this<00:01:21.369> black<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.240> excision

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
dioxide so this black is the excision

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:31.620 
dioxide so this black is the excision
aided<00:01:23.079> blood

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.520 

and<00:01:32.200> it's<00:01:32.500> scary<00:01:32.590> carbon<00:01:33.340> dioxide<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.869> it

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and it's scary carbon dioxide because it

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.459 
and it's scary carbon dioxide because it
carries<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.369> metabolic<00:01:37.060> wastes<00:01:37.689> after

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
carries the metabolic wastes after

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.840 
carries the metabolic wastes after
burning<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.579> food<00:01:39.820> so<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.130> black<00:01:42.369> carrying

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
burning the food so the black carrying

burning the food so the black carrying
the<00:01:42.970> carbon<00:01:43.329> dioxide<00:01:43.450> goes<00:01:44.320> into<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.220> lungs

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the carbon dioxide goes into the lungs

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.929 
the carbon dioxide goes into the lungs
and<00:01:45.929> through<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.289> semipermeable<00:01:47.979> blood

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
and through the semipermeable blood

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.809 
and through the semipermeable blood
capillaries<00:01:49.619> diffusion<00:01:50.619> occurs<00:01:50.979> carbon

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
capillaries diffusion occurs carbon

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.850 
capillaries diffusion occurs carbon
dioxide<00:01:52.299> comes<00:01:53.020> out<00:01:53.259> from<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.649> black

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
dioxide comes out from the black

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.730

instead<00:02:02.560> of<00:02:02.710> being<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.159> excision<00:02:03.429> aidid

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
instead of being the excision aidid

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:12.289 
instead of being the excision aidid
black<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.659> becomes<00:02:05.459> oxygenated<00:02:06.459> blood<00:02:10.769> and

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
black it becomes oxygenated blood and

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.990 
black it becomes oxygenated blood and
then<00:02:13.299> it<00:02:13.750> moves<00:02:14.049> once<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:14.709> through<00:02:15.040> luxuries

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
then it moves once more through luxuries

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.100 
then it moves once more through luxuries
which<00:02:16.420> segregate<00:02:17.230> into<00:02:18.060> bigger<00:02:19.060> pin<00:02:19.870> holes

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
which segregate into bigger pin holes

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.530 
which segregate into bigger pin holes
and<00:02:20.319> then<00:02:20.519> beans<00:02:21.519> which<00:02:23.430> finally<00:02:24.430> pour<00:02:25.060> their

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and then beans which finally pour their

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.030 
and then beans which finally pour their
contents<00:02:26.200> our<00:02:26.530> oxygen<00:02:27.280> into<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:29.040> pulmonary

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
contents our oxygen into the pulmonary

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.259 
contents our oxygen into the pulmonary
vein<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:32.560> bruises<00:02:33.190> from<00:02:33.370> tanks<00:02:33.790> inside

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
vein and it bruises from tanks inside

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.670

circulation the next time we will talk

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.430 
circulation the next time we will talk
about<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.130> systemic<00:02:43.030> circulation<00:02:43.510> which

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
about the systemic circulation which

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.280 
about the systemic circulation which
begins<00:02:44.920> from<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.430> left<00:02:45.700> atrium<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.720> until

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
begins from the left atrium and until

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.780 
begins from the left atrium and until
then<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.620> thank<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:47.920> for<00:02:48.040> watching<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.609> see

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
then I thank you for watching and see
