00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.000
 quinté plus and 5-5 to accompany me 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 today the lovely Filipino 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.869
 bun hello filippino jean philippe 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 then go to the racecourse of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.500
 longchamp this Sunday a test where we 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.000
 knows the protagonists of the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.260
 5 5 horses but also 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.140
 horses that shined at semi level 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.910
 classic is almost a very good 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.180
 lot it's horses that ran a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.160
 group iii some are placed there in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.200
 even one who participated in the hen 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 test we will come back so that's 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.149
 really a very good horses to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.890
 quality water 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.450
 just talk about quality we're going 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.800
 listen to your philippines selection 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.640
 so so in mind I put my choice in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.809
 2nd position I compliment myself gold 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.079
 third genghis fourth sleepers best 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.390
 11th 11 louvain for fifth place 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.969
 then the 3rd line biarrot on the 14th 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.650
 October and the 6th Gothic 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.850
 ok be careful with the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.619
 pronunciation it's not won for me 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.330
 so the 13 good choice that's enough 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.549
 simple moreover it is the holder of the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.130
 title to the 100% on the course we go on 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.360
 could not dismiss it so here 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.689
 actually it's the title holder 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.939
 it's a female but the angels have 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.930
 no sense so she was first and 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.510
 third on this course 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.800
 so that she is wearing a little pea 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.330
 yann barberot told us she 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.510
 returned very very well after a small 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.960
 empty passage is therefore down 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.040
 chart with this favorable weight and in 39 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.870
 5 of value it can clearly 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.530
 to prevail yes it is the basis of logic 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.360
 of this event 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.520
 we will oppose him the oci logically a 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.020
 ball the two compliments wrong three 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.970
 accessits in four tent camps 90 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.920
 during on this on this route 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.300
 it has already been placed semi 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.190
 classic which is still not bad 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.420
 quite logical of sassuolo position of the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.250
 court yes but ben it's a horse of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.710
 quality it comes from groups 1 after 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 so the good is there a descent 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.700
 a few levels we do not know but finally 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.399
 he was still fourth in the price of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.229
 royal palace finally at the end of May so he has 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.750
 very well done this year he likes 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.610
 on the course 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.390
 it's maxim guyon he rides that the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.209
 knows by heart 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.100
 and in addition he drew the number 3 at the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.340
 rope and the places to the agreement are very 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.840
 important on this course so it is 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.400
 fresh and go 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.230
 xavier thomas demeault it's still 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.690
 a good club coach 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.580
 that's the logic and to know 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.019
 a little more ali bouakaz was at the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.549
 meeting guyon who talks to us 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.920
 chances of his partner have 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.260
 listen in maxi Sunday I 'll be there 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.610
 associate accomplished mentor in boarder 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.500
 of xavier thomas demeault you had 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.670
 the opportunity of already mounted what are 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.190
 his characteristics 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.600
 it's a horse that 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.250
 it's a horse that ran against 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 to be a very good choice every time 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.080
 the cracking and group horses 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.310
 he defended himself as he often could 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.650
 very very well unfortunately the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.090
 last time it's a horse who 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.920
 can be pretty bright she's in 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.910
 my faith here it was I could not hide I 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.770
 took two three little strokes what this 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.360
 who did that he shot a lot I 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.160
 let him move forward so he can 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.420
 breathe and then after that he had some 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.250
 too much done and could not speed up but 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.110
 there it goes down grade should well 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.610
 behave in any case he will have to 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.830
 advantage of being confirmed on this 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.240
 course it will be an asset in your game 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.070
 yes, it's true it's me 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.780
 flatter rushed several times on 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.070
 this track there he knows it by heart 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.150
 here I hope there is going to be a whole 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.520
 little bit of rhythm so that I can 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.630
 does not put it less free and they 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.250
 do not shoot too much otherwise it's a horse 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.780
 kéké better than that before the shot 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.110
 now we will see how he gets 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.640
 behave well we understood it is rather 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.110
 the trust of the guyon maxim 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.790
 nothing to add to what he has 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.410
 said it was almost everything in 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.330
 third position the number 7 is a 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.040
 slips third on this early trace 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.990
 July the horse is at the top 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.330
 good number ah in the stalls 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.830
 be wary yes so he was deemed worthy of 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.350
 participate in the test hen 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.850
 foals last year good he was 8th 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.070
 but hey he certainly has 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.630
 defended so there this year they 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.210
 no longer evolve at all level 1 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.310
 but despite everything he stays on two 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.380
 beautiful places in races to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.180
 conditions of type d so 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.330
 here is one on the course in 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.550
 question he has the 5 to the rope and runs to 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.070
 his fees mounted by pasquet good it's 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.520
 not me it's still a very good 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.800
 horse 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.930
 after maybe he had a 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.040
 small decrease of diet but it is necessary him 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.810
 to trust I think we made him 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.610
 trust we will buy it back in the fourth 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.380
 position number 10 it's a subject all 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.390
 nine only six outputs it to 100% of 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.770
 success in longchamp good year bad year he 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.760
 starts on the new track but hey 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.680
 no worries it's a good 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.120
 training and I like horses 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.770
 like that they do not have many classes 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.240
 they do not know yet so much 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.280
 they are worth but it's interesting to 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.140
 to see in any case actually she has 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.940
 always been on arrival never again 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.470
 far as fifth it starts in the 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.440
 disabilities with a weight of distrust 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.500
 but good anyway and it is the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.450
 rope 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.249
 so that's important she likes the good 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.139
 field and 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.329
 this is antoine hamelin who rides it 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.039
 it is he who won the challenge of 

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:58.689
 games she has recently so it's a 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.649
 it's still a jockey who has a 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.860
 little bit on the rise right now 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.900
 very cool and 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.759
 here I am curious to see her in 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.500
 any case at work good at the aura understood 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.729
 it's a bit your favorite in his 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.849
 composition I reminded a little 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.469
 poker shot the 11 louvain bond and the 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.030
 second on this course it was in May 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.669
 last and it was in this category 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.960
 rather well engaged it can be the rating 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.460
 interesting of the test yes because 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.680
 it's a game it's a very competitor 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.030
 seasoned but they alternate the good and 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.120
 less good that is not really 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.949
 regular 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.840
 but he has longchamp titles 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.020
 he was second of the price of chevilly 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.660
 over 1400 meters in May so he knows 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.669
 well the course also he was 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.889
 supplemented which is not negligible 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.260
 and then I think it can turn out 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.040
 dangerous still a river always 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.650
 pay attention to the horses 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.220
 Additional this is not what not 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.680
 harmless according to marc castel son 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.510
 coach the distance is ok the form 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.919
 is ok he's riding a little bit of 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.630
 category but I think he can 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.820
 get a place that can surprise 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.860
 so the victory well in place and forced 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.300
 steel we will have understood not listened 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.100
 thanks a lot to the philippines for 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.479
