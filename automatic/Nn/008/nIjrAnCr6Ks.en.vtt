00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.950
 Condenser microphone 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.500
 pc microphone high sound quality pc microphone microphone 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.610
 It is written here, but it is written 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.710
 Sony ecm hi you pcv 80 u 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.829
 8 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.850
 Elect Re' 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.200
 In terms of electret condenser microphones 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.930
 It is a condenser microphone 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.940
 Ettoko of product I think that there are those who have the General Assembly you were everyone of pretty ne user tuber 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.440
 But 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.600
 The famous Kurt Mountain and Lifeguard 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.630
 youtube users too 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:23.159
 I bought this condenser microphone 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 8 I am a little bit concerned about this Lancer Mike right now 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 I bought it today, yes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.079
 The go and opening with a spoon and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.079
 I want to go there 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:44.110
 I guess I Tteyuu I condenser microphone scan is 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.690
 I think that there are two types of ordinary microphones among computer users but I 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.870
 I don't know it's not funny but 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.810
 And after that condenser microphone 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:58.880
 It seems that there is a dynamic sheet 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.520
 By the law of the condenser microphone, this is a dynamic microphone. 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.000
 Excuse me 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 Sound 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.960
 Oh dynamically 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.510
 Do you say to pick up 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:20.270
 It seems that 8 dynamic sounds are heard 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.440
 Condenser microphones seem not to be the depth of the sound of the abandoned Sankodo , though 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.840
 Well 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:31.370
 Sounds of the surroundings are often shown, yes this is a racer microphone now 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.370
 Maybe I could change the camera day 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:47.159

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.520
 If you open it first 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.520
 Let's take a shot later 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.000

 Well it's a stand, the size is quite small 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.500

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.260

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.319
 Well Well canned coffee of fact Kedomo it's different 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.950
 Canned coffee and small canned coffee but 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.610
 About together 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.610
 Is it the size of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.670
 Well here is a good fixed It is the lower part of the stand 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.970
 Here 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.970

 I also have a logo of sony 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.910
 After all as height 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.900
 It looks almost the same height as the canned coffee 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.769
 Do 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.769
 I think that want to go 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.180
 First of all, in front of the microphone 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.400
 It enters here with high sound quality by bsb connection, but 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.750
 Well this is ぇ 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.750
 What did you say 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.470
 When 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.400
 esb audio box 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:49.740
 That thing You're Sony Well 80 of uab called 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.740
 Audio box is included 4 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.830
 Well door Well it has right is to say I open here only from a little while ago 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:00.670
 audio out it's a microphone character 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.090
 And here we only report to usb 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:09.810
 Cormorant looks pretty light this we become to these Year 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.590
 Then this is of this agent 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.590
 It is a microphone 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.360
 The 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.360
 This is a microphone 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:38.620
 The switch of the sound country is attached with the usual microphone 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:42.169
 Then there is a red line here and this is an ordinary microphone connection terminal. 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.529
 futura It is not this which is one 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.560
 6 points 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.430
 I'd guy of about in the community 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.780
 This is uh 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.400
 Usual 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:58.030
 It will be in the microphone terminal 3.5 mm plug mini plug 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:02.620
 8 col and it is It is also Tomo usually become a cable mini-plug 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.750
 It is necessary to convert it to this mini club, but here is originally this 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.460
 I see you 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.480
 Well this is a microphone that is made for personal computers , so if it's this from the beginning of the difference 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.430
 I think 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.430
 Then I will try to connect three times 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.960
 Put on the stand 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.870
 Is it like this? 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.660
 As height 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.960
 If you show this much 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.960
 W 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.160
 Is 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:35.950
 The destination says canned coffee but tourism c is 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:41.590
 Will it be about 3 heights for one and fingers? 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:43.120
 Well that's not too expensive to be alone in this star , but it's a stand that can be used enough 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:49.900
 I think 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:51.810
 Well then here is the usb audio box 2 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.200
 Hojo goal disappeared 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:58.630
 Where is this place 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.630
 Are now connected to the ou box also whether oh well 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:07.810
 And it inserted inaugurated to be here a microphone to both box 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:14.800
 It's about making it white for your computer 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:18.249
 So I think I would like to make a sound quality test if I can get it 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:23.800
 This time to sea food review 

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:24.840
 Well this is 0.5m, so it's 50cm 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.320
 Hey ! 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.270
 I think this cable is long enough to be usable enough 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:37.260
 So I introduced this time 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:44.430
 You're right here pc Microphone high quality PC vocal microphone 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:45.120

 I don't know if it starts but it 's 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.060
 It was an introduction and it is made of Sony 

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.470
 that's all
