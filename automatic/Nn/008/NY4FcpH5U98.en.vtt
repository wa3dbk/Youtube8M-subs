00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.750 
refined silver or you can get normal
silver<00:04:27.229> ingot<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.860> for<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.729> need

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
silver ingot and for that you need

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.990 
silver ingot and for that you need
silver<00:04:29.210> now<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:29.960> get<00:04:30.350> silver<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:31.520> need<00:04:31.699> to<00:04:31.850> go

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
silver now to get silver you need to go

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.250 
silver now to get silver you need to go
to<00:04:33.010> dismantle<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:35.539> need<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.840> dismantle

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
to dismantle and you need to dismantle

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.400 
to dismantle and you need to dismantle
silver<00:04:37.190> or<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:38.000> way<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.300> will<00:04:38.599> get<00:04:38.780> silver

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
silver or that way you will get silver

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.100 
silver or that way you will get silver
just<00:04:39.979> basic<00:04:40.400> silver<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.000> when<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.570> have<00:04:41.780> ten

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
just basic silver and when you have ten

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.580 
just basic silver and when you have ten
basic<00:04:42.650> silver<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:44.240> will<00:04:44.270> be<00:04:44.810> able<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.200> craft<00:04:45.680> a

I'm hereby dismantling the blond text I

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.149 
I'm hereby dismantling the blond text I
will<00:05:33.320> get<00:05:33.650> one<00:05:33.889> heft<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.430> one<00:05:34.729> steel<00:05:34.940> ingot<00:05:36.159> by

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
will get one heft and one steel ingot by

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.520 
will get one heft and one steel ingot by
dismantling<00:05:37.880> for<00:05:38.180> example<00:05:38.659> silver<00:05:39.110> ingot<00:05:39.409> I

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
dismantling for example silver ingot I

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.620 
dismantling for example silver ingot I
will<00:05:39.680> get<00:05:39.800> silver<00:05:40.130> ore<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.550> by<00:05:40.700> dismantling

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
will get silver ore and by dismantling

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.080 
will get silver ore and by dismantling
or<00:05:41.900> I<00:05:41.960> will<00:05:42.320> get<00:05:42.410> silver<00:05:42.890> so<00:05:43.190> I<00:05:43.220> put<00:05:43.700> silver

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
or I will get silver so I put silver

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.670 
or I will get silver so I put silver
ingot<00:05:44.450> but<00:05:44.690> you<00:05:44.810> never<00:05:45.110> want<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.410> do<00:05:45.530> that

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
ingot but you never want to do that

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.170 
ingot but you never want to do that
basically<00:05:45.890> because<00:05:46.250> he'll<00:05:46.520> bring<00:05:46.700> us<00:05:46.820> are<00:05:47.000> far

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
basically because he'll bring us are far

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.870 
basically because he'll bring us are far
more<00:05:47.210> valuable<00:05:47.390> than<00:05:47.870> silver<00:05:48.370> but<00:05:49.370> if<00:05:49.550> you<00:05:49.670> get

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
more valuable than silver but if you get

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.120 
more valuable than silver but if you get
basic<00:05:50.600> silver<00:05:50.840> from<00:05:51.140> silver<00:05:51.500> ore<00:05:51.710> then<00:05:51.980> you

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
basic silver from silver ore then you

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.090 
basic silver from silver ore then you
can<00:05:52.310> craft<00:05:52.610> yourself<00:05:52.760> ingots<00:05:53.860> now<00:05:54.860> there<00:05:55.040> are

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
can craft yourself ingots now there are

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.180 
can craft yourself ingots now there are
a<00:05:55.160> couple<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:55.490> things<00:05:55.790> you<00:05:56.000> can<00:05:56.300> also<00:05:56.450> craft

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
a couple of things you can also craft

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.500 
a couple of things you can also craft
for<00:05:58.190> example<00:05:58.520> there<00:05:58.610> is<00:05:58.730> a<00:05:58.760> dark<00:05:59.000> steel<00:05:59.270> plate

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
for example there is a dark steel plate

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.270 
for example there is a dark steel plate
to<00:05:59.750> get<00:05:59.900> dark<00:06:00.110> steel<00:06:00.410> plate<00:06:00.680> you<00:06:00.830> need<00:06:00.920> direct

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
to get dark steel plate you need direct

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.250 
to get dark steel plate you need direct
still<00:06:01.460> ingot<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:02.000> get<00:06:02.180> dark<00:06:02.360> steel<00:06:02.660> ingot<00:06:03.080> you

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
still ingot to get dark steel ingot you

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.120 
still ingot to get dark steel ingot you
need<00:06:03.440> dark<00:06:04.220> iron<00:06:04.580> ore<00:06:04.970> and<00:06:05.380> still<00:06:06.380> England<00:06:06.860> now

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
need dark iron ore and still England now

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.070 
need dark iron ore and still England now
I<00:06:07.160> already<00:06:07.490> cover<00:06:07.910> how<00:06:08.090> to<00:06:08.120> craft<00:06:08.600> stealing

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
I already cover how to craft stealing

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.810 
I already cover how to craft stealing
about<00:06:09.320> to<00:06:09.410> get<00:06:09.530> dark<00:06:09.800> iron<00:06:10.190> ore<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:12.050> need<00:06:12.230> to

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
about to get dark iron ore you need to

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.700 
about to get dark iron ore you need to
buy<00:06:13.820> it<00:06:13.880> from<00:06:14.300> a<00:06:14.420> merchant<00:06:14.750> or<00:06:15.080> get<00:06:15.260> it<00:06:15.440> through

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
buy it from a merchant or get it through

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.120 
buy it from a merchant or get it through
in<00:06:15.980> the<00:06:16.540> gate<00:06:17.540> to<00:06:17.780> get<00:06:18.080> it<00:06:18.200> in<00:06:18.770> the<00:06:18.920> specific

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
in the gate to get it in the specific

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.100 
in the gate to get it in the specific
regions<00:06:19.790> or<00:06:19.970> what<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.150> haven't<00:06:20.750> found<00:06:20.930> it<00:06:21.050> yet

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
regions or what I haven't found it yet

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.930 
regions or what I haven't found it yet
because<00:06:21.590> they<00:06:21.770> are<00:06:21.890> kind<00:06:22.340> of<00:06:22.430> tougher<00:06:22.760> to<00:06:22.910> find

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
because they are kind of tougher to find

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.420 
because they are kind of tougher to find
now<00:06:23.750> I<00:06:23.780> have<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.230> medium<00:06:24.680> or<00:06:24.890> and<00:06:25.160> glowing

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
now I have the medium or and glowing
