00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.160
 the worlds we could actually feel 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.470
 the smell of the sweat and blood of their enemies 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.690

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.590
 the development of hellraid previously led to the engine 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.150

 virtual reality developers 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.530
 made an important decision to change the engine 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.360
 they refused unity in favor of unreal 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.400
 engine 4 representatives of the system peak 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.620
 explained that during the work on the network 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.870
 dust shooter 514 well studied 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.850
 technology opportunities epic games unreal 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.620
 engine is better familiar to developers 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.630
 so the studio decided 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.460
 stop the choice on this engine 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.410
 besides, as noted by the host 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.600
 programmer and valkyrie sigurda argun 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.310
 Orson Anaryl Engine 4 Seriously 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.050
 surpasses unity in terms of working with 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.970
 lighting however on the gameplay 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.890
 changing the engine will not affect 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.910
 Recall that they will Valkyrie 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.919

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.520

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.680
 morpheus 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.200
 It is assumed that the game will be released on the PC and 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.580
 playstation 4 until the end of this year but 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.410
 just above the developers have not yet called 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.850
 sony online entertainment team wants 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.190

 make really horrible zombies 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.070
 quote from john smedley if you 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.870
 watched the walking dead 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.060
 then feel at home in the sense 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.280
 atmospheres that we try to create in 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.260
 the game we want you to be afraid of zombies and 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.910
 other players end of quotation 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.490
 despite the comparison of the new project 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.380
 sony sd and z are a lot of players say that 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.270
 post-apocalyptic bohemian game 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.729
 meeting players is often worse than 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.560
 meeting with zombie developers speech stabs 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.770

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.530
 genre quote of course dsn inspired us 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.510
 to create and closet z2 to be honest we 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.220
 drew inspiration from many games 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.080
 but I would say that yes and z became one 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.360
 the most catalyst for the development of our 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.970
 project if you like zombie games on 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.800
 pk you should play daisy because 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.200
 play is not very fun the team has done 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.360
 excellent job in creating the apocalypse 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.970
 but we look at yes and z as their version 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.770
 apocalypse we have our ideas we 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.479
 there are many new features and this is not 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.529
 just a new opportunity but also its own 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.319
 own excuses 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.149
 the end of the quote developers are not going 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.019
 limited to release each month z 

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.669

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:01.019
 According to the media for developers 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.389
 concentrated on working on 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:05.749
 pc version but in the future the game can 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.399
 appear on playstation 4 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:11.519
