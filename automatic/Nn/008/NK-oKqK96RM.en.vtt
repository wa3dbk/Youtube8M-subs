hey guys welcome back to another mod
review<00:00:02.550> it's<00:00:02.669> been<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> while<00:00:02.970> since<00:00:03.120> I've<00:00:03.270> done

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
review it's been a while since I've done

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.579 
review it's been a while since I've done
this<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.659> I've<00:00:03.780> actually<00:00:03.929> done<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:04.380> mod

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
this and I've actually done this mod

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.309 
this and I've actually done this mod
already<00:00:05.040> but<00:00:06.029> it<00:00:06.089> was<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.240> pretty<00:00:06.420> bad<00:00:06.750> overview

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
already but it was a pretty bad overview

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.320 
already but it was a pretty bad overview
of<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> mod<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:07.980> i<00:00:08.010> am<00:00:08.220> doing<00:00:08.370> craftable<00:00:09.090> mob

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
of the mod but i am doing craftable mob

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.200 
of the mod but i am doing craftable mob
spawners<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.650> was<00:00:10.830> made<00:00:11.429> by<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.969> guy

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
spawners and this was made by a guy

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.730 
spawners and this was made by a guy
named<00:00:12.630> boo<00:00:13.110> i<00:00:13.410> want<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.650> say<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:15.960> boo<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.500> his

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
named boo i want to say the boo is his

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.429 
named boo i want to say the boo is his
name<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.660> who<00:00:18.750> made<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.199> very

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
name so that is who made it it's a very

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.150 
name so that is who made it it's a very
nice<00:00:20.130> mod<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.900> basically<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.949> way<00:00:23.010> that

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
nice mod and so basically the way that

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.740 
nice mod and so basically the way that
it<00:00:23.250> works<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.640> will<00:00:23.789> allow<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> craft

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
it works is it will allow you to craft

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
it works is it will allow you to craft
any<00:00:25.080> mob<00:00:25.230> spawner<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:26.519> long<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
any mob spawner as long as you have the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:27.950 
any mob spawner as long as you have the
right<00:00:26.970> material<00:00:27.449> scenario

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
right material scenario

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.040 
right material scenario
so<00:00:28.289> each<00:00:29.279> mob<00:00:29.580> spawners<00:00:29.820> basically<00:00:30.480> her<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
so each mob spawners basically her is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.569 
so each mob spawners basically her is
essentially<00:00:31.500> crafted<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> same<00:00:32.369> manner

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
essentially crafted in the same manner

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
essentially crafted in the same manner
you<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.450> four<00:00:33.660> iron<00:00:33.870> ingots<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> knee

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you have four iron ingots and the knee

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.139 
you have four iron ingots and the knee
of<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.649> mossy<00:00:35.010> cobble<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> corner<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of your mossy cobble on the corner and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.900 
of your mossy cobble on the corner and
then<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> take<00:00:37.710> an<00:00:37.829> item<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.700> put

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
then when you take an item and you put

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.330 
then when you take an item and you put
it<00:00:39.000> inside<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:40.559> chest<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.219> guess

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it inside of the little chest I guess

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
it inside of the little chest I guess
you<00:00:41.460> could<00:00:41.550> call<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.899> then<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> actually<00:00:43.260> get

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you could call it then you actually get

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
you could call it then you actually get
a<00:00:43.410> craft<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:44.940> that's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
a craft that and then you get that's

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.020 
a craft that and then you get that's
fine<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.379> guess<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.950> pro<00:00:47.640> shop<00:00:47.850> will

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
fine so as you can guess a pro shop will

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.020 
fine so as you can guess a pro shop will
gig<00:00:48.210> few<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.870> picks<00:00:49.289> button<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.879> go

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
gig few a picks button so now if we go

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.479 
gig few a picks button so now if we go
along<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.449> craft<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:53.190> got<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> pig

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
along and craft this we got a pig

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.660 
along and craft this we got a pig
spawner<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:56.010> essentially<00:00:56.489> works

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
spawner and now this essentially works

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.420 
spawner and now this essentially works
just<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> was<00:00:57.449> expected<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.250> now<00:00:59.250> each

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
just as you was expected to you now each

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.340 
just as you was expected to you now each
of<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.760> do<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.030> their<00:01:00.510> requirements<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
of of them do have their requirements to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
of of them do have their requirements to
spawn<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.890> example<00:01:02.219> these<00:01:02.309> passive<00:01:02.699> mobs<00:01:02.940> do

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
spawn for example these passive mobs do

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.630 
spawn for example these passive mobs do
you<00:01:03.809> require<00:01:04.080> grass<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.189> believe<00:01:05.489> they

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you require grass and I believe they

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
you require grass and I believe they
also<00:01:05.820> require<00:01:06.299> light<00:01:06.799> now<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.540> big

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
also require light now so that's big

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.890 
also require light now so that's big
varnish<00:01:10.619> now<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> could<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.369> through<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.000> list

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
varnish now I could go through and list

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.590 
varnish now I could go through and list
each<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.830> different<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.400> site<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:15.420> what

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
each of the different one site or what

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.080 
each of the different one site or what
it<00:01:15.689> requires<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.110> craft<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.759> basically

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it requires to craft and so basically

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.719 
it requires to craft and so basically
it's<00:01:18.270> still<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> same<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.590> iron<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.549> like

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it's still the same for iron not like

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's still the same for iron not like
that<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.409> then<00:01:22.970> for<00:01:23.970> cobble<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.530> example

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that and then for cobble so for example

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
that and then for cobble so for example
to<00:01:25.920> craft<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.640> cow<00:01:27.119> spawner

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to craft a cow spawner

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.469 
to craft a cow spawner
you<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.259> raw<00:01:28.920> beef<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.939> chicken

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you would put raw beef there or chicken

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.289 
you would put raw beef there or chicken
you<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:30.689> put<00:01:30.960> raw<00:01:31.409> chicken<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.119> sheep<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
you would put raw chicken or sheep you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.980 
you would put raw chicken or sheep you
would<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.840> wool<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:35.090> mushroom<00:01:36.090> cow<00:01:36.299> you'd<00:01:36.570> put

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
would put wool or mushroom cow you'd put

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.840 
would put wool or mushroom cow you'd put
a<00:01:37.200> mushroom<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> I'm<00:01:41.430> not<00:01:41.610> gonna<00:01:41.759> go

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
a mushroom there so I'm not gonna go

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.819 
a mushroom there so I'm not gonna go
through<00:01:42.000> every<00:01:42.210> single<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.689> them<00:01:42.899> because

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
through every single one of them because

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920 
through every single one of them because
that<00:01:43.979> would<00:01:44.100> take<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> lot<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> time<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.780> will

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that would take a lot of time but I will

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.469 
that would take a lot of time but I will
have<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.170> link<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> forum<00:01:47.040> thread<00:01:47.479> down

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have the link to the forum thread down

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.510 
have the link to the forum thread down
in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.990> description<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.979> look<00:01:50.399> at

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
in the description so you can go look at
