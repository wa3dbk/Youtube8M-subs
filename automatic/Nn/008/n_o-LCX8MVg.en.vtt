search-and-destroy<00:01:24.360> bomb<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.290> here

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
search-and-destroy bomb like right here

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
search-and-destroy bomb like right here
where<00:01:25.740> I'm<00:01:25.860> aiming<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> side

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
where I'm aiming it's just out of side

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.969 
where I'm aiming it's just out of side
of<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.450> window<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> hear<00:01:28.740> someone

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
of this window but if you hear someone

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.850 
of this window but if you hear someone
defusing<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:30.060> cook<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.810> nade<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.409> bank<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
defusing you can cook a nade and bank it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
defusing you can cook a nade and bank it
off<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> window<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.640> gonna<00:01:32.790> land<00:01:32.939> right

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
off the window and it's gonna land right

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
off the window and it's gonna land right
next<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> bomb<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.530> useful

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
next to the bomb so that's really useful

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.550 
next to the bomb so that's really useful
now<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> most<00:01:36.119> useful<00:01:36.570> tips<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.320> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
now one of the most useful tips for this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.190 
now one of the most useful tips for this
map<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.070> what's<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> happen<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.570> lot

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
map is what's about to happen so a lot

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.170 
map is what's about to happen so a lot
of<00:01:40.229> people<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> only<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.759> get

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of people think that the only way to get

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.580 
of people think that the only way to get
from<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.570> side<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> map<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.259> other<00:01:43.439> on

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
from one side of the map to the other on

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.780 
from one side of the map to the other on
this<00:01:43.740> side<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> map<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> run<00:01:44.759> through

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
this side of the map is to run through

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
this side of the map is to run through
this<00:01:45.180> bucket<00:01:45.570> room<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.409> why<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
this bucket room so that's why a lot of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.440 
this bucket room so that's why a lot of
people<00:01:47.070> tend<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> camp<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.880> they'll<00:01:48.030> sit<00:01:48.240> here

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
people tend to camp it they'll sit here
