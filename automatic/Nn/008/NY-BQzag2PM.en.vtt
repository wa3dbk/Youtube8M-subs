00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
as you can tell right here see he has a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.350 
as you can tell right here see he has a
defense<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.670> doesn't<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.329> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
defense but it doesn't really do that

much<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.710> big<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.160> an

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
much so it's not really that big of an

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.150 
much so it's not really that big of an
epic<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:39.440> number<00:00:40.440> four<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.739> gonna<00:00:40.980> go<00:00:41.100> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
because if you guys didn't know it does

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.080 
because if you guys didn't know it does
i<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.219> bit<00:01:59.340> more<00:01:59.460> damaging<00:01:59.909> Green

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
i think a little bit more damaging Green

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.120 
i think a little bit more damaging Green
Lantern<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.540> also<00:02:00.990> his<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.740> used<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
Lantern and also his if you used that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.149 
Lantern and also his if you used that
trait<00:02:03.060> move<00:02:03.329> his<00:02:04.110> trade<00:02:04.409> move<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> only

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
trait move his trade move is the only

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.940 
trait move his trade move is the only
trade<00:02:05.520> move<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.890> block<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
trade move that you can actually block a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.550 
trade move that you can actually block a
super<00:02:08.429> move<00:02:08.640> by<00:02:08.879> punching<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.929> safer<00:02:10.440> means

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
super move by punching it so safer means

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.790 
super move by punching it so safer means
is<00:02:10.679> Lex<00:02:10.890> Luthor<00:02:11.069> does<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.360> super<00:02:13.260> move<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.620> I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
is Lex Luthor does a super move and I

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710 
is Lex Luthor does a super move and I
I have<00:02:13.980> my<00:02:14.160> traits<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.730> activate<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.270> punch<00:02:15.540> him

opinion<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:23.940> think<00:02:24.120> flash<00:02:24.540> has<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> really

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
opinion I just think flash has a really

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.440 
opinion I just think flash has a really
good<00:02:25.290> gimmick<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:26.220> slow<00:02:26.610> down<00:02:26.790> time<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.150> do

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
good gimmick you slow down time to do

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.510 
good gimmick you slow down time to do
multiple<00:02:27.660> combos<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.800> course<00:02:29.010> I'm<00:02:29.130> not<00:02:29.220> great

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
multiple combos of course I'm not great

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.560 
multiple combos of course I'm not great
with<00:02:29.550> them<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.240> all<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.510> stuff

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
with them so I can do all that stuff

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.030 
with them so I can do all that stuff
with<00:02:30.960> them<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.140> I've<00:02:31.260> seen<00:02:31.410> people<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.830> pull

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.140 
out some crazy shit with him I'm not
even<00:02:34.500> kidding<00:02:34.650> his<00:02:35.220> gimmick<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:35.910> useful

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
even kidding his gimmick is so useful

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180 
even kidding his gimmick is so useful
you<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:37.350> literally<00:02:37.680> stopped<00:02:38.010> so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
you can like just literally stopped so

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.950 
you can like just literally stopped so
much<00:02:38.310> combo<00:02:38.700> from<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.360> doing<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.810> like

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
much combo from just doing it like

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.150 
much combo from just doing it like
somebody<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.290> has<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.010> do

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
somebody just has you and then you do

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.310 
somebody just has you and then you do
that<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.520> they're<00:02:41.970> very<00:02:42.000> slow<00:02:42.570> down<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.080> i

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
that and they're very slow down so i

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.800 
that and they're very slow down so i
think<00:02:43.740> number<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.310> deserves<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.240> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
think number one deserves to go to the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.330 
think number one deserves to go to the
