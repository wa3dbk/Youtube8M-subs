 to create this bracelet 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.880
 we need a bar close 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.060

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.500
 inside the bracelet in this way 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.690
 take a piece of silver thread e 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.690
 let's create a closing dino side 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.600
 then take the tips the pliers a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.610
 round tip and the pliers with its beak lio 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.610
 curved and create our urbino 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:50.460
 let's insert the thread inside 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:55.140
 of the rhombus in this way 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 now we insert in crystal 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:08.450

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:15.260
 we insert the thread inside the other 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:20.180
 passerby we pull well we do so 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.280
 that the dinho is next to the passerby and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.280
 create another rabbi on the other side 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.860
 here is obviously created 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.939
 we don't care about another we all repeat 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.829
 past 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.599
 let's proceed in this way to create 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.120
 all nine pendants that will go 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.040
 within our portal 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.930
 now let's go create the bracelet 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.019
 we take our own 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.640
 chain and support it to one side 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.940
 employees and on the other hand we hook 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.010
 hanging from the chain counting 3 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.439
 crystals in each end ed 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.569
 hooking the pendant inside the 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.459
 third of the iv iii stall 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.069
 in this way with the hunter e 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.170
 crystals 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:43.310
 we open the shirt immediately after the third 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:45.700
 crystal release and a rascal mo un 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.700
 pendant 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.019
 we also open the shirt before the fourth 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.829
 crystal and we also hook that a 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.829
 mind 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.160
 we ask for the shirt 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.360
 and proceed by attacking all the pendants 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.750
 now the pendants are all hooked 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.370
 to one side of our therefore bed 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.320
 now we have to hang pendants 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.770
 on the other side of our bracelet 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.930
 to do this we always count you crystals 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.300
 of the first end and then two 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.730
 crystals of distance between a pendant 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:49.290
 the other here is hooked all the 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.990
 pendants to our bracelet now 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.220
 let's put our closure 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.050
 on one side and the other to do it 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.650
 we still have to open the last meshes 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:07.440
 and hook them to the attached shirt 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.990
 at our closure in this way 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:16.890
 let's open the mania 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.890
 we insert the suture we close 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.840
 let's open the other shirt 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.979
 we add 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.860
 me too 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.270
 and here is ours created 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.270
