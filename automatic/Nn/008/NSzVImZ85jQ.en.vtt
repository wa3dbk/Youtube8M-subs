vehicle find it has been installed it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.170 
vehicle find it has been installed it
came<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> factory<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.640> way<00:00:38.820> just

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
came from the factory that way just

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
came from the factory that way just
plugs<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.930> into<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.320> 4-pole<00:00:40.649> and

plugs in like so into your 4-pole and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.190 
plugs in like so into your 4-pole and
then<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.940> gets<00:00:42.120> grounded<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> body<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
then just gets grounded to the body of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.869 
then just gets grounded to the body of
the<00:00:43.260> vehicle<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.520> couple<00:00:44.789> extra

the vehicle you have a couple extra
wires<00:00:45.239> black<00:00:45.719> wire<00:00:46.050> gets<00:00:46.770> ran<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> battery

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
wires black wire gets ran to the battery

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.240 
wires black wire gets ran to the battery
blue<00:00:48.180> wire<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.750> actually<00:00:49.559> gets<00:00:49.860> ran<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
blue wire here actually gets ran to the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.369 
blue wire here actually gets ran to the
blue<00:00:50.399> wire<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.820> brake<00:00:51.000> controller<00:00:51.379> then

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
blue wire and your brake controller then

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.020 
blue wire and your brake controller then
finally<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.160> purple<00:00:53.550> wire<00:00:53.699> here

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
finally we have this purple wire here

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
finally we have this purple wire here
which<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.930> technically<00:00:55.260> gets<00:00:55.469> ran<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
which actually technically gets ran to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
which actually technically gets ran to
reverse<00:00:56.280> lights<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.120> need<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
reverse lights if you don't need this

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
reverse lights if you don't need this
wire<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> black<00:00:58.260> wire<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.039> don't<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
wire or a black wire you don't have to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.080 
wire or a black wire you don't have to
install<00:00:59.670> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
install it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.520 
install it
but<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.539> brakes<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.960> definitely<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
but for brakes you definitely have to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
but for brakes you definitely have to
have<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.219> blue<00:01:02.399> wire<00:01:02.609> installed<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.449> then

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
have the blue wire installed and then

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.149 
happens here just wire gets split back
and<00:01:28.979> gets<00:01:29.130> connected<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:30.360> wires<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:31.159> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and gets connected to two wires on the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.850 
and gets connected to two wires on the
4-pole<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.700> 7<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.210> 4-pole<00:01:33.420> adapter<00:01:33.860> what

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
4-pole to 7 and 4-pole adapter what

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.140 
4-pole to 7 and 4-pole adapter what
happens<00:01:35.220> basically<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.790> you're<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
happens basically is you're going to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
happens basically is you're going to
take<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> blue<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.689> black<00:01:36.810> wire<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.350> then

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
take the blue and black wire and then

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
take the blue and black wire and then
your<00:01:37.799> black<00:01:38.009> wire<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.909> ran<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> black

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
your black wire will get ran to black

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.270 
your black wire will get ran to black
you<00:01:39.720> want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> keep<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> same<00:01:41.159> as

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
you want to keep as much as the same as

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.340 
you want to keep as much as the same as
possible<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> white<00:01:42.810> wire<00:01:43.079> is

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
possible and then the white wire is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.859 
possible and then the white wire is
gonna<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.890> ran<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> blue<00:01:44.610> wire<00:01:44.869> here

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
gonna get ran to the blue wire here

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.590 
gonna get ran to the blue wire here

that reason why you want to go to the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.170 
that reason why you want to go to the
battery<00:02:02.280> first<00:02:02.490> because<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.090> always

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
battery first because you're always

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.810 
battery first because you're always
gonna<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.810> leftover<00:02:04.380> approximately<00:02:05.369> 5

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
gonna have some leftover approximately 5

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.310 
gonna have some leftover approximately 5
to<00:02:05.969> 6<00:02:06.210> foot<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to 6 foot and then you don't have the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.850 
to 6 foot and then you don't have the
access

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
access

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.890 
access
and<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.070> excess<00:02:08.550> wire<00:02:08.970> you're<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.540> cut-off

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
and that excess wire you're a cut-off

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.200 
and that excess wire you're a cut-off
and<00:02:10.259> you're<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.740> run<00:02:11.009> out<00:02:11.160> between<00:02:11.370> your<00:02:11.970> brake

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
and you're on run out between your brake

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.820 
and you're on run out between your brake
controller<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.020> batter<00:02:13.230> essentially

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
controller and the batter essentially

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.410 
controller and the batter essentially
you're<00:02:13.950> gonna<00:02:14.070> have<00:02:14.160> one<00:02:14.460> wire<00:02:14.730> going<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
you're gonna have one wire going to the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.120 
you're gonna have one wire going to the
battery<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.750> black<00:02:15.990> wire<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.500> then<00:02:17.010> you're

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
battery the black wire and then you're

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.280 
battery the black wire and then you're
cut<00:02:17.430> off<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.640> excess<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.300> again<00:02:19.020> you're

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
cut off the excess and again you're

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.020 
cut off the excess and again you're
gonna<00:02:19.410> have<00:02:19.470> another<00:02:19.710> connection<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.790> black

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
gonna have another connection of a black

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.730 
gonna have another connection of a black
wire<00:02:21.270> going<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.810> battery<00:02:21.990> except<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
wire going to the battery except the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.650 
wire going to the battery except the
other<00:02:22.920> black<00:02:23.190> wire<00:02:23.430> will<00:02:24.060> be<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.270> directly

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
other black wire will be going directly

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.690 
other black wire will be going directly
to<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.200> brake<00:02:25.380> controller<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.370> have<00:02:26.520> two

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
to the brake controller so I have two

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.890 
to the brake controller so I have two
connections<00:02:26.970> coming<00:02:27.480> off<00:02:27.570> your<00:02:27.690> battery

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
connections coming off your battery

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.930 
connections coming off your battery
after<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.620> ran<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.100> your<00:02:29.220> battery<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> hot

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
after you ran to your battery for a hot

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.430 
after you ran to your battery for a hot
lead<00:02:30.090> you're<00:02:30.300> coming<00:02:30.540> back<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.050> line<00:02:31.230> between

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
lead you're coming back the line between

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.990 
lead you're coming back the line between
the<00:02:31.770> brake<00:02:31.980> controller<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.670> battery

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the brake controller and the battery

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.660 
the brake controller and the battery
itself<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:34.440> black<00:02:34.680> wire<00:02:34.890> has<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.310> go<00:02:35.430> through

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
itself that black wire has to go through

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.370 
itself that black wire has to go through
a<00:02:35.700> circuit<00:02:36.090> breaker<00:02:36.210> depending<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.290> your

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
a circuit breaker depending on your

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.480 
a circuit breaker depending on your
brake<00:02:37.530> controller<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.310> gonna<00:02:38.400> be

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
brake controller we're just gonna be

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.910 
brake controller we're just gonna be
using<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.760> 20<00:02:39.030> amp<00:02:39.150> or<00:02:39.360> 30<00:02:39.600> amp<00:02:39.810> that's<00:02:40.620> why<00:02:40.800> we

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
using a 20 amp or 30 amp that's why we

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.230 
using a 20 amp or 30 amp that's why we
supply<00:02:41.160> three<00:02:41.460> because<00:02:41.730> different<00:02:41.970> brake

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
supply three because different brake

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.160 
supply three because different brake
controllers<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.780> different<00:02:43.050> requirements

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
controllers have different requirements

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.980 
controllers have different requirements
you're<00:02:44.160> gonna<00:02:44.280> use<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.580> 20<00:02:44.940> amp<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.480> view<00:02:45.750> 30

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
you're gonna use a 20 amp this view 30

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.170 
you're gonna use a 20 amp this view 30
amp<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.740> then<00:02:46.950> also<00:02:47.130> here<00:02:47.430> we<00:02:47.550> have<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> 40<00:02:48.000> amp

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
amp and then also here we have a 40 amp

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.270 
amp and then also here we have a 40 amp
this<00:02:48.600> 40<00:02:48.990> amp<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.470> also<00:02:49.680> want<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.040> install

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
this 40 amp you also want to install

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.300 
this 40 amp you also want to install
between<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.360> battery<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.310> 12-volt

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
between the battery and the 12-volt

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.980 
between the battery and the 12-volt
power<00:02:53.520> supply<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.300> back<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.870> it's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
power supply going out back so it's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.540 
power supply going out back so it's
pretty<00:02:55.110> good<00:02:55.320> idea<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:56.040> install<00:02:56.280> these

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
pretty good idea to install these

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.310 
pretty good idea to install these
side-by-side<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.540> you'll<00:02:57.690> always<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.140> one

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
side-by-side and you'll always have one

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.060 
side-by-side and you'll always have one
of<00:02:58.350> these<00:02:58.530> left<00:02:58.860> over<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:01.590> make<00:03:01.830> all<00:03:01.950> these

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
of these left over and make all these

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.620 
of these left over and make all these
connections<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.790> circuit<00:03:03.090> breaker<00:03:03.300> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
connections to the circuit breaker and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.180 
connections to the circuit breaker and
wiring<00:03:03.990> kit<00:03:04.140> battery<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.650> does<00:03:04.800> come<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:05.070> all

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
wiring kit battery it does come with all

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.230 
wiring kit battery it does come with all
four<00:03:05.340> ring<00:03:05.490> terminals<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.000> make<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
four ring terminals to make the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.550 
four ring terminals to make the
connection<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:06.840> these<00:03:07.080> two<00:03:07.260> will<00:03:07.350> be<00:03:07.440> going

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
connection but these two will be going

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.140 
connection but these two will be going
for<00:03:07.830> your<00:03:07.920> battery<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.490> then<00:03:08.700> these<00:03:08.910> four

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
for your battery and then these four

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.820 
for your battery and then these four
here<00:03:09.450> I'll<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.660> making<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.990> connections<00:03:10.410> to

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
here I'll be making the connections to

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.530 
here I'll be making the connections to
your<00:03:11.040> circuit<00:03:11.490> breakers<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.209> then<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.390> comes

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
your circuit breakers and then it comes

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.640 
your circuit breakers and then it comes
the<00:03:12.600> buck<00:03:12.840> connectors<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> make<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
the buck connectors to make the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.540 
the buck connectors to make the
connections<00:03:14.040> between<00:03:14.190> your<00:03:14.370> brake

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
connections between your brake

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.610
