00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
April 2012 it's been a while since we

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.490 
April 2012 it's been a while since we
covered<00:00:15.370> ADHD<00:00:15.880> and<00:00:16.359> we<00:00:16.840> just<00:00:17.050> felt<00:00:17.289> like

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
covered ADHD and we just felt like

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.890 
covered ADHD and we just felt like
getting<00:00:17.740> a<00:00:18.310> catch-up<00:00:18.670> video<00:00:19.150> as<00:00:19.390> well<00:00:19.420> as<00:00:19.870> a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
getting a catch-up video as well as a

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.250 
getting a catch-up video as well as a
cool<00:00:20.410> thing<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.760> tested<00:00:22.210> out<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.539> we

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
cool thing we tested out the we

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.650 
cool thing we tested out the we
basically<00:00:23.650> compared<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.880> stock<00:00:25.119> kernel<00:00:25.360> and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
basically compared the stock kernel and

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.230 
basically compared the stock kernel and
the<00:00:26.140> Fox<00:00:26.380> Colonel<00:00:26.770> while<00:00:27.430> installing<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:28.029> ROM

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
the Fox Colonel while installing the ROM

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.000 
the Fox Colonel while installing the ROM
you<00:00:28.420> do<00:00:28.630> get<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.960> option<00:00:29.140> of<00:00:29.380> flashing<00:00:29.800> either

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
you do get the option of flashing either

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.339 
you do get the option of flashing either
or<00:00:30.130> and<00:00:30.520> we<00:00:30.609> basically<00:00:31.090> tested<00:00:31.720> both<00:00:31.900> of<00:00:32.169> them

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
or and we basically tested both of them

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.500 
or and we basically tested both of them
and<00:00:32.590> we're<00:00:33.250> going<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.579> compare<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.090> see<00:00:34.239> which

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
and we're going to compare and see which

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.050 
and we're going to compare and see which
one<00:00:34.810> but<00:00:35.770> is<00:00:35.950> better<00:00:36.250> which<00:00:36.670> one<00:00:36.880> would<00:00:37.000> be

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
one but is better which one would be

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.600 
one but is better which one would be
suited<00:00:37.480> for<00:00:37.750> someone<00:00:38.079> who<00:00:38.470> has<00:00:38.860> specific<00:00:39.399> uses

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
suited for someone who has specific uses

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
suited for someone who has specific uses
so<00:00:40.360> software<00:00:41.200> wise<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:42.579> comes<00:00:42.820> with<00:00:42.970> 4.3

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
so software wise it comes with 4.3

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.500 
so software wise it comes with 4.3
technically<00:00:44.829> this<00:00:45.130> will<00:00:45.430> be<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.700> last<00:00:45.880> for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
technically this will be the last for

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.810 
technically this will be the last for
the<00:00:46.719> HTC<00:00:47.079> Sensation<00:00:47.860> andhra<00:00:48.370> four-point-oh

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
the HTC Sensation andhra four-point-oh

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.670 
the HTC Sensation andhra four-point-oh
point<00:00:49.030> for<00:00:49.270> this<00:00:49.540> a<00:00:49.600> big<00:00:49.870> chance<00:00:50.079> it<00:00:50.290> will<00:00:50.440> not

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
point for this a big chance it will not

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.600 
point for this a big chance it will not
come<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.399> HTC<00:00:51.880> Sensation<00:00:52.420> officially<00:00:53.290> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
come to the HTC Sensation officially and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.810 
come to the HTC Sensation officially and
basically<00:00:54.809> under<00:00:55.809> revolution<00:00:56.440> so<00:00:56.710> Mike<00:00:56.920> 1986

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
basically under revolution so Mike 1986

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.110 
basically under revolution so Mike 1986
he<00:00:58.180> does<00:00:58.930> his<00:00:59.110> roms<00:00:59.489> pure<00:01:00.489> stock<00:01:00.760> with

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
he does his roms pure stock with

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.600 
he does his roms pure stock with
optimization<00:01:01.719> so<00:01:02.170> that's<00:01:02.379> why<00:01:02.590> most<00:01:03.219> likely

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
optimization so that's why most likely

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.820 
optimization so that's why most likely
will<00:01:03.730> stay<00:01:04.000> at<00:01:04.239> 4.3<00:01:05.079> HTC<00:01:06.040> Sense<00:01:06.280> is<00:01:06.460> 3.6<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
will stay at 4.3 HTC Sense is 3.6 and in

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
that's what it gives us so we wanted to

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.850 
that's what it gives us so we wanted to

covers all of them like we mentioned
before<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:52.080> can<00:04:52.410> actually<00:04:52.530> see<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.980> it

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
before you can actually see that it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.730 
before you can actually see that it
actually<00:04:53.430> did<00:04:54.180> increase<00:04:54.690> quite<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.110> bit<00:04:55.410> but

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
actually did increase quite a bit but

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.460 
actually did increase quite a bit but
like<00:04:56.280> for<00:04:56.610> quite<00:04:56.850> quite<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.150> bit<00:04:57.390> so<00:04:58.050> if<00:04:58.200> you<00:04:58.320> go

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
like for quite quite a bit so if you go

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.850 
like for quite quite a bit so if you go
back<00:04:58.710> let's<00:04:59.130> see<00:04:59.630> is<00:05:00.630> it

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
back let's see is it

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.249 
back let's see is it

colonel<00:05:14.419> 6235<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:15.659> it's<00:05:15.780> done<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.930> good<00:05:16.169> job

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
colonel 6235 so it's done a good job

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.080 
colonel 6235 so it's done a good job
there<00:05:16.620> even<00:05:16.919> SD<00:05:17.250> card<00:05:17.520> has<00:05:17.699> increased

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
there even SD card has increased

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.409 
there even SD card has increased
slightly<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:19.379> that's<00:05:19.860> pretty<00:05:20.129> good<00:05:20.460> moving<00:05:21.300> on

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
slightly so that's pretty good moving on

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.450 
slightly so that's pretty good moving on
here's<00:05:21.780> just<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.110> bar<00:05:22.469> chart<00:05:22.710> format<00:05:23.129> so<00:05:23.340> we

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
here's just the bar chart format so we

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.070 
here's just the bar chart format so we
beat<00:05:23.639> the<00:05:23.759> optimus<00:05:24.090> 2x<00:05:24.270> as<00:05:24.689> well<00:05:24.870> as<00:05:24.990> the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
beat the optimus 2x as well as the

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.580 
beat the optimus 2x as well as the
galaxy<00:05:25.199> s2<00:05:25.729> remember<00:05:26.729> these<00:05:26.909> are<00:05:27.020> not<00:05:28.020> tested

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
galaxy s2 remember these are not tested

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.249 
galaxy s2 remember these are not tested
we<00:05:29.099> haven't<00:05:29.340> tested<00:05:29.639> these<00:05:30.180> with<00:05:30.780> like<00:05:31.050> other

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
we haven't tested these with like other

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.070 
we haven't tested these with like other
roms<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.949> kernels<00:05:32.129> we'll<00:05:33.090> just<00:05:33.330> eat<00:05:33.569> this

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
roms and kernels we'll just eat this

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.790 
roms and kernels we'll just eat this
comes<00:05:34.439> within<00:05:35.099> the<00:05:35.370> app<00:05:35.520> with<00:05:36.180> stock<00:05:36.800> devices

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
comes within the app with stock devices

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.519 
comes within the app with stock devices
so<00:05:38.240> basically<00:05:39.240> if<00:05:39.360> we<00:05:39.539> could<00:05:39.750> use<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.169> optimus

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
so basically if we could use the optimus

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.279 
so basically if we could use the optimus
2x<00:05:40.650> you<00:05:41.490> never<00:05:41.699> know<00:05:41.849> if<00:05:41.969> go<00:05:42.569> actually<00:05:42.900> higher

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
2x you never know if go actually higher

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.879 
2x you never know if go actually higher
or<00:05:43.560> lower<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:45.139> don't<00:05:46.139> really<00:05:46.289> take<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:46.710> at

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
or lower so don't really take this at

there<00:06:06.770> technically<00:06:07.909> but<00:06:08.909> again<00:06:09.330> I'm<00:06:09.539> a<00:06:09.599> bit

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
there technically but again I'm a bit

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.680 
there technically but again I'm a bit

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
skeptical for those results so and

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.079 
skeptical for those results so and
that's<00:06:13.319> basically<00:06:13.589> it<00:06:13.919> for<00:06:13.979> the<00:06:14.339> benchmarking

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:15.089 
that's basically it for the benchmarking

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:17.959 
that's basically it for the benchmarking
