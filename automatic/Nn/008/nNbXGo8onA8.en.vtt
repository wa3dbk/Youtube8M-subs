00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:09.400
 today I come to tell you something very 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.980
 interesting and important it turns out that 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.380
 a week ago on facebook I published a 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.260
 congratulations to all those who 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.660
 they were starting their social service in 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.419
 their different headquarters and I gave them some 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.279
 recommendations then it turns out that 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.349
 some claimed me because also 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.579
 They came to class and therefore not to 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.650
 I had said nothing then I wanted to do 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.780
 something a little bit more special for 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.399
 you and that's why I decided to do it is 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.440
 better a video so I think that good 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.539
 we are on time not just passing the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.670
 first week the week where everyone is 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.910
 present their professors are presented 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.280
 the subjects that they will be seeing 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.989
 they ask you the typical question of you 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.520
 why they decided to study nutrition 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.910
 which is something that you have to 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.710
 accustom every quarter semester every 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.950
 once they change teachers because that 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.600
 happens then 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.480
 Here are some good will 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.640
 recommendations for you 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:16.510
 and that I already as a former student as a former 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 student and everything I want to give you things that 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.920
 learned in these years 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.530
 and good to let you clarify that many 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.540
 things are things that I regret 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.680
 and I would have liked to have done 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.530
 so good 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.630
 because I was not me and tell me that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.610
 nobody told me I would have liked it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.600
 someone told me so I better what 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.500
 I do with you and well let's start 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.930
 recommendation onces 1 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.730
 Make friends live with all your 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.280
 comrades take good with all 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:59.910
 mates be happy have fun do not know 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.840
 move away from being a very united group of colleagues 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.930
 very united and be like brothers know 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.310
 that unites them a very great love that their 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.770
 profession then let's be united because 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.440
 otherwise you never know when the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.470
 partner that you are bothering or 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.590
 you think more insignificant I can get to 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.810
 do something bigger that's why there is a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.540
 recommendation that not on good occasion I 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.560
 they gave and that is that they never fight with 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.239
 no one 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.060
 never fight with any partner 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.310
 because the world of nutrition and itself 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.450
 the world is very small and you never know 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.569
 when the next one is going to be your boss 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.860
 then better 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.090
 all that love and peace 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.480
 recommendation 2 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.879
 from the beginning to be studied are ponte 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.769
 the time passes too quickly and when 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.500
 you realize the semester has ended 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.690
 come all the exams so from 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.300
 preference see studying up to date 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.810
 if today you gave in class give yourself a time 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.430
 to review it and so on continuously and 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.250
 you will never forget anything 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.830
 you will be reviewing daily like this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.410
 which is a good recommendation 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.390
 and do not stay with the only thing that you 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.640
 professors say you investigate more 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.340
 apart about the different topic 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.320
 opinions different authors and goes 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.710
 creating your own criteria 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.700
 recommendation number 3 takes good 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.920
 ratings 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.910
 maybe it's a bit ironic because who 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.860
 know me 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.129
 You must know that I have never worried 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.569
 a lot for the qualifications but that I 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.060
 what he does does not mean that you 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.819
 as well 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.980
 the truth I have always been a little 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.349
 more pending in learning what I want 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.590
 learn and not very focused on the 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.930
 qualifications but it is very true that 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.050
 the grades also help you in 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.269
 many things unfortunately help you 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.440
 for example to have a scholarship if you want 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.470
 study in I do not know a masters help you 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.590
 even to have a scholarship at school 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.900
 and of recommendation 4 be a good student 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.290
 from the beginning it starts to 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.930
 have a career 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.780
 with merits and so we can say that your 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.040
 teachers begin to detect you as 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 someone 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.320
 very 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.889
 that is the beginning your teachers 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.190
 as someone who wants to achieve a lot 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.710
 innovative creative and so on that is going to 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.600
 open many doors and do not just do it 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.150
 in school but in life and in each 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.129
 situation where you always try 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.069
 give more than what they ask you 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:58.699
 which you get good grades do not 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.959
 guarantees that you will succeed in 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.539
 the life 

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:05.030
 so focus if in the 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.240
 ratings but much more 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.130
 in your being a good professional 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.800
 and not stay anything else in what you 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.130
 teach at school but try 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:20.120
 give much more last recommendation 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:23.180
 number 5 believe you a graduate in 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.720
 nutrition portat uniform your dressing gown with 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.389
 a lot of love passion and seriously believe that already 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:34.449
 you are, behave as such, behave yourself 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.449
 as a professional he is educated respectfully 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:41.260
 firm I know how I would like to do it because 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:45.190
 when you're already a professional 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.650
 love your career mom you your subjects to 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.020
 your professors 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.660
 feel that passion for your profession 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:58.060
 because that is going to guarantee that you 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.889
 be more motivated and want to have those 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.870
 desire to continue learning a lot and to 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:04.330
 learn everything what you are 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.190
 teaching and especially being the best 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.009
 because you are the best 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.560
 ok you should always believe that you are 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:15.950
 the most obviously 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.440
 not with ego but you are the best you 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.740
 you deserve the best and therefore you are going to 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:26.270
 demand as if you were the best ok 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.710
 well that's all for the moment I hope 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.070
 that you have liked and served them 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.410
 very much these recommendations that for 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.750
 me for me apparently they are the most 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.750
 important now that you start and 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.510
 especially for the entire race 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.419
 then you want a lot 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.250
 beautiful profession that promises a lot no 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.229
 get discouraged by everything they say about the 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.570
 lack of work blah blah clear that no 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.970
 all the races right now are very bad 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.000
 all populations the population and the 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.620
 world is wrong but if you feel like it 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.020
 to get ahead of throwing a lot 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.630
 you're creative innovator you're going to 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.550
 achieve a lot of things so everything 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.640
 it depends on you and what you want to do 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:12.020
 so he has really wanted and for 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.020
 what they need here I will be
