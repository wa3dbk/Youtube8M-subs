00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
volleyball programs in Texas I say

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.729 
volleyball programs in Texas I say
tongue-in-cheek<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.380> need<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.559> have

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
tongue-in-cheek that we need to have

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.260 
tongue-in-cheek that we need to have
equipment<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.579> need<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.880> fancy

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
equipment and we need to have fancy

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.319 
equipment and we need to have fancy
things<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.690> boys<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.500> lacrosse<00:00:37.680> does

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
things that boys like like lacrosse does

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.700 
things that boys like like lacrosse does
but<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.480> reality<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.290> boys<00:00:40.440> need<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
but in reality I think just boys need to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.490 
but in reality I think just boys need to
be<00:00:40.770> exposed<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.430> good<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.820> sport<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
be exposed to how good of a sport it is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
be exposed to how good of a sport it is
i<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.980> make<00:00:44.190> arguments<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> being<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
i can make arguments about it being the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.369 
i can make arguments about it being the
best<00:00:45.270> team<00:00:45.480> sport<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.289> then

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
best team sport out there and then

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.840 
best team sport out there and then
you're<00:00:46.500> reliant<00:00:46.829> every<00:00:47.190> time<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> ball<00:00:47.640> comes

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you're reliant every time the ball comes

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.369 
you're reliant every time the ball comes
over<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> net<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.270> fully<00:00:48.600> half<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.170> team

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
over the net on fully half of your team

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
over the net on fully half of your team
that<00:00:49.620> three<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> six<00:00:50.430> guys<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:51.000> there

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
that three out of the six guys out there

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.610 
that three out of the six guys out there
have<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> perform<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> win<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
have to perform well for you to win a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
have to perform well for you to win a
point<00:00:52.829> it'd<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.250> great<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.610> had<00:00:53.699> more<00:00:53.969> teams

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
point it'd be great if we had more teams

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.290 
point it'd be great if we had more teams
around<00:00:54.809> competition<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.739> much<00:00:55.920> better

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
around competition would be much better

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.639 
around competition would be much better
I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.870> reason<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.230> don't<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.590> lot

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
I think one reason you don't see a lot

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
I think one reason you don't see a lot
of<00:00:58.770> guys<00:00:59.039> volleyball<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.699> because<00:01:00.030> most

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
of guys volleyball is because most

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.910 
of guys volleyball is because most
people<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.649> sport<00:01:01.829> for

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
people think that it's just a sport for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
people think that it's just a sport for
girls<00:01:02.070> they've<00:01:02.550> never<00:01:02.699> seen<00:01:02.969> guys<00:01:03.270> play<00:01:03.690> I've
