back<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.439> kind<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.680> took<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
back to one we kind of took off the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
back to one we kind of took off the
Konami<00:01:08.340> list<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.970> guess<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
Konami list with this I guess and now we

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
Konami list with this I guess and now we
have<00:01:10.680> actually<00:01:11.549> necros<00:01:11.850> pretty<00:01:12.060> much

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
have actually necros pretty much

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
have actually necros pretty much
testable<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.810> both<00:01:12.960> formats<00:01:13.320> minus<00:01:13.740> Trish<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
testable in both formats minus Trish so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
testable in both formats minus Trish so
I<00:01:15.000> think<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.200> decks<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.500> actually<00:01:16.710> pretty

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
I think the decks are actually pretty

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
I think the decks are actually pretty
different<00:01:17.100> between<00:01:17.640> both<00:01:17.939> formats<00:01:18.210> just

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
different between both formats just

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.859 
different between both formats just
because<00:01:19.170> Trish's<00:01:19.560> band<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.490> um<00:01:20.729> seeing<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.750> we

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because Trish's band but um seeing as we

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
because Trish's band but um seeing as we
did<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> complete<00:01:22.409> 180<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.610> we're

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
did a complete 180 with these two we're

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.460 
did a complete 180 with these two we're
gonna<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.479> abyss<00:01:24.960> dweller<00:01:25.229> as

where it was before with shrit f3 neck I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.789 
where it was before with shrit f3 neck I
was<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.060> noqueira<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.560> actually

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
was like noqueira one even just actually

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
was like noqueira one even just actually
building<00:02:02.219> off<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:02.880> hitting<00:02:03.180> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
building off of that and just hitting a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.789 
building off of that and just hitting a
shrimp<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.049> been<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> cool<00:02:04.380> idea<00:02:04.500> but

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
shrimp would have been a cool idea but

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
shrimp would have been a cool idea but
hey<00:02:05.310> I'm<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:05.700> part<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
hey I'm not part of that it is what it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.449 
hey I'm not part of that it is what it
is<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.079> actually<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.710> believe<00:02:08.310> will

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
is and it actually I believe will

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.490 
is and it actually I believe will
promote<00:02:08.759> changes<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> necros<00:02:10.080> deck<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.410> I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
promote changes in the necros deck do I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.479 
promote changes in the necros deck do I
think<00:02:10.709> it'll<00:02:10.860> make<00:02:10.950> necros<00:02:11.280> better

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
think it'll make necros better

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.820 
think it'll make necros better

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
weekend yeah last weekend uh because we

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.300

changed after Charlotte and then I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.800 
changed after Charlotte and then I
wasn't<00:02:24.120> worth<00:02:24.240> making<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.540> video<00:02:24.720> about

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
wasn't worth making a video about

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
wasn't worth making a video about
because<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.320> one<00:02:25.500> simple<00:02:25.830> change<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
because it was one simple change so I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
because it was one simple change so I
decided<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.570> wait<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.020> now<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.410> action

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.140 
decided to wait and now we have action
enough<00:02:28.980> changes<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.340> really<00:02:29.550> talk<00:02:29.670> about<00:02:29.730> and

cards out of your opponent's hand and if
you<00:04:36.419> had<00:04:36.509> sole<00:04:36.750> charge<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:37.080> can<00:04:37.199> just<00:04:37.349> live

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
you had sole charge you can just live

you had sole charge you can just live
their<00:04:37.650> whole<00:04:37.680> hand<00:04:38.009> but<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.400> course

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
their whole hand but that of course

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.869 
their whole hand but that of course
that's<00:04:38.729> sole<00:04:38.970> charge<00:04:39.139> but<00:04:40.139> um<00:04:40.889> it's<00:04:41.490> it's<00:04:41.639> a

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
that's sole charge but um it's it's a

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.550 
that's sole charge but um it's it's a
fair<00:04:42.090> tradeoff<00:04:42.360> absolutely<00:04:43.020> because<00:04:43.319> now

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
fair tradeoff absolutely because now

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.320 
fair tradeoff absolutely because now
wine<00:04:43.770> is<00:04:43.889> just<00:04:44.099> become<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.460> rank<00:04:44.669> for<00:04:44.909> toolbox

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
wine is just become a rank for toolbox

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.879 
wine is just become a rank for toolbox
stack<00:04:45.900> which<00:04:46.199> I<00:04:46.319> don't<00:04:46.379> think<00:04:46.620> everybody's

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
stack which I don't think everybody's

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.770 
stack which I don't think everybody's
really<00:04:47.039> against<00:04:47.250> that<00:04:47.460> but<00:04:47.970> um<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.419> think

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
really against that but um I think

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.689 
really against that but um I think
really<00:04:49.229> wind-ups<00:04:49.650> they<00:04:50.159> thrived<00:04:50.460> off<00:04:50.580> the

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
really wind-ups they thrived off the

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:51.980 
really wind-ups they thrived off the
fact<00:04:50.879> that<00:04:50.970> they<00:04:51.120> could<00:04:51.270> still<00:04:51.419> hand<00:04:51.659> loop<00:04:51.810> and

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
fact that they could still hand loop and

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.570 
fact that they could still hand loop and
I<00:04:52.050> really<00:04:52.289> like<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.620> hand<00:04:52.830> loop<00:04:53.009> actually<00:04:53.159> a

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
I really like the hand loop actually a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.580 
I really like the hand loop actually a
lot<00:04:53.819> of<00:04:53.940> people<00:04:54.120> thought<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.300> was<00:04:54.389> unfair<00:04:54.590> but

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
lot of people thought it was unfair but

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.460 
lot of people thought it was unfair but
i<00:04:55.889> think<00:04:56.849> really<00:04:57.389> one<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.990> only<00:04:58.050> ways<00:04:58.319> they

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
i think really one of the only ways they

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.379 
i think really one of the only ways they
could<00:04:58.530> keep<00:04:58.740> up<00:04:58.889> was<00:04:59.069> a<00:04:59.099> hand<00:04:59.400> loop<00:04:59.550> but<00:04:59.819> now<00:05:00.030> we

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
could keep up was a hand loop but now we

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.580 
could keep up was a hand loop but now we
get<00:05:00.569> to<00:05:00.659> see<00:05:00.750> what<00:05:00.900> they<00:05:00.960> can<00:05:01.050> do<00:05:01.169> with<00:05:01.199> all<00:05:01.469> the

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
get to see what they can do with all the

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.050 
get to see what they can do with all the
rank<00:05:01.770> fours<00:05:02.009> they<00:05:02.159> have<00:05:02.280> access<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.729> now<00:05:02.849> which

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
rank fours they have access to now which

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.110 
rank fours they have access to now which
that's<00:05:03.360> pretty<00:05:03.569> exciting<00:05:03.780> too<00:05:04.020> but<00:05:04.800> yeah<00:05:05.580> so

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
that's pretty exciting too but yeah so

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.580 
that's pretty exciting too but yeah so
that's<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.539> changes<00:05:06.930> we<00:05:07.050> have<00:05:07.080> moving

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590
