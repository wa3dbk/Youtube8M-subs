00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.699 
the fact that it repairs itself over
time<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.720> never<00:03:36.930> really<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.590> make

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
time so you never really have to make

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.229 
time so you never really have to make
another<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.190> as<00:03:38.340> long<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.670> let<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.940> repair

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
another one as long as you let it repair

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.350 
another one as long as you let it repair
itself<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.720> think<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.200> awesome

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
itself and I think that is awesome

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.170 
itself and I think that is awesome
next<00:03:42.360> up<00:03:42.480> we<00:03:42.630> have<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.900> living<00:03:43.230> metal<00:03:43.440> blocks

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
next up we have the living metal blocks

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.100 
next up we have the living metal blocks
living<00:03:45.180> metal<00:03:45.390> blocks<00:03:45.570> are<00:03:45.720> made<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.080> same

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
living metal blocks are made the same

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.870 
living metal blocks are made the same
way<00:03:46.290> as<00:03:46.500> any<00:03:46.650> other<00:03:46.709> block<00:03:47.070> iron<00:03:47.489> gold<00:03:47.760> or

bench with living metal and it makes the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
bench with living metal and it makes the
blocks<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:50.970> that's<00:03:51.120> what<00:03:51.209> we're<00:03:51.330> standing<00:03:51.570> on

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
blocks and that's what we're standing on

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.630 
blocks and that's what we're standing on
right<00:03:51.840> now<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.230> what<00:03:52.980> living<00:03:53.190> metal<00:03:53.400> blocks

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
right now and what living metal blocks

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.420 
right now and what living metal blocks
do<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.120> they<00:03:54.810> will<00:03:55.050> heal<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:56.010> stand<00:03:56.280> on

do is they will heal you if you stand on
them<00:03:56.640> much<00:03:57.120> much<00:03:57.330> faster<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.780> think<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:58.050> like

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
them much much faster I think it's like

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.710 
them much much faster I think it's like
four<00:03:58.500> times<00:03:58.769> faster<00:04:00.290> one<00:04:01.290> second<00:04:02.570> don't<00:04:03.570> mind

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
four times faster one second don't mind

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.750 
four times faster one second don't mind
me<00:04:03.810> I'll<00:04:03.900> show<00:04:04.050> this<00:04:04.170> later<00:04:04.430> they'll<00:04:05.430> hear<00:04:05.670> you

me I'll show this later they'll hear you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.020 
me I'll show this later they'll hear you
much<00:04:05.970> faster<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:07.110> lot<00:04:07.590> faster<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.280> that's

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
much faster like a lot faster and that's

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.460 
much faster like a lot faster and that's
the<00:04:09.209> box<00:04:09.440> next<00:04:10.440> up<00:04:10.739> we<00:04:10.950> have<00:04:10.980> amulets<00:04:12.230> I'm<00:04:13.230> not

this<00:05:14.970> but<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.210> kind<00:05:15.480> of<00:05:15.540> figured<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.110> out<00:05:16.200> and<00:05:16.470> I

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
this but I kind of figured it out and I

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.360 
this but I kind of figured it out and I
thought<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:16.860> was<00:05:16.980> worth<00:05:17.880> noting<00:05:18.920> I'm<00:05:19.920> not

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
thought it was worth noting I'm not

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.070 
thought it was worth noting I'm not
exactly<00:05:20.730> sure<00:05:21.060> how<00:05:21.090> it<00:05:21.270> works<00:05:21.480> but<00:05:21.690> let's<00:05:21.900> go

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
exactly sure how it works but let's go

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.840 
exactly sure how it works but let's go
ahead<00:05:22.170> and<00:05:22.410> deposit<00:05:22.890> all<00:05:23.010> this<00:05:23.190> stuff<00:05:23.640> we

can hold 200 but I'm pretty sure you

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.350 
can hold 200 but I'm pretty sure you
only<00:05:58.620> get<00:05:58.800> one<00:05:58.950> soul<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.580> usually<00:05:59.850> get<00:06:00.150> 2

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
only get one soul and you usually get 2

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.080 
only get one soul and you usually get 2
to<00:06:00.480> 4<00:06:00.720> blood<00:06:01.080> so<00:06:01.440> it<00:06:02.040> ends<00:06:02.430> up<00:06:02.490> working<00:06:02.730> itself

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
to 4 blood so it ends up working itself

a germinated biomass seed and that is

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.470 
a germinated biomass seed and that is
then<00:06:24.750> planted<00:06:25.200> on<00:06:25.380> top<00:06:25.560> of<00:06:26.060> see<00:06:27.060> if<00:06:27.120> I<00:06:27.210> have<00:06:27.450> it

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
then planted on top of see if I have it

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.620 
then planted on top of see if I have it
there<00:06:27.780> we<00:06:27.900> go<00:06:29.780> soul<00:06:30.780> sand<00:06:31.790> once<00:06:32.790> you<00:06:33.060> you<00:06:33.510> have

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
there we go soul sand once you you have

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.900 
there we go soul sand once you you have
to<00:06:33.780> take<00:06:34.350> a<00:06:34.380> creek<00:06:35.010> ball<00:06:35.220> creep<00:06:35.580> balls<00:06:35.760> are

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
to take a creek ball creep balls are

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.910 
to take a creek ball creep balls are
made<00:06:36.060> from<00:06:36.330> slime<00:06:36.750> balls<00:06:36.990> for<00:06:37.470> rotten<00:06:37.650> flesh

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
made from slime balls for rotten flesh

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.679 
made from slime balls for rotten flesh
and<00:06:38.190> for<00:06:38.370> spider<00:06:38.610> is<00:06:38.790> so<00:06:39.000> spite

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:39.689 
and for spider is so spite

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.559 
and for spider is so spite
spawner<00:06:40.219> trap<00:06:41.219> is<00:06:41.489> probably<00:06:41.939> recommended

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
spawner trap is probably recommended

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.269 
spawner trap is probably recommended
here<00:06:42.779> but<00:06:43.319> you<00:06:43.439> take<00:06:43.589> the<00:06:43.709> creep<00:06:43.889> ball<00:06:44.069> use

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
here but you take the creep ball use

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.649 
here but you take the creep ball use
right<00:06:44.519> click<00:06:44.549> it<00:06:44.849> it<00:06:44.969> makes<00:06:45.149> these<00:06:45.299> blocks

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
right click it it makes these blocks

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.519 
right click it it makes these blocks
here<00:06:45.979> then<00:06:46.979> you<00:06:47.099> take<00:06:47.249> your<00:06:47.279> glaive<00:06:47.759> and<00:06:48.529> you

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
here then you take your glaive and you

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:51.889 
here then you take your glaive and you
can<00:06:49.709> hollow<00:06:49.949> them<00:06:50.219> out<00:06:50.369> and<00:06:50.669> then<00:06:51.449> you<00:06:51.659> take

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:51.899 
can hollow them out and then you take

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.479 
can hollow them out and then you take
your<00:06:51.929> germinated<00:06:52.499> biomass<00:06:52.919> seeds<00:06:53.189> and<00:06:53.429> you

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:53.489 
your germinated biomass seeds and you

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:56.679 
your germinated biomass seeds and you
place<00:06:53.699> them<00:06:53.819> down<00:06:53.999> here<00:06:54.769> you<00:06:55.769> can<00:06:55.949> use<00:06:56.069> blood

00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:56.689 
place them down here you can use blood

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.549 
place them down here you can use blood
to<00:06:57.689> speed<00:06:57.959> this<00:06:58.110> process<00:06:58.379> up<00:06:58.649> and<00:07:00.169> I<00:07:01.169> think

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:01.559 
to speed this process up and I think

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.469 
to speed this process up and I think
from<00:07:01.889> this<00:07:02.219> point<00:07:02.639> I'm<00:07:02.939> not<00:07:03.089> sure<00:07:03.299> if<00:07:03.389> these

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
from this point I'm not sure if these

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.669 
from this point I'm not sure if these
are<00:07:03.539> done<00:07:03.809> yet<00:07:03.959> I<00:07:04.019> don't<00:07:04.110> want<00:07:04.289> to<00:07:04.349> use<00:07:04.439> them<00:07:04.589> I

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:04.679 
are done yet I don't want to use them I

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:07.549 
are done yet I don't want to use them I
haven't<00:07:04.919> like<00:07:06.079> experimented<00:07:07.079> with<00:07:07.110> this<00:07:07.379> I'm

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:07.559 
haven't like experimented with this I'm

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:08.809 
haven't like experimented with this I'm
just<00:07:07.709> showing<00:07:07.949> everyone<00:07:08.159> how<00:07:08.339> to<00:07:08.369> do<00:07:08.669> the

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 
just showing everyone how to do the

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.689 
just showing everyone how to do the
basic<00:07:09.209> steps<00:07:09.479> from<00:07:10.319> that<00:07:10.409> point<00:07:10.709> on<00:07:10.860> I<00:07:11.099> think

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 
basic steps from that point on I think

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.659 
basic steps from that point on I think
this<00:07:12.059> is<00:07:12.209> how<00:07:12.360> you<00:07:12.419> make<00:07:12.719> biomass<00:07:13.469> and<00:07:13.829> biomass

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
this is how you make biomass and biomass

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.469 
this is how you make biomass and biomass
can<00:07:14.969> be<00:07:15.029> used<00:07:15.269> to<00:07:15.449> make<00:07:16.759> farmer<00:07:17.759> weapons<00:07:18.269> and

things like that and just as the same
with<00:07:21.110> the<00:07:22.610> the<00:07:23.610> wool<00:07:23.849> stuff<00:07:24.179> I<00:07:24.360> don't<00:07:24.449> know<00:07:24.779> how

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:25.519 
with the the wool stuff I don't know how

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:29.839 
with the the wool stuff I don't know how
much<00:07:27.199> it<00:07:28.199> like<00:07:29.009> I<00:07:29.099> don't<00:07:29.189> know<00:07:29.339> how<00:07:29.519> well<00:07:29.729> it

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:29.849 
much it like I don't know how well it

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.509 
much it like I don't know how well it
works<00:07:30.059> I<00:07:30.209> don't<00:07:30.239> know<00:07:30.479> what<00:07:30.779> it<00:07:30.899> does<00:07:31.110> but<00:07:31.519> I

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:32.519 
works I don't know what it does but I

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.399 
works I don't know what it does but I
just<00:07:33.419> thought<00:07:33.539> I'd<00:07:33.689> share<00:07:33.839> on<00:07:33.989> how<00:07:34.079> to<00:07:34.139> make<00:07:34.289> it

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:34.409 
just thought I'd share on how to make it

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:35.869 
just thought I'd share on how to make it
because<00:07:34.679> it<00:07:35.009> doesn't<00:07:35.219> show<00:07:35.339> you<00:07:35.519> how<00:07:35.639> to<00:07:35.699> make

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 
because it doesn't show you how to make

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:39.739 
because it doesn't show you how to make
