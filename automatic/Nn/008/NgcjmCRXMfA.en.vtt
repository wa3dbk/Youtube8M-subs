00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.260
 what are we doing? 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.150
 of armor status h of that in Spanish 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.800
 would be state of the tool and of the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.600
 armor and what we are is that we 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.060
 indicates how much life or how much use you have 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.340
 that are our swords and armor as 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.230
 come on the left side of the bottom says 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.710
 what are the uses and pay them has 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.260
 use 1,562 in the bottom 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.699
 left says 1,556 what has the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.370
 use sword and the peak has 251 the 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.620
 ax has 132 and if we kill what is 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.390
 any sheep cow creperie and so on 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 going to go down one thousand 562 and if we hit 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.659
 a cow says thousand 558 be the one created by 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.949
 that thousand 557 thousand 556 and now we are going to 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.870
 try with the peak I really loved it 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.979
 Let's be pretty because it's very useful there 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.460
 to know when we are running out of what 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:12.770
 250 249 248 and so on 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.840
 successively it's really worth I love it 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.100
 rather, you are, well, you 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.399
 you have to try it with the other weapons 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.230
 and as you can see it has 132 131 130 and 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.960
 successively it is and lowering vale 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.090
 I really have been fascinated by this mod 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.500
 because for me it is very useful when it goes 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.500
 to finish a weapon 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.610
 50 59 57 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 and so it's good and I do not know is interesting 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.560
 what is this mode because many do not 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.630
 we know what time we're going to finish what 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.890
 which are the weapons the shovels and etcetera 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.100
 since they also tell us what are the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:52.070
 uses and with laos has 33 32 29 28 and so 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.020
 successively and also serves with what 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.810
 is the armor worth we will see everything 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.210
 has what is the diamond armor 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 and we are going to leave all these things that 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.369
 we took 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.369
 really and already light 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.819
 good shells good that we keep leaving 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
 these things of the devil and we take what 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.209
 is the armor is worth and we open here the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.209
 Inventory 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.150
 armor and you have to look good and in the part 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.430
 right tells us what the helmet is 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:37.690
 has 264 breast use 500 500 22 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.490
 the 496 pants and the 664 boots that 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.720
 it's the same as the helmet and I hope that 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.190
 I really liked it to me 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.740
 loved it because it tells us 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.120
 How much water do I want? 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.060
 which are the tools you already know in the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.940
 left part in what the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.820
 life or the use of tools in the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.160
 right part tells us the use of the 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.750
 armor and I hope you liked it
