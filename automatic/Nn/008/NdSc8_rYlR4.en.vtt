of<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.070> way<00:02:33.190> here<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.210> we<00:02:34.330> will<00:02:34.480> take<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.690> look

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
of the way here and we will take a look

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.280 
of the way here and we will take a look
at<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.110> card<00:02:35.790> no<00:02:36.790> cooling<00:02:37.180> fan<00:02:37.450> sapphires

at the card no cooling fan sapphires
using<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.680> very<00:02:39.100> large<00:02:39.690> heatsink<00:02:40.690> here

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
using this very large heatsink here

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.650 
using this very large heatsink here
this<00:02:42.160> should<00:02:42.280> dissipate<00:02:42.700> most<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> heat

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
this should dissipate most of the heat

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.210 
this should dissipate most of the heat
that's<00:02:44.140> gonna<00:02:44.350> come<00:02:44.590> for<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:44.830> as<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.160> said
