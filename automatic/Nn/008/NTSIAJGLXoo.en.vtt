00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
believe me the chemical is allowing her

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.139 
believe me the chemical is allowing her
to<00:01:34.110> unlock<00:01:34.619> new<00:01:34.860> areas<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.310> her<00:01:35.670> brain<00:01:36.530> she<00:01:37.530> has

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
to unlock new areas of her brain she has

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.139 
to unlock new areas of her brain she has
abilities<00:01:40.220> they<00:01:41.220> cannot<00:01:41.490> fall<00:01:41.759> into<00:01:42.060> the
