00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.630
 and guillermo and me 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:13.340
 We are going to teach you how to clean a 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.360
 good reel follow the principles the 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.360
 reels of course 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.130
 a rag to zoom 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:30.570
 a water brush and a silicone spray 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.600
 It's worth cheap good first thing 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.320
 they started and I have it already clean but 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.320
 good 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.219
 A) Yes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:06.320
 this serves gives you much more to the is 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.100
 clean to pick up will be easier for them 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.100
 launches to arrive 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.620
 dismantle that piece 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.940
 the one above is cleaned with a little bit of 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.830
 water and dries with that is the same it 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.330
 clean here that only has sand and 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.220
 up here 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.090
 and this was done 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.090
 and that little one 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.740
 they are taken out and cleaned the 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.530
 fat that has 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.840
 inter cloth 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.790
 Now that it's clean, if not 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.780
 the water would come 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.780
 in that part 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.810
 then dismantle and masters what is in the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.810
 crank 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.850
 it is also removed the fat was dried and 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.120
 around here the same after this part d 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.350
 the tube made when it is on top of 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.780
 everything around here there is some fat that 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.300
 usually comes out there will always be little 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 because it leaves 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.780
 and 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.430
 after silicone 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.380
 its poured per hour 10 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.620
 through the gap is where the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.620
 crank 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.360
 here on all the pieces that can 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.360
 move 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.880
 machine 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.180
 then it is reassembled just like 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.180
 I was 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.440
 always remember how they were 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.440
 to be thrown out here again 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.480
 this is the icon 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.819
 I'm going to kill over here 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.670
 here it is 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.670
 it gets done 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.069
 and done and reapplied 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.900
 like this one is clean but with the other 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.900
 that what was used recently fat 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.080
 these are the reels have a little bit of 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.080
 sand is wrapped riding 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.120
 here 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.490
 you see that it has some ring with the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.730
 brush and a little water is removed the 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.730
 burner 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.110
 the pro takes water and is the sand 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.680
 and it dries but they are very well dry 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.639
 it's very dry exactly the same here 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.000
 if you have sand and fats here it's removed 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.000
 the fat 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.320
 this has another mechanism exactly 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.660
 just as you dismounted you remember 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.620
 how is 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.620
 it cleans 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.129
 and the fat is removed 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.490
 to all 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.939
 this I do after after the 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.159
 fishing day if it's at night by the 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:28.310
 next guard equally clean to 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.889
 the streets if you want me to teach how 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.990
 clean a 3-d cane to sections not 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.100
 telescopic 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.970
 and you put it and already but yes 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.970
 Soon here too 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.630
 this only that at least since it is not the 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.790
 coach 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.720
 Olympia 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.720
 All very well 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.070
 this as I said before also 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.070
 above 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.710
 there are also times that what I have done 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.660
 this here I have done loosens 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.210
 loosens up the sides because anyone here 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.200
 a kind of nut that tightens and already 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.200
 it has happened to me with the little 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.320
 and I repeat that it does not matter what this is 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.320
 CarrÃ© are the magicians 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.460
 a tip that you never use 3 in 1 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:40.139
 since there are bad for the reels 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.139
 a friend commented 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.870
 I've done 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:24.250
 and that is very good 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.250
 now that we do not have a mystery made 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.200
 what 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.200
 we are visuals here like this 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:39.520
 and here 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.520
 in all the places 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.939
 and it squeezes 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.190
 and with this and little else with the two 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:04.080
 reels I repeat the reel 

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:07.630
 this air silicones water and a brush 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.510
