reviews<00:00:21.670> because<00:00:22.090> I<00:00:22.150> think<00:00:22.210> they<00:00:22.450> become

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
reviews because I think they become

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.590 
reviews because I think they become
boring<00:00:23.050> redundant<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.100> my<00:00:24.940> personal<00:00:25.300> opinion

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
boring redundant and my personal opinion

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.210 
boring redundant and my personal opinion
