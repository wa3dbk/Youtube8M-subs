00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.370
 do not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210
 yes 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.540
 how are we all have new 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 zinc ex protein supplement from pepe ex 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.320
 we go 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.239
 singh ex of bibi ex laboratories 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.820
 vicks a protein that I was 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.489
 living quite pretty pretty well 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.309
 and here they have it from vicks labs 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.269
 I had already talked about another that was massive 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.329
 corp is I think it's the big sister 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:02.110
 so to speak or an even more protein 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.540
 clean that is literally like that is 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.390
 literal for when you go to a 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.730
 competition that really takes care of your 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.800
 load others to the fullest is really 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.860
 that you have a diet is super strict 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.110
 this is not not so much but if you are in a 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.770
 definition phase if what you are looking for is 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.560
 nothing more an isolated protein this is me 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.820
 I think it's an excellent option I put it 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.640
 in the top 5 of January 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.640
 so let's not waste any more time and let's go 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.460
 to see iniexsa videos that is without jacks 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.210
 vivex those who brought us the bait corp 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.229
 What is this protein that brings 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.899
 brings is that you will have 75 services 70 and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.270
 50 years will last approximately one 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.550
 month a month and a half depending on the use 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.250
 right you give this protein 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.590
 and a 30 gram scooter because at 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.060
 listen to 30 grams then by 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.400
 service per service brings 120 calories 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.020
 of total fat 30 30 grams of 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:14.280
 cholesterol 350 milligrams of sodium 95 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.950
 milligrams of potassium 160 milligrams and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.550
 of carbonate only brings 3 grams 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.860
 truth is also very very short in 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.050
 how many grams is excellent for 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.440
 when you're looking to define 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.710
 mark yourself art rai completely is a 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:37.590
 an excellent choice and protein for 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.380
 Service by service gives us 20 grams 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.080
 then they call weight issues of 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.500
 everyone of stature are already going to take 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.610
 the speeches but the right way 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.720
 of taking this protein is to take a 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.210
 measured with 300 milliliters of milk or with 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.950
 water I recommend it more with milk 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:05.220
 in the morning and then you're going to take 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:09.480
 Two measures two scoops after entering 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.550
 or if to say your training is for the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680
 tomorrow you will take two brooms 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.720
 after training and one at night I 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.989
 I recommend it in this way better 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.680
 after training and already in the night 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.070
 so that the protein acts throughout 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.890
 the night to use that is giving us 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.650
 this whey protein concentrate 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.380
 all of that protein to inhabit 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.860
 so to say the catabolism that does not pass 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.800
 it is not so much the catabolism of these 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.000
 many hours without eating the string of 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.209
 nonsense but if it is a very very very very 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.310
 good choice in terms of phase 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.670
 definition refers is an excellent 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.709
 option the truth meets meets I believe 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.920
 that of the flavors the chocolate and I 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.680
 would move away I would seek it better the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.190
 vanilla or cookies and cream those 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.489
 two whore mother what good flavors the 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.959
 true as for pee ex flavors 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.120
 they are also very rich in terms of other 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.670
 proteins that has spoken but this one 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.739
 It also has a very rich flavor 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.019
 dissolves quite well is not like other 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.150
 they are proteins that stays stuck in the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.620
 sheikh that I stuck it in the blender and 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.780
 it's a problem because he does not know if 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.960
 you are taking the correct amount if 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.800
 you are leaving a certain amount in the pot 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.650
 or in the equator 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.870
 then this is a very good one 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.120
 option because he also has got that 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.870
 plus that does not stick do not stick in the 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.449
 seiquer boat but in terms of flavor if 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.349
 we leave it clear vanilla and cookies 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.340
 since the chocolate and leaves a lot that 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.669
 to wish 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.050
 they have to get wet on chocolate what 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.969
 what I have tried is to put a 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.789
 banana a banana 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.220
 to the blender already with the protein 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.850
 chocolate 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.560
 but it is the only way to improve your 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.400
 taste because if it is made for the truth 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.530
 of the plane go away then this 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.660
 protein I repeat it again because I 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.570
 the stupidity that I committed when everything 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.270
 I was very very novice was that I 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.540
 buy but the sibucara when 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.340
 I needed to gain volume not so much 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:30.250
 definition not so much scratching then yes 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.250
 it was a great great fail and I know I committed 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.690
 this price of the new t is that it does not 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.240
 It tells you that you are trying to take 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.460
 beginning when you're still going to start 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.320
 when as is also your body and 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.030
 you need to first make a phase of 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.670
 volume and then do a phase of 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.960
 fiction ray art then beep and ex 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:53.420
 meets the price is this is the price not 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.020
 are paid more for that protein is the 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:00.010
 final price then the review that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.120
 so much ask me to inject vip and there is 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.110
 resolve any doubt in any 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.240
 question about their clubs 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.220
 If you liked the gift video, like in 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.050
 the button that is down here already 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:16.660
 you did very well share of fulling if 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.420
 you are not yet subscribed to this incredible 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.420
 channel after all this information 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:34.159
 Well, what are you waiting for and remember what 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:34.159
 all this was an advice and see you
