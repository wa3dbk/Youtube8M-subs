so this look is all about sectioning so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.609 
so this look is all about sectioning so
when<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:23.270> get<00:00:23.359> your<00:00:23.509> sections<00:00:23.900> in<00:00:24.020> place<00:00:24.230> the

when to get your sections in place the
rest<00:00:24.800> look<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.220> follow<00:00:25.430> so<00:00:26.150> we're<00:00:26.390> just<00:00:26.419> going

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
to section off the hair working from

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.069 
to section off the hair working from
about<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.109> ear<00:00:31.210> and<00:00:32.210> just<00:00:32.540> behind<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:33.050> ear

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
about the ear and just behind the ear

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.299 
about the ear and just behind the ear
all<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.399> way<00:00:34.520> around<00:00:34.989> until<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.379> other<00:00:36.530> side

we're going to work from ear to ear
going<00:00:44.210> across<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:44.750> ground<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:49.870> again

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
going across the ground and again

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:00.180 
going across the ground and again
splitting<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:52.340> section<00:00:52.879> into<00:00:53.210> two

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.830

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.960 
so from ear-to-ear across the top of the
head<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.230> should<00:01:03.320> have<00:01:03.560> two<00:01:03.770> sections<00:01:04.130> one

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
head you should have two sections one

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.540 
head you should have two sections one
slightly<00:01:05.420> bigger<00:01:06.100> now<00:01:07.100> we're<00:01:07.280> going<00:01:07.400> to<00:01:07.460> do

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
slightly bigger now we're going to do

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.620 
slightly bigger now we're going to do
one<00:01:07.760> more<00:01:07.790> section<00:01:09.910> working<00:01:10.910> from<00:01:11.150> just

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
one more section working from just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.130 
one more section working from just
behind<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.230> ear<00:01:13.000> again<00:01:14.000> across<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.480> top<00:01:14.930> of

the head so section 2 by 2 inch white
and<00:01:20.690> section<00:01:21.230> up<00:01:21.320> again

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580 

and<00:01:26.000> then<00:01:26.180> any<00:01:26.510> remaining<00:01:26.930> hair<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.410> have

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
and then any remaining hair you have

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.760 
and then any remaining hair you have
after<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.730> can<00:01:28.910> add<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.170> lower<00:01:30.380> part

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
after this you can add to the lower part

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.830 
after this you can add to the lower part
of<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.070> hair<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.120> is<00:01:32.270> going<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.510> make<00:01:32.660> up

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
of the hair so this is going to make up

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.520 
of the hair so this is going to make up
the<00:01:32.990> kind<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.230> cascading<00:01:33.680> wave<00:01:34.040> style<00:01:35.320> now<00:01:36.320> as

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the kind of cascading wave style now as

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.050 
the kind of cascading wave style now as
you<00:01:36.710> know<00:01:36.860> Lana<00:01:37.100> Del<00:01:37.310> Rey's<00:01:37.520> hair<00:01:37.790> it's

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you know Lana Del Rey's hair it's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.520 
you know Lana Del Rey's hair it's
usually<00:01:38.210> quite<00:01:38.660> big<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:38.990> it's<00:01:39.320> quite

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
usually quite big so it's quite

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.380 
usually quite big so it's quite
impressive<00:01:39.800> beehive<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:40.970> that's<00:01:41.150> how<00:01:41.270> we're

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
impressive beehive so that's how we're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.910 
impressive beehive so that's how we're
working<00:01:41.479> with<00:01:41.690> two<00:01:41.840> sections<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.530> create<00:01:42.770> that

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
working with two sections to create that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.730 
working with two sections to create that
volume<00:01:43.190> so<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.540> back<00:01:44.750> section<00:01:45.110> we're<00:01:45.619> going

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
volume so the back section we're going

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.170 
volume so the back section we're going
to<00:01:45.800> practice<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.310> little<00:01:46.400> bit<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.700> texturizing

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
to practice a little bit of texturizing

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.140 
to practice a little bit of texturizing
just<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.950> it's<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.250> great<00:01:52.460> idea<00:01:52.760> if<00:01:52.940> you<00:01:52.970> do

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
just this it's a great idea if you do

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.000 
just this it's a great idea if you do
have<00:01:53.360> tanner<00:01:53.660> hair<00:01:53.990> or<00:01:54.440> hair<00:01:54.619> that's<00:01:54.830> just

been<00:01:55.160> washed<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.030> know<00:01:56.150> has<00:01:56.330> no

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
been washed and that you know has no

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.359 
been washed and that you know has no
grip<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:58.580> working<00:01:59.180> with<00:01:59.360> this<00:01:59.860> I'm<00:02:00.860> gonna<00:02:01.070> back

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
grip so working with this I'm gonna back

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.940 
grip so working with this I'm gonna back
home<00:02:01.729> from<00:02:02.390> bed<00:02:02.630> an<00:02:02.750> inch<00:02:02.930> or<00:02:03.140> two<00:02:03.350> from<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
home from bed an inch or two from the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.410 
home from bed an inch or two from the
roots<00:02:04.190> all<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:05.479> way<00:02:05.570> back<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.080> hair<00:02:06.290> and

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
roots all the way back to the hair and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.150 
roots all the way back to the hair and
remember<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.540> work<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.899> around<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.560> sides<00:02:09.830> as

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
remember to work all around the sides as

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.360 
remember to work all around the sides as
well<00:02:10.190> very<00:02:10.790> important<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:12.680> middle<00:02:13.010> section

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
well very important this middle section

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.860 
well very important this middle section
is<00:02:13.400> gonna<00:02:13.550> be<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.790> foundation<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.630> style

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
is gonna be the foundation of this style

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.970 
is gonna be the foundation of this style
so<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:15.290> where<00:02:15.410> we're<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.739> get<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so it's where we're going to get the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.920 
so it's where we're going to get the
most<00:02:16.220> height<00:02:16.550> from<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.330> again<00:02:17.570> I'm<00:02:17.780> gonna

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
most height from so again I'm gonna

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.390 
most height from so again I'm gonna
practice<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.440> little<00:02:18.620> bit<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.920> texturizing

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
practice a little bit of texturizing

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.280 
practice a little bit of texturizing
just<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:23.060> just<00:02:23.270> makes<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.630> whole<00:02:23.660> look<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.140> bit

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
just it just makes the whole look a bit

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.170 
just it just makes the whole look a bit
easier<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.680> achieve<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.430> don't<00:02:25.970> have<00:02:26.060> to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
easier to achieve and you don't have to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.330 
easier to achieve and you don't have to
