00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.000
 Talk beauty guys bringing you more 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.950
 an online digital video on ps four 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 following to do but the race 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.920
 called the central drift it created was the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.869
 flamingo course 01 has two points 104 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 Let's go the little gallery of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.240
 command's already there we play with LÃ©o 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 deny guto to see here and otavio there 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.490
 Powerful race in fact she was 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.050
 sports but as probably the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.980
 It's going to be a very short race. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.989
 repeat 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.320
 There, the next day, 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.600
 and in this multipotent hand 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:47.129
 my our emotion to choose 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:53.719
 Dude, I think I'll go with a glass that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:57.350
 has better traction is oo dux the action 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.550
 remembering that it will be a gift in the snow 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.970
 drift in the snow face that's what it is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.340
 it would be very crazy, for example in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 united states have the snowy seasons 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.790
 the streets really look like this 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.220
 it would be interesting if the the right gta also 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 apply this question of time 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.159
 It would of course make it work for them. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.000
 Why would not you have to keep stirring? 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.540
 always but it would be crazy crazy man 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.230
 though 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.350
 our character and expensive assortment of cars 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.350
 it's big 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:41.270
 Look, Lady Bora, this comes to 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.950
 van stole a step 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.840
 We have to go in here though rumor 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.840
 Hey, hi, do you have to go up? 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.460
 My God, how patty mother is atypical 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.460
 patina 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.619
 that's why I put the cars 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.479
 powerful ne 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.869

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.920
 very good and in the snow then and get worse 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.470
 still 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:22.030
 then check if unavoidable 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:22.030
 have to check the galaxy opa opa 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:42.150
 Look how patina car here is not knocking 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:43.590

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.890
 Wow, I'll get inside the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.890
 parking 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:58.860
 and now where the old wrong way past 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:06.510

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:13.040
 I got injured in off is all up to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.040
 though but I think I think here 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.250
 but I think they went straight too 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.330
 come closer 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.330
 I think I'll send you 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:40.210
 I love the pathogen the line has to climb 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:47.650
 But you still have a gift. 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:53.850
 I think I rolled over but gave the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.850
 starter is coming close 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.230
 God damn it , now it passes. 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:16.800
 no ramp is going to speak, I will not go 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.800
 leave everything here there is no acceleration here 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:29.940
 Hey, dude, get out of here. 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:40.710
 under the car 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:45.280
 I know it 's wrong human there 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.490
 The guys are rolling over there, I found 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:54.930
 that to repeat this race will not give 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:57.970
 new race more insane veto it 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.970
 The snow gets in the way, huh? 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.660
 It's cool, but it bothers. 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.600
 here we are only good that neither drift is 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:14.600
 This is a school here. 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:19.640
