himself up and starts to show interest

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.480 
himself up and starts to show interest
in<00:02:12.599> laying<00:02:12.989> down

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
in laying down

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.000 
in laying down
as<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:15.990> see<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> beginning<00:02:16.680> it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
as you can see in the beginning it's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.160 
as you can see in the beginning it's
usually<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.520> gonna<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.880> very<00:02:18.180> subtle<00:02:18.570> so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
usually it's gonna be very subtle so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.850 
usually it's gonna be very subtle so
it's<00:02:19.320> up<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.100> catch<00:02:20.340> those<00:02:20.670> things<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
it's up to you to catch those things a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.440 
it's up to you to catch those things a
lot<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.950> horses<00:02:23.250> will<00:02:23.610> start<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.000> paw<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.210> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
lot of horses will start to paw on the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.150 
lot of horses will start to paw on the
ground<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.840> Nemo<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.290> doing<00:02:25.560> right<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
ground like Nemo is doing right there so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.190 
ground like Nemo is doing right there so
I'm<00:02:26.370> not<00:02:26.520> necessarily<00:02:26.700> gonna<00:02:27.210> reward<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.840> I'm

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
I'm not necessarily gonna reward it I'm

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.930 
I'm not necessarily gonna reward it I'm
gonna<00:02:28.410> try<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.770> see<00:02:28.980> where<00:02:29.250> he's<00:02:29.490> going<00:02:29.850> with

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
gonna try and see where he's going with

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300 
gonna try and see where he's going with
it<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.330> then<00:02:30.690> I'm<00:02:30.810> gonna<00:02:30.930> reward<00:02:31.200> him<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.830> he's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it and then I'm gonna reward him if he's

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.400 
it and then I'm gonna reward him if he's
pawing<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:33.240> he's<00:02:33.450> getting<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.870> idea<00:02:34.260> of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
pawing because he's getting the idea of

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.780 
pawing because he's getting the idea of
laying<00:02:34.710> down<00:02:34.800> not<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.280> pawing<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.030> ground

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
laying down not just pawing the ground

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.220 
laying down not just pawing the ground
and<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.480> those<00:02:39.600> things<00:02:39.930> with<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and that is one of those things with the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.230 
and that is one of those things with the
lay<00:02:40.380> down<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> beginning<00:02:41.670> you're<00:02:42.000> not

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
lay down is in the beginning you're not

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.820 
lay down is in the beginning you're not
really<00:02:42.480> gonna<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.900> looking<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.410> reward<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
really gonna be looking to reward a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.410 
really gonna be looking to reward a
behavior<00:02:44.310> because<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.880> really<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.150> won't

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
behavior because you really you won't

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.370 
behavior because you really you won't
get<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.990> you're<00:02:46.740> gonna<00:02:46.800> try<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.430> reward<00:02:47.970> them

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
get one you're gonna try and reward them

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.200 
get one you're gonna try and reward them
thinking<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.620> laying<00:02:50.100> down<00:02:50.190> getting<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> idea

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
thinking of laying down getting the idea

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.900 
thinking of laying down getting the idea
of<00:02:51.480> laying<00:02:51.750> down<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.920> then<00:02:53.460> that's<00:02:53.700> gonna

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
of laying down and then that's gonna

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.610 
of laying down and then that's gonna
hopefully<00:02:54.180> lead<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:55.050> getting<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
hopefully lead to you getting the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:04.640 
hopefully lead to you getting the
behavior<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.220> you're<00:02:56.340> looking<00:02:56.730> for<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:04.380> here

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
behavior that you're looking for so here

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.720 
behavior that you're looking for so here
we<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:05.010> Nemo

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
we have Nemo

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.240 
we have Nemo
after<00:03:06.390> having<00:03:06.960> done<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.470> almost<00:03:07.920> every

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
after having done this almost every

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.400 
after having done this almost every
single<00:03:08.550> day<00:03:08.700> 15<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.330> 20<00:03:09.630> minutes<00:03:09.870> day<00:03:10.080> for

single day 15 to 20 minutes day for

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.350 
single day 15 to 20 minutes day for
about<00:03:10.650> two<00:03:10.980> weeks<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.730> actually<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.210> day

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
about two weeks this is actually the day

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.070 
about two weeks this is actually the day
that<00:03:12.600> he<00:03:12.780> learned<00:03:13.020> how<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.290> lay<00:03:13.560> down<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.930> can

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
that he learned how to lay down you can

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.660 
that he learned how to lay down you can
see<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.950> don't<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.550> do

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
see here I really I don't have to do

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.699 
see here I really I don't have to do
much<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:17.910> touch<00:03:18.420> his<00:03:18.660> legs<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.140> bring<00:03:19.500> his

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
much just touch his legs and bring his

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.040 
much just touch his legs and bring his
leg<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.070> his<00:03:20.280> head<00:03:20.489> down<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.910> he<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.690> really

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
leg to his head down and he is really

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.290 
leg to his head down and he is really
starting<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> understand<00:03:23.250> what<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.850> want<00:03:24.150> him

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
starting to understand what I want him

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.590 
starting to understand what I want him
to<00:03:24.510> do<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:25.640> lot<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.760> times<00:03:27.030> they<00:03:27.239> won't<00:03:27.420> lay<00:03:27.570> down

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
to do a lot of times they won't lay down

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.020 
to do a lot of times they won't lay down
right<00:03:28.080> away<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.800> they<00:03:29.100> might<00:03:29.340> go<00:03:29.700> down<00:03:29.850> on

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
right away but they might go down on

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.550 
right away but they might go down on
their<00:03:30.180> knees<00:03:30.239> like<00:03:30.750> he's<00:03:30.989> gonna<00:03:31.110> do<00:03:31.380> right

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
here and that is a huge step that needs

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.660 
here and that is a huge step that needs
to<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.750> rewarded<00:03:33.959> almost<00:03:34.860> just<00:03:35.040> as<00:03:35.220> much<00:03:35.370> as<00:03:35.550> if

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
to be rewarded almost just as much as if

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.510 
to be rewarded almost just as much as if
he<00:03:35.790> had<00:03:35.940> laid<00:03:36.150> down<00:03:36.770> so<00:03:37.770> here<00:03:38.070> he<00:03:38.310> lays<00:03:38.459> down

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.190 
he had laid down so here he lays down
for<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.060> very<00:03:39.300> first<00:03:39.600> time<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:39.930> I'm<00:03:40.050> gonna

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
for the very first time so I'm gonna

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.770 
for the very first time so I'm gonna
really<00:03:40.680> really<00:03:41.100> over<00:03:41.760> exaggerate<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.450> reward

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
really really over exaggerate the reward

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.199 
really really over exaggerate the reward
to<00:03:42.930> really<00:03:43.470> emphasize<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.700> was<00:03:45.000> really

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
to really emphasize that that was really

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.000 
to really emphasize that that was really
the<00:03:45.330> behavior<00:03:45.570> that<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.050> wanted

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the behavior that I wanted

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.250 
the behavior that I wanted
later<00:03:47.730> on<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.000> might<00:03:48.300> ask<00:03:48.510> him<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> stay<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.140> the
