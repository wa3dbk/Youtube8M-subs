00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
green so yeah it is there are 92

green so yeah it is there are 92
underfoot<00:00:44.149> cap<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:47.999> cap<00:00:48.570> wall

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
underfoot cap you can cap wall

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.139 
underfoot cap you can cap wall
construction<00:00:49.350> says<00:00:49.739> right<00:00:49.949> there<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.969> means

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
construction says right there that means

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.509 
construction says right there that means
is<00:00:52.789> here's<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.999> cap<00:00:54.269> here's<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> sidewall<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
is here's the cap here's the sidewall so

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.459 
is here's the cap here's the sidewall so
what<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.760> does<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.719> makes<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> lot

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
what that does is that makes it a lot

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.820 
what that does is that makes it a lot
lighter<00:00:58.710> um<00:01:00.019> thin<00:01:01.019> tip<00:01:01.319> tip<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.010> tail<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.600> I

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
lighter um thin tip tip and tail and I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.289 
lighter um thin tip tip and tail and I
think<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:04.949> macro<00:01:05.309> block<00:01:05.519> wood<00:01:05.729> core<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
think it's macro block wood core so it's

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
think it's macro block wood core so it's
maple<00:01:06.540> underfoot<00:01:07.079> Aspen's<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.740> asked<00:01:08.159> me<00:01:08.250> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
maple underfoot Aspen's and asked me in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.760 
maple underfoot Aspen's and asked me in
the<00:01:08.369> tip<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.610> tail<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.140> all<00:01:10.140> those<00:01:10.500> things

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the tip and tail so all those things

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.620 
the tip and tail so all those things
combined<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:11.399> it<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.939> lighter<00:01:12.180> ski

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
combined to make it a lot lighter ski

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.319 
combined to make it a lot lighter ski
it's<00:01:12.899> really<00:01:13.290> durable<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.829> well<00:01:14.329> really

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
four millimeter camber underfoot let me

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:36.460 
four millimeter camber underfoot let me
see<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.040> put<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.399> together<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:29.909> second

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.260 

if<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.160> squeeze<00:01:37.400> them<00:01:37.580> together<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.000> can<00:01:38.030> see

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
if I squeeze them together you can see

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.390 
if I squeeze them together you can see
there's<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.570> camber<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:40.130> when<00:01:40.370> I

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
there's the camber and then when I

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.970 
there's the camber and then when I
squeeze<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.970> camber<00:01:41.360> together<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.740> see

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
squeeze the camber together you can see

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.130 
squeeze the camber together you can see
starting<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.120> right<00:01:44.300> there<00:01:44.570> there's<00:01:44.990> that

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
starting to right there there's that

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.540 
starting to right there there's that
early<00:01:45.470> rise<00:01:45.680> in<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.920> tip<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.310> tail

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
early rise in the tip and tail

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.760 
early rise in the tip and tail
there's<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.150> early<00:01:47.330> rise<00:01:47.480> in<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.630> tip<00:01:47.770> so

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
there's the early rise in the tip so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.910 
there's the early rise in the tip so
there's<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:51.170> yeah<00:01:51.290> it's<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.440> lot<00:01:51.680> lighter

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.210 
a white toe piece and a black heel piece
on<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.570> ski<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.140> then<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.440> black<00:02:27.920> toe<00:02:28.070> piece

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
on one ski and then a black toe piece

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.530 
on one ski and then a black toe piece
and<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> white<00:02:28.610> heel<00:02:28.790> piece<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.150> other<00:02:29.240> ski

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
and a white heel piece on the other ski

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.540 
and a white heel piece on the other ski
so<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> think<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.530> have<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.740> swap<00:02:31.040> those<00:02:31.280> or

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
so I think you have to swap those or

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.700 
so I think you have to swap those or
swap<00:02:31.850> those<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.990> doesn't<00:02:33.320> really<00:02:33.440> make<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
swap those but it doesn't really make a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.840 
swap those but it doesn't really make a
difference<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.250> who<00:02:34.520> cares

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
difference so who cares

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.040 
difference so who cares
um<00:02:36.070> yeah<00:02:37.070> pretty<00:02:37.850> much<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> Griffon<00:02:38.690> schizo

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
um yeah pretty much the Griffon schizo

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.540 
um yeah pretty much the Griffon schizo
allows<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:40.220> there's<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.520> little

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
allows you to do is there's a little

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.740 
allows you to do is there's a little
screw<00:02:40.970> right<00:02:41.560> there<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.030> screw<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
screw right there and you screw that and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.790 
screw right there and you screw that and
you<00:02:45.350> get<00:02:45.850> six<00:02:46.850> centimeters<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.630> for<00:02:47.900> F<00:02:48.230> travel

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
you get six centimeters of for F travel

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.949 
you get six centimeters of for F travel
so<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:49.970> them<00:02:50.090> centered<00:02:50.510> mounted<00:02:50.840> which

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
so if I have them centered mounted which

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.000 
so if I have them centered mounted which
is<00:02:51.050> where<00:02:51.170> they're<00:02:51.290> at<00:02:51.380> right<00:02:51.410> now<00:02:51.739> all<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
is where they're at right now all the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.830 
is where they're at right now all the
weight<00:02:52.130> forward<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.670> could<00:02:53.330> put<00:02:53.480> them<00:02:53.540> six

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
weight forward I could put them six

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.630 
weight forward I could put them six
centimeters<00:02:54.290> back<00:02:54.530> on<00:02:54.739> like<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.950> POW<00:02:55.130> day<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:55.580> I

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
centimeters back on like a POW day so I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.960 
centimeters back on like a POW day so I
can<00:02:55.790> ski<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> POW<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.800> moves<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.670> heel

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
can ski the POW and moves that the heel

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.810 
can ski the POW and moves that the heel
and<00:02:59.180> toe<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.660> same<00:02:59.920> or<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.160> together<00:03:01.459> so

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and toe it the same or like together so

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.699 
and toe it the same or like together so
yeah<00:03:02.660> that's<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.500> schizo<00:03:03.860> technology<00:03:04.430> um

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
yeah that's the schizo technology um

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.870 
yeah that's the schizo technology um
dinner<00:03:06.709> range<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.630> thirteen<00:03:09.100> it's<00:03:10.100> got<00:03:10.310> yeah
