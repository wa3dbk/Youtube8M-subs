people come to our lab to kind of see
how<00:01:13.459> we<00:01:13.520> were<00:01:13.819> making<00:01:14.209> the<00:01:14.329> vaccine<00:01:14.779> and<00:01:15.109> and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
how we were making the vaccine and and

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.969 
how we were making the vaccine and and
extrapolate<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.719> a<00:01:18.139> you<00:01:18.829> know<00:01:18.859> a

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:34.669 
actually you know quite simple it's just

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:36.190 
actually you know quite simple it's just
