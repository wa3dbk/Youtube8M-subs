00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
switch in this position we can remove

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.810 
switch in this position we can remove
the<00:03:49.570> electrical<00:03:50.080> connector<00:03:50.530> by<00:03:51.190> pushing<00:03:51.490> in

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.319 

same<00:04:10.930> thing<00:04:11.260> for<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.769> directional<00:04:12.640> switch<00:04:12.909> move

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
same thing for a directional switch move

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:21.810 
same thing for a directional switch move
a<00:04:13.510> steel<00:04:13.930> wheel<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.810> better<00:04:17.049> position<00:04:20.820> and

a steel wheel in a better position and

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:33.060 
a steel wheel in a better position and
we<00:04:22.060> can<00:04:22.090> get<00:04:22.510> at<00:04:23.250> Phillips<00:04:24.250> screws

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.810 

tougher<00:04:33.970> okay<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:34.990> got<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.350> now<00:04:37.320> once<00:04:38.320> we<00:04:38.820> get

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
tougher okay we got it now once we get

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.940 
tougher okay we got it now once we get
it<00:04:39.970> in<00:04:40.450> that<00:04:40.690> position<00:04:40.870> right<00:04:41.320> there<00:04:41.820> we<00:04:42.820> can

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
it in that position right there we can

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.740 
it in that position right there we can
remove<00:04:44.950> our<00:04:45.490> electrical<00:04:46.180> connectors<00:04:46.890> one<00:04:48.750> and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
remove our electrical connectors one and

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.340 
remove our electrical connectors one and
then<00:04:49.930> we<00:04:50.110> got<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:53.680> one<00:04:53.740> right<00:04:54.130> there<00:04:54.190> and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
then we got this one right there and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:05.060 
then we got this one right there and
there's<00:04:56.350> our<00:04:56.530> directional<00:04:57.070> switch

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.560 

so<00:05:06.070> that's<00:05:06.340> all<00:05:06.580> there<00:05:06.699> is<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.970> removing<00:05:07.389> your

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
so that's all there is to removing your
