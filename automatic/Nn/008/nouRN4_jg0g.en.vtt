00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
okay so let's jump into the pros for

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.720 
okay so let's jump into the pros for
this<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.730> lip<00:00:18.119> lacquer

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.179 

so<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.570> pro<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.020> course<00:00:22.289> number<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.859> um

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
so the pro of course number one is um

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.460 
so the pro of course number one is um
actually<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.760> packaging<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.449> really<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
actually the packaging I really like the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.470 
actually the packaging I really like the
packaging<00:00:25.680> oftentimes<00:00:26.609> you'll<00:00:27.000> find<00:00:27.270> with

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
packaging oftentimes you'll find with

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.659 
packaging oftentimes you'll find with
lip<00:00:27.660> glosses<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.439> lip<00:00:28.650> lacquers<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.430> any<00:00:29.579> of

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
lip glosses or lip lacquers or any of

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.730 
lip glosses or lip lacquers or any of
these<00:00:29.789> kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> liquid<00:00:30.360> lip<00:00:30.720> products<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
these kind of liquid lip products that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.560 
these kind of liquid lip products that
is<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.070> messy<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.210> cheaply

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
is just messy like it's just so cheaply

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
is just messy like it's just so cheaply
designed<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.949> the<00:00:35.220> lip<00:00:35.400> gloss<00:00:35.579> gets<00:00:35.879> off<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
designed that the lip gloss gets off the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.270 
designed that the lip gloss gets off the
sides<00:00:36.449> of<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.050> lip<00:00:37.230> gloss<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.830> or<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sides of the lip gloss you know or the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040 
sides of the lip gloss you know or the
lip<00:00:38.430> lacquer<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.879> whatever<00:00:39.269> gets<00:00:39.540> off<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.839> stun

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
lip lacquer or whatever gets off to stun

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
lip lacquer or whatever gets off to stun
the<00:00:40.080> product<00:00:40.650> gets<00:00:40.769> on<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> bottle<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
the product gets on on the bottle and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.400 
the product gets on on the bottle and
these<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.540> actually<00:00:42.870> done<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.379> really

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
these are actually done really really

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
these are actually done really really
well<00:00:43.650> so<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.339> does<00:00:44.580> not<00:00:44.820> happen<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.360> these

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
well so that does not happen with these

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.930 
well so that does not happen with these
there's<00:00:45.720> no<00:00:45.870> leakage<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.699> really

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
there's no leakage so I really really

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.540 
there's no leakage so I really really
like<00:00:48.089> that<00:00:48.269> about<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:49.290> design<00:00:49.650> of<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.400> know

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like that about the design of you know

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
like that about the design of you know
and<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.879> something<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.379> actually<00:00:52.650> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and for something which is actually the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.299 
and for something which is actually the
second<00:00:53.579> Pro<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.140> cost<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:56.039> something

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
second Pro is the cost for something

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.650 
second Pro is the cost for something
that<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.699> cheap<00:00:56.969> these<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.329> averaged

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that is so cheap these are averaged

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.819 
that is so cheap these are averaged
around<00:00:57.809> 499<00:00:58.530> um<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.789> each<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.320> my

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
around 499 um for each one and so on my

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.219 
around 499 um for each one and so on my
drug<00:01:02.070> stores<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.609> CVS<00:01:03.059> Walgreens<00:01:03.719> rite<00:01:04.050> aid

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
drug stores so CVS Walgreens rite aid

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
drug stores so CVS Walgreens rite aid
things<00:01:04.649> like<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.039> so<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:06.030> something<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
things like that so for something that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.070 
things like that so for something that
is<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.810> cheaply<00:01:07.280> sold<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:09.420> packaging<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is so cheaply sold the packaging is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.779 
is so cheaply sold the packaging is
actually<00:01:10.440> really<00:01:10.649> really<00:01:10.860> nice<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> like

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.889 
actually come on beautifully and they
are<00:01:20.340> exactly<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.690> when<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
think of a lip lacquer you think of a

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.300 
think of a lip lacquer you think of a
product<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.899> neither<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.319> gloss<00:01:25.709> or<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
product that is neither a gloss or I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
product that is neither a gloss or I
lipstick<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.360> chose<00:01:28.399> four<00:01:29.399> colors<00:01:30.030> from<00:01:30.539> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
lipstick I chose four colors from the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
lipstick I chose four colors from the
more<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.069> are<00:01:32.340> some<00:01:32.640> colors<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
more because they are some colors that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
more because they are some colors that
have<00:01:33.300> some<00:01:33.660> kind<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.929> sheen<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> shimmer<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
have some kind of sheen of shimmer to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.650 
have some kind of sheen of shimmer to
them<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.160> didn't<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.940> those<00:01:36.179> on<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
them I didn't really like those on the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.130 
them I didn't really like those on the
lips<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.349> I<00:01:37.440> chose<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.310> more<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:39.300> guess<00:01:39.690> matte

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
lips so I chose the more I guess matte

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
lips so I chose the more I guess matte
colors<00:01:40.679> that<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.039> that<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.910> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
colors that they that they have in the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
line although these aren't exactly am at

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.639 
line although these aren't exactly am at
the<00:01:45.330> product<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:47.550> for<00:01:48.060> me<00:01:48.209> um<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:49.470> fact

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the product and so for me um the fact

the product and so for me um the fact
that<00:01:49.830> they<00:01:50.009> are<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.489> bright<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.179> vibrant

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that they are so bright and so vibrant

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.690 
that they are so bright and so vibrant
the<00:01:52.259> color<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.649> four<00:01:52.890> calls<00:01:53.099> that<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> chosen

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the color the four calls that I chosen

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.330

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
they are nova apocalyptic big bang and

not<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.240> brightest<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:17.200> I<00:05:17.260> guess<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.560> of

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
not the brightest and I guess that of

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.930 
not the brightest and I guess that of
all<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.950> these<00:05:18.070> this<00:05:18.280> would<00:05:18.400> probably<00:05:18.550> be<00:05:18.790> my

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
all of these this would probably be my

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.930 
all of these this would probably be my
least<00:05:19.330> favorite<00:05:19.990> color<00:05:20.290> only<00:05:20.830> because<00:05:21.010> as<00:05:21.490> you

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
least favorite color only because as you

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.470 
least favorite color only because as you
notice<00:05:22.270> my<00:05:22.450> top<00:05:22.780> lip<00:05:23.170> requires<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.890> lot<00:05:24.340> more

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
notice my top lip requires a lot more

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.850 
notice my top lip requires a lot more
application<00:05:25.480> to<00:05:25.690> get<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.050> even<00:05:26.500> full

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
application to get that even full

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.850 
application to get that even full
coverage<00:05:27.690> so<00:05:28.690> it's<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:28.990> little<00:05:29.110> bit<00:05:29.200> sheer<00:05:29.590> for

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860
