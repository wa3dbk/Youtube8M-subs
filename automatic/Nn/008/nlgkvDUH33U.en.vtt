Pistons or sticky pistons pressure plate
and<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> block<00:00:47.989> basically<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.890> like

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and a block basically you can have like

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.760 
and a block basically you can have like
different<00:00:50.820> times<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
different times like that one that is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.310 
different times like that one that is
useful<00:00:53.399> sticky<00:00:53.789> pistons<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.660> there's

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
useful sticky pistons and there's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
useful sticky pistons and there's
another<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.920> over<00:00:56.100> there

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
another one over there

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.389 
another one over there
used<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.090> normal<00:00:57.449> Pistons<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.289> reason<00:00:59.250> have

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
used with normal Pistons the reason have

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.420 
used with normal Pistons the reason have
a<00:00:59.430> bed<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.879> me<00:01:00.059> hand<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.660> cause<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:02.010> sleeping

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
a bed in me hand is cause I was sleeping

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
a bed in me hand is cause I was sleeping
before<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> forgot<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> gotta<00:01:03.750> finish<00:01:03.930> before

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
before I forgot I gotta finish before

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.679 
before I forgot I gotta finish before
the<00:01:04.500> recording<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.210> sorry<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.570> that

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the recording so I'm sorry about that

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.070 
the recording so I'm sorry about that
but<00:01:06.960> don't<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.650> make<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> difference<00:01:09.080> so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
but don't really make a difference so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
but don't really make a difference so
you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> customize<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.299> bear

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you can just customize it a little bear

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.420 
you can just customize it a little bear
to<00:01:12.689> put<00:01:12.840> different<00:01:13.260> blocks<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.220> looks

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to put different blocks and it looks

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.149 
to put different blocks and it looks
quite<00:01:14.729> nice<00:01:15.619> matches<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.650> house<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
quite nice matches your house that you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.539 
quite nice matches your house that you
have<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> complement<00:01:18.030> or<00:01:18.210> cobblestone<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.549> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
have a complement or cobblestone and so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.450 
have a complement or cobblestone and so
what<00:01:20.670> you're<00:01:20.759> gonna<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.210> stick<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:28.460> you've

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
what you're gonna do is stick is you've

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
what you're gonna do is stick is you've
gotta<00:01:29.700> put<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.360> block<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> top<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
gotta put a block on the top just to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.880 
gotta put a block on the top just to
stop<00:01:32.009> them<00:01:32.159> ups<00:01:32.340> jumping<00:01:32.579> out<00:01:32.820> and
