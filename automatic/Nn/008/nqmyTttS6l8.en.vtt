00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
worked and a lot of the features simply

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860 
worked and a lot of the features simply
open<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.309> blackberry<00:00:50.820> browser<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.300> directed

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
open the blackberry browser and directed

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.540 
open the blackberry browser and directed
me<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.170> mobile<00:00:52.530> interface<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:53.129> Evernote

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
me to the mobile interface of Evernote

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
me to the mobile interface of Evernote
so<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:55.170> eyes<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:56.399> application<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.059> useless

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
so in my eyes the application is useless

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
so in my eyes the application is useless
and<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.649> difference<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.699> me

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
and there is little difference to me

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
and there is little difference to me
using<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.390> mobile<00:01:00.539> interface<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.620> the

using the mobile interface to the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.910 
using the mobile interface to the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
application but I'm a third person and I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.350 
application but I'm a third person and I
really<00:01:05.159> believe<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> application<00:01:05.970> has<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> lot

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
really believe the application has a lot

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.200 
really believe the application has a lot
of<00:01:06.390> potential<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.799> also<00:01:08.070> has<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
of potential and it also has one of the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
of potential and it also has one of the
best<00:01:09.479> looking<00:01:09.689> user<00:01:10.110> interfaces<00:01:10.710> I've<00:01:10.860> ever

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
best looking user interfaces I've ever

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.490 
best looking user interfaces I've ever
seen<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.520> any<00:01:11.760> application<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.350> these

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
seen on any application so on these

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.580 
seen on any application so on these
grounds<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.310> give<00:01:14.570> with<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> good<00:01:15.869> mind<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
grounds I can give with the good mind to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.219 
grounds I can give with the good mind to
stars<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> 5<00:01:18.060> forever<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.020> for

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
stars out of 5 forever not for

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.390 
stars out of 5 forever not for
blackberry<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> fair<00:01:21.330> rating

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
blackberry I think this is a fair rating

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.649 
blackberry I think this is a fair rating
but<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.520> everyone<00:01:23.850> else<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> now<00:01:24.240> listening

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
but if everyone else is now listening

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.350 
but if everyone else is now listening
here<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.439> my<00:01:25.590> three<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:26.070> three<00:01:26.310> points<00:01:26.700> where

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
here are my three or three points where

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
here are my three or three points where
I<00:01:27.390> believe<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.380> should<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
I believe they should really get this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.929 
I believe they should really get this
stuff<00:01:29.670> done<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.710> probably<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:32.220> they<00:01:32.700> can

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
stuff done and probably then they can

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.649 
stuff done and probably then they can
