people<00:00:26.910> don't<00:00:27.119> really<00:00:27.240> understand<00:00:27.750> this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
people don't really understand this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.929 
people don't really understand this
technology<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:29.039> pretty<00:00:29.220> simple<00:00:29.550> right

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
technology but it's pretty simple right

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.299 
technology but it's pretty simple right
we're<00:00:30.210> very<00:00:30.390> simple<00:00:30.810> actually<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.529> your

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
we're very simple actually so your

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.120 
we're very simple actually so your
body's<00:00:32.880> fat<00:00:33.270> actually<00:00:33.630> tends<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.440> float<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
body's fat actually tends to float and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.590 
body's fat actually tends to float and
I'm<00:00:35.280> gonna<00:00:35.399> show<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.000> canister<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
I'm gonna show you in this canister so

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.290 
I'm gonna show you in this canister so
this<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:37.079> 20<00:00:37.590> percent<00:00:37.800> oil<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this is about 20 percent oil here and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.619 
this is about 20 percent oil here and
watch<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> flip<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> over<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.219> oil

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
watch when I flip this over the oil

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.250 
watch when I flip this over the oil
wants<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.840> rise<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> top<00:00:45.170> they're<00:00:46.170> gonna

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
wants to rise to the top they're gonna

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.660 
wants to rise to the top they're gonna
have<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.500> hold<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> right<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.070> problem

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
have you hold that right there problem

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.389 
have you hold that right there problem
this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.690> where<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.230> 32%<00:00:49.800> oils<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
this is one where it's about 32% oils so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
this is one where it's about 32% oils so
there's<00:00:50.579> more<00:00:50.850> more<00:00:51.239> oil<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
there's more more oil much like in the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.670 
there's more more oil much like in the
body<00:00:52.920> again<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.090> fat<00:00:54.329> rises<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.140> top<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
body again the fat rises to the top and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
body again the fat rises to the top and
what<00:00:56.340> you're<00:00:56.520> doing<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.180> able<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
what you're doing is you're able to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.810 
what you're doing is you're able to
compare<00:00:58.020> someone's<00:00:58.410> dry<00:00:58.890> weight<00:00:59.190> versus

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
compare someone's dry weight versus

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
compare someone's dry weight versus
their<00:01:00.000> water<00:01:00.239> weight<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:00.840> muscles<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
their water weight because muscles and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
their water weight because muscles and
bone<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.399> denser<00:01:02.760> than<00:01:02.879> water<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.300> they'll

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
bone are denser than water so they'll

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.119 
bone are denser than water so they'll
actually<00:01:03.719> sink<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> water<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.830> fat

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
actually sink into the water the fat

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.560 
actually sink into the water the fat
will<00:01:05.309> rise<00:01:05.460> above<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.390> figure

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
will rise above that so you can figure

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
will rise above that so you can figure
out<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.750> percentage<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.560> fat<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
out that percentage that's fat and we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.620 
out that percentage that's fat and we
can<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:08.970> Christy<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can do that with Christy right now to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
can do that with Christy right now to
figure<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.110> her<00:01:10.260> actual<00:01:11.060> percentages

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
figure out what her actual percentages

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.100 
figure out what her actual percentages
right<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
right you got it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.999 
right you got it
so<00:01:13.770> Lily<00:01:13.920> takes<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> few<00:01:14.520> minutes<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:16.009> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
so Lily takes a few minutes to do the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.289 
so Lily takes a few minutes to do the
