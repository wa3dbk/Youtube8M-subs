good yeast starter now we most of us I'm

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.859 
good yeast starter now we most of us I'm
sure<00:00:20.070> get<00:00:20.550> our<00:00:20.640> yeast<00:00:20.850> either<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.240> dry<00:00:21.570> or

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.050 
sure get our yeast either is dry or
liquid<00:00:22.640> white<00:00:23.640> labs<00:00:23.939> or<00:00:24.330> why<00:00:25.080> yeast<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.060> they

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
liquid white labs or why yeast and they

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.410 
liquid white labs or why yeast and they
all<00:00:27.240> work<00:00:27.449> really<00:00:27.660> well<00:00:28.460> however<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.760> really

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
all work really well however I really

like<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.810> my<00:00:31.109> yeast<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.740> started

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
like to have my yeast to get started

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.360 
like to have my yeast to get started
quickly<00:00:33.500> there's<00:00:34.500> nothing<00:00:35.130> worse<00:00:35.340> than

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
quickly there's nothing worse than

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.750 
quickly there's nothing worse than
waiting<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.030> day<00:00:36.300> day<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.079> half<00:00:37.380> for

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
okay I like it to start quickly within

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
okay I like it to start quickly within
oh<00:00:45.390> four<00:00:46.110> five<00:00:46.289> hours<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:47.190> things

oh four five hours I want things
bubbling<00:00:47.969> along<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.829> always<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.879> good

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
bubbling along so I always make a good

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.130 
bubbling along so I always make a good
starter<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.289> thought<00:00:52.500> we'd<00:00:52.680> talk<00:00:52.890> about<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
starter and I thought we'd talk about it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.130 
starter and I thought we'd talk about it
starts<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.289> obviously<00:00:55.680> with<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.890> pot<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:57.109> use<00:00:58.109> a

overall however if you're really
fanatical<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.770> might<00:01:16.979> use<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> lighter<00:01:17.610> for

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
fanatical you might use the lighter for

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140 
fanatical you might use the lighter for
the<00:01:18.030> pale<00:01:18.900> ales<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.860> dark<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> your

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
darker beers get it boiling now remember

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.899 
darker beers get it boiling now remember
it<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:27.150> boil<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it could boil over just like it can in a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.910 
it could boil over just like it can in a
wort<00:01:30.420> pot<00:01:30.659> cuz<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.170> basically<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.770> we're

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.520 
favorite stirrer we get to stir in this
thing<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> mixed<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.880> well<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:43.049> let<00:01:43.500> it

okay once I'm done with a good solid
boil<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> probably<00:01:53.670> they'll<00:01:53.850> over<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> last

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509

boil it probably they'll over the last
minute<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.320> two<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.740> always<00:01:56.189> throw<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> lid

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
minute or two I always throw on a lid

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.289 
minute or two I always throw on a lid
I<00:01:57.890> want<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.159> good<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.640> hot<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.969> steamy

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I want it to get good and hot and steamy

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.200 
I want it to get good and hot and steamy
in<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.990> helps<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.560> sanitation

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
in there and that helps with sanitation

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.520 
in there and that helps with sanitation
what's<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> most<00:02:03.540> important<00:02:04.140> thing<00:02:04.350> and

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.029 
continue to stir it this thing will go
to<00:04:42.180> nuts<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.749> have<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> great<00:04:43.259> time<00:04:43.499> and<00:04:43.710> you're

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
to nuts and have a great time and you're

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.689 
to nuts and have a great time and you're
basically<00:04:44.520> making<00:04:45.020> beer<00:04:46.020> at<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.860> time<00:04:47.069> it's

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
basically making beer at the time it's

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.499 
basically making beer at the time it's
stirring<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.419> do<00:04:49.080> like<00:04:49.529> the<00:04:49.770> syrup<00:04:49.979> lights<00:04:50.479> okay

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
stirring I do like the syrup lights okay

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.439 
stirring I do like the syrup lights okay
couple<00:04:52.259> days<00:04:52.439> down<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.919> road<00:04:53.090> this<00:04:54.090> thing<00:04:54.330> is

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
couple days down the road this thing is

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.989 
couple days down the road this thing is
basically<00:04:54.659> done<00:04:55.169> what<00:04:55.349> it's<00:04:55.469> going<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.710> do

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:55.999 
basically done what it's going to do

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.510 
basically done what it's going to do
you're<00:04:56.999> gonna<00:04:57.120> see<00:04:57.889> once<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:59.039> turn<00:04:59.249> it<00:04:59.430> off

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
you're gonna see once you turn it off

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.790 
you're gonna see once you turn it off
and<00:04:59.729> let<00:04:59.849> it<00:04:59.879> settle<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.449> much<00:05:00.689> heavier<00:05:01.080> amount

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
and let it settle a much heavier amount

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.409 
and let it settle a much heavier amount
of<00:05:01.949> yeast<00:05:02.490> then<00:05:02.759> you<00:05:02.879> could<00:05:03.090> have<00:05:03.180> possibly

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
of yeast then you could have possibly

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.899 
of yeast then you could have possibly
started<00:05:04.080> with<00:05:04.259> and<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.949> know<00:05:05.279> those<00:05:05.610> seats

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
started with and you know those seats

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.360 
started with and you know those seats
are<00:05:06.120> happy<00:05:06.509> and<00:05:06.689> healthy<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.379> are<00:05:07.889> ready<00:05:08.099> to

lets the yeast settle down to the bottom

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.579 
lets the yeast settle down to the bottom
once<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.800> yeast<00:05:38.009> has<00:05:38.129> settled<00:05:38.779> then<00:05:39.779> the<00:05:40.259> next

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.589 
once the yeast has settled then the next

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:42.559 
once the yeast has settled then the next
day<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:41.219> I'm<00:05:41.310> about<00:05:41.550> ready<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.849> use<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:42.389> I
