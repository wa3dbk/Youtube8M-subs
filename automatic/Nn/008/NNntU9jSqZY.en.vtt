side of the the spectrum and still

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330 
side of the the spectrum and still
incredibly<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.990> mean<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.409> highest<00:01:55.740> level

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

it can't be beneficial to gain strength
and<00:02:17.130> gain<00:02:17.610> muscle<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.560> by<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and gain muscle but it is not by a

in amazing shape but ugly looking

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.440 
in amazing shape but ugly looking
strokes<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.340> mean<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> person<00:02:53.970> with<00:02:54.209> ugly

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
strokes can win and does win all the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.940 
strokes can win and does win all the
time<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.320> know<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:58.800> necessarily

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
time so you know it's not necessarily

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.000 
time so you know it's not necessarily
that<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.840> necessarily<00:03:01.290> pick<00:03:01.709> one

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
that that you can necessarily pick one

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.229 
that that you can necessarily pick one
or<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.790> other

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
or the other

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.650 
or the other
but<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.590> lack<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.070> strength<00:03:05.640> holding<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.150> back

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
but is lack of strength holding you back

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.190 
but is lack of strength holding you back
probably<00:03:07.560> not<00:03:07.800> could<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.550> be<00:03:08.580> beneficial<00:03:09.200> yeah

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
probably not could it be beneficial yeah

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.050 
probably not could it be beneficial yeah
it<00:03:10.560> could<00:03:10.739> probably<00:03:10.980> give<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.430> some<00:03:11.459> benefit

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it could probably give you some benefit

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.470 
it could probably give you some benefit
but<00:03:12.690> being<00:03:13.050> technically<00:03:13.530> sound<00:03:13.950> is

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
but being technically sound is

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.540 
but being technically sound is
immediately<00:03:15.480> more<00:03:15.690> importance<00:03:16.560> than<00:03:16.800> just

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
immediately more importance than just

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.770 
immediately more importance than just
building<00:03:17.850> strength<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.360> you're<00:03:18.480> working<00:03:18.600> on

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
building strength if you're working on

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.060 
building strength if you're working on
your<00:03:18.840> cardio<00:03:19.230> then<00:03:19.350> you're<00:03:19.470> probably<00:03:19.650> you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
your cardio then you're probably you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.100 
your cardio then you're probably you
know<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.310> overall<00:03:20.820> good<00:03:21.060> physical<00:03:21.630> condition

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
know in overall good physical condition

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.110 
know in overall good physical condition
if<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.799> were<00:03:22.920> out<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.160> shape<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.700> know<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
if you were out of shape you know and

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.550 
if you were out of shape you know and
you<00:03:24.209> were<00:03:24.299> overweight<00:03:24.780> by<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> bunch<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.470> I

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
you were overweight by a bunch and I

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.900 
you were overweight by a bunch and I
would<00:03:25.709> say<00:03:25.890> yeah<00:03:26.220> maybe<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.580> something<00:03:26.730> you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
would say yeah maybe it's something you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.970 
would say yeah maybe it's something you
should<00:03:27.060> focus<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.510> but<00:03:28.380> since<00:03:28.769> you're<00:03:28.950> already

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
should focus on but since you're already

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.520 
should focus on but since you're already
in<00:03:29.370> good<00:03:29.610> shape<00:03:29.880> then<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.900> don't<00:03:31.170> think<00:03:31.290> this

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
in good shape then I don't think this

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.070 
in good shape then I don't think this
this<00:03:31.830> is<00:03:31.980> certainly<00:03:32.280> not<00:03:32.430> something<00:03:32.489> that's

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
this is certainly not something that's

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.110 
this is certainly not something that's
necessary<00:03:34.080> or<00:03:34.140> that's<00:03:34.380> essential<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.790> to

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
necessary or that's essential for you to

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.920 
necessary or that's essential for you to
you<00:03:36.810> know<00:03:37.730> greatly<00:03:38.730> increase<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.600> level<00:03:39.870> of

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
you know greatly increase the level of

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.350 
you know greatly increase the level of
your<00:03:39.989> play<00:03:40.260> last<00:03:41.250> thing<00:03:41.489> I'll<00:03:41.610> say<00:03:41.640> nickel<00:03:42.209> is

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
your play last thing I'll say nickel is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.539 
your play last thing I'll say nickel is
simply<00:03:42.810> that's<00:03:43.019> be<00:03:43.980> sure<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.400> you're

short<00:03:52.860> intense<00:03:53.870> bursts<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.049> output<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.950> mean

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
short intense bursts of output I mean

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.000 
short intense bursts of output I mean
we're<00:03:56.760> talking<00:03:57.120> about<00:03:57.360> 5<00:03:57.690> 10<00:03:58.080> seconds<00:03:58.860> on

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
we're talking about 5 10 seconds on

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.060 
we're talking about 5 10 seconds on
average<00:03:59.989> probably<00:04:00.989> at<00:04:01.110> most<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> point<00:04:01.950> is

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
average probably at most that a point is

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.610 
average probably at most that a point is
lasting<00:04:02.489> for<00:04:02.670> most<00:04:02.850> people<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.390> then<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.440> get

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
lasting for most people and then you get

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.820 
lasting for most people and then you get
20<00:04:05.459> 25<00:04:05.940> seconds<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.420> rest<00:04:06.660> oh<00:04:06.959> no<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.739> know

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
20 25 seconds of rest oh no you know

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.490 
20 25 seconds of rest oh no you know
it's<00:04:08.040> basically<00:04:08.370> no<00:04:08.700> activity<00:04:09.209> then<00:04:09.840> 5<00:04:10.140> 10

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
it's basically no activity then 5 10

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.759 
it's basically no activity then 5 10
seconds<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.160> high<00:04:11.910> high<00:04:12.480> intensity<00:04:13.079> activity

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
seconds of high high intensity activity

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.360 
seconds of high high intensity activity
and<00:04:13.980> then<00:04:14.700> 15<00:04:15.480> 20<00:04:15.840> 25<00:04:16.229> seconds<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.799> no<00:04:17.190> activity

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and then 15 20 25 seconds of no activity

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.909 
and then 15 20 25 seconds of no activity
and<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:20.390> this<00:04:21.390> up<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.200> down<00:04:22.530> of

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
and so you have this this up and down of

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.779 
and so you have this this up and down of
high<00:04:23.640> intensity<00:04:24.060> followed<00:04:24.720> by<00:04:24.840> low<00:04:25.080> intensity

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
high intensity followed by low intensity

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.170 
high intensity followed by low intensity
you

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
you

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.490 
you
talking<00:04:27.449> about<00:04:27.539> cardio<00:04:28.020> which<00:04:28.259> to<00:04:28.410> me

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
talking about cardio which to me

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.279 
talking about cardio which to me
typically<00:04:28.949> means<00:04:29.220> steady<00:04:30.210> intensity<00:04:31.080> for

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
typically means steady intensity for

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.610 
typically means steady intensity for
long<00:04:31.560> periods<00:04:32.070> of<00:04:32.160> time<00:04:32.660> that<00:04:33.660> can<00:04:34.110> have<00:04:34.410> some

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
long periods of time that can have some

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.290 
long periods of time that can have some
benefits<00:04:35.009> here<00:04:35.190> at<00:04:35.280> tennis<00:04:35.580> but<00:04:36.120> if<00:04:36.180> you're

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
benefits here at tennis but if you're

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.580 
benefits here at tennis but if you're
gonna<00:04:36.389> pick<00:04:36.690> just<00:04:36.930> one<00:04:37.169> kind<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:39.169> exercise<00:04:40.169> to

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
gonna pick just one kind of exercise to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.650 
gonna pick just one kind of exercise to
complete<00:04:41.130> it's<00:04:41.340> going<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.580> be<00:04:41.729> more

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
complete it's going to be more

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.870 
complete it's going to be more
beneficial<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.650> more<00:04:43.800> mimic<00:04:44.310> what<00:04:44.850> a

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
beneficial to you to more mimic what a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.960 
beneficial to you to more mimic what a
tennis<00:04:45.270> point<00:04:45.509> is<00:04:45.660> like<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.199> that<00:04:47.039> is<00:04:47.190> what's

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
tennis point is like and that is what's

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
interval training bursts a very high

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.890 
interval training bursts a very high
intensity<00:04:52.919> followed<00:04:53.639> by<00:04:53.759> a<00:04:53.789> rest<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.419> then

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
intensity followed by a rest and then

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.689 
intensity followed by a rest and then
another<00:04:55.110> burst<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.830> then<00:04:56.009> another<00:04:56.310> rest

another burst and then another rest
going<00:04:57.389> even<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.440> you<00:04:59.039> know<00:04:59.160> steady<00:04:59.610> for<00:05:00.000> a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
going even and you know steady for a
