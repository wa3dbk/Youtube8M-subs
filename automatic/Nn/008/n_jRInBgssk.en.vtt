it's<00:01:29.640> something<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> you'll<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.420> using<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it's something that you'll be using a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
it's something that you'll be using a
lot<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.530> expansion<00:01:32.189> because<00:01:32.600> there

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
lot in this expansion because there

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
lot in this expansion because there
isn't<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.799> dungeon<00:01:35.310> wise

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
isn't a lot you can do dungeon wise

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.240 
isn't a lot you can do dungeon wise
anymore<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.259> lot<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> its<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.100> out

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
anymore and a lot of its going to be out

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.469 
anymore and a lot of its going to be out
in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> world<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.970> you're<00:01:39.180> gonna<00:01:39.270> obviously

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
in the world so you're gonna obviously

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.090 
in the world so you're gonna obviously
want<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.439> able<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> different

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
want to be able to go to different

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
want to be able to go to different
servers<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.790> respawn<00:01:42.329> rates<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.780> things

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
servers because respawn rates for things

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.469 
servers because respawn rates for things
are<00:01:43.229> pretty<00:01:43.500> high<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.399> there's<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.329> really

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
are pretty high so there's not really

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
are pretty high so there's not really
any<00:01:45.659> instant<00:01:46.049> spawns<00:01:46.320> meaning<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> will

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
any instant spawns meaning that you will

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
any instant spawns meaning that you will
want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> swap<00:01:47.640> servers<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.329> when<00:01:48.540> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
want to swap servers so that when you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.840 
want to swap servers so that when you
swap<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.140> will<00:01:49.229> be<00:01:49.259> more<00:01:49.619> spawned<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
swap there will be more spawned and you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.240 
swap there will be more spawned and you
just<00:01:51.000> keep<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.240> non-stop<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> respawn

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
just keep going non-stop so the respawn

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800 
just keep going non-stop so the respawn
on<00:01:53.369> these<00:01:53.549> trees<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> three<00:01:54.479> minutes

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
on these trees is two to three minutes

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420 
on these trees is two to three minutes
showing<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.920> definitely<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
showing you that there definitely is a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.399 
showing you that there definitely is a
lot<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.850> time<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.180> hop<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> another<00:01:57.750> server<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
lot of time to hop to another server and

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
lot of time to hop to another server and
gather<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.189> trees<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> server<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.180> hop

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
gather the trees on that server then hop

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.660 
gather the trees on that server then hop
back<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.560> keep<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
back and just keep going like that and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.639 
back and just keep going like that and
you<00:02:02.820> should<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:03.090> good<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> go<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:04.140> non-stop

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you should be good to go with non-stop

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.020 
you should be good to go with non-stop
farming<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.189> only<00:02:05.369> thing<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.759> should<00:02:06.000> be

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
farming the only thing that should be

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.760 
farming the only thing that should be
limiting<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> fact<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
limiting you this is the fact that you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.820 
limiting you this is the fact that you
can<00:02:07.890> only<00:02:08.009> carry<00:02:08.310> 250<00:02:09.239> timber<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> time

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
can only carry 250 timber at a time

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.250 
can only carry 250 timber at a time
that<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.220> max<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.060> set<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.600> your<00:02:12.960> bags

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that is the max that is set on your bags

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.800 
that is the max that is set on your bags
so<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.730> recording<00:02:15.210> session<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.630> went

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so for this recording session I went

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.690 
so for this recording session I went
ahead<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.080> farm<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.740> 10<00:02:16.950> minutes<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.460> in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
ahead and farm for 10 minutes and in

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.360 
ahead and farm for 10 minutes and in
those<00:02:17.820> 10<00:02:18.090> minutes<00:02:18.420> were<00:02:18.540> able<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:19.190> 166<00:02:20.190> of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
those 10 minutes were able to get 166 of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.580 
those 10 minutes were able to get 166 of
the<00:02:20.520> timber<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.660> multiply<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:21.990> by<00:02:22.170> 6

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the timber and if you multiply that by 6

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.060 
the timber and if you multiply that by 6
to<00:02:22.770> get<00:02:22.860> your<00:02:23.070> timber<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.610> our<00:02:23.730> due<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.320> 996<00:02:25.320> so

to get your timber for our due to 996 so
just<00:02:26.370> under<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.240> thousand<00:02:28.050> timber<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.830> hour

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
just under a thousand timber in one hour

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.820 
just under a thousand timber in one hour
that<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.550> pretty<00:02:29.970> amazing<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.630> ask<00:02:30.750> me<00:02:31.260> but

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
he also do have to keep in mind that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.700 
he also do have to keep in mind that
there<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.870> limit<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.200> two<00:02:34.380> hundred<00:02:34.530> and

fifty timber at a time so you will have

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.540 
fifty timber at a time so you will have

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
couple days here it's been pretty hard

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.670 
couple days here it's been pretty hard
to<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.300> about<00:03:42.540> farming<00:03:43.050> things<00:03:43.290> because<00:03:43.650> I

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
to go about farming things because I

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.410 
to go about farming things because I
don't<00:03:43.830> really<00:03:44.190> do<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.580> much<00:03:44.760> damage<00:03:44.820> right

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
don't really do that much damage right

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.479 
don't really do that much damage right
now<00:03:45.480> on<00:03:45.989> either<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.530> my<00:03:46.650> characters<00:03:47.070> my<00:03:47.250> gear

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
now on either of my characters my gear

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.949 
now on either of my characters my gear
isn't<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.790> best<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.300> it's<00:03:48.450> hard<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.720> find<00:03:48.870> a

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
isn't the best so it's hard to find a

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.830 
isn't the best so it's hard to find a
place<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.040> can<00:03:50.130> farm<00:03:50.519> efficiently<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.390> be

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
place that I can farm efficiently and be

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.570 
place that I can farm efficiently and be
able<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.050> pull<00:03:52.230> enough<00:03:52.470> mobs<00:03:52.769> really<00:03:53.250> make<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
able to pull enough mobs really make it

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.710 
able to pull enough mobs really make it
a<00:03:53.610> good<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:55.320> strong<00:03:55.739> farming<00:03:56.340> location<00:03:56.910> but<00:03:57.690> I
