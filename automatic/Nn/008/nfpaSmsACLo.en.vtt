00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.150

 there just to progressive hair okay 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.800
 Beautiful shining is not fair with less 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.859
 volume 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.330
 A delight, people look at themselves in the mirror. 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.970
 accomplished is the same thing when you 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.130
 make a color for example per month 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.410
 be a touch up will say that you do not 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.079
 if you like more with the result 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.450
 so why not take some care 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.710
 to prolong the effect of progressive 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.600
 coloring 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.559
 if you have one if you have both 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.899
 even better 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.850
 already thought of using a speechless saltless shampoo 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.579
 from there to here but you know 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.160
 really the benefits of using shampoos 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.840
 Think about your series so much, I'll go 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.910
 explain to you now for example 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.340
 for who has hair 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.320
 the salt and ends up removing the pigments it 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.539
 just fading in removing the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.449
 pigments but it promotes a depletion 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.909
 before time and not for what lasts x 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.970
 will last - so we do not want this 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.580
 it is the same progressive because salt 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.500
 he cleans his house well clean so much 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.960
 ever than it tends to 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.329
 dryness or in normal hair and 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.049
 ends up drying out the scalp and 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.150
 thread 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.240
 so why should you use a shampoo 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.920
 without salt first is democratic is to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.920
 all hair 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.960
 second one is also well and some say 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.600
 which cleans even deeper with a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.979
 shampoo without salt without being so aggressive 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.290
 the saltless shampoo he does not 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.479
 removing the natural hair barrier 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.280
 which is the type of oiliness but the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.689
 natural oiliness is nothing to excess 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.670
 that does well to wire and protects protects the 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.530
 hair to make it healthy 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.960
 There are a lot of people that feel good when 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.960
 a unsalted shampoo says that he hair 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.600
 is more straight but aligned or that 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.000
 When sec he takes more chances and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.100
 Already noticed this so everything can be a 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.880
 clue to your yummy shampoo hair 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.009

 It's cool, you even try it at home. 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.060
 less people know that the progressive lasts 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.580
 more and your painting will also last 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.810
 It will fade after it will not last a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.700
 little more time 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.010

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.959
