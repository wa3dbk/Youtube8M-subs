00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
suitable working point of view you're

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.270 
suitable working point of view you're
able<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.510> download<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.470> attachment<00:01:04.530> perhaps

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
able to download an attachment perhaps

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
able to download an attachment perhaps
the<00:01:05.700> excel<00:01:06.000> sheet<00:01:06.050> you<00:01:07.050> can<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.320> edit<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the excel sheet you can then edit it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.280 
the excel sheet you can then edit it
make<00:01:07.950> changes<00:01:08.460> update<00:01:08.909> graphs<00:01:09.240> save<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
make changes update graphs save it and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
make changes update graphs save it and
then<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.620> send<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.790> originator

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
then you can send it back the originator

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.910 
then you can send it back the originator
the<00:01:12.780> key<00:01:12.930> thing<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.770> other

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the key thing about that there are other

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.160 
the key thing about that there are other
programs<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.150> allows<00:01:15.420> weather<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.080> they

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
programs that allows weather but they

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
programs that allows weather but they
don't<00:01:16.350> allow<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.890> retain<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.340> original

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
don't allow you to retain the original

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020 
don't allow you to retain the original
integrity<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> document<00:01:20.100> whereas<00:01:20.579> ours<00:01:20.759> does

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
integrity and document whereas ours does

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.100 
integrity and document whereas ours does
so<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.539> thing<00:01:21.689> called<00:01:21.750> round

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
so we can do a thing called round

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
so we can do a thing called round
tripping<00:01:22.500> basically<00:01:23.399> we<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.789> document

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
tripping basically we have the document

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.730 
tripping basically we have the document
yes<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.750> will<00:01:24.869> save<00:01:25.079> it<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.320> send<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> back

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
yes it will save it you send it back

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.410 
yes it will save it you send it back
some<00:01:25.979> other<00:01:26.189> deaths<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.579> they<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.939> edit<00:01:27.090> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
some other deaths but they can edit it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
some other deaths but they can edit it
and<00:01:27.720> send<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.079> to<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:29.039> only

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and send it back to you that's only

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.389 
and send it back to you that's only
possible<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.880> women<00:01:30.000> lower<00:01:30.270> panel<00:01:31.399> of

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
possible for women lower panel of

possible for women lower panel of
revolution<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> wasn't<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> today

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
revolution it wasn't like that today

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
revolution it wasn't like that today
we're<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.649> treehouse<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
we're here in a treehouse just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.069 
we're here in a treehouse just
illustrated<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.509> an<00:01:36.600> outdoor<00:01:36.780> zone

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.880 

would<00:01:41.079> you<00:01:41.170> like<00:01:41.320> people<00:01:41.530> start

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
would you like people start

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.160 
would you like people start
incorporating<00:01:42.159> miss<00:01:42.729> me

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
incorporating miss me

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
incorporating miss me
yeah<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.040> again<00:01:44.400> it's<00:01:44.549> all<00:01:44.640> about

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
yeah I think again it's all about

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
yeah I think again it's all about
balance<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.170> you've<00:01:46.290> got<00:01:46.470> laptops

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
balance so so really you've got laptops

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
balance so so really you've got laptops
obviously<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> we're<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
obviously in it and we're not going to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.670 
obviously in it and we're not going to
suggest<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.750> laptops<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> thing<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
suggest that laptops are a thing of the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
suggest that laptops are a thing of the
past<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.159> course<00:01:50.340> they're<00:01:50.549> not<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.850> mean<00:01:51.030> you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
past of course they're not I mean you

different<00:02:03.960> types<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.409> devices<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.979> two

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
different types of devices it's two

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.950 
different types of devices it's two
different<00:02:05.340> types<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.759> people<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.630> what<00:02:06.780> we're

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
different types of people so what we're

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
different types of people so what we're
trying<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> provide<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.920> whole<00:02:08.399> range

trying to do is to provide a whole range
of<00:02:09.000> different<00:02:09.060> components<00:02:09.569> different<00:02:10.140> tools

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
of different components different tools

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.170 
of different components different tools
and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.310> people<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.670> choose<00:02:11.880> what's<00:02:12.120> best
