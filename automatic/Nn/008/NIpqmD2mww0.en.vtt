two of them so on this section because I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.100

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
know I've picked up a couple of the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.470 
know I've picked up a couple of the
sleeping<00:00:49.469> darts<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.980> went<00:00:50.699> into<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:51.030> inventory

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
sleeping darts I went into my inventory

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.760 
sleeping darts I went into my inventory
and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.719> equipped<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> crossbow<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
and I equipped the crossbow with the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.319 
and I equipped the crossbow with the
sleeping<00:00:53.129> darts<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.640> can't<00:00:53.850> rank<00:00:54.090> them

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
sleeping darts because I can't rank them

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
sleeping darts because I can't rank them
and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.750> don't<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> murder<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:56.300> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and I don't have to murder them this

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.509 
and I don't have to murder them this
will<00:00:57.480> probably<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.949> some<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> only<00:00:59.309> times

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
will probably be some of the only times

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.880 
will probably be some of the only times
you<00:00:59.670> ever<00:00:59.789> seen<00:00:59.969> me<00:01:00.059> use<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> crossbow<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.960> am

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
areas I'm going to be traversing much

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.940 
areas I'm going to be traversing much
easier<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.550> that's<00:01:05.730> not<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.120> point<00:01:06.270> guys

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
easier but that's not the point guys

this<00:01:07.950> series<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> supposed<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this series is supposed to be a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.210 
this series is supposed to be a
challenge<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.390> myself<00:01:09.680> I've<00:01:10.680> already<00:01:11.070> beat

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
challenge for myself I've already beat

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.980 
challenge for myself I've already beat
the<00:01:11.369> game<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.880> very<00:01:12.509> hard<00:01:12.780> without<00:01:13.560> upgrading

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
the game on very hard without upgrading

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.190 
the game on very hard without upgrading
you<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> using<00:01:16.799> blink<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.689> was<00:01:18.689> doing

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you know all the using blink I was doing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
you know all the using blink I was doing
lethal<00:01:19.619> kills<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.220> pretty<00:01:20.460> much<00:01:20.579> only<00:01:20.880> really

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
lethal kills but pretty much only really

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.630 
lethal kills but pretty much only really
using<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> knife<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.950> myself<00:01:23.130> ready<00:01:23.490> for

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
using the knife to get myself ready for

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.319 
using the knife to get myself ready for
this<00:01:24.060> room<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.430> for<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> majority<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.119> game

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
this room so for the majority the game

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.350 
this room so for the majority the game
is<00:01:27.540> very<00:01:27.570> simple<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.500> pretty<00:01:28.890> simple<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
is very simple it's pretty simple the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.929 
is very simple it's pretty simple the
worst<00:01:31.320> level<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> game<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> sunken

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
worst level on the game is the sunken

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.630 
worst level on the game is the sunken
area<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> flooded<00:01:34.049> section<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
area the flooded section I think is it's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.249 
area the flooded section I think is it's
the<00:01:35.790> mission<00:01:36.090> before<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> final<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.079> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the mission before the final one that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
the mission before the final one that
place<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.369> found<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.759> very<00:01:38.970> rough<00:01:39.329> but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
place I found to be very rough but

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
place I found to be very rough but
that's<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> ambient

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's because there's a lot of ambient

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.590 
that's because there's a lot of ambient
things<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> environment<00:01:42.149> that<00:01:42.210> fuck<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
things in the environment that fuck you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.080 
things in the environment that fuck you
up<00:01:42.829> right<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> think<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.490> broke<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.909> game

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
up right there I think I broke the game

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.490 
up right there I think I broke the game
