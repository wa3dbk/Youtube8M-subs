00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
creating a pushing force with both feet

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.600 
creating a pushing force with both feet
the<00:03:00.810> outside<00:03:01.260> foot<00:03:01.530> which<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.010> now<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.489> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the outside foot which is now on the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:12.430 
the outside foot which is now on the
inside<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.420> body<00:03:03.600> pushes<00:03:04.500> outward

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.910 

crossovers<00:03:13.440> backward<00:03:14.280> reaching<00:03:15.920> this

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
crossovers backward reaching this

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.890 
crossovers backward reaching this
technique<00:03:17.460> helps<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.120> increase<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> player's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
technique helps to increase a player's

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.190 
technique helps to increase a player's
speed<00:03:19.320> when<00:03:19.740> skating<00:03:20.160> backward<00:03:21.170> when<00:03:22.170> a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
speed when skating backward when a

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.320 
speed when skating backward when a
player<00:03:22.410> initiates<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.160> crossover<00:03:23.520> move<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
player initiates a crossover move the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.480 
player initiates a crossover move the
outside<00:03:24.750> foot<00:03:25.080> should<00:03:25.470> reach<00:03:25.710> out<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.130> far<00:03:26.340> as

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
outside foot should reach out as far as

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.200 
outside foot should reach out as far as
possible<00:03:27.860> once<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.070> toe<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.430> planted<00:03:29.820> the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
possible once the toe is planted the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.030 
possible once the toe is planted the
reaching<00:03:30.630> aspect<00:03:31.080> forces<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.770> player<00:03:31.920> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
reaching aspect forces the player to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.120 
reaching aspect forces the player to
pull<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.640> rest<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.060> body<00:03:33.270> to<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.690> outside

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
pull the rest of the body to the outside

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.340 
pull the rest of the body to the outside
this<00:03:35.130> creates<00:03:35.610> more<00:03:35.730> power<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.570> momentum<00:03:36.780> for

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
this creates more power and momentum for

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.780 
this creates more power and momentum for
the<00:03:37.440> player<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.800> perform<00:03:38.040> additional

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the player to perform additional

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:47.740 
the player to perform additional
crossovers<00:03:43.820> crossovers<00:03:44.820> high<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.900> low
