another<00:03:25.220> reasonable<00:03:25.819> argument<00:03:26.569> against<00:03:27.470> the

another reasonable argument against the

another reasonable argument against the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
idea that Jesus is not divine it's just

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.740 
idea that Jesus is not divine it's just
simply<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.370> idea<00:03:31.579> really<00:03:32.180> undermines

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
simply that that idea really undermines

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.610 
simply that that idea really undermines
the<00:03:33.320> whole<00:03:33.350> cific<00:03:34.130> value<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.760> his<00:03:35.090> sacrifice

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the whole cific value of his sacrifice

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.099 
the whole cific value of his sacrifice
so<00:03:36.620> Jesus<00:03:36.980> had<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.370> be<00:03:37.519> true<00:03:37.790> man<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.299> true<00:03:38.900> God

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
so Jesus had to be true man and true God

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.130 
so Jesus had to be true man and true God
in<00:03:39.380> order<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.890> be<00:03:40.070> able<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.459> redeem<00:03:41.000> us<00:03:41.030> he<00:03:42.019> had

in order to be able to redeem us he had

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.319 
in order to be able to redeem us he had

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.900 
to be true man in order to be able to
suffer<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:44.989> die<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.410> make<00:03:46.040> up<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.670> sins

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
suffer and die and make up for the sins

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.630 
suffer and die and make up for the sins
committed<00:03:47.239> by<00:03:47.780> man<00:03:47.989> but<00:03:48.709> he<00:03:48.829> had<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.160> be<00:03:49.190> true

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
committed by man but he had to be true

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.690 
committed by man but he had to be true
God<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:51.049> sacrifice<00:03:51.549> carried<00:03:52.549> with

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
God so that that sacrifice carried with

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.849 
God so that that sacrifice carried with
it<00:03:52.730> an<00:03:53.000> infinite<00:03:53.209> volume<00:03:53.660> which<00:03:54.530> would<00:03:54.709> be

it an infinite volume which would be

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
enough to make up the infinite den which

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.599 
enough to make up the infinite den which
