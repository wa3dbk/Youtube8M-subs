one<00:01:18.150> denko<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.290> actually

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
one denko which I think that's actually

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
one denko which I think that's actually
very<00:01:19.680> interesting<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:21.150> people<00:01:21.360> are

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
very interesting some people are

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.850 
very interesting some people are
starting<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.720> gravitate<00:01:22.229> towards<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> lot

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
starting to gravitate towards this a lot

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.200 
starting to gravitate towards this a lot
of<00:01:22.950> people<00:01:23.159> aren't<00:01:23.310> aren't<00:01:23.670> necessarily

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
of people aren't aren't necessarily

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.929 
of people aren't aren't necessarily
running<00:01:24.600> venko<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.259> deck<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.979> i<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.549> i

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
running venko in this deck but i think i

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
running venko in this deck but i think i
think<00:01:27.000> Denko<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.509> very<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.810> strong<00:01:28.110> just

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
think Denko is very very strong just

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.810 
think Denko is very very strong just
being<00:01:28.530> able<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> plop<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> down<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> board

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
being able to plop it down on the board

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
being able to plop it down on the board
and<00:01:30.659> pendulum<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> ass<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.280> just

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and pendulum out the ass is just

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.310 
and pendulum out the ass is just
absolutely<00:01:32.880> amazing<00:01:33.210> banco<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.110> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
absolutely amazing banco is just so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
absolutely amazing banco is just so
vicious<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.979> i<00:01:35.159> probably<00:01:35.579> wouldn't<00:01:35.880> run<00:01:36.060> like

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
vicious but i probably wouldn't run like

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.600 
vicious but i probably wouldn't run like
