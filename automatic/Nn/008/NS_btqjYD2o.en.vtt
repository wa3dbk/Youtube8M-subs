00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.639
 Hello my dear I will today 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.639
 cook chicken with pumpkin in the oven 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.210
 for cooking this dish to me 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.150
 need the next product and chicken 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 the meat here is my chicken leg flesh 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.480
 about a kilogram you can use 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.970
 and cut up chicken or legs with 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.980
 bone can take and clean breast 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.500
 but there is a risk that the meat will be a bit 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.600
 a bit dry 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 pumpkin up to 750 grams of garlic here and me 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.530
 now quite a lot is 15 cloves 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.949
 weighing 40 grams and 200 milliliters 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.690
 low-fat cream greens have take 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.570
 what kind of you like me on 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.850
 the moment dill and parsley if there is 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.979
 basil can also be given very well and 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.760
 I also want to add a little bit here 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.949
 turmeric 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.150
 but it is optional seasoning can 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.150
 to take too to taste 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.870
 first i'm borrowing meat for minutes at the marina 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.260
 and q she already washed me cut on 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.210
 such decent sized pieces somewhere 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:29.090
 will be 3 4 pieces per serving 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 and now I finely chop the garlic greens 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.070
 if you want to mess around cutting garlic 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 easier to just pass it through 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.869
 garlic press 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.080
 Well, I still bo I cut finely chopped 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.500
 greens with garlic 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:51.360
 I add outta here add 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.580
 soy sauce 30 40 grams if you are not 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.060
 like soy sauce or he just 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.470
 currently you are not at hand 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.550
 salt and cons and add a little 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.869
 lemon juice here we can leave the chicken 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.759
 marinate for half an hour 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.560
 Now I will do pumpkin but first 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.370
 turn on the oven and set to warm up 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.989
 up to 200 degrees 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.989
 tengu i will cut into cubes 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.599
 like this, I cut it even sooner 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.879
 slicing is like a straw than on 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.579
 sticks 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.310
 Now I put on the card as a matter of fact I 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.629
 I will stew dishes and put gave his 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.299
 gram of butter 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.909
 if you don't like butter you can 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.700
 boldly replace it with vegetable chases 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:56.159
 make small and melt butter 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.159
 when the oil left put here 3-ku 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.500
 add salt by the way very sweet if 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.049
 you are not sweet enough 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.769
 add a teaspoon of honey here 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.299
 add a quarter teaspoon of turmeric 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.500
 Well, as I said it completely 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.590
 not necessarily and all I can mix 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.010
 keep quite small so even 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.349
 it's hard to say pumpkin fry 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.069
 rather, just mix with melted 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.790
 butter for three minutes 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.049
 pumpkin 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:40.209
 prevented turning off the gas and impose 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:43.709
 chicken if you have a dish with a lid 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.840
 just cover the covers 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.209
 put the chicken in the oven for 20 minutes at 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.209
 temperature increase to 210 degrees 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.920
 and add cream 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.629
 now I can mix everything 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.459
 send the chicken to the oven again before 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.760
 readiness in open form 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.909
 I think it will take another half an hour if 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.909
 she will bake hard on top 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.909
 tagil1 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.040
