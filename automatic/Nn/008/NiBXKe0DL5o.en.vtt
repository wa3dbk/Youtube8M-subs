00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.170
 in the country one million one hundred thousand people 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.050
 they live in poverty 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.220
 of them more than 300,000 live in 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.520
 precarious 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.370
 and survive with at least 51 thousand colones 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.440
 per month 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.780
 the figures of the most recent survey 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.150
 of ine homes that is distant from other 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.170
 reality that is shown when walking 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.170
 within these settlements 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.170
 poverty does not exempt from getting some 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:39.390
 luxuries in the last two years is more 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.300
 frequent to find this panorama 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.809
 satellite television antennas despite 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.809
 the need 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.329
 also improvised garages and cars 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.079
 and when you enter these homes the wood and 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.140
 the cans give space to flat screens 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.700
 and other valuables 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.039
 Mrs. Marta has been living here for 14 years 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.460
 and recognizes that appliances like 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.740
 this help you have better quality of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.470
 life does not try to make up its little things 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:27.110
 that has eaten it went out one takes it out 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.480
 Three years ago my dad pulled out the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.730
 got paid for Christmas that gets a 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.650
 little cheaper and then so is that 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.860
 we have managed to have the screen of 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.380
 drag and the little thing and that the most 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.370
 necessary for the house to try to 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.370
 live a little better 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.490
 and we found in the house of dona fatima 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.570
 who lives alone with her husband 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.570
 in a small grocery store 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.830
 also as she says he 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.090
 of having satellite television the fact 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.350
 that we had in a 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.630
 precarious does not mean that we do not 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.960
 let's do from those things because not 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.280
 keep for a house or for food 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.730
 other expenses you like people 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.300
 well this one I for example in the case of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.430
 we are not that not 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.100
 if it's okay to save for a little house 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.610
 but sometimes you kind of do not think 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.800
 true but I say how this is like 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.410
 like some in jarana in centers 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.840
 commercial and already how to save like that 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.760
 one finds it difficult or if one 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.860
 example in a little house and one says it's already 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.110
 one will leave you audi and can pay 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.920
 but not seeing one says maybe 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.920
 I bought this 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.010
 she is not the only one with a 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.810
 tour of various precarious for 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.380
 recognize the antennas of this type of 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.380
 service 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.940
 Dona exiled now assures that she does not have 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.370
 Grace 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.850
 my son works and he is a person 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.490
 salaried the sack credit and I 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.830
 they gave true but that's how we do all the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.500
 that we live here for example in the cable 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.080
 we have cables are paid 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.630
 nine thousand colones per month one of each 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.760
 three households live in poverty on 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.620
 getting into debt is a way to get access 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.140
 to this type of products despite the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.730
 need then where are the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.220
 priorities and why this is 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 phenomenon the answers in our 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.700
 second installment of the contrasts within 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.700
 of the three Aryans
