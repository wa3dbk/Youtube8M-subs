00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you're using a strong enough developer

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.330 
you're using a strong enough developer
to<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> job<00:00:38.730> done<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:40.680> roots<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.190> the

hair<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> run<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.809> through<00:00:43.050> over

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
hair and if you run that through over

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.630 
hair and if you run that through over

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and over and over again you're just

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.369 
and over and over again you're just
gonna<00:00:44.760> unnecessarily<00:00:45.600> process<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.200> hair

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
gonna unnecessarily process that hair

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.920 
gonna unnecessarily process that hair
more<00:00:46.530> than<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.800> needs<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:48.450> doing<00:00:48.660> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
more than it needs to be so not doing it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
more than it needs to be so not doing it
will<00:00:49.079> definitely<00:00:49.710> improve<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> integrity<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
will definitely improve the integrity of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.459 
will definitely improve the integrity of
the<00:00:51.390> hair<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.899> keep<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> from<00:00:52.289> drying

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the hair as well as keep it from drying

the hair as well as keep it from drying
out<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.010> becoming<00:00:53.340> brittle<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.940> damaged<00:00:54.300> i

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
out and becoming brittle and damaged i

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.799 
out and becoming brittle and damaged i
think<00:00:55.680> another<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.399> good<00:00:56.640> point<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:57.329> not

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
think another really good point of not

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.330 
think another really good point of not
running<00:00:57.989> your<00:00:58.199> color<00:00:58.410> through<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.100> you're

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
running your color through is you're

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.849 
running your color through is you're
gonna<00:00:59.399> keep<00:00:59.699> from<00:01:00.059> over<00:01:00.449> depositing<00:01:01.140> color

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
gonna keep from over depositing color

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.979 
gonna keep from over depositing color
molecules<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> ends<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> hair<00:01:03.090> what

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
molecules in the ends of the hair what

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.390 
molecules in the ends of the hair what
color<00:01:04.019> does<00:01:04.470> tend<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> fade<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.070> there's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
color does tend to fade out there's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.500 
color does tend to fade out there's
always<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> couple<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> color

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
always going to be a couple of color

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.539 
always going to be a couple of color
molecules<00:01:07.020> hanging<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
molecules hanging on there and if you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.160 
molecules hanging on there and if you
pile<00:01:08.790> them<00:01:09.000> over<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.540> over<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.869> over<00:01:09.900> each

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
pile them over and over and over each

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
pile them over and over and over each
other<00:01:10.380> eventually<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.310> gonna<00:01:11.430> get

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
other eventually it's just gonna get

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420 
other eventually it's just gonna get
dark<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> ends<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:13.350> great<00:01:13.619> slightly

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
dark on the ends a really great slightly

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
dark on the ends a really great slightly
dramatic<00:01:14.640> example<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.080> see

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
dramatic example of that is when you see

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.910 
dramatic example of that is when you see
somebody<00:01:16.680> who<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.630> doing<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.409> home<00:01:19.680> box

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
somebody who is doing the at home box

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.350 
somebody who is doing the at home box
color<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.369> their<00:01:20.520> hair<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:20.909> tend<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> run

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
color on their hair and they tend to run

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.490 
color on their hair and they tend to run
it<00:01:21.479> through<00:01:21.630> from<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> roots<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> ends

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
it through from the roots to the ends

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050 
it through from the roots to the ends
over<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.890> over<00:01:23.070> again<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.790> them<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
over and over again and you see them and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.340 
over and over again and you see them and
they<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> color<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.930> were<00:01:24.990> going

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
they have the color that they were going

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
they have the color that they were going
for<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> root<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
for down at the root and then it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.219 
for down at the root and then it
eventually<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.450> gets<00:01:27.600> darker<00:01:27.930> until<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
eventually just gets darker until you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.130 
eventually just gets darker until you
have<00:01:28.320> black<00:01:28.530> ends<00:01:29.390> on<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.630> positive<00:01:30.840> note

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
have black ends on a more positive note

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.490 
have black ends on a more positive note
not<00:01:32.009> running<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> color<00:01:32.610> through<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.500> going

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
not running the color through is going

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.980 
not running the color through is going
to<00:01:34.799> allow<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> very<00:01:36.060> natural<00:01:36.420> look

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to allow you to have a very natural look

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.440 
to allow you to have a very natural look
to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> hair<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:38.220> natural<00:01:38.729> hair<00:01:38.939> even

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to the hair because natural hair even

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
to the hair because natural hair even
virgin<00:01:39.930> uncoloured<00:01:40.470> hair<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.860> gonna<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
virgin uncoloured hair is gonna be a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.670 
virgin uncoloured hair is gonna be a
little<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.640> lighter<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> ends<00:01:42.420> anyway<00:01:42.720> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
little bit lighter on the ends anyway so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
little bit lighter on the ends anyway so
only<00:01:44.040> applying<00:01:44.430> color<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> roots<00:01:45.240> is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
only applying color to the roots is
