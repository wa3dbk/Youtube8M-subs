00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.540
The story of

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:11.560
wanting to become one at midnight when you can't become one.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.700
Notice this roundabout expression;

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.140
our irony.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.150
You stay hush

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.600
just to hear the sound of insects.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.180
I like those brief moments of boredom.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.620
At any rate we should tell each other right away,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.800
and regain my mind's composure.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.880
My complaint is, what we have now is everything.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.360
But you did have some serious thoughts about how we should go on, right?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.680
When it became twisted,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.500
it became serious,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.460
but is that a proof of liking?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.660
It's because you're the one who misunderstood it;

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.890
an explosive irony.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.400
Your sleeping face seems lovely.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.160
Let me admire your meekness...

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.490
We huddled together

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.500
and it was all thanks to those many things we got.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.960
Everytime you say something nasty,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.600
even if you fall ill or cry,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.640
be on the mind of a philosopher

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.760
and engrave the things a little bit.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.420
But whether you like it or not, I enjoy taking care of you.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.050
I don't keep any secrets.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.980
But we had to be mysterious, right?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.600
Is it contradictory? Would you like to stimulate it?

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.240
An explosive irony.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:46.260
The parts I hate about myself are those you say you like.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:04:01.010
Is it a trick? I want to believe, but I'm scared.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.060
When it became twisted,

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.740
it became serious,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.860
but is that a proof of liking?

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.900
It's because you're the one who misunderstood it;

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.730
An explosive irony.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.610
I don't keep any secrets.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.760
But we had to be mysterious, right?

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.230
Is it contradictory? Would you like to stimulate it?

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.080
An explosive irony.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.820
I hope you love me the same I love you.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.600
Until the day we believe...
