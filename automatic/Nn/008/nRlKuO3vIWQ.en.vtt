00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that's one bag there it should cover

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.219 
that's one bag there it should cover
about<00:01:15.030> 30<00:01:15.299> square<00:01:15.600> feet<00:01:16.189> this<00:01:17.189> area<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.090> is

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
about 30 square feet this area here is

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.240 
about 30 square feet this area here is
about<00:01:21.229> 20<00:01:22.229> square<00:01:22.500> feet<00:01:22.530> I'm<00:01:22.950> gonna<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.189> ahead

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
about 20 square feet I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
about 20 square feet I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:23.400> use<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> whole<00:01:23.759> bag<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> have

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and use the whole bag and then I have

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
and use the whole bag and then I have
this<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.770> too<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:27.090> another<00:01:27.360> soil

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
this here too it's another soil

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
this here too it's another soil
conditioner<00:01:28.110> called<00:01:29.040> clay<00:01:29.520> breaker<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
conditioner called clay breaker so I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.880 
conditioner called clay breaker so I
think<00:01:30.750> I'll<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.290> loosened<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.680> pretty

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
think I'll get this loosened up pretty

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.249 
think I'll get this loosened up pretty
well<00:01:32.360> let's<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.450> ahead<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.689> take<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> look<00:01:34.049> at

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
well let's go ahead and take a look at

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.950 
well let's go ahead and take a look at
the<00:01:34.439> soil<00:01:34.650> itself<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> looks

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the soil itself and see what it looks

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
the soil itself and see what it looks
like<00:01:37.049> down<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> there<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> middle<00:01:38.759> you

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
like down in there now in the middle you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.429 
like down in there now in the middle you
may<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.659> looks<00:01:39.900> pretty<00:01:40.020> healthy

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
may think well that looks pretty healthy

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.289 
may think well that looks pretty healthy
but<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> soil<00:01:42.060> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
but that was a little bit the soil that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.899 
but that was a little bit the soil that
was<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> raised<00:01:43.290> bed<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.950> dumped<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.759> back

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
was in the raised bed I dumped it back

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.139 
was in the raised bed I dumped it back
over<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.659> left<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.970> had

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
over here I left it here so and this had

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.819

weed<00:01:48.360> block<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.320> about<00:01:49.530> two<00:01:49.799> years

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
