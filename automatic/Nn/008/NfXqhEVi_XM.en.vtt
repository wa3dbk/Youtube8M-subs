00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.460
 hello I've thought about it since numerous 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.580
 we requested various products 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.490
 single to region so imagine that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.119
 I'll make such a series now 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.650
 I try very briefly and precisely you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.439
 to introduce a product and mine 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.019
 to give reason to reason 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.650
 I start today with the petru like that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.669
 perfect sixty wars day concealer in the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.420
 color cool a chili beige 0 10 is it 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.239
 For me it looks like he promises 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 perfect coverage, no discoloration 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 Wisch and waterproof are ten 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.739
 millimeter the price is two euros 65 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.969
 that means you can actually do it 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.309
 at least try it and if he does 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.620
 it is very very bad then it falls to him 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.160
 not so hard to throw away or away 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.290
 to give 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.650
 He promises a slight acne cream too 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.689
 be for long-lasting opacity 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.840
 Lighter fit and more reliable 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.590
 stop for up to 16 hours no rub off 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 soft focus pigments hide skin 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.400
 irregularities and eye shadow for 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.890
 an even complexion with nurturing 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.530
 caviar and skin soothe lotus flowers 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.720
 extract skin compatibility dermatology 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.040
 confirmed on the internet I found then still 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:40.770
 that he should have a cooling effect 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:43.890
 what else he should prevent irritation and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.939
 perfect for caring for the delicate skin in the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 Eye area are then then also 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.420
 concealer himself he comes here with one 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.310
 type sponge applicator you can see it too 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.759
 Two arrows on and one turns it 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.560
 So push the product out and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.960
 then it comes out here the sponge 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 He is actually using it for application 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.900
 one such floats applicators so 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.920
 thought that the product is expressed 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.720
 and directly on the wears that works for me 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.930
 opinion not so good because then too much 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.580
 product on the august under the eye 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.550
 It just lies and I have it now 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.260
 really very often tested and with 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.410
 the finger on the ring finger would have the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.650
 least applied pressure and it is 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.840
 nothing has become mine 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.819
 Eyeshadow he has not covered 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.290
 crumbly he has become mine 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.569
 folded off 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.640
 The color is not with my skin 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.319
 it was completely fused 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.670
 dreadful 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.670
 I put them away for a while 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.170
 but then I discovered it like that 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.480
 youtube videos where the concealer order 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.830
 was shown with a brush and that 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.910
 not with a concealer brush but 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.410
 with such a blind brush 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.380
 I I believe I think so 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.120
 once said 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.410
 With that she has a new world 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.489
 just opens up so great 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.470
 I am sorry that I am now the 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.560
 show again is from ebay line is 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.000
 taken from the assortment house I am 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.340
 desperately looking for one 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.519
 alternative also cheaper 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.910
 area is otherwise I have to 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:39.760
 just surrendered and a mac 224 he or 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.650
 217 he buy a zip ten years 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.500
 but very expensive but also very 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.329
 versatile other topic such a blind 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.220
 brushes are available from many companies 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.040
 many have already tried one 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.299
 it's just what I do is me 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.420
 give the concealer to my hand 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.930
 Press because my hand is warm 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.639
 the concealer melts easier 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.190
 a bit warmed up becomes more fluid 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:08.319
 and thus wear the concealer to the brush 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.870
 on the lower eye area so under 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.090
 open your eyes and blind you so and so 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.989
 so that's it's really just fine 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.970
 So I'm really excited about the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.810
 two together 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:26.490
 That's why I would recommend you 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:28.440
 because not alone concealer with countries 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.560
 brush no matter which one is now 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.880
 you prefer the one you have there super 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.260
 So really right I would 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.720
 Do not recommend the concealer to you now 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.460
 to buy and then an expensive one 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.710
 dazzling brush because you 're going to try that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.730
 wanted there are other concealer's 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.890
 do not need that 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.330
 if you but as I said a home 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.120
 or have one anyway 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.650
 I would recommend you that 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.480
 Let's try it does not cost 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.480
 three euros and that's it as I said 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.190
 since then I have the technique somehow 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.690
 found out for myself 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.400
 I also use it regularly and am 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.570
 I'm not very happy with that 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.010
 he now cares especially the eyes or 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:17.600
 I prevent that from irritation 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.550
 actually not necessary but have 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.000
 discover my pretty strong 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:28.470
 eye shadow alright ok i hope it has 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.050
 I like you as always 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.220
 write back please write me 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.600
 also how he finds that with one 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.160
 evaluates shorter review and subscribes to that 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.800
 I would be very happy and see you then 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.800
 Let's go to the next video ts
