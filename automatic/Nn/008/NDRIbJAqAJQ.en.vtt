 Do you know what I hate about Americans? 

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:28.486
 Everything. 

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:31.823
 Especially cowboys. 

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:34.783
 Are you an American? 

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.871
 Yes, yes. New York. 

00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:40.165
 Are you a cop? 

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.040
 Yes, yes. 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.668
 Soon it will sound loud. 

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:45.628
 Where did you know I'm a cop? 

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:47.005
 You don't look like a lawyer. 

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:55.221
 Jack! 

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.180
 Father? 

00:00:57.306 --> 00:00:58.475

00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:02.228
 007 from Plainfield, New Jersey. 

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:03.980
 Peace, you're out of danger. 

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.523
 Get down! 

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:11.153
 Seriously out of danger right now. 

00:01:11.528 --> 00:01:13.490
 This type does not mean anything good. 

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:14.948
 Terrorism. 

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:17.326
 Uranium for Weapons of Mass Destruction. 

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.370
 Nuclear heads. 

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.080
 Someone has to stop him. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.956
 Good boy. 

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.126
 No! - Cop. 

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.550
 What is this? Some pirate gun or? 

00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:34.176
 It's an old school ... 

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.053
 Like you. - Just. 

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:43.101
 You've probably done it before. 

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.313
 Don't incite her to the fireplace. 

00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:47.898
 Me and my boyfriend ... 

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.318
 we'll give you one hard chain. 

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:51.651
 Really? 

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:53.946
 Really. 

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.701
 Are you confused? 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.620
 Tibakene. 

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:17.803
 VISA HING: GOOD DAY, SURRA 

00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:20.265
 Looking for junk or will you find them yourself? 

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.433
 I ask myself the same thing.
