first<00:00:52.640> same<00:00:53.640> track<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> HTC<00:00:54.690> One<00:00:54.930> m8

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.719 

as<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:23.020> can<00:01:23.140> see<00:01:23.350> from<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.979> initial<00:01:24.280> test<00:01:24.490> I

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
as you can see from the initial test I

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.240 
as you can see from the initial test I
think<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.390> Sun<00:01:25.630> on<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.900> m8<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.800> lot<00:01:27.070> better

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
think the Sun on the m8 is a lot better

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.580 
think the Sun on the m8 is a lot better
than<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.640> Moto<00:01:27.820> G<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.780> Moto<00:01:28.960> G<00:01:29.140> has<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.350> bit

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
than the Moto G the Moto G has a bit

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.710 
than the Moto G the Moto G has a bit
more<00:01:29.830> a<00:01:30.040> 10-year<00:01:30.520> sound<00:01:30.790> as<00:01:31.000> compared<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.509> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
more a 10-year sound as compared to the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.660 
more a 10-year sound as compared to the
m8<00:01:31.990> which<00:01:32.200> has<00:01:32.320> got<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.560> bit<00:01:32.740> more<00:01:32.950> heavier

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
m8 which has got a bit more heavier

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.920 
m8 which has got a bit more heavier
sound<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.119> obviously<00:01:34.210> because<00:01:34.660> it's<00:01:34.810> got

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
sound to it obviously because it's got

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.810 
sound to it obviously because it's got
the<00:01:35.080> metal<00:01:35.320> casing<00:01:35.650> plus<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.340> speakers<00:01:36.670> have

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
the metal casing plus the speakers have

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.880 
the metal casing plus the speakers have
a<00:01:36.850> built-in<00:01:37.180> amplifiers<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.990> overall<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
a built-in amplifiers and overall the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.800 
a built-in amplifiers and overall the
sound<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.280> much<00:01:39.490> much<00:01:39.700> better<00:01:39.880> less<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.750> a

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
sound is much much better less to this a

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.810 
sound is much much better less to this a
few<00:01:41.050> more<00:01:41.170> times<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:42.280> won't<00:01:42.460> be<00:01:42.640> saying

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
few more times and I won't be saying

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.040 
few more times and I won't be saying
anything<00:01:43.090> in<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.420> videos<00:01:43.600> without<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.930> can

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
anything in the videos without you can

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.990 
anything in the videos without you can
go<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.410> have<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> quick<00:01:44.770> look<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.100> see<00:01:45.250> what

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
go and have a quick look and see what

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.190 
go and have a quick look and see what
the<00:01:46.119> differences<00:01:46.479> are<00:01:46.600> between<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.930> two

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
the differences are between the two

00:01:47.200 --> 00:02:49.780 
the differences are between the two
phones<00:01:47.470> as<00:01:47.860> far<00:01:48.160> as<00:01:48.250> sound<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.580> concerned

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.820 

as<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.060> see<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.480> me<00:02:51.600> HTC<00:02:52.440> One<00:02:52.590> m8

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
as you can see to me HTC One m8

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.590 
as you can see to me HTC One m8
obviously<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.550> clear<00:02:53.730> winner<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.180> then

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
obviously is the clear winner but then

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600 
obviously is the clear winner but then
considering<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> Moto<00:02:55.290> G<00:02:55.560> which<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.250> one

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
considering the Moto G which is one

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.250 
considering the Moto G which is one
third<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.030> price<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.480> m8<00:02:57.780> i<00:02:57.930> think

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
third of the price of the m8 i think

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.140 
third of the price of the m8 i think
motorola<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.100> done<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.520> good<00:02:59.760> job<00:02:59.820> of

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
motorola have done a really good job of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.550 
motorola have done a really good job of
putting<00:03:00.330> speakers<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:00.960> least<00:03:01.110> at<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> front

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
putting speakers at least at the front

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.050 
putting speakers at least at the front
and<00:03:02.070> there's<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.370> many<00:03:02.460> other<00:03:02.610> windows<00:03:02.940> which

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
and there's so many other windows which

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.430 
and there's so many other windows which
are<00:03:03.180> still<00:03:03.300> trying<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.110> i<00:03:04.170> think

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
are still trying to do that and i think

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.380 
are still trying to do that and i think
we<00:03:05.040> should<00:03:05.190> give<00:03:05.370> kudos<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.640> motorola<00:03:06.060> for

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
we should give kudos to motorola for

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.120 
we should give kudos to motorola for
doing<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.960> very<00:03:07.170> good<00:03:07.230> job<00:03:07.380> with<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.770> speakers

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
