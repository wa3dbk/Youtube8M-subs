tips and tricks for working with fleece
or<00:00:07.020> polar<00:00:07.259> fleece<00:00:07.589> it's<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.250> really<00:00:08.639> nice

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
or polar fleece it's a really nice

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.910 
or polar fleece it's a really nice
fabric<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.480> making<00:00:09.750> softies<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.380> but

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
fabric for making softies with but

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.900 
fabric for making softies with but
there's<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.190> couple<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.550> things<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.880> might

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
there's a couple of things you might

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.160 
there's a couple of things you might
want<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> know<00:00:12.420> about<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.929> that's<00:00:12.990> what

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
want to know about it and that's what

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.849 
want to know about it and that's what
I'm<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.440> show<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.650> today<00:00:15.619> the<00:00:16.619> first

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I'm going to show you today the first

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
I'm going to show you today the first
thing<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.130> need<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> know<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.880> polar

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
thing you need to know is that polar

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.529 
thing you need to know is that polar
fleece<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.050> stretchy<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:21.060> need<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.359> take

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
fleece is stretchy and you need to take

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.730 
fleece is stretchy and you need to take
that<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:21.720> account<00:00:21.930> because<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.590> not

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that into account because it's not

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.370 
that into account because it's not
stretchy<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.369> same<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:23.939> directions<00:00:24.380> this

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
stretchy the same in all directions this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.800 
stretchy the same in all directions this
is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.740> factory<00:00:26.160> edge<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.660> tell

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
is the factory edge and you can tell

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
is the factory edge and you can tell
it's<00:00:27.960> called<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> selvage<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.849> can

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it's called the selvage and you can

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.970 
it's called the selvage and you can
always<00:00:30.300> see<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:30.900> easily<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
always see it very easily this is the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.720 
always see it very easily this is the
cut<00:00:32.189> edge

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
cut edge

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.209 
cut edge
there's<00:00:32.940> no<00:00:33.210> curl<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:35.059> you<00:00:36.059> pull<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
there's no curl to it if you pull this

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.280 
there's no curl to it if you pull this
perpendicular<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.030> selvage<00:00:39.750> there<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
perpendicular to that selvage there is a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.220 
perpendicular to that selvage there is a
lot<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> stretch<00:00:41.129> there<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.960> pull<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
lot of stretch there if you pull it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
lot of stretch there if you pull it
parallel<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> selvage<00:00:44.700> there's<00:00:45.059> almost

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
parallel to the selvage there's almost

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.470 
parallel to the selvage there's almost
no<00:00:45.660> stretch<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> some<00:00:47.700> patterns<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.450> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
no stretch so some patterns will have a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
no stretch so some patterns will have a
grain<00:00:48.809> line<00:00:49.110> marked<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.920> I've<00:00:50.100> talked

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
grain line marked on them I've talked

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.040 
grain line marked on them I've talked
about<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.149> another<00:00:51.360> video<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.960> I'll

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
about that in another video and I'll

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.529 
about that in another video and I'll
link<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> pop-up<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.820> but

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
link to that in a pop-up in this one but

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
link to that in a pop-up in this one but
if<00:00:55.289> there's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.710> grain<00:00:56.039> line<00:00:56.280> marked<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.730> there

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
if there's a grain line marked on there

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.869 
if there's a grain line marked on there
you<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.390> run<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.160> parallel<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you want to run that parallel to the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
you want to run that parallel to the
selvage<00:01:00.329> edge<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.899> show<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.410> that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
selvage edge and I show you in that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
selvage edge and I show you in that
other<00:01:01.649> video<00:01:01.980> how<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.660> that'll

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
other video how to do that that'll

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320 
other video how to do that that'll
change<00:01:04.250> how<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.309> stretch<00:01:05.729> works<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.210> your

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
change how the stretch works in your

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.420 
change how the stretch works in your
pattern<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.740> pattern<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.250> has

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
pattern and if it's a pattern that has

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
pattern and if it's a pattern that has
very<00:01:08.790> precise<00:01:09.299> shapes<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:09.960> somebody's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
very precise shapes like if somebody's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
very precise shapes like if somebody's
doing<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.619> realistically<00:01:11.280> shaped<00:01:11.640> dog<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.299> bear

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
doing a realistically shaped dog or bear

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.940 
doing a realistically shaped dog or bear
and<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:12.930> want<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> head<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> very

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and they want the head to be a very

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.630 
and they want the head to be a very
specific<00:01:14.400> shape

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
specific shape

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
specific shape
they'll<00:01:15.330> designer<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.259> take<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:16.950> account

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
they'll designer will take into account

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.840 
they'll designer will take into account
the<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.930> fabric<00:01:19.140> stretches<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> they'll

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the way the fabric stretches and they'll

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
the way the fabric stretches and they'll
put<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> line<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> pattern<00:01:22.049> piece<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
put a line on the pattern piece that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
put a line on the pattern piece that
tells<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.159> way<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.820> need<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.509> lay<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
tells you which way you need to lay the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
tells you which way you need to lay the
pattern<00:01:25.259> piece<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> stretch<00:01:26.159> works

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
pattern piece so that the stretch works

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.780 
pattern piece so that the stretch works
right<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> shape<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.979> softie<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
right with the shape of the softie that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
right with the shape of the softie that
you're<00:01:29.909> making<00:01:30.090> most<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.170> patterns<00:01:31.560> are

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you're making most of my patterns are

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
you're making most of my patterns are
kind<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.860> blobby<00:01:32.100> shapes<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> doesn't

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
kind of blobby shapes and so it doesn't

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
kind of blobby shapes and so it doesn't
really<00:01:33.780> matter<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.439> don't<00:01:34.680> put<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.890> grain

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
really matter so I don't put a grain

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.999 
really matter so I don't put a grain
line<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:36.200> besides<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.470> stretch<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
line on there besides the stretch and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.620 
line on there besides the stretch and
worrying<00:01:38.310> about<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.640> grain<00:01:38.850> line<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.479> other

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
worrying about the grain line the other

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.999 
worrying about the grain line the other
thing<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.110> need<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> worry<00:01:40.560> about<00:01:40.740> with

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
thing that you need to worry about with

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.609 
thing that you need to worry about with
fleece<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:41.909> fluffy<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> I've

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
fleece is that it's very fluffy so I've

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.139 
fleece is that it's very fluffy so I've
talked<00:01:43.890> before<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.520> another<00:01:44.759> video<00:01:44.939> about

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
talked before I have another video about

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
talked before I have another video about
napped<00:01:45.689> fabrics<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.350> corduroys<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
napped fabrics like corduroys and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.539 
napped fabrics like corduroys and
Velvets<00:01:47.520> where<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> fluff<00:01:48.360> tends<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.619> affect

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
Velvets where the fluff tends to affect

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
Velvets where the fluff tends to affect
the<00:01:50.729> way<00:01:50.850> when<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.270> sew<00:01:51.479> together<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.170> shifts

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the way when they sew together it shifts

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.859 
the way when they sew together it shifts
sideways<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> end<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.570> piece

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
sideways and you end up with one piece

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990 
sideways and you end up with one piece
usually<00:01:55.680> quite<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.340> longer<00:01:56.520> than<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
usually quite a bit longer than the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.429 
usually quite a bit longer than the
other

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
other

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.760 
other
the<00:01:58.439> problem<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.009> fleece<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.770> long

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the problem with fleece is not a long

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.010 
the problem with fleece is not a long
way<00:02:02.070> shift<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> sideways<00:02:03.360> shift<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
way shift but a sideways shift and you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.330 
way shift but a sideways shift and you
can<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> look<00:02:04.740> at<00:02:05.009> where<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
can see it if you look at where one of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.749 
can see it if you look at where one of
these<00:02:05.490> pins<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> edge<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.340> bottom

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
these pins is the edge of the bottom

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.110 
these pins is the edge of the bottom
piece<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.450> fabric<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:10.050> right<00:02:10.319> here<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:12.000> edge

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
piece of fabric is right here the edge

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
piece of fabric is right here the edge
of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> top<00:02:12.690> piece<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.170> fabric

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
of the top piece of fabric

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
of the top piece of fabric
is<00:02:13.830> right<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.730> that's<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.030> good

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
is right here and that's a good

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.730 
is right here and that's a good
sixteenth<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.930> an<00:02:16.050> inch<00:02:16.140> difference<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
sixteenth of an inch difference so the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.470 
sixteenth of an inch difference so the
alt<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.190> happens<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.850> because<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
alt that happens just because of the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.270 
alt that happens just because of the
distortion<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.140> putting<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> pin<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.160> it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
distortion of putting the pin in but it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.770 
distortion of putting the pin in but it
also<00:02:23.400> happens<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.180> distortion<00:02:24.690> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
also happens with the distortion of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.900 
also happens with the distortion of
putting<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.140> under<00:02:25.320> your<00:02:25.440> presser<00:02:25.800> foot<00:02:25.910> one

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
putting it under your presser foot one

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.840 
putting it under your presser foot one
way<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.120> fix<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.810> lots<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.800> pins<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.820> can

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
way to fix that is lots of pins you can

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.240 
way to fix that is lots of pins you can
see<00:02:30.210> here<00:02:30.540> where<00:02:30.720> I've<00:02:30.810> pinned<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.320> lot<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.980> pins

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
see here where I've pinned a lot of pins

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.040 
see here where I've pinned a lot of pins
in<00:02:32.490> there<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.910> tends<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.780> even

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
in there it tends to just even

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.190 
in there it tends to just even
everything<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.660> edges<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.170> your

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
everything out and so the edges of your

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.830 
everything out and so the edges of your
fabric<00:02:37.740> end<00:02:37.950> up<00:02:38.160> kind<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.850> lined<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.300> again<00:02:39.600> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
fabric end up kind of lined up again and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.360 
fabric end up kind of lined up again and
these<00:02:39.960> pins<00:02:40.260> are<00:02:40.440> about<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> quarter<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.250> an

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
these pins are about a quarter of an

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.370 
these pins are about a quarter of an
inch<00:02:41.460> apart<00:02:41.640> sometimes<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.810> little<00:02:42.930> bit<00:02:43.080> more

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
inch apart sometimes a little bit more

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.960 
inch apart sometimes a little bit more
but<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.590> would<00:02:43.680> probably<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:44.250> even<00:02:44.430> better<00:02:44.700> if

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
but it would probably be even better if

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.440 
but it would probably be even better if
it<00:02:45.090> was<00:02:45.210> even<00:02:45.570> less<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.280> will<00:02:47.730> often<00:02:48.150> fix

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
it was even less so that will often fix

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.250 
it was even less so that will often fix
any<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.110> sideways<00:02:49.590> shift<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.840> problem

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
any of that sideways shift the problem

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.630 
any of that sideways shift the problem
with<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.560> if<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.770> don't<00:02:53.010> put<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> lot<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.490> pins

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
with it if you don't put a lot of pins

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.300 
with it if you don't put a lot of pins
in<00:02:53.820> there<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.480> when<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.800> end<00:02:55.980> up<00:02:56.130> with

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
in there is when you so you end up with

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
in there is when you so you end up with
exactly<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> right<00:02:56.970> seam<00:02:57.330> allowance<00:02:57.780> on<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
exactly the right seam allowance on the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.320 
exactly the right seam allowance on the
top<00:02:58.320> where<00:02:59.010> you've<00:02:59.250> where<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.940> been<00:03:00.090> going

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
top where you've where it's been going

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.210 
top where you've where it's been going
under<00:03:00.510> your<00:03:00.630> presser<00:03:00.810> foot<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.800> bottom

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
under your presser foot but the bottom

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.130 
under your presser foot but the bottom
will<00:03:02.340> tend<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.760> shift<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.720> your<00:03:03.900> seam

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
will tend to shift in so your seam

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.980 
will tend to shift in so your seam
allowance<00:03:04.500> will<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.680> less<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.670> bottom<00:03:06.030> so

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
allowance will be less on the bottom so

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.510 
allowance will be less on the bottom so
lots<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.410> pins<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:07.800> help<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
lots of pins will help that but it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.390 
lots of pins will help that but it
doesn't<00:03:08.760> always<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> trick<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:11.220> that's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
doesn't always do the trick and that's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.060 
doesn't always do the trick and that's
what<00:03:11.550> I'm<00:03:11.640> going<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.820> show<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.030> here<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.560> this

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
what I'm going to show you here so this

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.740 
what I'm going to show you here so this
is<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.550> nice<00:03:14.790> fat<00:03:15.060> cat<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.600> it's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
is going to be a nice fat cat and it's

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.740 
is going to be a nice fat cat and it's
got<00:03:15.930> pausing<00:03:16.830> here<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.370> ears<00:03:17.820> up<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.240> here<00:03:18.600> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
got pausing here and ears up in here and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.930 
got pausing here and ears up in here and
it's<00:03:19.350> where<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.650> put<00:03:19.860> those<00:03:19.980> extra<00:03:20.250> things<00:03:20.640> in

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
it's where we put those extra things in

other Paula ended up not too bad so I

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.059 
other Paula ended up not too bad so I
have<00:05:00.180> two<00:05:00.449> weak<00:05:00.720> spots<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.620> want<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.860> fix

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
have two weak spots that I want to fix

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.339 
have two weak spots that I want to fix
we're<00:05:03.030> going<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.210> do<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.539> by<00:05:03.780> going<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:04.259> the

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
we're going to do that by going to the

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.370 
we're going to do that by going to the
sewing<00:05:04.650> machine<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.190> turn<00:05:05.610> this<00:05:05.729> around<00:05:05.909> so

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
sewing machine and turn this around so

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.629 
sewing machine and turn this around so
this<00:05:07.380> would<00:05:07.560> be<00:05:07.680> feeding<00:05:08.069> through<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.370> sewing

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
this would be feeding through the sewing

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.439 
this would be feeding through the sewing
machine<00:05:08.940> here<00:05:09.979> instead<00:05:10.979> of<00:05:11.220> following<00:05:12.060> this

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
machine here instead of following this

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.089 
machine here instead of following this
edge<00:05:12.720> for<00:05:13.050> my<00:05:13.139> quarter<00:05:13.500> of<00:05:13.620> an<00:05:13.710> inch<00:05:13.800> seam

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
edge for my quarter of an inch seam

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.730 
edge for my quarter of an inch seam
allowance<00:05:14.509> I'm<00:05:15.509> going<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.900> follow<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
allowance I'm going to follow the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.480 
allowance I'm going to follow the
shortest<00:05:17.400> fabric<00:05:18.240> edge<00:05:18.509> that<00:05:19.349> I<00:05:19.380> have<00:05:19.800> it's

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
shortest fabric edge that I have it's

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.249 
shortest fabric edge that I have it's
going<00:05:20.759> to<00:05:20.849> distort<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.389> side<00:05:21.599> seams<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:22.020> little

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
going to distort the side seams a little

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.260 
going to distort the side seams a little
bit<00:05:22.409> so<00:05:22.650> like<00:05:22.979> I<00:05:23.130> said<00:05:23.190> this<00:05:23.520> is<00:05:23.669> definitely<00:05:24.060> a

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
bit so like I said this is definitely a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.360 
bit so like I said this is definitely a
cheater<00:05:24.690> way<00:05:25.229> to<00:05:25.289> fix<00:05:25.620> things<00:05:25.860> this<00:05:26.159> is<00:05:26.340> not

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
cheater way to fix things this is not

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.790 
cheater way to fix things this is not
going<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.389> be<00:05:27.479> recommended<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.139> any<00:05:28.379> home<00:05:28.620> at

going to be recommended in any home at

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.610 
going to be recommended in any home at
class<00:05:29.069> but<00:05:29.669> this<00:05:29.789> is<00:05:30.000> a<00:05:30.030> big<00:05:30.389> big<00:05:30.659> fat<00:05:31.020> puffy

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.430 
cat knot with a very precise shape to
him<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:35.280> if<00:05:35.490> we<00:05:35.699> lose<00:05:35.969> an<00:05:36.240> extra<00:05:36.419> quarter<00:05:37.199> of<00:05:37.319> an

the<00:05:39.180> paw<00:05:39.419> is<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:40.349> not<00:05:40.530> going<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.800> distort<00:05:41.130> the

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
the paw is it's not going to distort the

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.879 
the paw is it's not going to distort the
look<00:05:41.580> of<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.880> finished<00:05:42.240> softy<00:05:42.960> at<00:05:43.050> all<00:05:43.199> so

look of the finished softy at all so

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:44.659 
look of the finished softy at all so
we're<00:05:43.979> going<00:05:44.069> to<00:05:44.130> take<00:05:44.250> it<00:05:44.370> over<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.580> the

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
we're going to take it over to the

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.279 
we're going to take it over to the
sewing<00:05:44.880> machine<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.419> do<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.870> little<00:05:46.110> bit<00:05:46.259> of

sewing machine and do a little bit of
extra<00:05:46.560> stitching<00:05:46.979> there<00:05:47.219> and<00:05:47.460> on<00:05:47.880> this<00:05:48.060> ear<00:05:49.250> so

extra stitching there and on this ear so

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.800 
extra stitching there and on this ear so
what<00:05:50.370> I've<00:05:50.490> done<00:05:50.639> is<00:05:50.819> started<00:05:51.240> back<00:05:51.449> here

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
what I've done is started back here

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.990 
what I've done is started back here
where<00:05:51.960> my<00:05:52.139> stitching<00:05:52.560> is<00:05:52.680> good<00:05:52.919> I'm<00:05:53.789> going<00:05:53.940> to

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
where my stitching is good I'm going to

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.320 
where my stitching is good I'm going to
back<00:05:54.210> stitch<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:56.520> now<00:05:56.759> I'm<00:05:56.880> going<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.090> start

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
back stitch and now I'm going to start

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.870 
back stitch and now I'm going to start
sewing<00:05:57.569> forward<00:05:58.080> when<00:05:59.039> I<00:05:59.069> hit<00:05:59.279> that<00:05:59.520> thick

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
sewing forward when I hit that thick

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.089 
sewing forward when I hit that thick
halt<00:06:00.539> I'm<00:06:00.930> going<00:06:01.169> to<00:06:01.229> go<00:06:01.380> really<00:06:01.860> slowly<00:06:02.330> and

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
halt I'm going to go really slowly and

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.029 
halt I'm going to go really slowly and
I'm<00:06:05.099> now<00:06:05.370> holding<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.569> shortest<00:06:07.440> edge<00:06:07.710> of<00:06:07.919> the

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
I'm now holding the shortest edge of the

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.180 
I'm now holding the shortest edge of the
fabric<00:06:08.750> along<00:06:09.750> the<00:06:10.080> edge<00:06:10.199> of<00:06:10.380> my<00:06:10.440> presser<00:06:10.800> foot

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
fabric along the edge of my presser foot

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.769 
fabric along the edge of my presser foot
so<00:06:11.370> that's<00:06:11.580> what<00:06:11.880> I'm<00:06:12.000> working<00:06:12.389> my<00:06:12.539> seam

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
so that's what I'm working my seam

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.950 
so that's what I'm working my seam
allowance<00:06:13.199> from<00:06:13.380> and<00:06:14.180> it'll<00:06:15.180> gradually<00:06:15.419> work

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
allowance from and it'll gradually work

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.689 
allowance from and it'll gradually work
back<00:06:16.229> into<00:06:16.590> where<00:06:16.740> my<00:06:16.860> seam<00:06:17.099> allowance<00:06:17.490> was

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
back into where my seam allowance was

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:22.040 
back into where my seam allowance was
good<00:06:18.440> I'm<00:06:19.440> going<00:06:19.650> to<00:06:19.710> back<00:06:19.860> stitch<00:06:20.190> just<00:06:21.050> just

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
good I'm going to back stitch just just

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.430 
good I'm going to back stitch just just
secure<00:06:22.349> that<00:06:23.029> take<00:06:24.029> it<00:06:24.180> out<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:27.000> now<00:06:27.960> you<00:06:28.110> can

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
secure that take it out and now you can

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.589 
secure that take it out and now you can
see<00:06:28.770> that<00:06:29.759> that<00:06:30.389> edge<00:06:30.690> is<00:06:31.020> safely<00:06:32.300> far<00:06:33.300> away

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
see that that edge is safely far away

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.540 
see that that edge is safely far away
from<00:06:33.990> my<00:06:34.199> stitching<00:06:34.620> line<00:06:34.770> so<00:06:35.039> nothing<00:06:35.430> is

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
from my stitching line so nothing is

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.350 
from my stitching line so nothing is
going<00:06:35.610> to<00:06:35.759> break<00:06:35.940> loose<00:06:36.180> there<00:06:37.940> so<00:06:38.940> that's<00:06:39.120> it

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
going to break loose there so that's it

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.070 
going to break loose there so that's it
a<00:06:39.599> couple<00:06:40.289> of<00:06:40.380> things<00:06:40.500> to<00:06:40.740> remember

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
a couple of things to remember

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.050 
a couple of things to remember
with<00:06:41.169> fleece<00:06:41.439> look<00:06:42.069> at<00:06:42.189> that<00:06:42.340> stretch<00:06:42.759> line

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
with fleece look at that stretch line

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.909 
with fleece look at that stretch line
and<00:06:43.389> make<00:06:43.569> sure<00:06:43.750> that<00:06:43.990> if<00:06:44.169> your<00:06:44.379> pattern<00:06:44.590> has

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
and make sure that if your pattern has

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.679 
and make sure that if your pattern has
grain<00:06:45.189> lines<00:06:45.460> marked<00:06:45.879> on<00:06:46.030> it<00:06:46.210> that<00:06:46.539> you're

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:46.689 
grain lines marked on it that you're

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.450
