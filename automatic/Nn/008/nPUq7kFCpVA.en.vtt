review<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:00.899> transformation<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> very

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
review that transformation is very

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.090 
review that transformation is very
similar<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.120> transformation<00:01:04.100> first

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
similar to this transformation first

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
similar to this transformation first
we'll<00:01:05.339> start<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:05.700> splitting<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
we'll start off by splitting the the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.500 
we'll start off by splitting the the
rear<00:01:07.650> wheels<00:01:08.360> apart<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:10.080> free<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.510> bed

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
rear wheels apart to free up the bed

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.890 
rear wheels apart to free up the bed
here<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.189> just<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> lift<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> get

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
here I just like to lift that up and get

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.580 
here I just like to lift that up and get
out<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> way

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
out of the way

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.480 
out of the way
swing<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> rear<00:01:18.299> down<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.259> fold<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
swing the rear down and fold out the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.390 
swing the rear down and fold out the
feet<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:22.320> when<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.100> we'll<00:01:23.340> just

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
feet and then when we do that we'll just

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
feet and then when we do that we'll just
stand<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.119> figure<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> figure

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
stand the figure up with the figure

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.810 
stand the figure up with the figure
standing<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.130> we'll<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.670> we'll

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
standing up what we'll do is we'll

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.620 
standing up what we'll do is we'll
actually<00:01:27.030> latch<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:28.530> place<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
actually latch this into place like that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.289 
actually latch this into place like that
then<00:01:30.630> take<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.409> sections<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> fold<00:01:32.970> them

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
then take these sections and fold them

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.069 
then take these sections and fold them
out<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.189> down<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.180> don't<00:01:36.299> lock<00:01:36.750> into

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
out and down now they don't lock into

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
out and down now they don't lock into
place<00:01:37.229> which<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> real<00:01:38.100> shame<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.670> really

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
place which is a real shame I really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.289 
place which is a real shame I really
wish<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.570> lock<00:01:39.810> into<00:01:40.110> place<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:41.299> they

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
wish they would lock into place but they

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.389 
wish they would lock into place but they
don't<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.500> latch<00:01:43.979> onto

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
don't and they don't like latch onto

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
don't and they don't like latch onto
anything<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.119> would<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.329> nice<00:01:45.509> if<00:01:45.780> maybe<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
anything it would be nice if maybe the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.350 
anything it would be nice if maybe the
chest<00:01:46.470> came<00:01:46.710> forward<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
chest came forward a little bit and you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
chest came forward a little bit and you
could<00:01:48.479> latch<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.960> underneath<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.979> over<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
could latch it underneath right over the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.649 
could latch it underneath right over the
wheel<00:01:50.549> wells<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.110> fold<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> arms

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
wheel wells and I just fold out the arms

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.760 
wheel wells and I just fold out the arms
let<00:01:54.659> me<00:01:54.720> take<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.020> whole<00:01:55.290> rear<00:01:55.470> section<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
let me take this whole rear section and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.899 
let me take this whole rear section and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
kind of lift up on the front and flip it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.140 
kind of lift up on the front and flip it
around<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.479> push<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.110> back<00:02:04.140> down

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
around and push it back down

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.020 
around and push it back down
and<00:02:05.770> there's<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.040> head<00:02:07.370> we're<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:07.970> to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and there's the head we're just going to

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.390 
and there's the head we're just going to
have<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:08.360> move<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.080> situate<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.100> such<00:02:10.369> that

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
have to move it and situate it such that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.820 
have to move it and situate it such that
we<00:02:11.360> can<00:02:11.660> then<00:02:12.350> fold<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.220> fold<00:02:13.790> down<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.830> flip

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
we can then fold it fold down and flip

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.220 
we can then fold it fold down and flip
out<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.130> head<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.570> can<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> little

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
out the head and that can be a little

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.800 
out the head and that can be a little
bit<00:02:18.440> challenging<00:02:18.710> sometimes<00:02:19.570> once<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:20.690> get

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
bit challenging sometimes once we get

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.400 
bit challenging sometimes once we get
the<00:02:20.930> head<00:02:21.080> up

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the head up

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.250 
the head up
lock<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.280> back<00:02:22.940> into<00:02:23.420> place<00:02:24.460> there<00:02:25.460> we<00:02:25.580> go<00:02:26.260> as

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
lock the back into place there we go as

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.350 
lock the back into place there we go as
you<00:02:27.350> can<00:02:27.470> see<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.340> head<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.880> demolisher

you can see the the head for demolisher

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.530 
you can see the the head for demolisher
is<00:02:29.650> significantly<00:02:30.650> different<00:02:30.940> now<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.180> Japan

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
of like that name a little better works

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.040 
of like that name a little better works
a<00:02:39.830> little<00:02:39.920> bit<00:02:40.160> better<00:02:40.910> for<00:02:41.270> me<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.690> overall

got a swivel and a ratchet joint here in

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.040 
got a swivel and a ratchet joint here in
the<00:02:51.440> hip<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.640> bending<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.300> 90<00:02:53.840> degree

but<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.910> little<00:02:59.300> bit<00:02:59.480> limited<00:03:00.370> simply

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
but it is a little bit limited simply

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.370 
but it is a little bit limited simply
because<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.850> can't<00:03:02.090> if<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.810> move<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.230> too

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
because you can't if you move it too

arms attack mode there is an attack mode
again<00:03:19.040> we<00:03:19.220> lift<00:03:19.489> up<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.300> middle<00:03:20.660> section

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
again we lift up on the middle section

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.840 
again we lift up on the middle section
and<00:03:21.680> put<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.950> head<00:03:22.130> straight<00:03:22.489> up<00:03:22.550> like<00:03:22.820> that

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
and put the head straight up like that

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.180 
and put the head straight up like that
and<00:03:23.300> then<00:03:23.930> turn<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.530> then<00:03:24.739> push<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.040> back

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
and then turn it and then push it back

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.150 
and then turn it and then push it back
down<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.420> is<00:03:26.630> his<00:03:26.810> official<00:03:26.959> attack<00:03:27.830> mode

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
down so that is his official attack mode

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.370 
down so that is his official attack mode
right<00:03:28.430> there<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:29.650> prefer<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.959> him<00:03:33.230> up

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
right there I prefer to just have him up

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.430 
right there I prefer to just have him up
like<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:34.300> unpack<00:03:35.300> that<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.780> just<00:03:36.080> have<00:03:36.230> it

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
like this unpack that and just have it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.830 
like this unpack that and just have it
lift<00:03:37.160> up<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.970> can<00:03:38.120> just<00:03:38.150> hold<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.570> up<00:03:38.660> with

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
lift up you can just hold it up with

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.670 
lift up you can just hold it up with
your<00:03:38.930> finger<00:03:39.260> or<00:03:39.290> whatnot<00:03:39.770> that<00:03:41.440> works<00:03:42.440> a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
your finger or whatnot that works a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.680 
your finger or whatnot that works a
little<00:03:42.709> bit<00:03:42.980> better<00:03:43.130> for<00:03:43.400> me<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.940> whichever

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
little bit better for me but a whichever

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.100 
little bit better for me but a whichever
way<00:03:45.110> you<00:03:45.170> would<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.800> do<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.070> is<00:03:46.190> fine

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
way you would like to do it is fine

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.900 
way you would like to do it is fine
negatives<00:03:48.110> are<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.769> only<00:03:48.920> real<00:03:49.190> negative<00:03:49.400> is

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
negatives are the only real negative is

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.810 
negatives are the only real negative is
this<00:03:50.690> back<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.290> really<00:03:51.800> heavy<00:03:52.160> compared<00:03:52.730> to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
this back is really heavy compared to

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.490 
this back is really heavy compared to
the<00:03:52.910> rest<00:03:53.090> of<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.300> figure<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:54.110> is<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.230> little

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
the rest of the figure so it is a little

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.229 
the rest of the figure so it is a little
bit<00:03:54.620> top-heavy<00:03:54.800> but<00:03:55.100> thankfully<00:03:55.970> he's<00:03:56.060> got

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
bit top-heavy but thankfully he's got

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.290 
bit top-heavy but thankfully he's got
nice<00:03:56.450> big<00:03:56.660> heels<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.440> mitigate<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.850> the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
nice big heels to mitigate that and the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.699 
nice big heels to mitigate that and the
other<00:03:59.420> thing<00:03:59.690> I<00:03:59.750> don't<00:03:59.810> like<00:03:59.959> is<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.380> can't

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
other thing I don't like is I can't

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.770 
other thing I don't like is I can't
stand<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.430> fact<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.970> decepticons<00:04:02.540> at

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
stand the fact that the decepticons at

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.910 
stand the fact that the decepticons at
some<00:04:03.170> point<00:04:03.440> all<00:04:04.100> got<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:04.820> weird

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
some point all got this weird

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.979 
some point all got this weird
translucent<00:04:06.920> plastic<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:08.120> makes<00:04:08.720> no<00:04:08.959> sense

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
translucent plastic it it makes no sense

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.640 
translucent plastic it it makes no sense
for<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.920> figures<00:04:10.280> um<00:04:11.050> you've<00:04:12.050> got<00:04:12.080> this

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
for the figures um you've got this

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.680 
for the figures um you've got this
translucent<00:04:13.190> plastic<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:14.239> guess<00:04:14.450> it's

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
translucent plastic I guess it's

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.449 
translucent plastic I guess it's
supposed<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.049> represent<00:04:15.200> Energon<00:04:16.040> or<00:04:16.280> the

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
supposed to represent Energon or the

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:16.690 
supposed to represent Energon or the
high

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
high

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.520 
high
promote<00:04:16.970> but<00:04:17.240> it<00:04:17.510> doesn't<00:04:17.870> really<00:04:18.020> make<00:04:18.260> sense

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
promote but it doesn't really make sense

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.150 
promote but it doesn't really make sense
and<00:04:19.490> it's<00:04:19.670> pretty<00:04:20.270> much<00:04:20.510> useless<00:04:21.050> would<00:04:22.040> have

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
and it's pretty much useless would have

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.380 
and it's pretty much useless would have
been<00:04:22.250> better<00:04:22.400> if<00:04:22.580> they<00:04:22.700> just<00:04:22.910> got<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:23.210> painted

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
been better if they just got it painted

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.190 
been better if they just got it painted
matte<00:04:24.310> green<00:04:25.310> but<00:04:26.180> yeah<00:04:26.750> what<00:04:27.020> are<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.110> gonna

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
matte green but yeah what are you gonna

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.310 
matte green but yeah what are you gonna
do<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:28.130> overall<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.760> figure<00:04:29.120> is<00:04:29.300> pretty<00:04:30.110> much

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
do so overall this figure is pretty much

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.010 
do so overall this figure is pretty much
pretty<00:04:30.650> good<00:04:31.390> transforming<00:04:32.390> him<00:04:32.480> back<00:04:32.690> is

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
pretty good transforming him back is

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.550 
pretty good transforming him back is
exactly<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.880> same<00:04:35.120> process<00:04:35.390> as<00:04:35.810> transforming

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
exactly the same process as transforming

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.340 
exactly the same process as transforming
him<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.890> just<00:04:37.760> a<00:04:38.950> disconnect<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.190> bottom<00:04:40.880> part

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
him to just a disconnect the bottom part

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.860 
him to just a disconnect the bottom part
fold<00:04:42.350> down<00:04:42.880> lift<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.270> part<00:04:44.860> fold<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.130> back

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
fold down lift up that part fold it back

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.030 
fold down lift up that part fold it back
flip<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.990> back<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.530> push<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.250> back<00:04:49.280> down<00:04:49.450> and

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
flip it back and push it back down and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.690 
flip it back and push it back down and
then<00:04:52.040> reattach<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:53.650> legs<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.070> bottom<00:04:55.520> of

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
then reattach the legs to the bottom of

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.170 
then reattach the legs to the bottom of
the<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.640> bed<00:04:58.820> here<00:04:59.380> take<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.500> arms<00:05:01.180> and

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
the of the bed here take the arms and

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.080 
the of the bed here take the arms and
just<00:05:02.450> kind<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.840> fold<00:05:03.140> them<00:05:03.350> up<00:05:03.880> back<00:05:04.880> into

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
just kind of fold them up back into

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.420 
just kind of fold them up back into
place<00:05:07.840> does<00:05:08.840> I<00:05:08.960> said<00:05:09.140> overall<00:05:09.590> he's<00:05:09.980> pretty

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
place does I said overall he's pretty

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.000 
place does I said overall he's pretty
good<00:05:10.610> figure<00:05:10.970> simple<00:05:11.900> very<00:05:12.650> easy<00:05:12.770> to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
good figure simple very easy to

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.670 
good figure simple very easy to
transform<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.700> great<00:05:14.240> figure<00:05:14.660> for<00:05:15.050> kids<00:05:15.260> I<00:05:15.500> have

really a great figure for kids I really
can't<00:05:18.980> stress<00:05:19.670> that<00:05:19.790> enough<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.390> how<00:05:20.540> good<00:05:21.170> of

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
can't stress that enough and how good of

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.370 
can't stress that enough and how good of
a<00:05:21.410> figure<00:05:21.680> this<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:22.040> for<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.370> little<00:05:22.730> guys<00:05:22.970> so<00:05:23.900> if

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
a figure this is for a little guys so if

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.740 
a figure this is for a little guys so if
you<00:05:24.620> can<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.920> would<00:05:25.010> pick<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.340> guy<00:05:25.550> up<00:05:25.600> but<00:05:26.600> you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
might want to look at other Energon

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.000 
might want to look at other Energon
figures<00:05:28.340> as<00:05:28.580> this<00:05:28.910> one<00:05:29.120> is<00:05:29.300> as<00:05:29.480> I<00:05:29.960> said<00:05:30.200> pretty
