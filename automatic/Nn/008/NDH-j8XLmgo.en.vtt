remember<00:03:09.360> correctly<00:03:09.630> but<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.050> buttons<00:03:10.350> were

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
remember correctly but the buttons were

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.400 
remember correctly but the buttons were
like<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> foam<00:03:12.090> rubber<00:03:12.330> these<00:03:12.930> buttons<00:03:13.320> were

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
like a foam rubber these buttons were

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.490 
like a foam rubber these buttons were
like<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> foam<00:03:13.860> rubber<00:03:14.070> ones<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:16.050> heat<00:03:16.290> pad

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
like a foam rubber ones the heat pad

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.699 
like a foam rubber ones the heat pad
feels<00:03:16.739> pretty<00:03:16.980> good<00:03:17.250> um<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.230> little<00:03:19.230> loose

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
feels pretty good um a little loose

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.440 
feels pretty good um a little loose
compared<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> other<00:03:20.610> ones<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.239> know<00:03:21.330> if

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
compared to the other ones I know if

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.090 
compared to the other ones I know if
it's<00:03:21.570> just<00:03:21.660> my<00:03:21.810> imagination<00:03:21.959> or<00:03:22.470> whatnot

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
it's just my imagination or whatnot

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.449 
it's just my imagination or whatnot
yeah<00:03:24.620> unfortunately<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> don't<00:03:25.800> have<00:03:26.070> an<00:03:26.190> NES

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
yeah unfortunately I don't have an NES

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.180 
yeah unfortunately I don't have an NES

controller right now all my game stuff

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.060 
controller right now all my game stuff
is<00:03:29.310> packed<00:03:29.550> away<00:03:29.670> I'm<00:03:30.090> moving<00:03:30.570> so<00:03:31.020> I'm<00:03:31.890> not

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
is packed away I'm moving so I'm not

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.860 
is packed away I'm moving so I'm not
gonna<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.430> run<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.880> hunt<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.570> do

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
gonna go run to in a hunt for it and do

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.080 
gonna go run to in a hunt for it and do
a<00:03:33.900> comparison<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:35.040> well<00:03:35.610> maybe<00:03:35.760> I'll<00:03:35.940> do<00:03:36.060> a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
a comparison on it well maybe I'll do a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.449 
a comparison on it well maybe I'll do a
comparison<00:03:36.540> at<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.560> later<00:03:37.770> point<00:03:38.010> after<00:03:38.220> I'm

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
comparison at a later point after I'm

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.810 
comparison at a later point after I'm
done<00:03:38.580> with<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.760> move<00:03:39.000> here<00:03:40.880> buttons<00:03:43.820> it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
done with the move here buttons it

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.040 
done with the move here buttons it
doesn't<00:03:45.120> seem<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.390> feel<00:03:45.600> like<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.780> has<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
doesn't seem to feel like it has the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.170 
doesn't seem to feel like it has the
same<00:03:46.260> build<00:03:46.590> quality<00:03:46.890> everyone<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:47.880> know<00:03:48.030> if

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
same build quality everyone I know if

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.180 
same build quality everyone I know if
it's<00:03:48.300> just<00:03:48.390> me<00:03:48.630> or<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:49.020> but<00:03:49.050> I'm<00:03:49.830> gonna<00:03:50.010> do<00:03:50.160> a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
it's just me or what but I'm gonna do a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.830 
it's just me or what but I'm gonna do a
comparison<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.180> at<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.360> later<00:03:51.570> point

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
comparison on this at a later point

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.600 
comparison on this at a later point
there<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.380> see<00:03:52.620> if<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.800> can<00:03:53.010> figure<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.370> out

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
there and see if I can figure this out

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.100 
there and see if I can figure this out
here<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.090> yep

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
here but yep

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.250 
here but yep
and<00:03:56.660> yeah<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.020> plug<00:03:58.320> is<00:03:58.650> definitely<00:03:59.220> smaller

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
and yeah the plug is definitely smaller

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.360 
and yeah the plug is definitely smaller
not<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> doubt<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:01.770> definitely<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.190> much

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
not a doubt it's definitely a much

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.720 
not a doubt it's definitely a much
thinner<00:04:02.640> cable<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:03.799> let's<00:04:04.799> see<00:04:05.430> here

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
thinner cable but let's see here

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:18.599 
thinner cable but let's see here
how<00:04:06.879> much<00:04:07.030> wire<00:04:07.450> we<00:04:07.720> got<00:04:07.900> here

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.759 

looks<00:04:19.150> like<00:04:19.269> it's<00:04:19.419> about<00:04:19.660> okay<00:04:20.109> I'm

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
looks like it's about okay I'm

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.550 
looks like it's about okay I'm
stretching<00:04:21.099> it<00:04:21.340> out<00:04:22.110> looks<00:04:23.110> like<00:04:23.199> it's<00:04:23.319> about

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
stretching it out looks like it's about

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.950 
stretching it out looks like it's about
six<00:04:24.220> feet<00:04:25.470> six<00:04:26.470> feet<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:27.069> cable<00:04:27.280> here<00:04:27.960> pretty

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
six feet six feet of cable here pretty

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.200 
six feet six feet of cable here pretty
good<00:04:29.169> so<00:04:29.440> forget<00:04:30.099> your<00:04:30.129> computer<00:04:30.669> about<00:04:30.970> six

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
good so forget your computer about six

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.680 
good so forget your computer about six
feet<00:04:31.360> away<00:04:32.250> or<00:04:33.250> your<00:04:33.520> USB<00:04:33.909> compatible<00:04:34.419> device

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
feet away or your USB compatible device

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.210 
feet away or your USB compatible device
you<00:04:34.870> can<00:04:34.990> go<00:04:35.110> ahead<00:04:35.199> and<00:04:35.409> plug<00:04:35.590> this<00:04:35.620> into<00:04:35.919> it

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
you can go ahead and plug this into it

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.730 
you can go ahead and plug this into it
and<00:04:36.460> whatnot<00:04:36.699> I<00:04:37.150> wonder<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.110> know<00:04:38.349> what<00:04:38.530> I

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
and whatnot I wonder you know what I

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.439 
and whatnot I wonder you know what I
want<00:04:38.979> to<00:04:39.039> try<00:04:39.129> to<00:04:39.250> somebody<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.879> see<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:40.330> this

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
want to try to somebody and see if this

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.029 
want to try to somebody and see if this
will<00:04:40.599> work<00:04:40.629> for<00:04:40.780> Virtual<00:04:41.259> Console<00:04:41.590> games

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
will work for Virtual Console games

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.610 
will work for Virtual Console games
that'd<00:04:42.970> be<00:04:43.060> pretty<00:04:43.180> cool<00:04:43.300> if<00:04:43.539> it<00:04:43.629> did<00:04:43.690> it

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
that'd be pretty cool if it did it

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.230 
that'd be pretty cool if it did it
probably<00:04:44.919> doesn't<00:04:45.099> but<00:04:45.310> if<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:45.729> does<00:04:45.940> and

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
probably doesn't but if it does and

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.790 
probably doesn't but if it does and
that's<00:04:46.389> cool<00:04:46.569> if<00:04:46.750> not<00:04:46.810> then<00:04:47.199> okay

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
that's cool if not then okay

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.200 
that's cool if not then okay
I'll<00:04:48.129> probably<00:04:48.310> my<00:04:48.490> really<00:04:48.729> use<00:04:48.819> this<00:04:48.940> for<00:04:49.120> my

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
I'll probably my really use this for my

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.249 
I'll probably my really use this for my
emulators<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:52.330> course<00:04:52.569> this<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.870> for<00:04:53.050> games

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
emulators of course this is for games

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.620 
emulators of course this is for games
that<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:54.310> know<00:04:54.400> have<00:04:54.840> two<00:04:55.840> buttons<00:04:57.509> you<00:04:58.509> know

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
that you know have two buttons you know

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.450 
that you know have two buttons you know
like<00:04:58.900> maybe<00:04:59.319> Atari<00:04:59.710> games<00:04:59.979> will<00:05:00.159> work<00:05:00.310> with

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
like maybe Atari games will work with

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.020 
like maybe Atari games will work with
this<00:05:00.639> and<00:05:01.090> whatnot<00:05:01.509> on<00:05:01.780> Atari<00:05:02.710> emulators<00:05:03.250> NES

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
this and whatnot on Atari emulators NES

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.330 
this and whatnot on Atari emulators NES
games<00:05:04.270> will<00:05:04.389> work<00:05:04.539> with<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.870> I<00:05:05.800> don't<00:05:06.069> think

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
games will work with it I don't think

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.100 
games will work with it I don't think
this<00:05:06.819> will<00:05:07.000> be<00:05:07.210> ideal<00:05:07.569> for<00:05:07.599> Super<00:05:08.020> Nintendo

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
this will be ideal for Super Nintendo

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.559 
this will be ideal for Super Nintendo
games<00:05:08.680> because<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:08.979> have<00:05:09.130> those<00:05:10.000> that

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
games because you have those that

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.879 
games because you have those that
control<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.900> has<00:05:10.990> four<00:05:11.259> buttons<00:05:11.380> on<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.710> front

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
control it has four buttons on the front

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:13.439 
control it has four buttons on the front
and<00:05:12.250> there's<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.669> got<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:12.969> shoulder<00:05:13.270> buttons

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
and there's you got the shoulder buttons

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.249 
and there's you got the shoulder buttons
up<00:05:13.659> here<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:14.409> probably<00:05:14.710> won't<00:05:14.860> work<00:05:14.919> very<00:05:15.280> good

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
up here it probably won't work very good

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.390 
up here it probably won't work very good
Genesis<00:05:17.259> games<00:05:17.469> probably<00:05:17.800> won't<00:05:18.129> really<00:05:18.310> work

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
Genesis games probably won't really work

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.890 
Genesis games probably won't really work
that<00:05:18.699> good<00:05:18.759> either<00:05:19.030> depending<00:05:19.599> upon<00:05:19.690> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
that good either depending upon the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.510 
that good either depending upon the
Genesis<00:05:20.319> game<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:20.949> I<00:05:20.979> think<00:05:21.159> there's<00:05:21.310> some

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
Genesis game so I think there's some

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.320 
Genesis game so I think there's some
that<00:05:21.729> have<00:05:22.270> only<00:05:22.750> two<00:05:23.530> buttons<00:05:24.120> or<00:05:25.120> you<00:05:25.210> could

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
that have only two buttons or you could

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.020 
that have only two buttons or you could
program<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:26.169> because<00:05:26.979> I<00:05:27.039> think<00:05:27.280> any<00:05:27.400> Avengers

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
program it because I think any Avengers

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.610 
program it because I think any Avengers
Captain<00:05:28.599> America<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:28.990> Avengers<00:05:29.080> if<00:05:29.560> I

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
Captain America the Avengers if I

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.219 
Captain America the Avengers if I
remember<00:05:29.889> correctly<00:05:30.250> you<00:05:30.719> can<00:05:31.719> program

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
remember correctly you can program

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.649 
remember correctly you can program
there's<00:05:33.159> three<00:05:33.639> buttons<00:05:33.849> to<00:05:34.240> pick<00:05:34.389> we<00:05:34.599> have

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
there's three buttons to pick we have

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.899 
there's three buttons to pick we have
three<00:05:34.870> buttons<00:05:35.169> on<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.440> controller<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:36.099> you

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
three buttons on the controller and you

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.300 
three buttons on the controller and you
can<00:05:37.090> program<00:05:37.409> two<00:05:38.409> of<00:05:38.560> them<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.949> perform<00:05:39.130> the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
can program two of them to perform the

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.080 
can program two of them to perform the
same<00:05:39.490> function<00:05:39.880> so<00:05:40.620> maybe<00:05:41.620> that<00:05:42.400> might<00:05:42.580> this

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
same function so maybe that might this

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.430 
same function so maybe that might this
game<00:05:43.300> might<00:05:43.449> benefit<00:05:43.779> from<00:05:43.840> that<00:05:44.080> maybe<00:05:44.319> a

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
game might benefit from that maybe a

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.760 
game might benefit from that maybe a
little<00:05:44.590> bit<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:44.800> don't<00:05:45.099> know<00:05:45.219> but<00:05:46.500> yeah<00:05:47.500> I'm

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
little bit I don't know but yeah I'm

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.050 
little bit I don't know but yeah I'm
gonna<00:05:47.889> get<00:05:48.039> around<00:05:48.279> probably<00:05:48.729> after<00:05:48.880> the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
gonna get around probably after the

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.540 
gonna get around probably after the
movie<00:05:49.210> I'll<00:05:49.360> review<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:49.900> game<00:05:50.430> it's<00:05:51.430> been

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
movie I'll review that game it's been

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.909 
movie I'll review that game it's been
one<00:05:51.669> since<00:05:51.819> I<00:05:51.909> played<00:05:52.150> it<00:05:52.330> so<00:05:52.770> correct<00:05:53.770> me<00:05:53.800> if

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
one since I played it so correct me if

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.309 
one since I played it so correct me if
I'm<00:05:54.039> wrong<00:05:54.069> on<00:05:54.400> that<00:05:54.639> obviously<00:05:55.120> when<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.199> get

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.740 
I'm wrong on that obviously when I get
to<00:05:56.469> it<00:05:56.620> there<00:05:56.770> but<00:05:57.039> hey<00:06:00.000> I'm<00:06:01.000> really<00:06:01.300> eager<00:06:01.569> to
