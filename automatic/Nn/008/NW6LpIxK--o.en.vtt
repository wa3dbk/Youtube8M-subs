00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.929
 the wise man builds is called an old saying 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.100
 and refers to the cases 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.220
 and not everything runs like it is what you want and how it is 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.039
 How to experience that just the healthy popular 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.460
 from Pauli Teak and Media want us to believe 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.829
 Crisis prevention under today's topic 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.250
 Dear spectators, welcome to a new stay in conversation old 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.400
 houses of Parliament 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.590
 I welcome in the studio Gerhard Spannbauer very nice that you 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.560
 there you are 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.650
 a expert in the field of crisis preparedness 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 is because of his view and that we are the economic 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.090
 to have to go into details 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.870
 something like that again 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.630
 become current 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.950
 Alb think I speed up my ' 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.480
 when we occupied 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.300
 almost endless debt in the world 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.670
 Percent the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.270
 has the money multiplication 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.450
 then you realize that the basics of life are just what 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.760
 Money is yes 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.850
 from multiple could stick with the dance is danger 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 and I realized that here years ago 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.760
 and Danube is to be heard and that never mean danger to me on my family 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.110
 No company to come and I had all those ok 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.040
 What's it all precautionary measures announced what you have to do to yourself 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.649
 protect 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.580
 So, actually, you do something that is task of the state or 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 here would be our three states 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.910
 namely the citizen 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.520
 and the opportunity to move 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.340
 a via if things Peter Schiefer run 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.350
 APA 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.290
 it's amazing 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.490
 and with respect you have to take note that no such 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.440
 actually a big task for citizens for the state 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.090
 People 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.500
 in the countries of this privateer 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.000
 is implemented 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.620
 Takes care of months 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.899
 if we look at the history of mankind a certain 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.819
 Stocking Annika five years ago I was always part of the extended family life 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.269
 Supplies and such 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.480
 only if we emphasize with Paya ten years of peace 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.840
 had stable conditions, people just did not think is anymore 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.750
 Necessary to finish today is a nice evening to count the food you can buy 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.809
 Unfortunately, it also fails to deliver the spoiled completely the state 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:35.049
 push but each individual must actually own responsibility her 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.839
 with a 5er 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.589
 the approach 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.689
 above that raised the money "You do not always have to brush for cooking 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.019
 fell in parts 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.419
 Percent book what we ended up just a Kemptener a beautiful from Uli Rome 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:52.199
 quoted from the therefore a brochure of the German Bundesbank on the subject of money 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.399
 the 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.169
 thoughtfully makes the SETI act means 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.839
 are economically and banknotes a liability of the 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:01.269
 Eurosystem 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.469
 but this is an abstract obligation in the 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.769
 Bundesbank submits a banknote issued by the Eurosystem 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.379
 the bill possibly changed but not in gold or other 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.379
 Assets exchanged 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.970
 the central bank pays it only with the money that it has created itself 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:25.869
 therein is a problem 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:29.309
 There is a massive problem with him so he prefers it for the coach 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:34.709
 which are blame and success is only laid down to learn that our childhood 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.459
 for the German Bundesbank in the case therefore 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.439
 Hardly anyone comes to ask us the money 10 on the TTSG ten 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.929
 Respondents and it actually end in August problem and we offer ourselves and 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:49.609
 Safety but no longer exists for students rather counts approximately 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.399
 two years ago due to the bursting financial crisis 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.909
 that's something she used to be different so go and maybe you should 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.219
 easier to say 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:06.020
 that is not always so it has been that the banknotes are only one 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.230
 an option on it from a 50-euro-spark percent also promises to be via 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.090
 2 20a and a tens to get on the ICE banknote was yes the outside 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.130
 Marc Reis banknote that percent of the honor and Neutra at any time 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.840
 can be 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.360
 against gold or silver 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.789
 secretly one to two times the original idea of ​​cold two things 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:29.400
 it's so 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.710
 the country earlier actually deposited Malaysia Nepal eprimo 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.219
 have decided 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.709
 and with the seemingly just the guarantee against the decision I can 

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:39.849
 pick up my ounce of gold now 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.610
 and at the same time the club has known me all people and cultures simply has 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.909
 More bills had been spent on their coins 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:50.429
 and so is actually the fraud Beppino howl called book money or so 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:51.460
 Instant more 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.830
 and that's going to be a big game especially through 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.719
 Computer is true 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:59.099
 naturally made for all major states and central banks worldwide 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.499
 the countries so beautiful in the system 4 Pauli 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:04.650
 So what money 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.419
 So 4 Tesla you will know he knows the Fiat Lux is done 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.749
 just put a bench down and lead by computer like Tesco TS DAX 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.219
 one percent 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:19.139
 Creating money yourself and lending in the way and so on 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.029
 Everything has nothing to do with deposited values ​​and that is one of ours 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:24.029
 problem 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.969
 Now unfortunately in the now my pocket will grab and 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.490
 in the 50-euro bill ausholen one 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.580
 thinks everyone of us thinks he has got what is solid what Real is in 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.750
 the hand of so 50 euros with which I have no idea what to buy two 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.210
 Boxes of beer similar 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.770
 but the fact is the money creation he has my bill 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.720
 Maybe he lived cloning yes 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.360
 So there is a quasi in German to a hundred, the allocation clever 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.509
 for the well distributed, it looks pretty good in the world for quite a while 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.499
 and that's why the bluff does not come up 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.129
 but values ​​stretching is too 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.159
 Deposit values ​​like real estate stocks or whatever the legacy experience yes 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.180
 but this day the printed HAZ was issued 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.180
 He can also imagine that Inge Voss would decide today
