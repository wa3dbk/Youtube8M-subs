about<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:49.399> I've<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.640> ever<00:01:50.670> found<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
about them I've not ever found what I

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.170 
about them I've not ever found what I
thought<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> ideal<00:01:51.960> calf<00:01:52.649> table<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.549> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
thought was the ideal calf table but you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
thought was the ideal calf table but you
want<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.530> allow<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
want to make sure that they allow you to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.109 
want to make sure that they allow you to
catch<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.520> calf

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
catch a calf

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.770 
catch a calf
easily<00:01:58.020> lay<00:01:58.920> them<00:01:59.100> over<00:01:59.250> easily<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.570> set

easily lay them over easily and then set

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.120 
easily lay them over easily and then set
them<00:02:00.899> back<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.290> without<00:02:01.590> straining<00:02:01.920> yourself

them back up without straining yourself

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.630 
them back up without straining yourself
too<00:02:02.610> much<00:02:02.820> we've<00:02:03.750> gone<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.399> Brandon<00:02:05.399> calves

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
too much we've gone to Brandon calves

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.210 
too much we've gone to Brandon calves
with<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> table<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.750> that's<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> most

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
with the table and that's not the most

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.290 
with the table and that's not the most
popular<00:02:08.459> thing<00:02:08.700> where<00:02:09.030> they're<00:02:09.149> neighbors

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
popular thing where they're neighbors

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.330 
popular thing where they're neighbors
but

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
but

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.630 
but
you<00:02:10.849> know<00:02:10.969> we<00:02:11.150> don't<00:02:11.299> manage<00:02:11.569> by<00:02:11.980> by<00:02:12.980> consensus

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know we don't manage by by consensus

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.660 
you know we don't manage by by consensus
or<00:02:13.790> by<00:02:13.909> poll<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.859> so<00:02:15.859> another<00:02:16.189> thing<00:02:16.340> we've

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
or by poll and so another thing we've

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.539 
or by poll and so another thing we've
done<00:02:16.879> is<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:18.739> only<00:02:18.920> manage<00:02:19.159> them<00:02:19.430> in

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
done is to not only manage them in

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.390 
done is to not only manage them in
smaller<00:02:19.849> groups<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.389> branding<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:20.930> we'll

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
smaller groups of branding but we'll

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.129 
smaller groups of branding but we'll
will<00:02:22.400> sort<00:02:22.969> the<00:02:23.060> cattle<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.569> we<00:02:23.689> always<00:02:23.870> do

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.139 
will sort the cattle like we always do

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.559 
will sort the cattle like we always do
the<00:02:24.319> calves<00:02:24.590> from<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.950> cows<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:25.549> and<00:02:25.760> use<00:02:26.540> a

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
the calves from the cows and and use a

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.860 
the calves from the cows and and use a
table<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:27.290> with<00:02:28.219> five<00:02:28.459> people<00:02:28.939> we<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.299> we<00:02:29.689> can

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
table and with five people we can we can

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.140 
table and with five people we can we can
brand<00:02:30.109> 150<00:02:30.769> calves<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.609> under<00:02:31.939> two<00:02:32.120> hours

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
brand 150 calves and in under two hours

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.159 
brand 150 calves and in under two hours
and<00:02:33.489> it's<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.849> lot<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.329> times<00:02:35.510> we'll<00:02:35.719> set<00:02:35.930> up<00:02:36.049> a

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:36.169 
and it's a lot of times we'll set up a

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.589 
and it's a lot of times we'll set up a
portable<00:02:36.349> Krell<00:02:36.799> in<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.129> pasture<00:02:37.639> and<00:02:37.760> gather

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
portable Krell in the pasture and gather

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.809 
portable Krell in the pasture and gather
the<00:02:38.840> pairs<00:02:39.109> and<00:02:39.650> once<00:02:39.919> the<00:02:40.099> calf<00:02:40.310> has<00:02:40.549> worked

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
the pairs and once the calf has worked

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.860 
the pairs and once the calf has worked
and<00:02:41.299> why<00:02:41.900> he's<00:02:42.109> he's<00:02:42.769> in<00:02:42.919> he's<00:02:43.870> familiar

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
and why he's he's in he's familiar

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.339 
and why he's he's in he's familiar
surroundings<00:02:45.680> he's<00:02:45.919> back<00:02:46.129> with<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> cow<00:02:46.639> and

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
surroundings he's back with a cow and

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.319 
surroundings he's back with a cow and
just<00:02:48.349> try<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.069> keep<00:02:49.219> that<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.609> low<00:02:49.790> stress<00:02:50.120> as

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
just try and keep that as low stress as

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.300 
just try and keep that as low stress as
possible<00:02:50.389> and<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.230> guess<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.769> third<00:02:52.010> thing

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
possible and I guess the third thing

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.089 
possible and I guess the third thing
that<00:02:52.340> we've<00:02:52.879> done<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:54.409> this<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.829> going<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
that we've done and and this is going to

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.580 
that we've done and and this is going to
have<00:02:55.250> some<00:02:55.430> impact<00:02:55.579> I<00:02:55.969> think<00:02:56.239> for<00:02:56.540> as<00:02:56.719> we<00:02:57.439> go

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
have some impact I think for as we go

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.759 
have some impact I think for as we go
into<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.919> future<00:02:58.099> and<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.849> is<00:02:59.530> our<00:03:00.530> bull

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
into the future and that is our bull

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.189 
into the future and that is our bull
calves<00:03:01.099> were<00:03:01.480> started<00:03:02.480> banding<00:03:02.870> them<00:03:03.019> at

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:03.199 
calves were started banding them at

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.199 
calves were started banding them at
Birth<00:03:03.409> rather<00:03:03.739> than<00:03:04.000> castration<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.150> a

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
Birth rather than castration with a

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.379 
Birth rather than castration with a
knife<00:03:05.419> I<00:03:05.980> think<00:03:06.980> that's<00:03:07.189> another<00:03:07.699> form<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.209> low

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
knife I think that's another form of low

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.199 
knife I think that's another form of low
stress<00:03:08.750> cattle<00:03:09.709> handling<00:03:09.889> that<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:11.000> just

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
stress cattle handling that it just

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.819 
stress cattle handling that it just
seems<00:03:11.389> like<00:03:11.480> those<00:03:11.719> calves<00:03:12.049> recover<00:03:12.560> from

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
seems like those calves recover from

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.599 
seems like those calves recover from
that<00:03:13.549> branding<00:03:13.969> process<00:03:14.449> and<00:03:14.720> castration<00:03:15.609> it

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
that branding process and castration it

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.429 
that branding process and castration it
just<00:03:16.819> goes<00:03:16.939> much<00:03:17.180> smoother<00:03:17.569> that<00:03:17.780> way<00:03:17.930> today

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
just goes much smoother that way today

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.990 
just goes much smoother that way today
we're<00:03:18.590> using<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.859> real<00:03:19.069> traditional<00:03:19.639> method

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000

we're using a real traditional method
