00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.510
 Hi, I'm just from the free Android and 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.580
 we are at the legion stand in mobile 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.420
 world congress with the latest device 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.360
 of the optimus family with the optimus pro 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.970
 as you can see is a fable is 5.5 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.370
 inches in size similar to samsung 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.190
 galaxy not cars that we saw in the ifa 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.280
 2012 and good the shaft with this device 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.420
 The truth is that it has a design that 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.290
 I personally like it very much 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.599
 being plastic 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.239
 that yes true materialized to all we 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.710
 please, but the design feels very good 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.149
 recording very light for the size that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.620
 has and the truth is that it is quite 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.840
 thin also taking into account the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.450
 size not dimensions 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.760
 as I said on the screen is 5.5 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.640
 inches with full hd resolution is the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.130
 first LG smartphone with resolution 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.430
 full hd has the same processor 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.809
 that the htc one we saw a week ago 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.890
 in the qualcomm snapdragon 600 that according to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.990
 reveals the performance tests exceeds in 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.890
 almost double that room proved that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.300
 for example we saw in the nexus 4 and in 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.330
 other devices that we saw late 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.100
 from 2012 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.350
 I also know well accompanied by 2 GB of 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.590
 ram as it could be otherwise one 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.480
 3 megapixel camera that the truth of 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.110
 the axes chambers are usually at the 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.850
 height normally and also with flash 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.580
 however it does not allow recording in mode 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 hdr as if it allows sony xperia z and 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.930
 the htc one 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.049
 of the front camera is 2 megapixels 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 and the battery being a fablet have more 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.640
 space to store more components 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.549
 the battery that they have incorporated is 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.740
 3000 140,000 amps so in 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.570
 theory must grant autonomy 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.030
 pretty pretty good 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.010
 it's true it 's behind the galaxy not 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.560
 cars that if I remember correctly are 3 thousand 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.750
 300 thousand empires but the combination of 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.510
 the thousand 140 milliamps with the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.510
 28-nanometer snapdragon processor 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.539
 that consume less power less 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.560
 energy than that of other processors 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.450
 should 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.000
 grant a relatively economical 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.760
 Similary 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.430
 the factory device has' no 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.480
 the fourth point 1.2 is not the last 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.280
 version but good at least we're 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.410
 contains wine that is a leap 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.600
 qualitative especially in fluency and 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.570
 also the shaft has optimized its 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 tasting as you can see is very fluid is me 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.880
 I would say that as fluid as a nexus 4 and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.130
 probably the device with layer of 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.310
 more fluid personalization than ever 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.410
 seen that as you can see it is very very 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.470
 fast the transition to the different 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.000
 eyelashes too 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.630
 the notification bar of 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.520
 glide 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.690
 we have tried a game before 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.470
 and the truth that we have seen that works 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.620
 very quickly the truth that has created a 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.990
 very powerful and very fast although of 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.700
 moment will only be available in 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.930
 Korea and in other non-European countries but 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.010
 who knows if we are going to make the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.890
 launch of galaxy 3 by summer 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.450
 the hertha this tour have it to europe no 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.980
 to compete directly with this 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.450
 device since the hardware that 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.160
 incorporates inside probably 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.700
 stand up as a stop for 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.440
 compete with the galaxy not three 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.310
 in terms of software as you said 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.970
 change 4.1.2 the axis interface and the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.860
 axis has added some functions some 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.860
 very interesting applications one of 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.640
 she is with love with memos though 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.260
 we can open it here 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.080
 and we can is very useful because we have it 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.620
 always at hand but they should have 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.480
 incorporated the stylus as it does exam 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.310
 with the grove because it's such a screen 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.870
 big maybe with the stylus we could 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.060
 draw worlds in a more comfortable way 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.860
 however I know how good they incorporate 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.240
 functions of this type especially in 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.450
 such large screens 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.300
 we can erase change the crowd tone 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.860
 of things if we do not want to access 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.540
 through the address bar the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.950
 incorporated a dedicated button here in the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.400
 upper part on the left side 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.000
 that after studying we have it here we believe 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.060
 and it's quite simple and we can access 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.120
 we are quickly in the browser and 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.000
 click here and we can access more 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.990
 if we left the mode 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.090
 let's cultivate 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.880
 we can maintain ourselves and continue using the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.970
 device without needing without need 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.040
 to erase the note we had created in 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.830
 screen 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.330
 another function is reproduction 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.610
 video have incorporated something similar to 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.560
 what made samsung galaxy 7 pop 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.580
 play 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:01.380
 it allows us to play videos at the same time 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.350
 that we navigate if we have it here and 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.590
 Simply clicking on this button already 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.590
 we have 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.560
 wherever we want we move it without any 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.240
 however this is this function 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.139
 of the optimum but has an improvement that does not 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.129
 it had the galaxy s3 and the galaxy in 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.110
 cars and is that we can 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.700
 the transparency of the video we can 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.230
 adjust 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.240
 so that 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.310
 it's quite comfortable if you think it's 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.650
 pretty useful maybe it would have been fine 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.449
 that we could extend the limit 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.540
 the video how we do so they propose 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.729
 but, well, I think it's not 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.050
 a function is excessively necessary 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.120
 that probably with future 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.440
 system updates are due 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.350
 to correct 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.940
 so well this has been everything and we 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.240
 we see by the free android together with a 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.240
 greeting
