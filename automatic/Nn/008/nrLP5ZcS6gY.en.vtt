00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.200
Everyone knows two heads are better than one
when you're trying to figure something out,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.839
but is a twin hull better than a single one?

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.870
If you're talking about the Carolina Cat 23DC
the answer will be yes.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.689
If you're looking for big water comfort that's
similar to a much larger offshore deep V,

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.699
more stability than any V hull, and more space
than a 26 foot deck boat and less than a foot

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.619
of draft.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.570
The test boat also has an optional fiberglass
hard top, a marine toilet and a fully enclosed

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.640
head compartment, and a convertible sun pad
or table in the bow compartment.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.460
The test boat doubles up on power too, with
twin Yamaha F115 four stroke outboards.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.149
Acceleration is good, with the boat reaching
20 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds, and 30 miles

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.140
per hour in 7.3 seconds.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.620
Unlike most mono hulls, the 23DC doesn't come
out of the hole, but rises to plane without

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.250
much bow rise.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.780
Top speed at 5700 rpm is 42 miles per hour
with the engines trimmed out.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.340
Cruise in comfort at 28 miles per hour at
4000 rpm or 32 miles per hour at 4500 rpm.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.369
If you get into some big waves prepare for
a smooth ride at all speeds.

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.619
The boat slices through the waves as the hulls
rise, the impat of reentry is dampened.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.720
Choppy water is smoothed out, the ride through
big rollers is always comfortable.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.310
In turns, the boat stays almost flat, at the
helm the swiveling adjustable seat is comfortable.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.009
Gauges are easily visible and controls are
right at hand.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.450
The optional companion seat is a single back
to back chair that pulls out to form a lounge.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.750
It has a portable cooler under the seat.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.159
A pair of wide jump seats int he aft corners
of the cockpit round out the seating.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.910
There's plenty of storage space under and
between the seats.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:23.200
A wide walkway aft leads to a big fold up
swim platform and into the water.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.290
If your destination is a beach or sand bar,
the Cat's shallow draft will let you pull

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.930
right up, for easy access.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.950
It's just one of the benefits that comes from
having a twin hull like the Carolina Cat.
