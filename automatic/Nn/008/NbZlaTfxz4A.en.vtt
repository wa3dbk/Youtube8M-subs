00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 you do not deserve your happiness in the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.650
 competition without my world class 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.020

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.020

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.070
 give, we do not give up, we 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.809
 are beaten but think only what 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.879

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:07.630
 team we have to keep fighting, I have 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:09.399
 all of you will be left in the lurch now 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.140
 I used as a needle and thread and 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.430
 a rush to live mentioned 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.310

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:37.360
 leading brings nothing that was 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.500
 just the worst training of all 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.990
 The 94 songs bring us around the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.490
 title 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.350
 pity that we do not change it 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 Can I see through if Dracula 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.930
 I want to make a second attempt 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.060
 while clearly distributed as before 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.369

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.570
 Never enough time was on her 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.399
 It's not just about cheerleading here 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.990
 it's all about us in our teams 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.600
 ever give us up 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.459
 only with you as leader creamy mr 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.280
 Beuth let down because I'm one 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.769
 incompetent voted not you 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.730
 we won the parade instead of one 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.730
 my failures 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.500
 You just could not just press the button 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.750
 she had to push down immediately 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.819
 I'm sorry for my mistake 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.310
 here but give me disappointed 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.099

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.109
 you also never give up 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.030
 but we are a second-rate team 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.889
 that will also make you feel sorry for her 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.290

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.480
