area with the u-shaped not the area with
the<00:00:23.100> metal<00:00:23.340> post<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.390> we're<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.529> locate

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the metal post and we're going to locate

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
the metal post and we're going to locate
the<00:00:26.550> holes<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.269> right<00:00:27.599> next<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the holes that are right next to the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.420 
the holes that are right next to the
battery<00:00:29.640> box<00:00:29.970> there's<00:00:30.330> two<00:00:30.480> open<00:00:30.840> holes<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
battery box there's two open holes and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.840 
battery box there's two open holes and
that's<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.790> slide<00:00:33.030> right<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.750> there<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
that's going to slide right in there and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.229 
that's going to slide right in there and
then<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.870> center<00:00:37.260> portion<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:38.100> let's<00:00:39.000> push

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
then the center portion here let's push

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.290 
then the center portion here let's push
that<00:00:39.270> back<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.129> then<00:00:41.129> pull<00:00:41.430> back<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> cage

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that back and then pull back on the cage

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.650 
that back and then pull back on the cage
and<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:44.250> allows<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.870> clip<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:47.510> now<00:00:48.510> we're

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and it allows this to clip in now we're

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.790 
and it allows this to clip in now we're
going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> come<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> back<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.440> these<00:00:52.440> two

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
going to come to the back and these two

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.479 
going to come to the back and these two
units<00:00:53.390> are<00:00:54.390> gonna<00:00:54.510> fall<00:00:54.899> down<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.280> back

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
units are gonna fall down into the back

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.599 
units are gonna fall down into the back
holes<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:58.410> pretty<00:00:58.649> easy<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:59.399> how

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
holes here it's pretty easy that's how

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.950 
holes here it's pretty easy that's how
it<00:00:59.820> sits<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.160> now<00:01:02.160> we're<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.789> use

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.250 

these<00:01:06.960> two<00:01:07.290> little<00:01:07.560> units<00:01:08.720> I'm<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> turn

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
these two little units I'm going to turn

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.630 
these two little units I'm going to turn
the<00:01:10.530> Baja<00:01:10.920> over<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> view

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the Baja over here so you can get a view

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.350 
the Baja over here so you can get a view
of<00:01:14.790> what's<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> those<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.180> going

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
of what's going on and those are going

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
of what's going on and those are going
to<00:01:18.479> go<00:01:18.780> over<00:01:21.470> right<00:01:22.470> here<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> flat<00:01:24.509> side<00:01:25.250> goes

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to go over right here the flat side goes

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.929 
to go over right here the flat side goes
towards<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> chassis<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.549> slides

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
towards the chassis and that slides

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
towards the chassis and that slides
right<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.509> let's<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.530> light<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
right on let's see if we can light that

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
right on let's see if we can light that
up<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.460> bit<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:34.259> going

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
up a little bit there we go that's going

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
up a little bit there we go that's going
to<00:01:34.590> slide<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to slide right on then we're going to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.130 
to slide right on then we're going to
take<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> our<00:01:38.220> body<00:01:38.520> Clips<00:01:39.000> here

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.440 

and<00:01:46.140> slide<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> through<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:53.550> get<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.790> little

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and slide it through you get a little

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.680 
and slide it through you get a little
better<00:01:54.660> angle<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:56.030> helps<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> use<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.330> pair

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
better angle on this helps to use a pair

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.880 
better angle on this helps to use a pair
of<00:01:57.720> needle-nose<00:02:00.260> we're<00:02:01.260> going<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.470> slide<00:02:01.710> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of needle-nose we're going to slide that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.290 
of needle-nose we're going to slide that
through<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> hole<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.610> clip<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:08.210> so<00:02:09.210> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
through the hole and clip it on so it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.050 
through the hole and clip it on so it
looks<00:02:09.480> like<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.430> let's<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.580> ahead<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.940> do

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
looks like the a let's go ahead and do

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.660 
looks like the a let's go ahead and do
that<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.510> other<00:02:12.690> side<00:02:16.250> not<00:02:17.250> sure<00:02:17.460> if<00:02:17.580> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
that to the other side not sure if you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.070 
that to the other side not sure if you
can<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.210> or<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> idea

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.750 

first<00:02:28.080> couple<00:02:28.470> times<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.860> slip<00:02:29.130> body<00:02:29.370> clips

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
first couple times you slip body clips

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.360 
first couple times you slip body clips
in<00:02:30.000> there<00:02:30.240> they<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:32.040> tight<00:02:32.340> but

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
in there they are a little tight but

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
in there they are a little tight but
they<00:02:33.140> they<00:02:34.140> wear<00:02:34.410> in<00:02:34.620> easily<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.350> you're

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
they they wear in easily so that you're

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.050 
they they wear in easily so that you're
not<00:02:37.680> fighting<00:02:38.190> them<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:44.430> one's<00:02:44.640> being<00:02:44.850> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
not fighting them this one's being a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.980 
not fighting them this one's being a
bear<00:02:49.610> because<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.820> angle<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.450> I'm<00:02:51.600> at<00:02:51.780> if

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
bear because of the angle that I'm at if

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.140 
bear because of the angle that I'm at if
you<00:02:52.140> push<00:02:52.470> down<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.370> your<00:02:53.730> hand<00:02:53.940> like

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you push down on it with your hand like

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.560 
you push down on it with your hand like
I<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.390> did<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.830> lowers<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.850> pin<00:02:57.060> down<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.510> you

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
I just did it lowers the pin down so you

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.350 
I just did it lowers the pin down so you
can<00:02:57.840> get<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.320> properly<00:02:58.820> again<00:02:59.820> one<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
can get it in properly again one of the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
can get it in properly again one of the
things<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.320> working<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> camera<00:03:02.750> all<00:03:03.750> right

story in my life there we go now we have
a<00:04:59.120> roll<00:05:00.120> cage<00:05:00.360> on<00:05:00.690> our<00:05:00.870> buggy<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:01.919> pick<00:05:02.100> it

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
a roll cage on our buggy you can pick it

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.240 
a roll cage on our buggy you can pick it
up<00:05:02.280> by<00:05:02.460> that<00:05:02.669> make<00:05:03.000> some<00:05:03.180> beautiful<00:05:03.419> handle

we're<00:05:08.250> starting<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.700> get<00:05:08.820> somewhere<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:10.320> next

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
we're starting to get somewhere the next

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.690 
we're starting to get somewhere the next
step<00:05:10.860> is<00:05:12.260> step<00:05:13.280> 106<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.700> we're<00:05:16.400> again<00:05:17.400> going

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
step is step 106 and we're again going

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.760 
step is step 106 and we're again going
to<00:05:17.789> take<00:05:18.000> our<00:05:18.210> time<00:05:18.539> through<00:05:19.169> step<00:05:19.500> number

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
to take our time through step number

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.279 
to take our time through step number
actually<00:05:20.729> step<00:05:20.940> 106<00:05:21.450> is<00:05:21.600> opening<00:05:22.020> your<00:05:22.110> bag

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
actually step 106 is opening your bag

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:31.040 
actually step 106 is opening your bag
out<00:05:22.530> but<00:05:23.280> step<00:05:24.270> number<00:05:24.500> 107<00:05:26.030> 108<00:05:28.039> 1<00:05:29.039> 9<00:05:29.600> 110<00:05:30.600> are

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
out but step number 107 108 1 9 110 are

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.230 
out but step number 107 108 1 9 110 are
