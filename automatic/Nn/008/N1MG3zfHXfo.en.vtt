well when I first started getting into

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
knives and thinking about

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.100

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
most people I watched a bunch of videos

most people I watched a bunch of videos
on<00:00:20.360> YouTube<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:21.020> obviously<00:00:21.740> one<00:00:22.039> of<00:00:22.070> the

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
on YouTube and obviously one of the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.940 
on YouTube and obviously one of the
people's<00:00:22.580> you<00:00:23.000> watch<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.390> lot<00:00:23.509> are<00:00:23.869> not<00:00:24.830> in

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
people's you watch a lot are not in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.260 
people's you watch a lot are not in
fancy<00:00:25.570> he's<00:00:26.570> got<00:00:26.990> quite<00:00:27.259> a<00:00:27.320> few<00:00:27.919> knife<00:00:28.820> videos

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
fancy he's got quite a few knife videos

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.759 
fancy he's got quite a few knife videos
and<00:00:29.509> obviously<00:00:29.960> they're<00:00:30.259> going<00:00:30.439> to<00:00:30.500> pop<00:00:30.740> up

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
and obviously they're going to pop up

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.710 
and obviously they're going to pop up
right<00:00:31.400> near<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.820> top<00:00:32.000> there<00:00:32.300> when<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:32.599> do

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
right near the top there when you do

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.650 
right near the top there when you do
searches<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.760> I<00:00:34.910> think<00:00:35.120> it<00:00:35.210> was<00:00:35.300> about<00:00:35.390> the

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
searches and I think it was about the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.200 
searches and I think it was about the
10th<00:00:35.900> video<00:00:36.290> I<00:00:36.379> watched<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.070> now<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:37.640> come<00:00:38.150> to

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
10th video I watched and now I come to

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.610 
10th video I watched and now I come to
think<00:00:38.330> of<00:00:38.600> it<00:00:38.690> it's<00:00:38.870> kind<00:00:39.080> of<00:00:39.140> funny<00:00:39.350> because<00:00:39.500> I

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
think of it it's kind of funny because I

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.560 
think of it it's kind of funny because I
actually<00:00:39.710> think<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.430> was<00:00:40.550> this<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.330> leak

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
actually think it was this the leak

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.619 
actually think it was this the leak
actually<00:00:42.460> but<00:00:43.460> anyway<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:43.850> was<00:00:44.089> watching<00:00:44.510> this

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
actually but anyway I was watching this

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.100 
actually but anyway I was watching this
video<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.090> Nutnfancy<00:00:47.090> was<00:00:47.300> talking<00:00:47.870> about

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
video and Nutnfancy was talking about

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.250 
video and Nutnfancy was talking about
the<00:00:48.260> good<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.500> bad<00:00:48.559> points<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.250> he<00:00:49.399> had<00:00:49.610> like

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
the good and bad points and he had like

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
the good and bad points and he had like
I<00:00:51.640> think<00:00:53.079> 33<00:00:54.079> leaks<00:00:54.350> or<00:00:54.620> something<00:00:55.070> like<00:00:55.219> that

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
I think 33 leaks or something like that

flipper the Knicks flipper just popped
right<00:02:21.290> out

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.460 

I<00:02:25.340> think<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.580> liner<00:02:27.180> lock<00:02:27.510> ones<00:02:27.900> are<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.320> little

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
I think the liner lock ones are a little

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.340 
I think the liner lock ones are a little
bit<00:02:29.040> faster<00:02:29.340> than<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.940> frame<00:02:30.240> lock<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
bit faster than the frame lock but the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.990 
bit faster than the frame lock but the
frame<00:02:31.620> lock<00:02:31.800> probably<00:02:32.460> are<00:02:32.580> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> be<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
frame lock probably are going to be a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.310 
frame lock probably are going to be a
little<00:02:33.270> stronger<00:02:33.660> staying<00:02:34.320> open<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.840> speed

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
little stronger staying open the speed

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.710 
little stronger staying open the speed
say<00:02:37.530> system<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> basically<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.730> torsion<00:02:39.510> bar

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
say system is basically a torsion bar

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.940 
say system is basically a torsion bar
spring<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.990> open<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.590> with<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
spring and you can open it with the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.330 
spring and you can open it with the
thumb<00:02:44.190> stud<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.860> little<00:02:47.100> quicker

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
thumb stud and it's a little quicker

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.540 
thumb stud and it's a little quicker
that<00:02:47.640> way<00:02:48.470> typically<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.620> open<00:02:50.130> them<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
that way typically I open them with the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.090 
that way typically I open them with the
flipper<00:02:51.050> that's<00:02:52.050> I'll<00:02:52.260> open<00:02:52.620> most<00:02:52.830> Mike

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
flipper that's I'll open most Mike

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.280 
flipper that's I'll open most Mike
inning<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.610> nice<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.720> keep<00:02:54.930> them<00:02:55.140> all

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
inning you nice so I just keep them all

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.770 
inning you nice so I just keep them all
the<00:02:55.440> same<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:58.590> handles<00:02:59.300> typically<00:03:00.300> they<00:03:00.570> come

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
the same the handles typically they come

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.370 
the same the handles typically they come
in<00:03:00.930> either<00:03:01.140> an<00:03:01.950> aluminum<00:03:02.640> scale<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.870> 410

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
in either an aluminum scale or the 410

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:13.040 
in either an aluminum scale or the 410
stainless<00:03:04.800> like<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.670> one<00:03:05.910> or<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:12.050> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
stainless like this one or this one the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.990 
stainless like this one or this one the
410<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:14.130> think<00:03:14.790> these<00:03:14.940> are<00:03:15.000> slightly<00:03:15.690> narrower

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
410 I think these are slightly narrower

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.690 
410 I think these are slightly narrower
the<00:03:18.000> reason<00:03:18.510> i<00:03:18.750> think<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.040> frame<00:03:20.430> locks

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
the reason i think that the frame locks

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.510 
the reason i think that the frame locks
are<00:03:20.940> slightly<00:03:21.240> narrower<00:03:21.780> because<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.680> my

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
are slightly narrower because in my

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.670 
are slightly narrower because in my
little<00:03:23.850> kydex<00:03:24.420> sheath<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:24.960> i<00:03:25.200> did<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> little

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
little kydex sheath that i did a little

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.090 
little kydex sheath that i did a little
video<00:03:25.860> on<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.810> fits<00:03:27.810> real<00:03:28.080> tight<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.800> there's

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
video on it fits real tight and there's

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.250 
video on it fits real tight and there's
no<00:03:29.489> wobble<00:03:30.090> at<00:03:30.180> all<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.360> mean<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.110> there

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
no wobble at all I mean it's in there

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.050 
no wobble at all I mean it's in there
really<00:03:31.440> tight<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.340> give<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.520> good<00:03:32.760> pop

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
really tight you have to give a good pop

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.550 
really tight you have to give a good pop
to<00:03:33.300> get<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.570> out<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:35.989> specifically<00:03:36.989> bought<00:03:37.290> this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
to get it out I specifically bought this

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.229 
to get it out I specifically bought this
one<00:03:37.770> well<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.670> knife<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
one well I just like a knife but I

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.380 
one well I just like a knife but I
specifically<00:03:40.020> bought<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.560> put<00:03:41.459> into<00:03:41.910> here<00:03:42.209> but

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
specifically bought it put into here but

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.479 
specifically bought it put into here but
there<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.790> bit<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.880> play<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.120> mean<00:03:46.489> it'll

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
there is a bit of play I mean it'll

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.979 
there is a bit of play I mean it'll
probably<00:03:47.940> stay<00:03:48.360> in<00:03:48.390> there<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.810> could

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
probably stay in there and you could

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.840 
probably stay in there and you could
certainly<00:03:49.260> tighten<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:49.950> up<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.520> wanted

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
certainly tighten that up if you wanted

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.960 
certainly tighten that up if you wanted
to<00:03:51.739> reheat<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:52.950> squeeze<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.340> down<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.850> put

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
to reheat it and squeeze it down and put

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.390 
to reheat it and squeeze it down and put
another<00:03:54.209> rivet<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.720> here<00:03:54.989> or<00:03:55.110> whatever<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:56.340> i

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
another rivet in here or whatever but i

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.760 
another rivet in here or whatever but i
think<00:03:56.970> i'll<00:03:57.120> probably<00:03:57.600> mostly<00:03:58.200> just<00:03:58.500> stick

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
think i'll probably mostly just stick

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.760 
think i'll probably mostly just stick
with<00:03:59.270> my<00:04:00.270> red<00:04:00.480> smoke<00:04:00.870> one<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.620> i've<00:04:01.739> been

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
with my red smoke one that i've been

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.400 
with my red smoke one that i've been
using<00:04:02.130> or<00:04:03.030> i<00:04:03.060> might<00:04:03.330> get<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> black<00:04:03.810> smoke<00:04:04.170> one

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
using or i might get a black smoke one

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.840 
using or i might get a black smoke one
why<00:04:05.130> not<00:04:05.340> get<00:04:05.550> one<00:04:05.610> more<00:04:05.940> for<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.239> collection

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
why not get one more for the collection

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.100 
why not get one more for the collection
the<00:04:08.850> blades<00:04:09.150> are<00:04:09.510> three-inch<00:04:11.360> very<00:04:12.360> thin<00:04:12.810> as<00:04:13.080> a

the blades are three-inch very thin as a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.570 
the blades are three-inch very thin as a
lot<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.530> people<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:13.890> pointed<00:04:14.070> out<00:04:14.400> that

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
lot of people have pointed out that

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.110 
lot of people have pointed out that
point<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.150> great<00:04:15.480> for<00:04:15.720> EDC<00:04:16.020> stuff<00:04:16.770> but<00:04:17.120> you

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
point is great for EDC stuff but you

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.430 
point is great for EDC stuff but you
know<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.299> got<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> little<00:04:18.959> careful<00:04:19.200> with

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
know you got to be a little careful with

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560 
know you got to be a little careful with
it<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.799> certainly<00:04:20.220> can't<00:04:20.549> do<00:04:20.700> any<00:04:20.850> prying<00:04:21.269> or

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
it you certainly can't do any prying or

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.790 
it you certainly can't do any prying or
anything<00:04:21.959> with<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.200> if<00:04:22.530> break<00:04:22.860> real<00:04:23.130> easy<00:04:24.800> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
anything with it if break real easy the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.400 
anything with it if break real easy the
older<00:04:26.190> ones<00:04:26.400> were<00:04:26.640> 440<00:04:27.390> i<00:04:27.419> believe<00:04:27.960> all<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
older ones were 440 i believe all the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.700 
older ones were 440 i believe all the
new<00:04:28.800> ones<00:04:29.010> are<00:04:29.190> going<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.430> be<00:04:29.550> sandvik<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.930> 14c

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
new ones are going to be sandvik the 14c

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.670 
new ones are going to be sandvik the 14c
28<00:04:32.160> in<00:04:32.310> which<00:04:32.880> i<00:04:33.060> really<00:04:33.330> like<00:04:33.510> i<00:04:33.960> first<00:04:34.410> got

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
28 in which i really like i first got

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.660 
28 in which i really like i first got
one<00:04:34.890> on<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.600> zing

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
one on the zing

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.480 
one on the zing
and<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.960> really<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.740> zing<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.280> like

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490

version which is 80 bucks I think that's

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.510 
version which is 80 bucks I think that's
a<00:05:02.760> little<00:05:03.000> bit<00:05:03.120> much<00:05:03.330> for<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.630> leak<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.169> I<00:05:04.520> don't

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
a little bit much for a leak but I don't

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.159 
a little bit much for a leak but I don't
know<00:05:05.610> more<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.120> likely<00:05:06.150> I'll<00:05:06.660> end<00:05:06.690> up<00:05:06.960> with

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
know more and likely I'll end up with

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.110 
know more and likely I'll end up with
one<00:05:07.350> anyway<00:05:07.740> obviously<00:05:07.980> I<00:05:10.070> think<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:11.700> have<00:05:11.880> one

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120

or<00:05:12.240> two<00:05:12.390> other<00:05:12.540> leaks<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:13.050> think<00:05:13.290> I<00:05:13.410> may<00:05:13.590> have

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
or two other leaks I think I may have

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.650 
or two other leaks I think I may have
given<00:05:13.830> those<00:05:14.160> ones<00:05:14.400> away<00:05:15.350> already<00:05:16.610> but<00:05:17.660> there

you go I guess once you get into the
whole<00:05:20.820> night<00:05:21.060> think<00:05:21.419> it<00:05:21.690> gets<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.110> little<00:05:22.230> crazy
