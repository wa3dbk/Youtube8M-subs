I didn't cast the life's life siphon
this<00:02:49.739> isn't<00:02:50.099> probably<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.819> great<00:02:50.970> opening

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.270 
luck we'll play my second one yeah chard
and<00:04:44.840> then<00:04:45.840> we're<00:04:45.990> just<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.260> to<00:04:46.320> play<00:04:46.530> this

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.940 

we'll<00:04:50.280> plan<00:04:50.460> our<00:04:50.580> another<00:04:50.910> another<00:04:51.240> harvester

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
we'll plan our another another harvester

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.680 
we'll plan our another another harvester
will<00:04:52.950> attack<00:04:53.250> for<00:04:53.520> three<00:04:55.910> taking<00:04:56.910> her<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.210> 15

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
will attack for three taking her to 15

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.880 
will attack for three taking her to 15
but<00:04:58.290> we<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.590> up<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:59.070> 16<00:04:59.730> so<00:05:00.600> that's<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:01.230> mean<00:05:01.470> just

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
but we go up to 16 so that's I mean just

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.920 
but we go up to 16 so that's I mean just
the<00:05:02.010> crazy<00:05:02.280> power<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.820> Life<00:05:03.000> Drain<00:05:05.690> so<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.900> is

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
the crazy power of Life Drain so this is

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.160 
the crazy power of Life Drain so this is
my<00:05:07.280> blood<00:05:08.280> on<00:05:08.340> your<00:05:08.610> shoes<00:05:08.910> build<00:05:09.360> I'm<00:05:09.900> gonna

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
my blood on your shoes build I'm gonna

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.510 
my blood on your shoes build I'm gonna
work<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.590> obviously<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.340> lot<00:05:11.850> more<00:05:13.520> added

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
work it obviously a lot more added

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.730 
work it obviously a lot more added
sealed<00:05:14.790> today<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.480> think<00:05:15.690> that's<00:05:16.080> going<00:05:16.680> to

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
sealed today so I think that's going to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.280 
sealed today so I think that's going to
take<00:05:16.950> up<00:05:17.100> some<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.310> my<00:05:17.370> time<00:05:17.720> three-run<00:05:18.720> arena

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
take up some of my time three-run arena

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.420 
take up some of my time three-run arena
brawler<00:05:19.740> ok<00:05:20.550> I'm<00:05:21.510> fine<00:05:21.570> with<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.310> becomes<00:05:23.310> a

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
brawler ok I'm fine with that becomes a

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.080 
brawler ok I'm fine with that becomes a
51<00:05:26.390> but<00:05:27.390> that's<00:05:27.570> ok<00:05:28.050> because<00:05:28.880> we<00:05:29.880> have

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
51 but that's ok because we have

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.900 
51 but that's ok because we have
basically<00:05:30.780> these<00:05:31.080> two<00:05:31.410> are<00:05:31.860> unblockable<00:05:32.610> so

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
basically these two are unblockable so

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.380 
basically these two are unblockable so
we<00:05:33.030> have<00:05:33.180> like<00:05:34.110> six<00:05:34.560> six<00:05:34.680> coming<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.640> we<00:05:36.240> also

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
we have like six six coming in we also

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.810 
we have like six six coming in we also
have<00:05:36.600> a<00:05:36.630> murder<00:05:36.930> which<00:05:37.230> is<00:05:37.440> an<00:05:37.650> instant<00:05:38.490> speed

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
have a murder which is an instant speed

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.000 
have a murder which is an instant speed
or<00:05:39.090> quick<00:05:39.300> action<00:05:39.690> destroy<00:05:40.410> target<00:05:40.860> non

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
or quick action destroy target non

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.500 
or quick action destroy target non
artifact<00:05:41.520> troop<00:05:41.730> so<00:05:41.910> I<00:05:41.940> have<00:05:42.030> four<00:05:42.270> of<00:05:42.300> those

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
artifact troop so I have four of those

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.810 
artifact troop so I have four of those
in<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.840> deck<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.230> course<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:45.860> I<00:05:46.860> think<00:05:47.640> this

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
in the deck of course and I think this

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.630 
in the deck of course and I think this
time<00:05:47.880> since<00:05:48.420> right<00:05:48.660> 11<00:05:49.230> and<00:05:49.530> we're<00:05:50.460> going<00:05:50.610> to

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
time since right 11 and we're going to

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.910 
time since right 11 and we're going to
go<00:05:50.880> to<00:05:51.470> 12<00:05:52.470> I<00:05:54.080> think<00:05:55.080> we're<00:05:55.350> just<00:05:55.530> going<00:05:55.650> to<00:05:55.680> be

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
go to 12 I think we're just going to be

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.260 
go to 12 I think we're just going to be
really<00:05:56.190> aggressive<00:05:56.400> here<00:05:56.850> and<00:05:57.030> we're<00:05:57.120> going

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
really aggressive here and we're going

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.380 
really aggressive here and we're going
to<00:05:57.300> attack<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.490> then<00:05:59.490> instead<00:06:00.000> of<00:06:00.060> planning

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
to attack and then instead of planning

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.370 
to attack and then instead of planning
out<00:06:00.630> creatures<00:06:01.050> or<00:06:01.290> even<00:06:01.530> playing<00:06:01.770> murder<00:06:03.380> I

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
out creatures or even playing murder I

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.960 
out creatures or even playing murder I
think<00:06:05.130> we're<00:06:05.250> just<00:06:05.370> going<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.580> play<00:06:05.760> life

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.340 
think we're just going to play life
siphon<00:06:06.390> here<00:06:06.570> because<00:06:06.780> we<00:06:06.930> go<00:06:07.050> all<00:06:07.140> the<00:06:07.230> way<00:06:07.260> up

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
siphon here because we go all the way up

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.380 
siphon here because we go all the way up
to<00:06:07.380> 18<00:06:07.800> life<00:06:09.230> we<00:06:10.230> play<00:06:10.380> a<00:06:10.410> life<00:06:10.650> siphon<00:06:11.070> here<00:06:11.430> we

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
to 18 life we play a life siphon here we

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.620 
to 18 life we play a life siphon here we
do<00:06:12.510> five<00:06:12.810> more<00:06:12.840> damage<00:06:13.740> to<00:06:14.130> her<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:14.670> we<00:06:15.390> gain
