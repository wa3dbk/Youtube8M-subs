00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
initially i'm really impressed with the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.270 
initially i'm really impressed with the
fact<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.320> actually<00:00:53.500> matches<00:00:53.890> my<00:00:54.220> skin

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
fact that it actually matches my skin

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.620 
fact that it actually matches my skin
tone<00:00:54.780> pretty<00:00:55.780> spot-on<00:00:57.420> actually<00:00:58.420> very

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
tone pretty spot-on actually very

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.780 
tone pretty spot-on actually very
spot-on<00:00:59.020> um<00:01:01.110> so<00:01:02.110> that's<00:01:02.770> one<00:01:02.980> pro<00:01:03.280> i<00:01:03.490> suppose

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
spot-on um so that's one pro i suppose

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.319 
spot-on um so that's one pro i suppose
the<00:01:04.089> other<00:01:04.960> pro<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.840> does<00:01:08.649> have<00:01:09.329> a

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
the other pro is that it does have a

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.289 
the other pro is that it does have a
buildable<00:01:11.020> coverage<00:01:11.229> it<00:01:11.679> has<00:01:11.950> when<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.969> you

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
buildable coverage it has when you you

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.719 
buildable coverage it has when you you
know<00:01:13.420> put<00:01:13.659> on<00:01:13.749> your<00:01:13.899> first<00:01:14.140> layer<00:01:14.409> i<00:01:14.829> use<00:01:15.429> this

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689

um<00:01:52.299> I<00:01:56.039> guess<00:01:57.039> would<00:01:57.189> be<00:01:57.249> the<00:01:57.459> cost<00:01:58.770> yeah<00:01:59.770> I<00:02:00.130> only

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
um I guess would be the cost yeah I only

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.929 
um I guess would be the cost yeah I only
cost<00:02:00.700> me<00:02:00.850> like<00:02:01.630> six<00:02:01.959> bucks<00:02:02.139> I<00:02:02.759> guess<00:02:03.759> because

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
cost me like six bucks I guess because

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.239 
cost me like six bucks I guess because
the<00:02:04.179> initial<00:02:04.659> newness<00:02:05.469> of<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.920> fit<00:02:06.130> me

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249 
the initial newness of the fit me

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.730 
the initial newness of the fit me
foundation<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:07.179> kind<00:02:07.359> of<00:02:07.450> worn<00:02:07.689> off<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.709> I

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
foundation is kind of worn off so I

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.100 
foundation is kind of worn off so I
guess<00:02:08.890> that's<00:02:09.220> why<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:09.490> on<00:02:09.610> sale<00:02:09.819> but<00:02:10.270> who

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
guess that's why it's on sale but who

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.770 
guess that's why it's on sale but who
knows<00:02:11.879> okay<00:02:12.879> as<00:02:12.939> far<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.269> cons<00:02:13.510> go

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
knows okay as far as the cons go

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560

I have only skin and I guess if you want
to<00:02:21.620> go<00:02:21.740> technical<00:02:22.370> about<00:02:26.560> what's<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.680> NC<00:02:28.100> 50

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520

wooly<00:02:49.090> even<00:02:50.090> though<00:02:50.239> i<00:02:50.269> sealed<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.080> with

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
wooly even though i sealed it with

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.660 
wooly even though i sealed it with
powder<00:02:51.470> as<00:02:51.830> well<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.560> guess<00:02:55.040> maybe<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.489> has

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
powder as well so I guess maybe it has

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.800 
powder as well so I guess maybe it has
something<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:56.030> do<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.360> fact<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
something to do with the fact that the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:05.860 
something to do with the fact that the
SPF<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.820> 18<00:02:59.650> no<00:03:01.810> maybe<00:03:02.950> who<00:03:03.950> knows<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.880> and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
SPF is 18 no maybe who knows but and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.490 
SPF is 18 no maybe who knows but and
then<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.800> weather<00:03:07.310> today<00:03:07.550> was<00:03:07.850> like<00:03:08.000> 76<00:03:08.510> here

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
then the weather today was like 76 here

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.340 
then the weather today was like 76 here
so<00:03:10.459> it's<00:03:11.060> kind<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.330> warm<00:03:11.600> little<00:03:12.290> windy<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:14.600> I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
so it's kind of warm little windy and I

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.309 
so it's kind of warm little windy and I
was<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:15.769> oily<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.060> only<00:03:17.150> imagine<00:03:17.330> how<00:03:18.170> it

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
was like oily I can only imagine how it

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.910 
was like oily I can only imagine how it
would<00:03:18.470> react<00:03:18.829> in<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.850> summertime<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.920> that's

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
would react in the summertime so that's

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.210 
would react in the summertime so that's
not<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:22.130> good<00:03:22.280> sign<00:03:22.340> for<00:03:22.519> me<00:03:22.880> um<00:03:24.610> number<00:03:25.610> 2<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:27.320> a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
not a good sign for me um number 2 of a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.360 
not a good sign for me um number 2 of a
con<00:03:28.519> would<00:03:28.910> be<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.750> think<00:03:30.440> my<00:03:30.739> face<00:03:31.010> has<00:03:31.340> been

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
con would be I think my face has been

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.729 
con would be I think my face has been
like<00:03:31.670> tangling<00:03:32.150> all<00:03:32.360> day<00:03:32.600> not<00:03:33.290> really<00:03:33.500> sure<00:03:33.709> if

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
like tangling all day not really sure if

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.590 
like tangling all day not really sure if
I'm<00:03:33.920> allergic<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.910> or<00:03:35.090> what<00:03:35.920> um<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.670> don't

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.930 
I'm allergic to it or what um I don't
know<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:39.709> feels<00:03:39.980> kind<00:03:40.190> of<00:03:40.430> tingly<00:03:40.820> and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.479 

yeah<00:03:44.200> don't<00:03:45.200> particularly<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.280> about

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
yeah don't particularly like that about

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.690 
yeah don't particularly like that about
it<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:48.010> number<00:03:49.010> three<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.340> just<00:03:49.519> like<00:03:49.670> a

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
it and just number three I just like a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.670 
it and just number three I just like a
petty<00:03:50.060> kind<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.480> con<00:03:50.720> would<00:03:51.049> be<00:03:51.170> just<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.500> way

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
petty kind of con would be just the way

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.210 
petty kind of con would be just the way
that<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:53.359> way<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.920> but<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.489> I

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
that it the way that it is but you I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.069 
that it the way that it is but you I
guess<00:03:58.220> it's<00:03:58.370> not<00:03:58.519> really<00:03:58.579> user<00:03:59.000> friendly<00:03:59.120> you

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079

pour it out into the container and

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.150
