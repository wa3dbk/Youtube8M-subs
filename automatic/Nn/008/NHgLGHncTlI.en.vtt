more<00:04:14.380> stable<00:04:14.769> but<00:04:15.190> lighter<00:04:15.430> than<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:16.000> TouchWiz

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
more stable but lighter than a TouchWiz

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.680 
more stable but lighter than a TouchWiz
or<00:04:16.840> sense<00:04:17.640> this<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:18.760> not<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.909> final<00:04:19.209> user

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
or sense this is not a final user

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.759 
or sense this is not a final user
interface<00:04:20.260> remember

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
interface remember

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.210 
interface remember
I'm<00:04:22.759> gonna<00:04:22.910> go<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.120> settings<00:04:23.569> and<00:04:23.780> then<00:04:24.220> about

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
I'm gonna go to settings and then about

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.180 
I'm gonna go to settings and then about
phone<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:25.840> here<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.930> can<00:04:27.080> see<00:04:27.289> it<00:04:27.530> runs<00:04:27.889> on

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
phone and here you can see it runs on

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.189 
phone and here you can see it runs on
Android<00:04:28.789> 5.0<00:04:29.889> also<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:30.979> model<00:04:31.310> number<00:04:32.199> let's

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
Android 5.0 also the model number let's

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.850 
Android 5.0 also the model number let's
check<00:04:33.409> out<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.740> storage<00:04:34.159> and<00:04:35.080> this<00:04:36.080> is<00:04:36.289> 16gb

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
check out the storage and this is 16gb

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.490 
check out the storage and this is 16gb
and<00:04:37.009> you<00:04:37.460> have<00:04:37.669> just<00:04:38.120> under<00:04:38.449> 10<00:04:38.659> GB<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.409> it

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
and you have just under 10 GB but it

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.129 
and you have just under 10 GB but it
could<00:04:39.680> be<00:04:39.830> more<00:04:40.069> or<00:04:40.099> less<00:04:40.580> because<00:04:40.990> again<00:04:41.990> the

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
could be more or less because again the

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.930 
could be more or less because again the
software<00:04:42.319> is<00:04:42.620> not<00:04:42.979> final<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.520> you'll<00:04:43.639> have<00:04:43.789> to

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
software is not final so you'll have to

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.420 
software is not final so you'll have to
take<00:04:44.539> that<00:04:44.750> into<00:04:45.110> account<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:45.650> there<00:04:46.190> might<00:04:46.400> be

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
take that into account so there might be

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.730 
take that into account so there might be
additional<00:04:46.909> partner<00:04:47.599> apps<00:04:47.810> comes<00:04:48.409> up

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
additional partner apps comes up

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.189 
additional partner apps comes up
pre-loaded<00:04:49.400> now<00:04:50.180> let's<00:04:50.479> check<00:04:50.629> out<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.960> RAM

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
pre-loaded now let's check out the RAM

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.210 
pre-loaded now let's check out the RAM
so<00:04:51.909> there's<00:04:52.909> a<00:04:53.030> free<00:04:53.300> Ram<00:04:53.539> is<00:04:53.750> 1gb<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:55.009> have

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
so there's a free Ram is 1gb you have

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.689 
so there's a free Ram is 1gb you have
system<00:04:55.669> about<00:04:56.530> 374<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.800> 4:09

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
system about 374 and 4:09

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.990 
system about 374 and 4:09
mb<00:04:59.120> of<00:04:59.240> ram<00:04:59.270> in<00:05:00.199> use<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:01.460> system<00:05:01.759> will<00:05:01.880> take

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
mb of ram in use the system will take

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.040 
mb of ram in use the system will take
372<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:03.289> roughly<00:05:03.590> just<00:05:03.919> over<00:05:04.340> 1600<00:05:05.330> mb<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:06.020> ram

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
372 so roughly just over 1600 mb of ram

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.980 
372 so roughly just over 1600 mb of ram
and<00:05:08.199> above<00:05:09.199> that<00:05:09.590> about<00:05:10.250> 1gb<00:05:11.030> is<00:05:11.180> available<00:05:11.810> so

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
and above that about 1gb is available so

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.499 
and above that about 1gb is available so
more<00:05:12.620> than<00:05:12.740> 50%<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.490> available<00:05:14.000> that's<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.330> good

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
more than 50% is available that's a good

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.170 
more than 50% is available that's a good
sign<00:05:15.310> now<00:05:16.310> let's<00:05:16.550> check<00:05:16.639> out<00:05:16.789> some<00:05:16.819> of<00:05:17.060> the

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
sign now let's check out some of the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.230 
sign now let's check out some of the
apps<00:05:17.360> for<00:05:17.690> example<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.289> dialer<00:05:18.680> here<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.729> if

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
apps for example the dialer here and if

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.020 
apps for example the dialer here and if
you're<00:05:20.389> already<00:05:20.539> a<00:05:20.780> Sony<00:05:21.080> user<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:22.639> learning

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
you're already a Sony user the learning

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.820 
you're already a Sony user the learning
curve<00:05:23.240> would<00:05:23.419> be<00:05:23.569> very<00:05:23.840> very<00:05:24.169> low<00:05:24.590> because

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
curve would be very very low because

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.760 
curve would be very very low because
it's<00:05:25.129> almost<00:05:25.690> everything<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:26.870> identical<00:05:27.560> the

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
it's almost everything is identical the

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.779 
it's almost everything is identical the
way<00:05:28.699> you<00:05:28.759> add<00:05:29.210> widgets<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.110> stuff<00:05:30.380> and<00:05:30.949> then

double<00:05:35.960> pulldown<00:05:36.380> kind<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:37.130> then<00:05:37.909> let's

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
double pulldown kind and then let's

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.830 
double pulldown kind and then let's
check<00:05:38.330> out<00:05:38.509> the<00:05:38.659> camera<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:41.630> Sony

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
check out the camera and the Sony

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.570 
check out the camera and the Sony
cameras<00:05:42.289> are<00:05:42.440> generally<00:05:42.949> quite<00:05:43.610> good

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
cameras are generally quite good

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.040 
cameras are generally quite good
personally<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:46.610> prefer<00:05:46.729> the<00:05:47.240> Exmor<00:05:47.779> R<00:05:48.020> sensor

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
personally I prefer the Exmor R sensor

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.959 
personally I prefer the Exmor R sensor
more<00:05:48.710> than<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.919> Exmor<00:05:49.340> RS<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:50.830> I<00:05:51.969> explained

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
more than the Exmor RS and I explained

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.300 
more than the Exmor RS and I explained
that<00:05:53.090> in<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.330> separate<00:05:53.750> dedicated<00:05:53.900> video<00:05:54.560> it's

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
that in a separate dedicated video it's

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.749 
that in a separate dedicated video it's
fast<00:05:56.210> enough<00:05:56.389> you<00:05:56.630> can<00:05:56.779> see<00:05:56.960> although<00:05:57.199> not<00:05:58.159> 0

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
fast enough you can see although not 0

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
and then that's the front camera which

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.769 
and then that's the front camera which
is<00:06:05.090> not<00:06:05.479> very<00:06:05.840> dark<00:06:06.349> and<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:08.270> best<00:06:08.509> thing<00:06:08.659> it

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
is not very dark and the best thing it

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.749 
is not very dark and the best thing it

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
does not lag at all it's a real-time

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.050 
does not lag at all it's a real-time
that's<00:06:11.650> really<00:06:12.650> cool<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:12.979> 5mp<00:06:13.370> it<00:06:13.550> has<00:06:13.699> enough

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
that's really cool the 5mp it has enough

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.010 
that's really cool the 5mp it has enough
resolution

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
enough enough camera we'll probably try

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.370 
enough enough camera we'll probably try
to<00:06:24.280> take<00:06:24.580> some<00:06:24.790> image<00:06:25.180> and<00:06:25.360> video<00:06:25.750> sample<00:06:26.200> to

to take some image and video sample to

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.010 
to take some image and video sample to
show<00:06:26.590> you<00:06:26.650> how<00:06:26.950> it<00:06:27.100> goes<00:06:27.370> and<00:06:27.880> let's<00:06:28.600> start<00:06:28.900> the

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
show you how it goes and let's start the

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:42.999 
show you how it goes and let's start the
video<00:06:29.200> and<00:06:29.410> see<00:06:29.800> how<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:30.070> autofocus<00:06:30.610> performs

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.929 

what<00:06:43.699> a<00:06:43.729> focus<00:06:44.059> is<00:06:44.180> slow<00:06:44.479> to<00:06:44.779> log<00:06:44.990> but<00:06:45.319> it's<00:06:45.939> not

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
what a focus is slow to log but it's not

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:51.670 
what a focus is slow to log but it's not

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.379 
a legit slogging and yeah good enough I
guess<00:06:51.830> but<00:06:51.949> there<00:06:52.159> is<00:06:52.249> slight<00:06:52.490> lead

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
guess but there is slight lead

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.450 
guess but there is slight lead
and<00:06:53.659> because<00:06:54.559> the<00:06:54.710> CMOS<00:06:55.099> sensor<00:06:57.039> you<00:06:58.039> see<00:06:58.279> the

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
and because the CMOS sensor you see the

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.469 
and because the CMOS sensor you see the
art<00:06:58.789> our<00:06:58.999> bending<00:06:59.360> they're<00:06:59.719> just<00:07:00.050> a<00:07:00.169> tad<00:07:00.379> bit

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
art our bending they're just a tad bit

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:03.639 
art our bending they're just a tad bit
so<00:07:02.479> you're<00:07:02.569> gonna<00:07:02.659> go<00:07:02.869> bone<00:07:03.110> deep<00:07:03.319> into<00:07:03.559> the

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:03.649 
so you're gonna go bone deep into the

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:05.499 
so you're gonna go bone deep into the
camera<00:07:04.039> performance<00:07:04.490> of<00:07:04.699> course<00:07:04.849> for<00:07:05.119> you<00:07:05.210> and

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
camera performance of course for you and

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.959 
camera performance of course for you and
then<00:07:06.080> you<00:07:06.199> have<00:07:06.490> different<00:07:07.490> shooting<00:07:07.939> modes

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:07.969 
then you have different shooting modes

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.109 
then you have different shooting modes
there<00:07:08.419> enough<00:07:08.899> modes<00:07:09.289> but<00:07:09.529> they're<00:07:09.740> no<00:07:10.119> 4k

00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:11.119 
there enough modes but they're no 4k

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:13.420 
there enough modes but they're no 4k
mode<00:07:11.569> here<00:07:11.779> so<00:07:11.899> you<00:07:11.990> cannot<00:07:12.259> shoot<00:07:12.529> 4k<00:07:12.889> videos

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
mode here so you cannot shoot 4k videos

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.980 
mode here so you cannot shoot 4k videos
you<00:07:14.059> have<00:07:14.089> arm<00:07:14.809> AR<00:07:15.379> then<00:07:15.710> manual<00:07:16.899> so<00:07:17.899> we're

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
you have arm AR then manual so we're

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.100 
you have arm AR then manual so we're
gonna<00:07:18.080> go<00:07:18.259> bone<00:07:18.499> deep<00:07:18.800> into<00:07:19.189> the<00:07:20.149> other<00:07:20.689> apps

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
gonna go bone deep into the other apps

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.529
