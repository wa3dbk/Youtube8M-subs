happy<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.110> obviously<00:02:34.320> last

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
happy with that is that obviously last

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.920 
happy with that is that obviously last
year<00:02:35.100> they<00:02:35.670> didn't<00:02:36.120> use<00:02:36.270> him<00:02:36.300> for<00:02:36.510> three

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
year they didn't use him for three

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.200 
year they didn't use him for three
months<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> year<00:02:37.620> he<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:38.760> off<00:02:38.880> television

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
months of the year he was off television

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.390 
months of the year he was off television
and<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.320> there's<00:02:40.530> no<00:02:40.710> way<00:02:40.890> he<00:02:41.130> could<00:02:41.370> have

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
and so there's no way he could have

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.460 
and so there's no way he could have
reached<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.970> same<00:02:42.150> amount<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.480> money<00:02:42.540> Latin

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
reached the same amount of money Latin

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.560 
reached the same amount of money Latin
the<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.950> year's<00:02:44.190> he<00:02:44.310> did<00:02:44.460> last<00:02:44.700> year<00:02:44.820> Roy

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the this year's he did last year Roy

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.140 
the this year's he did last year Roy
okay<00:02:45.780> or<00:02:46.170> at<00:02:46.380> least<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.830> would<00:02:47.700> seem<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.940> way

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
okay or at least it would seem that way

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
okay or at least it would seem that way
if<00:02:48.240> they<00:02:48.360> weren't<00:02:48.480> gonna<00:02:48.600> use<00:02:48.690> him<00:02:48.900> for<00:02:48.930> three

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
if they weren't gonna use him for three

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.300 
if they weren't gonna use him for three
months<00:02:49.380> because<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.770> obviously<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.190> would

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
months because just obviously that would

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.250 
months because just obviously that would
take<00:02:50.580> out<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> massive<00:02:50.970> load<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.450> dates<00:02:51.660> so

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
take out a massive load of the dates so

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.480 
take out a massive load of the dates so
it's<00:02:52.380> big<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.710> could<00:02:52.860> hide<00:02:53.070> him<00:02:53.220> out<00:02:53.340> to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
it's big and they could hide him out to

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.790 
it's big and they could hide him out to
the<00:02:53.580> Indies<00:02:53.910> now<00:02:54.330> if<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:54.780> TNA<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> have

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
what they've looked at it is probably a

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.800 
what they've looked at it is probably a
hard<00:04:38.639> choice<00:04:38.910> for<00:04:39.180> them<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.419> make<00:04:39.539> when<00:04:39.720> it

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
hard choice for them to make when it

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.270 
hard choice for them to make when it
