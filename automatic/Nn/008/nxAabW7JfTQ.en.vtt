00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
through the motions none of us knew that

through the motions none of us knew that
when<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.820> started<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.329> very<00:00:54.600> first<00:00:54.930> match

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

something<00:01:00.180> embedded<00:01:00.600> inside<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.079> us<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
something embedded inside of us that

just<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.790> happened<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.420> wasn't<00:01:09.810> any

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
just so happened that there wasn't any

matter<00:01:10.170> no<00:01:10.619> team<00:01:10.860> compilation<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.610> was

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
matter no team compilation that was

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
matter no team compilation that was
better<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.600> every<00:01:12.900> player<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.350> innocent

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
better because every player was innocent

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
better because every player was innocent
and<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.250> didn't<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> difference

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and we didn't know the difference

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
and we didn't know the difference
between<00:01:15.240> who<00:01:15.659> years

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
between who years

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.499

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
tech damage and a P so daily we see

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.880 
tech damage and a P so daily we see
people<00:01:18.869> failing<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.619> tried

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
somehow eventually after what seemed

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.499

like<00:01:34.229> an<00:01:34.619> eternity<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:35.670> had<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.270> game

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
like an eternity we had that one game

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.630 
like an eternity we had that one game
where<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.810> got<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.049> first<00:01:37.409> victory<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
where we got our first victory and it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.109 
where we got our first victory and it
made<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.180> worth<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:40.159> all<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> frustration

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
made it all worth it all the frustration

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.389 
made it all worth it all the frustration
the<00:01:42.330> lack<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> team<00:01:43.020> communication<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:44.039> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the lack of team communication all the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.770 
the lack of team communication all the
times<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.850> lost<00:01:44.970> our<00:01:45.210> patience

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
times we lost our patience

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.870 
times we lost our patience
because<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.500> one<00:01:47.770> victory<00:01:48.190> was<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> defining

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
because that one victory was a defining

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.030 
because that one victory was a defining
moment<00:01:49.090> signaling<00:01:50.080> that<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.350> had<00:01:50.530> improved

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
moment signaling that we had improved

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.820 
moment signaling that we had improved
and<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.120> save<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.540> every<00:01:52.750> second<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.200> it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
and we save it every second of it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.649 
and we save it every second of it
come<00:01:54.010> out<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.250> top<00:01:54.460> somehow

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
come out on top somehow

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.590 
come out on top somehow
now<00:01:56.109> the<00:01:56.619> batter<00:01:56.859> was

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.730 

we<00:02:01.600> were<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.049> happy<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:05.350> through<00:02:05.619> this

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
we were so happy but through this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.309 
we were so happy but through this
hardship<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:07.149> where<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.570> all<00:02:07.659> started

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
hardship is where it all started

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.280 
hardship is where it all started
even<00:02:09.069> now<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.310> can't<00:02:09.729> grasp<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.269> because<00:02:11.170> I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
even now I can't grasp it because I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.540 
even now I can't grasp it because I
don't<00:02:11.349> know<00:02:11.530> where<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:11.920> went<00:02:12.040> wrong<00:02:12.190> but

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
don't know where we went wrong but

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.640 
don't know where we went wrong but
somewhere<00:02:12.940> along<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.360> line<00:02:13.569> we<00:02:13.840> decided<00:02:14.530> that

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
somewhere along the line we decided that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.350 
somewhere along the line we decided that
scoring<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.190> win<00:02:15.220> was<00:02:15.700> more<00:02:15.910> important<00:02:16.330> than

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
scoring a win was more important than

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.080 
scoring a win was more important than
our<00:02:16.569> teammates<00:02:17.340> playing<00:02:18.340> this<00:02:18.489> game<00:02:18.790> went

our teammates playing this game went

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.789 
our teammates playing this game went
from<00:02:19.239> being<00:02:19.480> an<00:02:19.599> uphill<00:02:19.900> struggle<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.410> improve

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
from being an uphill struggle to improve

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.630 
from being an uphill struggle to improve
to<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.310> downhill<00:02:21.670> spiral<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.480> abuse<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:24.400> what
