00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 I went how are you, that's for sure. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.359
 I changed the little screen of the other and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.799
 40 minutes by putting to the kitchen 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.599
 only when I went to see what the leg 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.429
 wrong and this one was up to that 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.860
 to do again is minute work 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.670
 I think I can be a surgeon who 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.170
 I'm not 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.960
 if anyone needs and then do 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.420
 I know very short robots robots robots 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.490
 robocop giants and I already told 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 describe the robocop when the child 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.390
 was designed since the congress 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 still I got there and spent too 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.719
 like the enemy of robocop wants 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.340
 to discuss a new leap that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 fear and also have a certain admiration 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.649
 by tis things kind of tractors 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 genre for me tractor and crane these 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.430
 things are closer to the mech is that the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 people can get there and have an arm 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.360
 and gang that can destroy with him the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.550
 building in the event that we had 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.410
 world cup debut and it was there 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 working and I was very excited 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.579
 to see the skeleton that was the face that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.899
 have physical disability 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.270
 paraplegic 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.120
 take a few steps kick the ball beauty type 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.309
 promised 30 seconds to show nine 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 stuff like that and it's everywhere 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.210
 complaining about it and had little time 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.070
 On TV, I should also have the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.860
 first time only on guy type giving the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 steps and showing everywhere and have 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.150
 some people complaining and not complaining 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.310
 not only of this kind complaining talking 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.380
 so bitch but I did played very 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.080
 better out of brazil than this detail 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 robot was made by a Brazilian in the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.590
 search all Brazilian and everything else 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.360
 a million of an interview for the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 national newspaper and complained about the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.130
 They had also separated for him as he 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.049
 was the following I will read that fifa in 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 informed that we have 29 seconds to 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.799
 carry out the experiment very difficult 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.479
 no one has ever demonstrated and 29 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.490
 robot seconds this does not exist instead 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.229
 none of the world with dramatic effort 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 all the people that are here we 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 We did 16 seconds good. 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.530
 cool it looks like there's no way you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.509
 criticize this kind of thing but the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 people will get it and talk like that because 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.009
 had better projects outside the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.509
 Brazil complained about the short robot space 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.579
 God only forgot that in fact a 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.229
 Robot who took steps was a guy who kind 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.820
 I had no movement of the legs 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.069
 finally there were many people criticizing the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.020
 fact that this guy did it for 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.920
 many sinister motives in fact I 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.080
 I think it's because he got 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.819
 the government or because it supports the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.500
 somehow because he got the 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.230
 sponsorship of other things I do not know 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.280
 exactly what is more basically me 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.830
 I do not think people understand how 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.110
 does scientific research work all this? 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.030
 It's very expensive to do and there are people 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.520
 so ah no because it's because chips that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.160
 control nature search for the brain already 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.110
 It's been a long time no matter if it exists 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.630
 long ago the last person who made a 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.519
 paraplegic walking was jesus mano and from there 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.709
 when the guy goes there and makes a robot that 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.540
 It makes a guy who can not walk 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.430
 people complain about the steps that you 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.260
 gave what had people on the side 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.700
 holding for not falling for the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.860
 sides is one thing the guy who 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.080
 invented wheelchair will show the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.420
 wheelchair for the first time 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.220
 alex is not so expensive wheels already 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.230
 been used for a long time, this is a 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.000
 much older creation than this or 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.680
 when a guy who invented for you goes 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.569
 talk but fire has been around for a long time 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.519
 time scientific research takes 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.500
 long time they are a lot of money 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.630
 are very important and when they are 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.420
 Made in Brazil is very important to 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.069
 also because, after all, it's 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.680
 important for our country and we see 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.269
 here and a half that everything is important for the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.380
 country is important to you and that 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.239
 and we are living in a time when 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.190
 everyone has complained and protested 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.510
 mainly due to education and 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.489
 That's why you're talking like this not because I want to 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.670
 more education, Brazil has an education 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.049
 precarious brazil it has got several 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.359
 problems and everything else that can be 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.650
 resolved has not yet been resolved in 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.350
 It's true, I think it was for a long time. 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.180
 to solve everything else but you and have 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.980
 journalism education that I saw a 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.680
 matter in the newspaper complaining 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.120
 also people have all kinds of education 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.430
 they can complain with a 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.320
 Brazilian research is correct and it is 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.250
 shown at the beginning of the world cup 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.620
 It will be transmitted to Brazil. 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.060
 Yes, of course it was a little time 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.130
 but I think this much discussion 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.660
 near the grandiosity of the project 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.239
 so I think there's a problem 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.190
 fundamental place where people put the 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.440
 their energies to protest or any 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.420
 thing of the genre the protest that works 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.730
 When you complain about something to 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.620
 change them in bringing benefits and when 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.389
 Do you complain about something that brings you? 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.579
 benefits mainly people have 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.220
 physical disability and has placed 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.200
 lots of money and work over 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.599
 something that was made in Brazil that 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.440
 did not necessarily require sustained 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.450
 in 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.640
 engineers who harms you 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.800
 Who harms me? Who wrote me? 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.430
 that I'm not all of us here this is the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.200
 robot 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.790
 and it looks like the robot was not going to do so many 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.500
 things like that he was helping a 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.900
 person who had paralysis in the legs 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.150
 stand and kick a ball 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.980
 I 've never felt a kick in the ball he 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.690
 took two or three steps to kick this 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.880
 Ball matter importantly gave 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.890
 steps were always staff expected 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.140
 arrive a jetpack or if the staff 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.500
 I was waiting for him to run around the field. 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.120
 and the goal of the match was even 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.370
 a guy who had full conditions 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.650
 to make the first goal of the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.750
 he made against the people who need 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.690
 to support Brazilian scientific research 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.820
 mainly because it's good for 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.890
 people have such an idea starting with a 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.940
 friend of mine who does chemical engineering it 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.460
 said that most research 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.740
 sciences are made in his college 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.620
 are made only of cosmetics and because 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.780
 this is because nobody supports research 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.850
 here in Brazil so the 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.950
 the cosmetics industries they go there 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.110
 faculties and means that pay 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.640
 research material and everything else. 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.919
 the guys doing research to create 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.050
 as cosmetic for them then I go 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.000
 do a free search for him and 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.470
 hence the staff is complaining after 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.390
 no one gives support to anyone who 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.550
 Brazil has no education that does not have 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.950
 technology that other places are 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.200
 more cool because sweden always comes to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.270
 connected with the situation of a country 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.250
 invented to use as a joker in 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.620
 discussions to say that there is a 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.720
 place where kind of paradise then Brazil 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.270
 Sweden is not our technology is not 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.980
 as good as the Japanese but we are 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.690
 making a robot like that and even if that 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.770
 Robot throw missiles neither do I 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.480
 machine guns 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.100
 This is a very cool goal you should 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.050
 support this type of robot 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.510
 Looks there are also other robots yesterday to 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.910
 popcorn galley and the boston dynamics they 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.800
 make the robots very face fires but neither 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.840
 wanted robots they are made to come in 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.669
 other countries and the filter and kill 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.130
 Go there and take the things of others. 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.650
 not made to type lift a 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.360
 face that has no movement of the legs 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.160
 because it took one himself shot one 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.290
 another robot then the exterminator 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.630
 future giant robots that launched today 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.790
 They are legal in the game in the cinema in 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.770
 real life is very cool the robot that helps 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.710
 people to live better were it not for 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.690
 against a person 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.610
 which has difficulties to live better 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.920
 with lots of research and lots of money 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.660
 I spent a lot of time I think you 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.610
 Should I ask for a worse face, you do not deserve? 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.290
 and sincerely then once again I ask 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.360
 for you to support the prestige 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.920
 work of miguel nicolelis and also of 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.900
 other Brazilian scientists who will 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.670
 to appear around no matter what team 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.710
 How long has he been there? 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.960
 on the globe is much more important than 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.980
 appear on the globe is to keep searches 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.150
 and keep doing things 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.400
 happen 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.660
 it is logical that the robot will not be 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.880
 marketed from one hour to another and 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.080
 nor will it be too fast for more 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.360
 people can use this technology 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.850
 this technology can continue to be 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.470
 developed and it also needs the 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.020
 our support for people to continue to 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.820
 doing either to overthrow the government wants 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.220
 knock down people want to pass the leg 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.200
 in others it does what you want but not 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.520
 be a guy that will disrupt research 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.500
 does good for others 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.080
 type is not the head is pure evil 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.300
 cepro stupidity and stupidity that you 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.000
 disagrees with the year goes there and makes the agreement 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.520
 robot that makes a guy who on the floor that I 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.180
 I want to see serious start now let's see 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.180
 with the delay time
