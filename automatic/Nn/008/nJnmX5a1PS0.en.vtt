00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.610
 kids by madrid ' 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.580
 we have cloudy, that is, there is a high 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.020
 atmospheric pressure what the fuck 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 there is yes sir is that with this well with 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 this pole of the micro that the micro by 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.519
 true they have brought me today I hope that they 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.260
 listen to all debut and pukki and all this 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.079
 is that it is worth entering a prebenefits 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.610
 by the way this is not true 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.960
 obviously good time every time 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.020
 that we see on TV I think it's 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 a little bull is a bit of monger there 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.370
 because they tell you that there will be rains and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.039
 then it does not rain then when they say that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.719
 It's sunny then it's good but 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.730
 well this was a little bit of the joke 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.210
 but good what is not of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.760
 eight hours is here we have it fence 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.879
 mountainous mountain ranges that we have for 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.090
 here these are well-armed mountain ranges 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.580
 and the rest is nonsense so nations 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.110
 and now comes a video of Colosio IT 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.270

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.760
 liked that you like better said enduro 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.380
 with equipment and nothing to lay a video if 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.150
 you have liked I am eating the truth 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 and well it is put in the comments 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.650
 if you want your city to appear 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 our country and in the next video 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.430
 Well, we'll look to see how we can 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.670
 do and if you have ideas out there because 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.670
 you know tell me what we see table 1 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.170
 rubina is the truncate which one you stay 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.700
 good, we're already here we're going to 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.590
 see the game this I said that I 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.010
 has taken a tremendous streak and the truth 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.170
 is that I wear the sm1 that is very cool 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.790
 I have the screen and background again and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.650
 the truth is that I do not know what's happening in 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.080
 this game that the truth is that 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.880
 I gave out a lot or I felt and strong 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.920
 Well, I already said my beginnings are not 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.290
 very good then good pineapple 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.990
 a little bit everything has to be said but I 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.240
 It's really cool over I'm good 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.190
 this camouflage 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.230
 certainly the camouflage of champions of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.050
 with champions and all the history that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.300
 He's very, very handsome, and you'll see 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.610
 I mean , I started it little by little 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.380
 little bit because of course here on this map of 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.290
 Well, when it 's a team duel 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.120
 obviously they are more in the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.100
 center can move you a little bit 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.050
 the surroundings a little bit cut a 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.350
 little for paschal but always 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.300
 the tomato will always go to the center not and 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.239
 as I told you before I took a 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.190
 very pretty streak I hope you mole and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.160
 nothing therefore I know with this soul that 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.070
 kill a lot I tried the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.470
 3 It seems to me that if I do not confuse that 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.440
 you know that I am a little bit for everything to 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.720
 these things and it goes very well very well what 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.030
 only good because obviously what 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.160
 cool for being the insane the 6 of anita 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.230
 I've seen the comments that by the way 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.780
 thank you very much everyone for the support 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.850
 that I have had opening the boxes and I 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.220
 they gave me the five boxes that I was missing 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.110
 the only thing that in the end I said that I'm going to 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.320
 make a video by opening five boxes 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.180
 because a bonus or six was nonsense 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.860
 then for joaquin and directly then 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.540
 the open did not touch me a shit 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.360

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.610

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.680
 kids is what he touches or is the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.030
 advanced supplies was lost and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.340
 there was also a comment from chávez 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.100
 there was a comment that I liked a lot 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.380
 because it said my mother says as a means 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.080
 of the people who spend a pasture on 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.620
 attentive supplies is spent a 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.500
 pasture in supplies and well then the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.960
 game ends this year or this year to 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.030
 take it through I'm looking at it that way 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.400
 I just have the camera in the middle and 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.160

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.450

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.760

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.100

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.740
 saying and then we spent the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.630
 Bundle of supplies for the 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.750
 mining structure of sticking a stick to 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.280
 minute that is that you touch a good weapon 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.250
 Well, you can say, come, come, come 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.470
 this is fine I know but then it is already a 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.330
 gas so tremendous and it touches us and a 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.490
 sputtering that is acojonante 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.050
 but good for tastes colors you know 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.160

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.010
 It is really cool that I was going to comment on a 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.449
 important thing is that I've seen that 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.120
 you said in the comments 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.029
 the truth that I caught a little bit this 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.819
 a little bit, that is, I have taken a 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:08.159
 video the other day on Sunday in the most 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.879
 far yesterday I made a video doing a 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:14.039
 draw for a mobile is worth then I hope 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.050

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.150
 this of the chroma thing little by little 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.809

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.759
 come here let's go that is already done defects 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:28.439
 to do everything of such interest then 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.169
 Well, people said he complained 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:33.330
 a little bit because the table then hey 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.610
 had as well as the edges a little bit 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.779
 until it had faded a little 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.539
 you do not want to because that whole room 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.279
 look here they just kill me since I was 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.680
 a tremendous breed the truth is 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:47.460
 beautiful and good I think it 's killing 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.499
 with gusts 10 10 and 9 if I do not get confused or 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.080
 be with almost a streak of 20 that is 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:54.899
 very, very cool, why pink 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.180
 the line that is fake said or like 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.949
 it can be how you can unlock is that 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.930
 he swelled them he turns around and 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.729
 mastery of killing with the same bullets 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.559
 killed me I do not matter but good 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.569
 I hope you have a week already 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:11.849
 you know starts with time, that is, what 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.930
 seen how smart it starts with the 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.419
 time that we have already seen the time 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.240
 before you are a lie or long ago 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.270
 sun at least around here and I think not 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.279
 for mexico no but for chile argentina and 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.969
 out there I think that right now you're 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.199
 going into winter does not have to be 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.819
 autumn 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.979
 So, as you are in others 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.499
 hemispheres I think it's something like that 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.539
 but I confuse myself good and see in the 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:38.849
 comments out there already tells me jce 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.689

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.719
 because it has been very good that in 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.169
 Uruguay and I also hope that I have 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:57.320
 obviously liked the nonsense 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.660
