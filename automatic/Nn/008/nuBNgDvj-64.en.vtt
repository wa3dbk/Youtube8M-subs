and<00:00:04.259> so<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.710> use<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.130> we<00:00:05.730> monitor<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.089> lot<00:00:06.180> of

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
and so we use a we monitor a lot of

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.120 
and so we use a we monitor a lot of
clean<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:06.990> gives<00:00:07.170> us<00:00:07.290> great<00:00:07.529> feedback<00:00:07.710> on

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
clean and it gives us great feedback on

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.459 
clean and it gives us great feedback on
a<00:00:08.189> volume<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.970> an<00:00:09.389> intensity<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.050> guys<00:00:10.260> have

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
a volume and an intensity that guys have

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.770 
a volume and an intensity that guys have
trained<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.120> so<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.179> look<00:00:12.330> at<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> number<00:00:12.570> of

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
trained that so we look at a number of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.680 
trained that so we look at a number of
things<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.080> number<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.469> accelerations

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
things a number of accelerations

the<00:00:19.500> video<00:00:19.740> zones<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.310> try<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.520> use<00:00:20.609> that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the video zones and we try and use that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.179 
the video zones and we try and use that
to<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:22.020> basically<00:00:22.109> plan<00:00:22.560> our<00:00:22.710> weeks<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.100> me

work really hard off the ball and you
know<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.050> still<00:00:58.649> covering<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
know if you know you still covering a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
know if you know you still covering a
few<00:00:59.219> miles<00:00:59.460> you'd<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.300> you're<00:01:00.449> adding

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
few miles you'd you know you're adding

always making line breaks and score at
Rises<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.460> still<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.600> you're<00:01:06.689> doing

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
Rises is still a lot that you're doing

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.830 
Rises is still a lot that you're doing
on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> pack<00:01:07.909> it's<00:01:08.909> been<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.270> good<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
on the pack it's been pretty good like a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800 
on the pack it's been pretty good like a
good<00:01:10.520> good<00:01:11.520> monitor<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> last

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
good good monitor to you know the last

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780 
good good monitor to you know the last
couple<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.200> times<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.310> how<00:01:14.460> how

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
couple of times I want to see how how

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.910 
couple of times I want to see how how
many<00:01:14.970> kg<00:01:15.180> clocked<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.890> our

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
many kg clocked up and it's good for our

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.399 
many kg clocked up and it's good for our
recovery<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.299> see<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.960> know

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
recovery I think like I see you know

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
recovery I think like I see you know
what<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.710> body's<00:01:19.979> been<00:01:20.159> under<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.180> stress

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
what your body's been under the stress

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
what your body's been under the stress
of<00:01:21.479> spring<00:01:21.750> under<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.200> gives<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> about

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
of spring under so that gives you about

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.870 
of spring under so that gives you about
you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.500> idea<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> do

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you know idea you know how what to do

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.670 
you know idea you know how what to do
for<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> next<00:01:27.360> couple<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.689> days<00:01:27.810> after<00:01:28.049> after

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
for the next couple of days after after

for the next couple of days after after
going<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.250> sure<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.880> recover<00:01:30.210> the

the<00:01:41.170> week<00:01:41.380> we'll<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.860> look<00:01:41.980> at<00:01:42.070> total

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
the week we'll just look at total

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.090 
the week we'll just look at total
distance<00:01:43.080> high-intensity<00:01:44.080> distance<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.770> 15

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
distance high-intensity distance of a 15

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.680 
distance high-intensity distance of a 15
kilometers<00:01:45.460> now<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:46.330> will<00:01:46.420> give<00:01:46.540> us<00:01:46.570> a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
kilometers now that will give us a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.270 
kilometers now that will give us a
reasonably<00:01:47.110> good<00:01:47.140> gauge<00:01:47.470> as<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.770> who's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
reasonably good gauge as to who's

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.490 
reasonably good gauge as to who's
experiencing<00:01:48.790> what<00:01:48.970> type<00:01:49.120> of<00:01:49.270> load<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.750> then

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
experiencing what type of load and then

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.260 
experiencing what type of load and then
from<00:01:51.250> there<00:01:51.460> we'll<00:01:51.580> just<00:01:51.790> look<00:01:51.910> at<00:01:52.000> number<00:01:52.210> of

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
from there we'll just look at number of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.730 
from there we'll just look at number of
Sprint's<00:01:52.690> across<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.140> week<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.650> actually

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
Sprint's across the week and actually

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.320 
Sprint's across the week and actually
just<00:01:54.130> check<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.700> concert<00:01:55.000> each<00:01:55.090> guys

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
just check the concert each guys

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
individual determine span are they

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.770 
individual determine span are they
getting<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.670> required<00:01:58.000> Sprint<00:01:58.360> stimulus

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780

covering the most distance so with the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.280 
covering the most distance so with the
use<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.270> things<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.660> Google<00:02:25.959> map<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
use of things like the Google map you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.170 
use of things like the Google map you
can<00:02:26.470> see<00:02:26.739> pretty<00:02:26.920> quickly<00:02:27.130> who's<00:02:27.489> actually

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
