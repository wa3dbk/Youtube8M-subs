00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello live dmitry tatarinov 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.790
 the author of the blog ozon.ru 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.589
 in this video we will look at how fast 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.480
 increase site traffic from 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.679
 search engines using tools 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.080
 semrush 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.179
 This is the second lesson from the video series on how 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 quickly get targeted visitors and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.990
 launch sales using tools 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.270
 competitor analysis and 7rash 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.670
 to see the rest of the lessons on 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.670
 increase traffic click on link in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.280
 description under this video 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.529
 the smaller competing sites are 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.220
 in the search engine index for this or that 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.170
 other request 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.020
 the easier it is to get into the top 10 but 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.970
 take the time to get in under the TOP10 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.030
 keyword that is looking for 5 people per month 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.370
 it's not rational, but when we can 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.170
 find relevant big keyword 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.239
 the number of requests and small 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.699
 competition is another thing 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.710
 Now we look at how to quickly find 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.390
 these fat requests with minimal 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.449
 competition using semrush 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.300
 so get started you will need to visit 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.250
 authoritative site your niche for example in 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.250
 case as with my site my main 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.720
 the audience of this master and bloggers 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.780
 so popular blogs and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.210
 Forms of type who on a new hammer to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.040
 masters dot ru search engine dot ru 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.020
 or my wordpress dot ru 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 We are interested in sites with large 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.830
 number of pages 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.570
 large amount of traffic that occupy 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.500
 google positions for hundreds and thousands 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.070
 requests 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.840
 then run the report search results 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.810
 positions 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.030
 in 1 house of one of our reputable 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.179
 competitors search string select 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.020
 the desired country click search after this 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.509
 set the filter 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.700
 show keywords which 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.710
 the number of requests is more than a hundred 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.429
 number of competitive pages in 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.360
 google index 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.829
 less than 50 thousand if you wish you can 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.220
 increase or decrease filter values 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.230
 if you have a relatively new website 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.510
 then the value for the number of competitive 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.030
 pages can be reduced after that 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.890
 click apply filter 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.380
 the remaining keywords are fat 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.780
 requests with low competition under which 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.700
 having a website made for people and write 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.670
 good article you can easily 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.950
 go to the top10 agree that much 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.960
 easier to reach the first position under the request 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 with thirty thousand competitive 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.980
 pages than on request with a similar 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.090
 attendance and a million competitive 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.370
 pages 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.100
 don't forget that semrush collects 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.280
 google-only query statistics 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.080
 and you can easily double the numbers so 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.880
 as in Yandex this request is not looking 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.740
 fewer people 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.650
 if you are analyzing a major site 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.460
 a rival of hundreds of thousands and millions 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.930
 visitors 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.520
 then you may encounter large 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.070
 number of non-commercial requests 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.660
 which would be for most thematic 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.910
 the site will be uninteresting 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.920
 enough to get rid of them 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.560
 add another condition filter 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.600
 show keywords which 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.970
 cost per click in contextual advertising 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.000
 more than five cents if you wish you can 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.320
 increase the cost per click 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.600
 way you will only 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.490
 commercial requests for which people 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.970
 pay real money in context 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.950
 advertising 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.660
 and no one will pay money for 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.170
 advertising on demand which does not bring 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.970
 im money 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.000
