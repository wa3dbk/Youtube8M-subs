cloud two are effectively identical

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300 
cloud two are effectively identical
except<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.500> thing<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:16.980> this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
except for one thing and that is this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.939 
except for one thing and that is this
this<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.580> an<00:00:17.820> inline<00:00:18.300> DSP<00:00:18.930> or<00:00:19.170> digital<00:00:19.560> signal

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
this is an inline DSP or digital signal

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.609 
this is an inline DSP or digital signal
processor<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.300> responsible<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.230> one

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
processor and it is responsible of one

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.370 
processor and it is responsible of one
thing<00:00:22.859> all<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.670> does<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.150> switch<00:00:24.390> between<00:00:24.570> 7.1

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
thing all it does is switch between 7.1

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.220 
thing all it does is switch between 7.1
audio<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.949> normal<00:00:26.400> stereo<00:00:26.789> audio<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:28.050> will

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
audio and normal stereo audio so it will

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.160 
audio and normal stereo audio so it will
digitally<00:00:28.800> simulate<00:00:29.310> 7.1<00:00:30.000> channels<00:00:30.539> meaning

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
digitally simulate 7.1 channels meaning

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
digitally simulate 7.1 channels meaning
it's<00:00:31.230> only<00:00:31.439> got<00:00:31.560> two<00:00:31.769> drivers<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it's only got two drivers so it's not a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's only got two drivers so it's not a
physical<00:00:33.500> 7.1<00:00:34.500> setup<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:34.920> some<00:00:35.160> headsets<00:00:35.550> as

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
physical 7.1 setup like some headsets as

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
physical 7.1 setup like some headsets as
two<00:00:36.360> drivers<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.780> 53<00:00:37.290> millimeters<00:00:37.710> each

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
two drivers are 53 millimeters each

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.619 
two drivers are 53 millimeters each
pretty<00:00:38.370> large<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> headset<00:00:39.149> driver<00:00:39.390> most

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
pretty large for a headset driver most

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.190 
pretty large for a headset driver most
on<00:00:39.809> 10<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.079> 40<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.559> 50<00:00:40.860> millimeters<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:42.600> 7.1

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
on 10 be 40 or 50 millimeters and in 7.1

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.950 
on 10 be 40 or 50 millimeters and in 7.1
mode<00:00:43.530> it'll<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:43.940> process<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> signal<00:00:45.480> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
mode it'll just process the signal so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.709 
mode it'll just process the signal so
that<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.440> games<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.980> tell<00:00:47.190> sort<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
that in your games you can tell sort of

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
that in your games you can tell sort of
diagonally<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.750> even<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:50.010> down<00:00:50.219> left<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
diagonally or even just up down left and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.979 
diagonally or even just up down left and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
right where your enemies are so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389

gamecom 780 in terms of comfort I do
prefer<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.660> 780<00:02:51.080> because<00:02:51.350> it's<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> bit

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the correct ear cups so you can tell

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.330 
the correct ear cups so you can tell
where<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.090> enemy<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.350> it's<00:03:30.860> not<00:03:31.040> as

HyperX cloud 2 overall I'm very happy

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.039 
HyperX cloud 2 overall I'm very happy
with<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.400> portability<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.090> how<00:03:38.540> easy<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.989> is

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
with the portability and how easy it is

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.900 
with the portability and how easy it is
to<00:03:39.110> transport<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.890> keep<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.250> protected<00:03:40.370> I'm

to transport and keep it protected I'm

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.759 
to transport and keep it protected I'm
happy<00:03:41.390> with<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.720> fact<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:42.290> using<00:03:42.709> a

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
happy with the fact that it is using a

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.069 
happy with the fact that it is using a
3.5<00:03:43.459> millimeter<00:03:43.489> jack<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.390> really<00:03:44.870> don't<00:03:45.019> like

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
3.5 millimeter jack I really don't like

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.319 
3.5 millimeter jack I really don't like
USB<00:03:45.410> but<00:03:46.010> if<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.160> plug<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.519> into<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.790> DSP<00:03:47.180> then

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
USB but if you plug it into the DSP then

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.759 
USB but if you plug it into the DSP then
it<00:03:47.420> switches<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.750> USB<00:03:48.019> because<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.650> now

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
it switches to USB because it is now

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.890 
it switches to USB because it is now
processing<00:03:49.070> all<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.700> audio<00:03:49.940> on<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.269> DSP<00:03:50.720> and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
processing all the audio on the DSP and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.069 
processing all the audio on the DSP and
doing<00:03:51.530> 7.1<00:03:52.130> conversion<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.120> if<00:03:53.600> you're<00:03:53.840> gaming

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
doing 7.1 conversion so if you're gaming

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.509 
doing 7.1 conversion so if you're gaming
this<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.739> pretty<00:03:54.920> good<00:03:54.980> for<00:03:55.100> counter-strike

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
this is pretty good for counter-strike

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.190 
this is pretty good for counter-strike
for<00:03:55.880> battlefield<00:03:56.360> for<00:03:56.570> Skyrim<00:03:56.900> things<00:03:57.049> like

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
for battlefield for Skyrim things like

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.560 
for battlefield for Skyrim things like
that<00:03:57.380> but<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.070> really<00:03:58.280> will<00:03:58.610> want<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:59.150> better

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
that but you really will want a better

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.690 
that but you really will want a better
or<00:03:59.900> an<00:04:00.200> aftermarket<00:04:00.680> microphone<00:04:01.250> because<00:04:01.400> the

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
or an aftermarket microphone because the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.400 
or an aftermarket microphone because the
quality<00:04:02.090> is<00:04:02.329> pretty<00:04:02.480> poor<00:04:02.780> it's<00:04:03.200> good<00:04:03.380> enough

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
quality is pretty poor it's good enough

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.900 
quality is pretty poor it's good enough
to<00:04:03.620> get<00:04:03.739> you<00:04:03.860> through<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:04.040> game<00:04:04.250> not<00:04:04.700> good

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
to get you through a game not good

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.400 
to get you through a game not good
enough<00:04:05.090> for<00:04:05.239> streaming<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:05.660> youtubing<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.260> if

enough for streaming and youtubing so if

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.990 
enough for streaming and youtubing so if
you<00:04:06.530> are<00:04:06.650> one<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.860> those<00:04:06.920> people<00:04:06.980> do<00:04:07.519> not<00:04:07.670> use

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
you are one of those people do not use
