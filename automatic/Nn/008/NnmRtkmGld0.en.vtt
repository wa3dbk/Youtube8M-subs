great in Calgary but I don't think it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770

wrong<00:00:47.160> again<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:47.520> would<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:48.239> very<00:00:48.270> good<00:00:48.629> in

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
wrong again they would do very good in

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.740 
wrong again they would do very good in
vicksburg<00:00:49.489> ensure<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.239> were<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.600> move

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

vicksburg ensure if they were to move
Afghani<00:00:52.170> milk<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.680> could<00:00:52.860> move<00:00:53.039> up

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
Afghani milk and they could move up

Jordan Staal the second line center

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.610 
Jordan Staal the second line center
Crosby<00:00:57.180> would<00:00:57.360> finally<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.960> his<00:00:58.230> wingman

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
Crosby would finally have his wingman

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.170 
Crosby would finally have his wingman
because<00:00:58.949> he<00:00:59.100> really<00:00:59.309> doesn't<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.760> wingman

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
because he really doesn't have a wingman

because he really doesn't have a wingman
and<00:01:00.390> Chris<00:01:00.539> Kunitz<00:01:00.870> Crosby<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.949> low

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and Chris Kunitz Crosby and get low

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
and Chris Kunitz Crosby and get low
would<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> dangerous<00:01:02.940> combination<00:01:03.680> but

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
would be a dangerous combination but

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.679 
would be a dangerous combination but
mulliken<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.400> said<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.939> his<00:01:06.090> early<00:01:06.180> 20s

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and Iginla is 33 so i don't i don't know

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.149 
and Iginla is 33 so i don't i don't know
if<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.869> would<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> great<00:01:10.439> deal<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
if this would be a great deal because of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.820 
if this would be a great deal because of
the<00:01:11.430> age<00:01:11.549> factor<00:01:12.140> Jarome<00:01:13.140> Iginla<00:01:13.170> prolly<00:01:13.650> has

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the age factor Jarome Iginla prolly has

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.740 
the age factor Jarome Iginla prolly has
roughly<00:01:14.189> around<00:01:14.340> five<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.030> six<00:01:15.270> years<00:01:15.330> left

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
roughly around five to six years left

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.550 
roughly around five to six years left
Malkin<00:01:16.710> probably<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.759> roughly<00:01:18.560> fifteen

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
Malkin probably has roughly fifteen

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
Malkin probably has roughly fifteen
years<00:01:19.799> left<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.280> mean<00:01:20.670> sure<00:01:20.880> having<00:01:21.270> again<00:01:21.450> them

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
years left I mean sure having again them

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
years left I mean sure having again them
would<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.810> great<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> couple<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.530> years<00:01:22.590> but

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
would be great for a couple of years but

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.609 
would be great for a couple of years but
his<00:01:23.729> lots<00:01:24.000> three<00:01:24.330> seasons<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:25.140> including<00:01:25.560> the

last<00:01:32.340> year<00:01:32.610> 69<00:01:33.180> points<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.689> he's<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.140> been

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
last year 69 points so he's really been

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
last year 69 points so he's really been
dropping<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.860> sure<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.610> great<00:01:35.790> with

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
dropping off sure he can do great with

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
dropping off sure he can do great with
Crosby<00:01:36.299> he's<00:01:36.479> struggling<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.079> year<00:01:37.140> though

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
Crosby he's struggling this year though

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.039 
Crosby he's struggling this year though
not<00:01:38.220> Crosby<00:01:38.640> Iginla<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.450> struggling<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
not Crosby Iginla is struggling this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.810 
not Crosby Iginla is struggling this
year<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.610> would

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
year and I just don't think that would

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060 
year and I just don't think that would
be<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> great<00:01:42.240> move<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.659> Penguins<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.259> mean

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
be a great move for the Penguins I mean

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.840 
be a great move for the Penguins I mean
I'm<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.189> saying<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> happen

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
I'm not saying this is going to happen

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
I'm not saying this is going to happen
but<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> mean<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> lot<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.960> people<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.380> talking

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
but I mean a lot of people are talking

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
but I mean a lot of people are talking
about<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.340> guess<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> would<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:48.090> sense

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
about it and I guess it would make sense

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.450 
about it and I guess it would make sense
because<00:01:48.390> Jay<00:01:48.810> Feaster<00:01:49.250> definitely<00:01:50.250> wants<00:01:50.399> to

because Jay Feaster definitely wants to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.069 
because Jay Feaster definitely wants to
make<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> big<00:01:50.850> splash<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> he's<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> new
