00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
like resolution really really low it's

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.200 
like resolution really really low it's
like<00:05:24.789> 170<00:05:25.660> bites<00:05:25.930> I<00:05:26.310> don't<00:05:27.310> 170<00:05:27.850> I<00:05:27.910> don't

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
really know but it's really low and this

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.860

is<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.150> hotter<00:05:32.250> game<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.610> upscale<00:05:34.060> properly<00:05:34.690> and

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
is a hotter game to upscale properly and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.860 
is a hotter game to upscale properly and
