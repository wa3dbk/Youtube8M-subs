I understand but I think that when you
let<00:03:51.730> kids<00:03:52.209> especially<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:53.049> access<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.590> each

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
let kids especially have access to each

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.069 
let kids especially have access to each
other<00:03:53.860> without<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.970> know<00:03:55.120> without<00:03:55.480> having

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
other without you know without having

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.229 
other without you know without having
without<00:03:56.560> with<00:03:57.010> being<00:03:57.340> able<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.670> be<00:03:57.760> anonymous

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
without with being able to be anonymous

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.750 
without with being able to be anonymous
and<00:03:58.420> being<00:03:59.200> like<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.709> shitty<00:04:00.100> teenager<00:04:00.549> because

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
we literally couldn't get out of a room

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.970 
we literally couldn't get out of a room
we<00:04:43.690> were<00:04:43.840> laughing<00:04:44.020> hysterically<00:04:44.650> because<00:04:44.860> we

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
we were laughing hysterically because we

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.800 
we were laughing hysterically because we
used<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.190> be<00:04:45.310> kings<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:46.000> now<00:04:46.330> we<00:04:46.390> were<00:04:46.570> getting

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
used to be kings and now we were getting

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.930 
used to be kings and now we were getting
abused<00:04:47.140> by<00:04:47.560> cool<00:04:47.920> not<00:04:48.160> know<00:04:48.340> there<00:04:48.610> is<00:04:48.730> a<00:04:48.880> key

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
abused by cool not know there is a key

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.310 
abused by cool not know there is a key
about<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.330> we<00:04:49.420> ended<00:04:49.600> up<00:04:49.660> going<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.140> store

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
about it we ended up going to the store

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.390 
about it we ended up going to the store
right<00:04:50.500> after<00:04:50.560> we<00:04:50.950> got<00:04:51.070> one<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.340> those

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
right after we got one of those

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400 
right after we got one of those
compilation<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.090> old<00:04:52.300> games<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:53.050> know<00:04:53.170> can

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
compilation of old games you know can

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.500 
compilation of old games you know can
weaken<00:04:53.680> day<00:04:53.800> anymore<00:04:53.980> but<00:04:54.310> can<00:04:54.850> go<00:04:55.000> simulate

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
weaken day anymore but can go simulate

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.030 
weaken day anymore but can go simulate
my<00:04:55.630> point<00:04:55.870> is<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.020> it<00:04:56.410> may<00:04:56.680> be<00:04:56.710> his

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
my point is that it may be his

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.520 
my point is that it may be his
ten-year-old<00:04:57.520> son's<00:04:57.940> brain<00:04:58.360> actually<00:04:58.810> is

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
ten-year-old son's brain actually is

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.220 
ten-year-old son's brain actually is
able<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.370> it's<00:05:01.270> more<00:05:01.480> sophisticated<00:05:01.690> and

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
able to it's more sophisticated and

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.320 
able to it's more sophisticated and
evolved<00:05:02.560> quicker<00:05:03.010> because<00:05:03.430> his<00:05:03.790> baseline

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
evolved quicker because his baseline

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.750 
evolved quicker because his baseline
he's<00:05:04.750> starting<00:05:05.260> in<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.410> 3d<00:05:05.800> world<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.370> who

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
he's starting in a 3d world and who

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.760 
he's starting in a 3d world and who
knows<00:05:06.940> what<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.210> will<00:05:07.540> lead<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.750> I<00:05:08.050> mean<00:05:08.560> we

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
knows what that will lead to I mean we

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.250 
knows what that will lead to I mean we
know<00:05:08.920> we<00:05:09.730> don't<00:05:09.850> know<00:05:10.060> but<00:05:10.330> here<00:05:11.110> the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
know we don't know but here the

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.540 
know we don't know but here the
percentages<00:05:11.620> of<00:05:11.710> our<00:05:11.830> brain<00:05:12.040> we<00:05:12.160> actually<00:05:12.460> use

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
percentages of our brain we actually use

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.240 
percentages of our brain we actually use
which<00:05:12.700> is<00:05:12.850> minuscule<00:05:13.450> and<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.740> I<00:05:14.770> we're<00:05:15.160> gonna

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
which is minuscule and so I we're gonna

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.950 
which is minuscule and so I we're gonna
go<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.940> other<00:05:16.060> reference<00:05:16.810> my

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
go to the other reference my

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.750 
go to the other reference my
two-year-old<00:05:17.290> son<00:05:17.560> he's<00:05:17.890> got<00:05:18.070> an<00:05:18.160> ipad<00:05:18.550> and
