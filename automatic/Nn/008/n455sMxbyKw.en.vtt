 hello everyone in this new video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.629
 tutorial I will teach you how to pair 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.040
 horses is very simple and easy then 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.970
 what we have to do is put the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.970
 two large horses 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.950
 first of all is to see saddle 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.950
 good everything is 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.490
 domesticate them is the coso 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.469
 they do not have to want 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.469
 note 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.980
 we put the saddle when it is 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.630
 our 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.890
 in the showing is necessary only 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.070
 we can take out 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.230
 and you get off now let's go to the other 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.160
 horse 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.030
 not domesticated 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 to the horse 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.690
 and want 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.700
 and well let's hope that there is a 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.700
 sticker and want us 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.000
 a horse is ready now we can not 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 go down and we have to have an apple 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.870
 golden and we do this there we are going to 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.420
 this horse and the other horse so that 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.420
 they are far near almost everything 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.900
 just as they do now this works 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.960
 and the son came out believe me 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.180
 and to feed them we need to bring 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.760
 wheat 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 and do this now we go once to the 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.180
 fret 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.170

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.570

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.280
 and a ladder we can feed him 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.760
 to the historian to eat and let's see 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.760
