imagine<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.050> patient<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:28.800> do

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
imagine this is the patient but how do

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.020 
imagine this is the patient but how do
we<00:00:28.949> get<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.660> stage<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.650> take

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
we get there to the stage or I can take

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
we get there to the stage or I can take
mr.<00:00:33.030> crow<00:00:33.210> put<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.630> something<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.739> mold<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
mr. crow put it in something on mold and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.119 
mr. crow put it in something on mold and
then<00:00:35.309> put<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.640> onto<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> patient's<00:00:37.129> interleaf

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
then put it onto the patient's interleaf

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.790 
then put it onto the patient's interleaf
what<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.489> use<00:00:38.640> putty<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.300> what<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.590> trick

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
what we use putty so what was the trick

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
what we use putty so what was the trick
that<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:41.010> taught<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> me<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.780> take<00:00:42.809> some

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that was taught to me was to take some

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
that was taught to me was to take some
putty<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:46.460> when<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> used<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
putty and it's when I used to do this I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.560 
putty and it's when I used to do this I
used<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.840> seams<00:00:49.230> all<00:00:49.530> over<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> place<00:00:50.570> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
used to get seams all over the place and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
used to get seams all over the place and
cross<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> set

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
cross it on a set

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.020 
cross it on a set
showed<00:00:54.270> me<00:00:55.940> she<00:00:58.190> showed<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.340> technique<00:00:59.789> how

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
showed me she showed me a technique how

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.220 
showed me she showed me a technique how
to<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.050> when

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to do this so you can do this when

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.149 
to do this so you can do this when
you're<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:02.340> put<00:01:02.489> duplicating<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> tooth<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.159> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you're to put duplicating a tooth for in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.719 
you're to put duplicating a tooth for in
putty<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:07.260> make<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> provisional<00:01:08.159> restoration

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729

inhibit the set of addition silicone so
that's<00:01:21.360> we're<00:01:21.509> using<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> what<00:01:23.610> she

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that's we're using here so what she

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.280 
that's we're using here so what she
taught<00:01:24.030> me<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:25.229> too

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
taught me and I think I have way too

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.660 
taught me and I think I have way too
much<00:01:25.820> in<00:01:26.820> any<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.630> any<00:01:27.689> event<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.520> roll<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
much in any in any event was to roll it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330 
much in any in any event was to roll it
like<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.470> she<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.710> didn't<00:01:32.189> get

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
like that and how she got didn't get

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.990 
like that and how she got didn't get
these<00:01:32.490> seams<00:01:32.909> was<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.689> place<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> don't

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
these seams was to place it so don't

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.630 
these seams was to place it so don't
have<00:01:36.150> any<00:01:36.299> seams<00:01:36.540> when<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> first<00:01:37.049> start

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
have any seams when you first start

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.609 
have any seams when you first start
place<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.850> where<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.329> need<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.259> roll

roll<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.420> over<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.950> teeth<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.880> portions

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
roll it over the teeth and the portions

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.779 
roll it over the teeth and the portions
to<00:01:49.450> cast<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.990> want<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:51.429> capture

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
to cast that you want to capture

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.359 
to cast that you want to capture
accurately<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:53.409> way<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.619> know<00:01:53.829> Kenny<00:01:54.100> seems

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
accurately that way you know Kenny seems

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.130 
accurately that way you know Kenny seems
because<00:01:55.000> what<00:01:55.329> I<00:01:55.360> was<00:01:55.479> doing<00:01:55.719> before<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:56.079> just

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
because what I was doing before is just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.980 
because what I was doing before is just
sort<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.439> putting<00:01:56.649> it<00:01:56.799> on<00:01:56.920> there<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.780> was

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
sort of putting it on there and that was

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.389 
sort of putting it on there and that was
that<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:01.060> right<00:02:01.119> so<00:02:01.329> that's<00:02:02.369> getting<00:02:03.369> a

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
that all right so that's getting a

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.130 
that all right so that's getting a
provisional<00:02:04.110> wrist<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.670> putty<00:02:06.670> matrix<00:02:07.209> for
