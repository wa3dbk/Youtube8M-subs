00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:10.950
 with so far down the thigh 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:12.599
 on our stomach and again and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.880
 today we are dedicated to the leg press 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.099
 once the rosenthal wine press and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.019
 once the vertical wine press a lot 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.640
 fun as with every exercise here too 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.890
 again the shoulder blades 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960
 nice back together chest out 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.749
 the kÃ¶b head just the upper body 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.969
 fills a beautiful line then 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:35.399
 let's position our legs first 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.859
 then comes to the lower edge after 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.570
 yet another variant, both the 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.339
 weight out keep us left and right 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.250
 Firmly press the body really nice 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.140
 down into the seat but into it 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.999
 Let's go down with the bavaria like that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.239
 as far as you need it 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.769
 is like kneeling so that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.690
 Maybe they were the best 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.859
 both vices tour like here with me 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.260
 already easily indicated 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.719
 we stretch both never quite by 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.309
 always slightly bent that way and then 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.339
 we can also do a second one 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.490
 Variantte would be the same with her 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.290
 the variant will be much higher 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.759
 we can only get that down so far 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.430
 The thighs are already in our stomach 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.219
 concerns and the variant goes more 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 the terios so on the ass muscle 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.920
 Months will be complete 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.540
 leg muscles then fix her weight 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.540
 again and applies first variant 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.060
 so the next variant is the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.729
 horizontal press here we put 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.640
 first the machine so that we 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.829
 have enough freedom of movement again 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.539
 hold down to push up 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.310
 we are I press the two too 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.740
 not entirely through that always stays 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.899
 very easy angle always look that 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.959
 you at least go down so far that 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.209
 her 45 degrees in the knees cushion bend 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.770
 then again the second variant we 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.380
 Place your feet up 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.349
 Here the exercise is also more on 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.759
 the leg biceps and the muscles 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.379
 Here we can do the machine a bit more 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.579
 put it down further so that we continue 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:06.110
 come down 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.720
 how will we get that far? 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.329
 down to our thigh bite the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.760
 Kathrin herself on our abdomen 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.319
 our body rests 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.090
 as I said not quite 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.569
 always stretched slightly at an angle 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.870
 to let 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.890
 These are the two herders of the leg press 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.890
 until next time 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.920
 and I have two videos for you again 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.549
 once up here my old belly legs 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.569
 training 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.859
 Maybe you can do that 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.409
 start to get inspired 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.659
 and she wanted a video underneath 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.469
 it explains how it with me with bonnie 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.430
 came together 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.430
 until the next show
