and Mike Wazowski figure Sulley here

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889 
and Mike Wazowski figure Sulley here
really<00:02:02.189> does<00:02:02.549> actually<00:02:03.030> kind<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.329> impress<00:02:03.689> me

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
no he has a bigger figure kind of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.310 
no he has a bigger figure kind of
replicating<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.240> same<00:02:06.509> kind<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.780> scale<00:02:07.170> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
replicating that same kind of scale that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
replicating that same kind of scale that
we<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> movie<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.580> comparison

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
we see in the movie so for comparison

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.059 
we see in the movie so for comparison
here<00:02:09.569> he<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
here he is

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.160 
here he is
here<00:02:10.549> we<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:10.849> mic<00:02:11.120> now<00:02:11.359> this<00:02:11.719> is<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> pretty

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
here we have mic now this is a pretty

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.259 
here we have mic now this is a pretty
good<00:02:12.499> skill<00:02:12.920> between<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.609> two<00:02:13.760> figures<00:02:14.090> uh

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
good skill between the two figures uh

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.759 
good skill between the two figures uh
this<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.629> basically<00:02:15.049> what<00:02:15.260> you're<00:02:15.379> looking<00:02:15.650> at

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
this is basically what you're looking at

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.009 
this is basically what you're looking at
in<00:02:15.889> terms<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.249> the<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.639> on-screen<00:02:17.090> persona<00:02:17.239> he

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
in terms of the the on-screen persona he

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.720 
in terms of the the on-screen persona he
might<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.379> little<00:02:18.709> bit<00:02:18.920> smaller<00:02:19.280> than<00:02:19.400> he

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
might be a little bit smaller than he

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.610 
might be a little bit smaller than he
should<00:02:19.760> be<00:02:19.999> but<00:02:20.329> it's<00:02:20.510> not<00:02:20.689> bad<00:02:20.959> but<00:02:21.319> beyond

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
should be but it's not bad but beyond

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.759 
should be but it's not bad but beyond
that<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:22.010> mean<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:23.150> overall<00:02:23.870> feel<00:02:24.530> of

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
that I mean the just overall feel of

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.500 
that I mean the just overall feel of
this<00:02:24.889> figure<00:02:25.129> is<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.639> much<00:02:25.790> better<00:02:26.030> he<00:02:26.239> does

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
this figure is so much better he does

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.020 
this figure is so much better he does
have<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> much<00:02:27.139> heavier<00:02:27.739> weight<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.340> him<00:02:28.489> I'm

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
have a much heavier weight to him I'm

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.059 
have a much heavier weight to him I'm
guessing<00:02:29.599> because<00:02:29.719> the<00:02:30.109> legs<00:02:30.379> actually<00:02:30.889> feel

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
guessing because the legs actually feel

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.069 
guessing because the legs actually feel
like<00:02:31.099> they're<00:02:31.400> solid<00:02:31.969> and<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.359> the<00:02:32.599> torso

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
like they're solid and the the torso

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.159 
like they're solid and the the torso
here<00:02:33.700> kind<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.819> feels<00:02:35.060> more<00:02:35.299> solid<00:02:35.599> as<00:02:35.959> well

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:36.169 
here kind of feels more solid as well

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.890 
here kind of feels more solid as well
but<00:02:36.439> definitely<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.579> legs<00:02:37.849> are<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.419> solid

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
but definitely the legs are a very solid

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.379 
but definitely the legs are a very solid
piece<00:02:39.139> even<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.859> lot<00:02:40.069> more<00:02:40.280> weight<00:02:40.639> to<00:02:40.669> them<00:02:41.030> so

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
piece even a lot more weight to them so

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.170 
piece even a lot more weight to them so
again<00:02:41.659> for<00:02:41.930> 888<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:43.040> price<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:43.579> here<00:02:43.879> at<00:02:44.030> least

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
again for 888 the price on here at least

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.690 
again for 888 the price on here at least
through<00:02:44.629> Walmart<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.169> a<00:02:45.200> very<00:02:45.769> nice<00:02:46.129> price<00:02:46.489> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
through Walmart is a very nice price to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.490 
through Walmart is a very nice price to
have<00:02:46.849> notice<00:02:47.359> I<00:02:47.419> mentioned<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> articulation

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
have notice I mentioned the articulation

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.349 
have notice I mentioned the articulation
it<00:02:48.949> says<00:02:49.159> that<00:02:49.310> it's<00:02:49.519> super<00:02:49.760> poseable<00:02:50.000> he

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
it says that it's super poseable he

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.209 
it says that it's super poseable he
doesn't<00:02:50.810> have<00:02:50.930> anything<00:02:51.230> at<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.379> legs<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:52.129> he

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.219 
doesn't have anything at the legs but he

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.979 
doesn't have anything at the legs but he
does<00:02:52.430> have<00:02:52.609> more<00:02:52.849> articulation<00:02:53.419> that<00:02:53.629> we<00:02:53.780> got

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
does have more articulation that we got

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.409 
does have more articulation that we got
previously<00:02:54.169> his<00:02:54.919> head<00:02:55.159> would<00:02:55.370> kind<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.269> rotate

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
previously his head would kind of rotate

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.589 
previously his head would kind of rotate
although<00:02:56.930> because<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:57.919> kind<00:02:58.579> of<00:02:58.730> molded<00:02:59.239> in

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
although because it's kind of molded in

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.899 
although because it's kind of molded in
with<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.260> fur<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.739> when<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.129> rotate<00:03:01.609> it<00:03:01.790> you

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
with the fur on when you rotate it you

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.789 
with the fur on when you rotate it you
can<00:03:02.120> see<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.629> splits<00:03:03.199> right<00:03:03.409> there<00:03:03.620> which

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
can see that it splits right there which

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.000 
can see that it splits right there which
is<00:03:03.980> kind<00:03:04.579> of<00:03:04.669> ugly<00:03:04.879> but<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.599> not<00:03:05.900> too<00:03:06.139> bad<00:03:06.439> he

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
is kind of ugly but it's not too bad he

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.979 
is kind of ugly but it's not too bad he
is<00:03:07.219> articulated<00:03:07.909> there<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.239> moved<00:03:08.510> forward

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
is articulated there so moved forward

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.649 
is articulated there so moved forward
and<00:03:09.109> back<00:03:09.379> all<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.310> way<00:03:10.400> around<00:03:10.699> he<00:03:11.150> bends<00:03:11.419> at

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
and back all the way around he bends at

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.689 
and back all the way around he bends at
the<00:03:11.689> elbow<00:03:11.810> he<00:03:12.319> also<00:03:12.439> rotates<00:03:13.129> at<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.489> elbow

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:13.699 
the elbow he also rotates at the elbow

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.689 
the elbow he also rotates at the elbow
so<00:03:14.269> nice<00:03:14.870> legit<00:03:15.290> articulation<00:03:15.829> there<00:03:16.129> nothing

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:16.699 
so nice legit articulation there nothing

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:17.890 
so nice legit articulation there nothing
at<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.909> way<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.180> not<00:03:17.389> done<00:03:17.540> with<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.750> legs

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
at the way it's not done with the legs

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.740 
at the way it's not done with the legs
but<00:03:18.169> the<00:03:18.319> tail<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:19.099> articulated<00:03:19.849> but<00:03:20.120> why

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
but the tail is articulated but why

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.240 
but the tail is articulated but why
would<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.049> really<00:03:21.169> I<00:03:21.290> mean<00:03:21.439> that's<00:03:21.769> kind<00:03:22.189> of

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
would you really I mean that's kind of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.059 
would you really I mean that's kind of
ugly<00:03:22.400> cuz<00:03:22.790> then<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.000> break<00:03:23.389> up<00:03:23.599> that<00:03:23.629> whole

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
ugly cuz then you break up that whole

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.679 
ugly cuz then you break up that whole
spike<00:03:25.069> thing<00:03:25.400> here<00:03:25.759> going<00:03:26.000> down<00:03:26.120> from<00:03:26.540> his

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
spike thing here going down from his

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.409 
spike thing here going down from his
back<00:03:26.930> into<00:03:27.229> his<00:03:27.349> tail<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:27.949> that<00:03:28.819> articulation

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
back into his tail so that articulation

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.289 
back into his tail so that articulation
joint<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.930> there<00:03:30.229> but<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.680> honestly<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.970> not

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
joint is there but it honestly is not

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.879 
joint is there but it honestly is not
really<00:03:32.629> needed<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.349> he<00:03:33.379> does<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.799> little

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
really needed so he does have a little

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.259 
really needed so he does have a little
bit<00:03:34.040> more<00:03:34.220> articulation<00:03:34.729> than<00:03:34.970> what<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:35.150> got

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
bit more articulation than what we got

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.879 
bit more articulation than what we got
with<00:03:35.449> Mike<00:03:35.659> and<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:36.169> heck<00:03:36.560> of<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.739> lot<00:03:36.859> more

with Mike and a heck of a lot more
articulation<00:03:37.519> than<00:03:37.790> what<00:03:37.879> we<00:03:37.970> get<00:03:38.120> with

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
articulation than what we get with

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.179
