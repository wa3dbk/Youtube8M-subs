castle we got to kill those clinic as
the<00:01:40.530> troops<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.220> our<00:01:41.340> heroes<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.790> work

on the archer queen once she's down

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.550 
on the archer queen once she's down
we're<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.240> gonna<00:01:45.420> wait<00:01:45.689> until<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.409> our

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
we're just gonna wait until the our

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
we're just gonna wait until the our
screen<00:01:46.799> takes<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.189> air<00:01:47.729> defense<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
screen takes out one air defense and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.020 
screen takes out one air defense and
then<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.320> time<00:01:49.399> once<00:01:50.399> we've<00:01:50.549> taken<00:01:50.850> out

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
then it's go time once we've taken out

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.340 
then it's go time once we've taken out
whatever<00:01:51.180> defense<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:51.750> only<00:01:51.899> three<00:01:52.320> left

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
whatever defense there's only three left

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.889 
whatever defense there's only three left
and<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.829> mean<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.090> unfair<00:01:54.570> it's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and I mean it's just it's unfair it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.219 
and I mean it's just it's unfair it's
it's<00:01:55.259> unfair<00:01:55.710> how<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.280> base<00:01:56.700> cannot<00:01:57.329> defend

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it's unfair how a base cannot defend

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.830 
it's unfair how a base cannot defend
itself<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.250> only<00:01:59.460> has<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.750> know

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
itself when it only has a you know

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
itself when it only has a you know
three-quarters<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.439> its<00:02:01.590> defenses<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.520> here

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
three-quarters of its defenses so here

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.249 
three-quarters of its defenses so here
we<00:02:02.729> go<00:02:02.759> we're<00:02:03.000> gonna<00:02:03.060> drop<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.570> here<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
we go we're gonna drop in here on the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.530 
we go we're gonna drop in here on the

first air troop drop we're gonna go
heavy<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.899> always<00:02:07.170> say<00:02:07.290> go<00:02:07.320> heavy<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.920> first

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
heavy I always say go heavy on the first

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
heavy I always say go heavy on the first
deployment<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.209> means<00:02:09.390> one<00:02:09.569> long<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
deployment that means one long out and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.559 
deployment that means one long out and
about

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
about

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.569 
about
half<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:11.019> our<00:02:11.140> balloon<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.069> in<00:02:12.189> this<00:02:12.249> case<00:02:12.400> it's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
half of our balloon so in this case it's

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.520 
half of our balloon so in this case it's
going<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> be<00:02:12.819> about<00:02:12.909> ten<00:02:13.390> balloons<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.379> want

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
going to be about ten balloons you want

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.929 
going to be about ten balloons you want
to<00:02:14.590> go<00:02:14.650> hard<00:02:14.829> you<00:02:14.980> want<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.219> put<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> rage<00:02:15.670> spell

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
to go hard you want to put a rage spell

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.089 
to go hard you want to put a rage spell
down<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.450> get<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.170> air<00:02:17.379> defense<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.799> quickly

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
down to get that air defense as quickly

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.399 
down to get that air defense as quickly
as<00:02:18.340> possible<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:19.209> also<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.079> worry<00:02:20.290> about

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
as possible you also have to worry about

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.739 
as possible you also have to worry about
wizard<00:02:20.950> towers<00:02:21.249> but<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.579> this<00:02:21.819> base<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:22.749 
wizard towers but on this base the

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.780 
wizard towers but on this base the
wizard<00:02:23.079> towers<00:02:23.319> are<00:02:23.469> not<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:23.920> high<00:02:23.980> level<00:02:24.459> so

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
wizard towers are not that high level so

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.069 
wizard towers are not that high level so
on<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:24.999> second<00:02:25.450> deployment<00:02:25.629> we're<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.019> to

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
on the second deployment we're going to

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.899 
on the second deployment we're going to
drop<00:02:26.230> our<00:02:26.379> remaining<00:02:26.829> two<00:02:27.159> lava<00:02:27.459> hounds<00:02:27.790> and

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
it was going to save like two to four

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.899 
it was going to save like two to four
for<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.650> last<00:02:35.650> side<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.549> base<00:02:36.669> they'll

for the last side of the base they'll

last rates fell down right on that next

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.929 
last rates fell down right on that next
air<00:02:41.560> defense<00:02:41.799> there<00:02:42.010> where<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.519> balloons

air defense there where the balloons
were<00:02:43.120> converging<00:02:43.719> now<00:02:44.049> we're<00:02:44.230> throwing<00:02:44.680> down

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
were converging now we're throwing down

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.159 
were converging now we're throwing down
two<00:02:45.459> more<00:02:45.730> remaining<00:02:46.299> balloons<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.780> last

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.610 
side of the base just to sort of help
out<00:02:48.609> I<00:02:48.879> always<00:02:49.480> do<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.870> because<00:02:50.049> you<00:02:50.590> know

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
out I always do that because you know

then it's just those are going to take

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.449 
then it's just those are going to take
out<00:02:52.629> a<00:02:52.659> few<00:02:52.840> defenses<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.469> then<00:02:53.980> our<00:02:54.219> main

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
out a few defenses and then our main

get<00:02:59.379> from<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.459> know<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.299> outside<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.139> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
get from you know the outside of the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.050 
get from you know the outside of the
base<00:03:02.349> to<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.040> defenses<00:03:03.549> as<00:03:03.669> quickly<00:03:03.879> as

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
base to the defenses as quickly as

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.580 
base to the defenses as quickly as
possible<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.629> if<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.139> can<00:03:05.260> split<00:03:05.500> your

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
possible and if you can split your

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.319 
possible and if you can split your
balloons<00:03:05.980> up<00:03:06.219> of<00:03:06.489> course<00:03:06.879> it's<00:03:07.060> gonna<00:03:07.180> be

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
balloons up of course it's gonna be

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.360 
balloons up of course it's gonna be
faster<00:03:07.689> so<00:03:07.870> boom<00:03:08.469> there<00:03:08.769> we<00:03:08.799> go<00:03:08.949> taking<00:03:09.280> out

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
faster so boom there we go taking out

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.649 
faster so boom there we go taking out
all<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.730> defense's<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.180> can<00:03:10.389> shoot<00:03:10.510> our

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
all the defense's that can shoot our

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.300 
all the defense's that can shoot our
balloons<00:03:10.930> now<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:11.620> just<00:03:11.889> have<00:03:11.919> one<00:03:12.010> more

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
balloons now we just have one more

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.890 
balloons now we just have one more
cannon<00:03:12.699> and<00:03:12.849> then<00:03:12.969> it's<00:03:13.090> cleanup<00:03:13.389> time<00:03:13.540> and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
cannon and then it's cleanup time and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.509 
cannon and then it's cleanup time and

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.550 
this had worked correctly I would have
deployed<00:05:59.120> on<00:05:59.300> two<00:05:59.600> sides<00:05:59.870> of<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.169> base<00:06:00.320> like<00:06:00.530> I

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
deployed on two sides of the base like I

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.800 
deployed on two sides of the base like I
did<00:06:00.770> in<00:06:00.860> that<00:06:00.919> last<00:06:00.979> raid<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.789> then<00:06:02.450> saved<00:06:02.690> a

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
did in that last raid and then saved a

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.420 
did in that last raid and then saved a
few<00:06:02.960> balloons<00:06:03.229> for<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.620> final<00:06:04.160> side<00:06:04.310> of<00:06:04.370> the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
few balloons for the final side of the

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.700 
few balloons for the final side of the
base<00:06:04.580> but<00:06:05.300> this<00:06:05.660> was<00:06:05.810> going<00:06:05.990> to<00:06:06.050> be<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.200> tough<00:06:06.410> 1i

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
base but this was going to be a tough 1i

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.260 
base but this was going to be a tough 1i
I<00:06:06.979> really<00:06:07.340> wanted<00:06:07.550> to<00:06:07.639> attack<00:06:07.850> this<00:06:08.000> because

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
I really wanted to attack this because

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.779 
I really wanted to attack this because
it<00:06:08.360> was<00:06:08.479> tough<00:06:08.750> versus<00:06:09.560> air<00:06:09.770> because<00:06:10.190> this<00:06:10.610> guy

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
it was tough versus air because this guy

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.600 
it was tough versus air because this guy
had<00:06:11.090> a<00:06:11.360> couple<00:06:11.950> wizard<00:06:12.950> towers<00:06:13.250> in<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.430> core

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
had a couple wizard towers in the core

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.310 
had a couple wizard towers in the core
and<00:06:13.760> they're<00:06:13.970> maxed<00:06:14.389> and<00:06:14.510> he<00:06:14.840> had<00:06:14.990> a<00:06:15.020> couple

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
and they're maxed and he had a couple

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.200 
and they're maxed and he had a couple
all<00:06:15.800> of<00:06:16.070> his<00:06:16.160> air<00:06:16.280> defenses<00:06:16.669> actually<00:06:17.000> in<00:06:17.120> the

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
all of his air defenses actually in the

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.629 
all of his air defenses actually in the
core<00:06:17.419> and<00:06:17.539> they<00:06:18.020> were<00:06:18.169> max<00:06:18.410> level<00:06:18.650> 7<00:06:19.039> and<00:06:19.160> level

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
core and they were max level 7 and level

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.520 
core and they were max level 7 and level
7<00:06:19.850> air<00:06:19.940> defenses<00:06:20.300> they<00:06:20.660> take<00:06:20.870> out<00:06:21.020> balloons<00:06:21.229> in

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
7 air defenses they take out balloons in

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.980 
7 air defenses they take out balloons in
two<00:06:21.740> shots<00:06:22.070> boom<00:06:22.610> boom<00:06:23.060> and<00:06:23.389> then<00:06:23.600> with<00:06:23.780> all

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
two shots boom boom and then with all

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.779 
two shots boom boom and then with all
that<00:06:24.229> other<00:06:24.380> stuff<00:06:24.680> you<00:06:24.979> have<00:06:25.130> it<00:06:25.280> in<00:06:25.370> any<00:06:25.520> way

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
that other stuff you have it in any way

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.090 
that other stuff you have it in any way
over<00:06:26.210> we<00:06:26.389> believe<00:06:26.840> those<00:06:26.960> same<00:06:27.169> chin<00:06:27.500> she

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
over we believe those same chin she

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.890 
over we believe those same chin she
really<00:06:28.550> got<00:06:28.729> to<00:06:29.060> get<00:06:29.389> through<00:06:29.539> that<00:06:29.660> course

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
really got to get through that course

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.750 
really got to get through that course
fast<00:06:30.169> as<00:06:30.320> poss

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
fast as poss

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.430 
fast as poss
so<00:06:31.540> coming<00:06:31.780> in<00:06:31.930> from<00:06:32.110> different<00:06:32.380> directions

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
so coming in from different directions

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.340 
so coming in from different directions
would<00:06:32.950> have<00:06:33.070> been<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.430> way<00:06:33.760> to<00:06:33.820> go<00:06:34.390> so<00:06:35.170> there

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
would have been the way to go so there

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.530 
would have been the way to go so there
we<00:06:35.410> go<00:06:35.440> guys<00:06:35.650> was<00:06:36.370> not<00:06:36.610> able<00:06:36.820> to<00:06:37.000> even<00:06:37.180> get<00:06:37.360> two

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.230 
know sometimes your balloons might
splash<00:06:56.410> on<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:56.890> town<00:06:57.160> hall<00:06:57.370> and<00:06:57.400> take<00:06:58.060> it<00:06:58.180> out

guys get good with this army because
this<00:07:08.800> is<00:07:08.920> worth<00:07:09.100> at<00:07:09.430> and<00:07:09.700> it<00:07:09.880> doesn't<00:07:10.210> look

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
this is worth at and it doesn't look

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.150 
this is worth at and it doesn't look
like<00:07:10.450> they're<00:07:10.750> really<00:07:10.870> changing<00:07:11.650> it<00:07:11.770> at<00:07:11.920> all<00:07:12.130> I

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
like they're really changing it at all I

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.640 
like they're really changing it at all I
mean<00:07:12.460> this<00:07:12.760> last<00:07:13.030> update<00:07:13.420> nothing<00:07:14.020> changed

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
mean this last update nothing changed

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.980 
mean this last update nothing changed
with<00:07:14.770> lava<00:07:14.980> hounds<00:07:15.220> they<00:07:15.670> improve<00:07:16.270> ground

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
with lava hounds they improve ground

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.050 
with lava hounds they improve ground
defenses<00:07:17.620> with<00:07:17.800> that<00:07:17.950> new<00:07:18.070> cannon<00:07:18.490> and<00:07:18.640> that's

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
defenses with that new cannon and that's

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.260 
defenses with that new cannon and that's
it<00:07:19.300> so<00:07:20.080> this<00:07:20.530> still<00:07:20.920> remains<00:07:20.950> the<00:07:21.790> hottest

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
it so this still remains the hottest

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.420 
it so this still remains the hottest
most<00:07:22.420> powerful<00:07:22.930> strategy<00:07:23.380> in<00:07:23.590> the<00:07:24.130> game<00:07:24.280> right

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
most powerful strategy in the game right

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.160 
most powerful strategy in the game right
now<00:07:24.490> so<00:07:24.790> definitely<00:07:25.570> use<00:07:25.720> the<00:07:25.810> guys<00:07:25.960> whether

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.170 
now so definitely use the guys whether

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.260 
now so definitely use the guys whether
you<00:07:26.320> are<00:07:26.470> town<00:07:26.650> hall<00:07:26.800> 9<00:07:26.830> or<00:07:27.310> Town<00:07:27.520> Hall<00:07:27.700> 10<00:07:28.030> it

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270 
you are town hall 9 or Town Hall 10 it

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.200
