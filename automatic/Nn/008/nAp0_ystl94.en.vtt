over<00:01:31.350> Ford<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> analog<00:01:32.729> version<00:01:33.090> but

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
over Ford this is the analog version but

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.770 
over Ford this is the analog version but
it<00:01:33.689> actually<00:01:34.110> holds<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.070> tail<00:01:35.509> pretty<00:01:36.509> good

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it actually holds the tail pretty good

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.850 
it actually holds the tail pretty good
and<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:38.000> it's<00:01:39.000> pretty<00:01:39.210> fast

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.789 

good<00:01:43.860> centering

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.069 

and<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:49.119> know<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:49.509> doing<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:49.840> pretty<00:01:49.990> good

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
and it you know it's doing a pretty good

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.090 
and it you know it's doing a pretty good
job<00:01:50.200> now<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:51.189> hopefully<00:01:51.579> it'll<00:01:51.759> hold<00:01:51.969> up<00:01:53.100> other

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
job now so hopefully it'll hold up other

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.760 
job now so hopefully it'll hold up other
