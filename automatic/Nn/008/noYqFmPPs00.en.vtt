little<00:00:23.250> mixer<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> UI<00:00:23.910> 16<00:00:24.570> which<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.259> a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
little mixer the UI 16 which is a

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.320 
little mixer the UI 16 which is a
wireless<00:00:25.830> mixer<00:00:26.279> controlled<00:00:26.759> from<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> tablet

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
wireless mixer controlled from a tablet

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.140 
wireless mixer controlled from a tablet
and<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.199> looks<00:00:28.470> somewhat<00:00:28.830> unorthodox<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:29.759> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and it looks somewhat unorthodox but I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
and it looks somewhat unorthodox but I
guess<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.449> does<00:00:30.599> all<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> regular<00:00:31.109> jobs<00:00:31.320> you

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
guess it does all the regular jobs you

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.790 
guess it does all the regular jobs you
got<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> par<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.180> uh<00:00:33.210> yep<00:00:33.720> we<00:00:33.900> have<00:00:33.990> the<00:00:34.080> UI<00:00:34.230> 16<00:00:34.680> we

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
got a par so uh yep we have the UI 16 we

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
got a par so uh yep we have the UI 16 we
also<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.100> UI<00:00:35.250> 12<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.539> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
also have the UI 12 so they get the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
right to it 2.4 gig or 5 gig you can

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
right to it 2.4 gig or 5 gig you can
change<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.370> also<00:01:02.879> has<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> hard<00:01:03.329> wired<00:01:03.510> Ethernet

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
change it also has a hard wired Ethernet

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.360 
change it also has a hard wired Ethernet
connection<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> don't<00:01:05.070> want<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> use

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the Wi-Fi you can go directly in that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.690 
the Wi-Fi you can go directly in that
way<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.930> well<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.710> also<00:01:07.860> use<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> two<00:01:08.580> at

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
way as well you can also use the two at

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
way as well you can also use the two at
the<00:01:08.790> same<00:01:09.000> time<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:10.979> like

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
system tech or the front house engineer
he<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.799> use<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.250> hardwire<00:01:17.549> connection<00:01:17.729> for

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
he can use the hardwire connection for

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
he can use the hardwire connection for
security<00:01:18.540> something<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.070> hit
