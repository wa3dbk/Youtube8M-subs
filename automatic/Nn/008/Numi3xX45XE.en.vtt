same experience when you play this map

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.810 
same experience when you play this map
now<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.740> without<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.040> doubt<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.460> smallest

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
now this is without a doubt the smallest

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.610 
now this is without a doubt the smallest

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
map in Call of Duty ghosts I'm sure

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.930 
map in Call of Duty ghosts I'm sure
there'll<00:02:20.800> be<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.920> few<00:02:21.130> people<00:02:21.280> complaining

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
there'll be a few people complaining

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.550 
there'll be a few people complaining
about<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.600> due<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.020> maps<00:02:23.260> small

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
about that that due to the maps small

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.140 
about that that due to the maps small
size<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.370> spawns<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:24.880> going<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> be

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
size the spawns are going to be

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.430 
size the spawns are going to be
ridiculous<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.900> you'll<00:02:25.990> be<00:02:26.080> spawning

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
ridiculous and you'll be spawning

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.070 
ridiculous and you'll be spawning
literally<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.910> middle<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.840> gunfight

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
literally in the middle of a gunfight

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080 
literally in the middle of a gunfight
and<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.740> can<00:02:29.950> assure<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.310> guys<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.850> not

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and I can assure you guys that is not

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.730 
and I can assure you guys that is not
the<00:02:31.209> case<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.540> spawns<00:02:31.810> are<00:02:32.020> pretty<00:02:32.410> good<00:02:32.650> on

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
the case the spawns are pretty good on

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.380 
the case the spawns are pretty good on
this<00:02:32.890> map<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.580> think<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.880> extra<00:02:34.150> layer

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
this map and I think the extra layer

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.660 
this map and I think the extra layer
around<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.470> map<00:02:35.650> where<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.340> kind<00:02:36.550> of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
around the map where the little kind of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.370 
around the map where the little kind of
inside<00:02:37.180> bits<00:02:37.540> where<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> flags<00:02:38.080> are<00:02:38.290> on

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
inside bits where the flags are on

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.230 
inside bits where the flags are on
domination<00:02:38.860> helps<00:02:39.220> with<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.520> spawns<00:02:39.790> but

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
domination helps with the spawns but

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.030 
domination helps with the spawns but
even<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:40.660> this<00:02:40.840> map<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.500> map<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.860> plan

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
even so this map is just a map to plan

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.729 
even so this map is just a map to plan
to<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.400> have<00:02:42.610> fun<00:02:43.000> like<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:44.050> all<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.620> us

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350

many great memories on this map now
personally<00:02:55.420> I'm<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> huge<00:02:56.230> fan<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.920> way

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
personally I'm a huge fan of the way

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.040 
personally I'm a huge fan of the way
that<00:02:57.310> infinity<00:02:57.880> would<00:02:58.120> remake<00:02:58.570> these<00:02:58.780> maps

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
that infinity would remake these maps

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.199 
that infinity would remake these maps
and<00:02:59.260> do<00:02:59.380> like<00:02:59.680> futuristic<00:03:00.160> spins<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.940> things

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
and do like futuristic spins on things

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.420 
and do like futuristic spins on things
so<00:03:01.720> with<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.110> being<00:03:02.350> set<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:02.709> like<00:03:03.010> an<00:03:03.160> arena

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
so with this being set in like an arena

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.180 
so with this being set in like an arena
I<00:03:03.790> really<00:03:04.420> really<00:03:04.600> like<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.200> that

I really really like that and that

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.979 
I really really like that and that
really<00:03:06.580> goes<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.940> well<00:03:07.120> with<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.390> field<00:03:07.750> order

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
really goes in well with the field order

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.810 
really goes in well with the field order
of<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.440> map<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.010> I'm<00:03:09.190> sure<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.489> guys<00:03:09.610> have

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
of this map so I'm sure you guys have

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.880 
of this map so I'm sure you guys have
seen<00:03:09.850> from<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.930> teaser<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.440> they<00:03:11.590> release

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
seen from the teaser that they release

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.010 
seen from the teaser that they release
that<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.180> map<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:13.600> got<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.750> whole

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
that with this map it's got a whole

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.229 
that with this map it's got a whole
bunch<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.560> kind<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.280> almost<00:03:15.520> like<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.910> sort<00:03:16.150> of

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
bunch of kind of almost like a sort of

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.420 
bunch of kind of almost like a sort of
game<00:03:16.540> show<00:03:16.900> roulette<00:03:17.680> kind<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.070> thing<00:03:18.250> going

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
game show roulette kind of thing going

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.009 
game show roulette kind of thing going
on<00:03:18.670> with<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.940> field<00:03:19.180> order<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.660> way<00:03:19.840> in

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
on with the field order so the way in

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.840 
on with the field order so the way in
which<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:20.500> field<00:03:20.799> order<00:03:21.160> works<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.670> that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
which this field order works is that

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.820 
which this field order works is that
once<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.299> complete<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.780> field<00:03:23.019> order<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
once you complete the field order you

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.710 
once you complete the field order you
simply<00:03:24.190> activate<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.060> what<00:03:25.450> will<00:03:25.600> happen

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
simply activate it and what will happen

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.720 
simply activate it and what will happen
is<00:03:26.019> on<00:03:26.200> screen<00:03:26.560> around<00:03:26.980> these<00:03:27.459> stadiums

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
is on screen around these stadiums

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.670 
is on screen around these stadiums
there'll<00:03:28.150> be<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.269> bunch<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.049> different<00:03:29.380> screens

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
there'll be a bunch of different screens

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.199 
there'll be a bunch of different screens
what<00:03:30.010> happen<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.340> will<00:03:30.430> be<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.760> almost<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
what happen it will be like almost a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.050 
what happen it will be like almost a
sort<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.450> roulette<00:03:31.959> kind<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.730> fruit<00:03:33.730> machine

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
sort of roulette kind of fruit machine

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.990 
sort of roulette kind of fruit machine
which<00:03:34.480> will<00:03:34.750> pick<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.200> random<00:03:35.739> selection<00:03:36.459> or

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
which will pick a random selection or

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.390 
which will pick a random selection or
reward<00:03:37.420> for<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.380> can<00:03:38.500> be<00:03:38.620> either<00:03:38.860> a

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
reward for you and it can be either a

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.690 
reward for you and it can be either a
gas<00:03:40.239> attack<00:03:40.780> which<00:03:41.140> will<00:03:41.320> gas<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.860> main<00:03:42.370> outer

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
gas attack which will gas the main outer

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.520 
gas attack which will gas the main outer
layers<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.690> map<00:03:43.959> which<00:03:44.140> will<00:03:44.260> force

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
layers of the map which will force

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.620 
layers of the map which will force
people<00:03:44.650> into<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.310> middle<00:03:45.549> of<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.730> map<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.180> can

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
people into the middle of the map it can

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.650 
people into the middle of the map it can
also<00:03:46.920> call<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.340> bunch<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:49.030> turrets<00:03:49.480> which

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
also call in a bunch of turrets which

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.270 
also call in a bunch of turrets which
will<00:03:49.840> spawn<00:03:50.140> out<00:03:50.380> of<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.739> actual<00:03:51.040> crates

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
will spawn out of the actual crates

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.620 
will spawn out of the actual crates
around<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.670> map<00:03:51.790> which<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:52.000> think<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.450> most

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
around the map which I think is the most

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.140 
around the map which I think is the most
evil<00:03:52.840> way<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.980> get<00:03:54.310> your<00:03:54.400> own<00:03:54.549> back<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.060> I

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
evil way to get your own back and I

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.030 
evil way to get your own back and I
think<00:03:55.209> that's<00:03:55.570> an<00:03:55.690> absolutely<00:03:56.170> awesome<00:03:56.500> kill

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
think that's an absolutely awesome kill

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.860 
think that's an absolutely awesome kill
streak<00:03:57.310> as<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.700> guaranteed<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.480> get<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.660> lot

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
streak as it's guaranteed to get a lot

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.500 
streak as it's guaranteed to get a lot
of<00:03:58.900> kills<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.829> third<00:04:00.070> one<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.549> these<00:04:01.090> Jets

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
of kills and the third one is these Jets

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.780 
of kills and the third one is these Jets
will<00:04:01.690> fly<00:04:01.930> over<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.440> drop<00:04:02.470> down<00:04:02.950> six<00:04:03.430> care

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
will fly over and drop down six care

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.880 
will fly over and drop down six care
packages<00:04:04.329> which<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:04.630> absolutely<00:04:05.320> insane<00:04:05.440> now

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
packages which is absolutely insane now

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.410 
packages which is absolutely insane now
what<00:04:06.100> happens<00:04:06.430> is<00:04:06.579> whether<00:04:07.000> these<00:04:07.180> care

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
what happens is whether these care

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.150 
what happens is whether these care
packages<00:04:07.450> I'm<00:04:07.959> not<00:04:08.140> sure<00:04:08.320> of<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.590> chance<00:04:08.860> rate

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
packages I'm not sure of the chance rate

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.190 
packages I'm not sure of the chance rate
but<00:04:09.610> I'm<00:04:09.700> pretty<00:04:09.940> sure<00:04:10.030> with<00:04:10.360> most<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.930> the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
but I'm pretty sure with most of the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.660 
but I'm pretty sure with most of the
time<00:04:11.410> when<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.739> have<00:04:11.769> these<00:04:12.040> care<00:04:12.310> package

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
time when you have these care package

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.880 
time when you have these care package
drops<00:04:12.940> one<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.600> them<00:04:13.780> will<00:04:13.989> be<00:04:14.170> another<00:04:14.560> roll

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
drops one of them will be another roll

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.650 
drops one of them will be another roll
on<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.430> actual<00:04:15.820> field<00:04:16.030> or<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:16.299> you<00:04:16.390> can<00:04:16.510> get

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
on the actual field or so you can get

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.180 
on the actual field or so you can get
yourself<00:04:16.989> another<00:04:17.470> one<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.769> these<00:04:17.859> selections

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
yourself another one of these selections

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.949 
yourself another one of these selections
and<00:04:18.489> if<00:04:18.669> you're<00:04:18.820> lucky<00:04:18.970> enough<00:04:19.180> you'll<00:04:19.840> be

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
and if you're lucky enough you'll be

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.750 
and if you're lucky enough you'll be
rare<00:04:20.200> enough<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.590> get<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.950> chance<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.310> get<00:04:21.549> all

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
rare enough to get the chance to get all

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.690 
rare enough to get the chance to get all
four<00:04:22.300> options<00:04:23.050> she'll<00:04:23.530> get<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.950> gas<00:04:24.160> you'll

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
four options she'll get the gas you'll

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.960 
four options she'll get the gas you'll
get

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
get

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.790 
get
the<00:04:25.090> turrets<00:04:25.690> you'll<00:04:26.020> get<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.320> six<00:04:26.560> care

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
the turrets you'll get the six care

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.230 
the turrets you'll get the six care
package<00:04:27.100> drops<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.580> you'll<00:04:27.790> get<00:04:27.940> another

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
package drops and you'll get another

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.420 
package drops and you'll get another
roll<00:04:28.570> which<00:04:29.020> we<00:04:29.200> actually<00:04:29.380> have<00:04:29.860> on<00:04:30.100> screen

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
roll which we actually have on screen

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.160 
roll which we actually have on screen
for<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.670> guys<00:04:30.820> now<00:04:31.090> which<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.510> apparently

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
for you guys now which is apparently

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.500 
for you guys now which is apparently
very<00:04:32.230> very<00:04:32.770> rare<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.640> if<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.880> manage<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.330> get

very very rare so if you manage to get

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.850 
very very rare so if you manage to get
the<00:04:34.630> field<00:04:34.870> order<00:04:35.020> on<00:04:35.230> this<00:04:35.380> map<00:04:35.560> you're<00:04:35.740> gonna
