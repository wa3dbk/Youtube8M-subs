00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
back you remember when he was introduced

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.539 
back you remember when he was introduced
that<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.719> also<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.290> crucial<00:01:58.649> set<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.280> for

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that was also a very crucial set up for

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.270 
that was also a very crucial set up for
the<00:01:59.820> future<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.540> series<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.350> obviously

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the future of the series so obviously

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
the future of the series so obviously
these<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.270> things<00:02:03.509> most<00:02:03.780> likely<00:02:04.049> might

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
these two things most likely might

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649 
these two things most likely might
intertwined<00:02:04.799> later<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.490> down<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.820> road<00:02:05.969> but

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
intertwined later on down the road but

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.350 
intertwined later on down the road but
for<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:06.869> looking<00:02:07.380> past<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.789> episode

episodes<00:03:20.220> are<00:03:20.459> really<00:03:20.850> standing<00:03:21.120> out<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
episodes are really standing out I

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.630 
episodes are really standing out I
really<00:03:22.110> cannot<00:03:22.470> ignore<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.950> i<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.430> dive

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
really cannot ignore it i have to dive

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.910 
really cannot ignore it i have to dive
into<00:03:23.850> now<00:03:24.030> after<00:03:24.480> seeing<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:24.810> episode<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
out of its way to attack demons and it

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.250 
out of its way to attack demons and it
will<00:03:35.940> not<00:03:36.090> listen<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.510> show<00:03:36.840> for<00:03:36.989> instance

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
will not listen to show for instance

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.080 
will not listen to show for instance
oshio<00:03:37.650> doesn't<00:03:37.980> say<00:03:38.070> go<00:03:38.310> attack<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.760> demon

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
oshio doesn't say go attack that demon

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.340 
oshio doesn't say go attack that demon
it<00:03:39.269> doesn't<00:03:39.600> tell<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.720> Beast<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.049> able<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.230> do

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
it doesn't tell the Beast be able to do

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.810 
it doesn't tell the Beast be able to do
that<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> Beast<00:03:41.250> viewer<00:03:41.430> goes<00:03:41.610> out<00:03:41.790> of

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
that but the Beast viewer goes out of

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.759 
that but the Beast viewer goes out of
its<00:03:41.940> way<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.180> do<00:03:42.450> something<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:43.650> it

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
its way to do something like that so it

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.949 
its way to do something like that so it
has<00:03:43.980> its<00:03:44.190> own<00:03:44.310> will<00:03:44.790> some<00:03:45.180> form<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.540> willows

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
has its own will some form of willows

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.440 
has its own will some form of willows
inside<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.799> had<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.070> assume<00:03:47.450> like

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
inside of it so if I had to assume like

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.479 
inside of it so if I had to assume like
you've<00:03:48.600> always<00:03:48.750> assuming<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.590> want<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.280> say

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
you've always assuming I want to say

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.250 
you've always assuming I want to say
that<00:03:50.700> there's<00:03:50.880> some<00:03:51.060> form<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.390> soul<00:03:51.750> inside

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
that there's some form of soul inside

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.520 
that there's some form of soul inside
that<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.680> maybe<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.880> previous<00:03:54.750> master<00:03:55.110> of

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
that like maybe the previous master of

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.140 
that like maybe the previous master of
the<00:03:55.739> beasts<00:03:55.950> fear<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> dude<00:03:56.519> that<00:03:56.760> still

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the beasts fear the dude that still

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.710 
the beasts fear the dude that still
Torah<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.170> past<00:03:58.440> if<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.920> was<00:03:59.160> doing<00:03:59.340> my

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
Torah in the past if I was doing my

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.030 
Torah in the past if I was doing my
assumptions<00:04:00.720> about<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.019> in<00:04:01.110> Furies<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.680> want

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
assumptions about that in Furies I want

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.380 
assumptions about that in Furies I want
to<00:04:02.100> assume<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.670> nude<00:04:02.910> soul<00:04:03.209> was

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
to assume that that nude soul was

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.789 
to assume that that nude soul was
probably<00:04:03.690> in<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> Beast<00:04:04.110> fear<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.650> that's

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
probably in the Beast fear and that's

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.800 
probably in the Beast fear and that's
probably<00:04:05.070> what's<00:04:05.220> controlling<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.970> think

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
probably what's controlling it I think

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.240 
probably what's controlling it I think
that's<00:04:06.959> what's<00:04:07.140> going<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.470> here<00:04:07.530> because<00:04:08.160> we

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
that's what's going on here because we

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.420 
that's what's going on here because we
never<00:04:08.430> really<00:04:08.760> felt<00:04:09.030> out<00:04:09.290> why<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.350> dude<00:04:10.920> from

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
never really felt out why the dude from

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.509 
never really felt out why the dude from
you<00:04:11.670> know<00:04:11.790> like<00:04:12.180> uh<00:04:12.360> shows<00:04:12.650> ancestor<00:04:13.650> why<00:04:13.950> he

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
you know like uh shows ancestor why he

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.000 
you know like uh shows ancestor why he
locked<00:04:15.420> up<00:04:15.690> Torah<00:04:15.989> didn't<00:04:16.380> really<00:04:16.590> finish<00:04:16.769> him

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
locked up Torah didn't really finish him

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.289 
locked up Torah didn't really finish him
off<00:04:17.100> because<00:04:17.250> you'd<00:04:17.430> fix<00:04:17.669> or<00:04:17.790> like<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.180> would

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
off because you'd fix or like that would

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.420 
off because you'd fix or like that would
try<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.479> finish<00:04:18.750> Torah<00:04:19.109> off<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.979> for<00:04:20.220> him<00:04:20.400> to

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
try to finish Torah off but for him to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.610 
try to finish Torah off but for him to
lock<00:04:20.700> them<00:04:20.849> away<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.419> kind<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.810> symbolizes

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
lock them away it kind of symbolizes

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.240 
lock them away it kind of symbolizes
that<00:04:22.950> maybe<00:04:23.220> Torah<00:04:23.490> isn't<00:04:23.910> that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
that maybe Torah isn't that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.890 
that maybe Torah isn't that
add<00:04:24.310> in<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.670> dude<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:25.000> long<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.390> look<00:04:25.570> knew

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
add in the dude that long to look knew

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.570 
add in the dude that long to look knew
he<00:04:26.170> wasn't<00:04:26.350> that<00:04:26.560> bad<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.950> begin<00:04:27.040> with<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
he wasn't that bad to begin with and

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.130 
he wasn't that bad to begin with and
maybe<00:04:27.880> that's<00:04:28.060> kind<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.390> why<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.600> Beast<00:04:28.900> fear

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
maybe that's kind of why the Beast fear

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.960 
maybe that's kind of why the Beast fear
avoids<00:04:29.620> tour<00:04:29.980> doesn't<00:04:30.280> even<00:04:30.400> attack<00:04:30.730> him<00:04:30.880> at

avoids tour doesn't even attack him at
all<00:04:31.180> when<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.810> comes<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.140> it<00:04:32.260> moving<00:04:32.590> at<00:04:32.710> its

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
all when it comes to it moving at its

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.620 
all when it comes to it moving at its
own<00:04:33.010> will<00:04:33.370> because<00:04:33.670> think<00:04:33.910> about<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.450> mean

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
own will because think about this I mean

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.630 
own will because think about this I mean
for<00:04:35.350> this<00:04:35.470> beast<00:04:35.740> fear<00:04:35.920> to<00:04:36.010> have<00:04:36.130> its<00:04:36.280> own<00:04:36.370> will

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
for this beast fear to have its own will

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.890 
for this beast fear to have its own will
and<00:04:36.670> doing<00:04:36.940> its<00:04:37.150> own<00:04:37.240> things<00:04:37.480> to<00:04:37.630> attack

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
and doing its own things to attack

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.240 
and doing its own things to attack
demons<00:04:38.260> especially<00:04:38.680> what<00:04:38.800> we<00:04:38.830> saw<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.160> this

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
demons especially what we saw in this

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.010 
demons especially what we saw in this
episode<00:04:39.550> you're<00:04:40.180> thinking<00:04:40.540> would<00:04:40.630> go<00:04:40.780> out<00:04:40.900> of

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
episode you're thinking would go out of

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.480 
episode you're thinking would go out of
its<00:04:41.110> way<00:04:41.170> to<00:04:41.320> attack<00:04:41.830> someone<00:04:42.040> like<00:04:42.220> Torah

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
its way to attack someone like Torah

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.790 
its way to attack someone like Torah
since<00:04:42.790> he's<00:04:42.910> also<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.360> yokai<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.680> this

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
since he's also a yokai and so this

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.370 
since he's also a yokai and so this
makes<00:04:45.070> it<00:04:45.340> go<00:04:45.700> on<00:04:45.970> my<00:04:46.270> theory<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:46.810> maybe<00:04:47.080> the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
makes it go on my theory that maybe the

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.710 
makes it go on my theory that maybe the
original<00:04:48.040> soul<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.520> do<00:04:48.640> that<00:04:48.820> use<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.300> beasts

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
original soul to do that use the beasts

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.810 
original soul to do that use the beasts
fear<00:04:49.930> most<00:04:50.530> likely<00:04:50.860> is<00:04:50.920> inside<00:04:51.220> of<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.490> he

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
fear most likely is inside of it and he

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.030 
fear most likely is inside of it and he
knows<00:04:52.090> who<00:04:52.870> Torah<00:04:53.140> is<00:04:53.350> it's<00:04:53.650> not<00:04:53.800> going<00:04:53.950> to

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
knows who Torah is it's not going to

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.770 
knows who Torah is it's not going to
attack<00:04:54.310> him<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.390> a<00:04:55.420> good<00:04:55.600> possibility

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
attack him that is a good possibility

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.909
