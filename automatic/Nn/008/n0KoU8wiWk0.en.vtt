00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 The sx20 is samsung's new and first 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.769
 system camera 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.890
 It has the same high pixel count as 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.600
 the nx200 10 and the nx200 in front of her 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.460
 the housing is bigger and bigger 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320
 supposedly more professional because samsung 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.930
 the wireless technology this year 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.810
 Pushes harder is the nx 20 one of the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.519
 first amateur cameras with wifi but from 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.529
 whole process of editing is the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 transfer of the photos from the camera 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.309
 a computer the simplest and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 fastest part why that with the lot 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.910
 slower again on the process ahead of us 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
 we are a mystery 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 apart from the unnecessary wlan has us 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.329
 the camera but very impressed 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 Manual operation is understandable 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.140
 gives hotkeys and shortcuts that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.360
 ergonomically designed housing leaves 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.760
 Keep yourself comfortable and stable 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.199
 bright and stable amulet of the player 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 for difficult reception to the outside 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.399
 can be pivoted is great 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.260
 the electronic viewfinder is not 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.989
 quite perfect but still accurate and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.030
 Expediently the same care samsung 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 applied to the picture quality the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.170
 just outstanding it the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.920
 color accuracy it only appropriate 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.810
 of the 18 55mm kit lens can but 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.970
 not to be claimed we have it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.009
 one of the best test results of this 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.350
 year recorded combined with the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.610
 high pixel count of the sensor produced 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.380
 the camera an amazing 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.790
 degree of detail if the small one 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.829
 software about sharpening and the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.320
 color spaces at low focal lengths not 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.770
 defend the enex 20 at all 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.540
 other cameras crept by 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.320
 A remark on the edge we have too 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.600
 tried the 60 and 85 mm s objective 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 And although there are only a few models 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.500
 we are of the super high quality 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 We are enthusiastic about this objective 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.210
 very much looking forward to what else samsung 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.399
 from the sleeve shakes in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.439
 bad lighting stn x20 not 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.280
 After the emigration is for something 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.560
 strange but should be until iso 3200 and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.020
 no annoying artifacts about it 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.060
 cause only as a video recording device 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.920
 we can not recommend the mx 20 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 At least not when you look at yourself 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 would like to record repetitive patterns 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.260
 the picture sharpness is pretty strong in 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.629
 the videos and also the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.459
 the lighting is good but in ours 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.769
 test videos was the marie effect yet 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.030
 pretty prominent to disturbing the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.890
 fairness we have to say 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.140
 that we always had to in our tests 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.360
 therefore record a real video entirely 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.239
 could ultimately look different 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.920
 ranks the samsung nx 20 just behind 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.140
 the sony nex 7 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.190
 which has received great results 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.609
 and before the olympus omd 5 that's it 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.500
 one of the best system cameras 2012 and 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.329
 It is hard to believe but almost 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.079
 1100 euro are a fair price for a 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.540
 such caliber 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.819
 who the future of the enex objective 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.519
 optimistically , we are doing it 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.730
 can not go wrong with the samsung nx 20 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.730
 do
