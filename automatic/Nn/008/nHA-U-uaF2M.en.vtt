00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
autumn he's starting to get that pretty

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.270 
autumn he's starting to get that pretty
crumbly<00:04:14.079> texture

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
crumbly texture

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.849 
crumbly texture
that's<00:04:17.280> had<00:04:17.430> its<00:04:17.549> second<00:04:17.880> dose<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.209> compost

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
that's had its second dose of compost

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.360 
that's had its second dose of compost
and<00:04:19.859> over<00:04:20.160> there<00:04:21.380> there's<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.530> year<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:23.130> bed

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
and over there there's a year for bed

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.080 
and over there there's a year for bed
and<00:04:23.610> that's<00:04:23.790> almost<00:04:24.480> look<00:04:24.690> like<00:04:24.720> topsoil<00:04:25.410> I

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
and that's almost look like topsoil I

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.610 
and that's almost look like topsoil I
know<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.270> could<00:04:27.570> say<00:04:27.780> what<00:04:28.110> I'm<00:04:28.230> doing<00:04:28.530> is

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
know you could say what I'm doing is

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.290 
know you could say what I'm doing is
effectively<00:04:29.100> replacing<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.670> soil<00:04:29.880> on<00:04:30.000> top<00:04:30.180> of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
effectively replacing the soil on top of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.880 
effectively replacing the soil on top of
on<00:04:30.630> top<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.350> clay<00:04:32.000> yeah<00:04:33.080> possibly<00:04:34.080> but

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
on top of the clay yeah possibly but

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.640 
on top of the clay yeah possibly but
what<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.190> will<00:04:35.370> find<00:04:35.640> is<00:04:35.940> worms<00:04:36.870> do<00:04:37.260> take<00:04:37.500> it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
what you will find is worms do take it

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.650 
what you will find is worms do take it
down<00:04:37.830> bigger<00:04:38.190> deeper<00:04:38.610> even<00:04:39.120> without<00:04:39.419> you

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
down bigger deeper even without you

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.540 
down bigger deeper even without you
digging<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.080> in<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:44.010> how<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.940> deal<00:04:45.540> with<00:04:46.550> clay

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
digging it in but how I deal with clay

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.500 
digging it in but how I deal with clay
soil<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.750> raised<00:04:49.080> beds<00:04:49.730> lime<00:04:50.730> it<00:04:51.650> add<00:04:53.510> compost

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
soil so raised beds lime it add compost

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.300 
soil so raised beds lime it add compost
but<00:04:54.780> not<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.080> same<00:04:55.290> time<00:04:55.560> wise<00:04:56.010> you'll<00:04:56.190> get

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
but not the same time wise you'll get

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.070 
but not the same time wise you'll get
ammonia<00:04:56.730> off<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.210> waste<00:04:57.510> for<00:04:57.720> good<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:57.960> in

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
ammonia off and waste for good is in

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.770 
ammonia off and waste for good is in
your<00:04:58.200> compost<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:59.060> see<00:05:00.060> how<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.330> goes<00:05:00.360> bare

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
your compost and see how it goes bare

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.680 
your compost and see how it goes bare
after<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.320> following<00:05:01.590> year<00:05:02.150> if<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.390> can

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
after in the following year if you can

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.360 
after in the following year if you can
you'll<00:05:04.110> notice<00:05:04.380> for<00:05:04.500> some<00:05:04.710> leaves<00:05:04.950> here<00:05:05.160> but

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
you'll notice for some leaves here but

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.280 
you'll notice for some leaves here but
they're<00:05:05.550> not<00:05:06.030> added<00:05:06.360> by<00:05:06.510> me<00:05:06.750> they're<00:05:06.960> added<00:05:07.200> by

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
they're not added by me they're added by

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.140 
they're not added by me they're added by
nature<00:05:07.770> if<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.700> can<00:05:08.940> add<00:05:09.180> leave<00:05:09.450> mold<00:05:09.750> or<00:05:11.150> just

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
nature if you can add leave mold or just

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.900 
nature if you can add leave mold or just
old<00:05:12.360> leaves<00:05:12.690> on<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.050> top<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.530> Tuva<00:05:14.460> bed<00:05:14.669> and

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
old leaves on the top of Tuva bed and

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.210 
old leaves on the top of Tuva bed and
then<00:05:15.180> starts<00:05:15.210> earning<00:05:15.660> but<00:05:15.930> over<00:05:16.350> in<00:05:16.560> January

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
then starts earning but over in January

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.280 
then starts earning but over in January
to<00:05:17.580> bury<00:05:17.790> them<00:05:18.030> remember<00:05:18.630> they<00:05:18.750> break<00:05:18.960> down<00:05:18.990> by

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
to bury them remember they break down by

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.110 
to bury them remember they break down by
anaerobic<00:05:19.530> respiration<00:05:19.890> so<00:05:20.520> they<00:05:20.640> don't<00:05:20.850> need

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
anaerobic respiration so they don't need

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.370 
anaerobic respiration so they don't need
any<00:05:22.080> oxygen<00:05:22.820> that<00:05:23.820> really<00:05:24.330> does<00:05:24.540> help<00:05:24.990> add

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
any oxygen that really does help add

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.210 
any oxygen that really does help add
fiber<00:05:26.280> or<00:05:26.990> friability<00:05:27.990> or<00:05:28.320> structure<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:29.130> make

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
fiber or friability or structure to make

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.830 
fiber or friability or structure to make
it<00:05:29.280> crumbly<00:05:29.820> as<00:05:30.000> well<00:05:30.479> as<00:05:30.600> all<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.810> other

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
it crumbly as well as all the other

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.010 
it crumbly as well as all the other
things<00:05:31.910> by<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.000> end<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.360> year<00:05:33.540> one<00:05:33.780> as

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
things by the end of year one as

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.630 
things by the end of year one as
mentioned<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.830> should<00:05:35.130> have<00:05:35.460> something

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
mentioned you should have something

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.050 
mentioned you should have something
reasonable<00:05:36.240> like<00:05:36.390> this<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:37.850> doing<00:05:38.850> it<00:05:38.970> at

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
reasonable like this and doing it at

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.770 
reasonable like this and doing it at
this<00:05:39.150> time<00:05:39.210> of<00:05:39.540> year

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
this time of year

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.219 
this time of year
nature<00:05:40.350> does<00:05:40.530> most<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.950> it<00:05:41.070> for<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:42.229> that's

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
nature does most of it for you that's

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.320 
nature does most of it for you that's
all<00:05:43.440> for<00:05:43.560> now

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
all for now

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.570 
all for now
take<00:05:45.330> care
