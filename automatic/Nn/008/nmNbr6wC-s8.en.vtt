00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
rollers in the hair here we want to

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.080

sides<00:01:09.119> we're<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> pin<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.900> buck<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
sides we're going to pin this buck a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
sides we're going to pin this buck a
little<00:01:10.799> bit<00:01:10.890> flatter<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:11.670> loop<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
little bit flatter and then loop that
