that's<00:01:09.030> young<00:01:09.270> i<00:01:09.450> would<00:01:09.630> say<00:01:09.840> you'll<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.770> safe

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that's young i would say you'll be safe

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.580 
that's young i would say you'll be safe
to<00:01:11.159> burn<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> every<00:01:11.700> other<00:01:11.820> year<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:13.260> climber

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to burn it every other year the climber

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.020 
to burn it every other year the climber
of<00:01:13.860> their<00:01:14.040> easter<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of their easter is going to go up and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.240 
of their easter is going to go up and
slightly<00:01:15.630> open<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> canopy<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.890> reason

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
slightly open up the canopy the reason

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
slightly open up the canopy the reason
for<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.090> increase<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> air

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
for that is so that we increase the air

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.600 
for that is so that we increase the air
penetration<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> lot<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
penetration so that when we get a lot of

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999 
penetration so that when we get a lot of
win<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:21.060> big<00:01:21.240> storms<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.380> area<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:22.799> just

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
win or big storms the area will just

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.140 
win or big storms the area will just
flow<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.220> through<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:23.970> won't

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
flow right through it and they won't

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
flow right through it and they won't
break<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:24.960> all<00:01:24.990> these<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
break and right now all these two it is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770 
break and right now all these two it is
just<00:01:26.009> removing<00:01:26.369> any<00:01:26.580> cross<00:01:26.909> limbs<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.659> in

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
just removing any cross limbs or up in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.289 
just removing any cross limbs or up in
the<00:01:27.900> canopy<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.890> objective<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the canopy and the objective of this is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
the canopy and the objective of this is
by<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.659> time<00:01:30.990> we're<00:01:31.170> done<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.530> tree<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
by the time we're done with a tree it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
by the time we're done with a tree it
should<00:01:32.640> still<00:01:32.880> look<00:01:33.030> natural<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.750> goal

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
should still look natural the goal

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.480 
should still look natural the goal
should<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.070> right

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
should be that you can see just right

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.940 
should be that you can see just right
through<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> tree<00:01:36.119> without<00:01:36.900> taking<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> big

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
through the tree without taking a big

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.370 
through the tree without taking a big
amount<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.430> debris<00:01:38.729> from<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:40.049> debris

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
amount of debris from it the more debris

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.710 
amount of debris from it the more debris
you<00:01:40.470> take<00:01:40.829> away<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> tree<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.180> faster

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you take away from the tree the faster

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.580 
you take away from the tree the faster
