00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.080 

or<00:05:20.560> think<00:05:20.889> about<00:05:20.949> converting<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.729> back<00:05:21.759> to

or think about converting it back to
unleaded<00:05:22.509> but<00:05:23.199> either<00:05:23.889> way<00:05:24.160> this<00:05:24.400> truck<00:05:24.729> runs

unleaded but either way this truck runs

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.990 
unleaded but either way this truck runs
great<00:05:25.470> low<00:05:26.470> mileage<00:05:26.500> makes<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:27.400> have<00:05:27.580> a<00:05:27.610> lot<00:05:27.880> of

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
great low mileage makes it have a lot of

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.450 
great low mileage makes it have a lot of
life<00:05:28.180> left<00:05:28.449> in<00:05:28.660> it

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
life left in it

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.099
