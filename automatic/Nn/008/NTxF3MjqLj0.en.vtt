00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.810
 that pick it up at 5:30 so better 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.810
 I go to sleep early 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.800
 for the things that I do for a job 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.800

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.800

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.000
 i 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.650
 it's not because I'm looking for a toy 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.650
 go back to sleep 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.030

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.280
 old process 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.820
 easy 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.760
 now you want to hear what else you're hungry 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.130
 dear you need something that will help you 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.670
 silence sleep if I do not sleep 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.310
 I want it to bother me I'm sorry honey 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.200
 your dad is very grumpy tonight we're going 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.610
 to see one of those videos two programs 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
 of action that you like so much in 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.360
 TV 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.340
 do not bother because you're going to stay 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.840
 celoni and then they'll tell you to the top 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.840
 of 4 already has 7 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.840
 good very alarm clock 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.980
 is not totally decomposed today let 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.430
 lie 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.730
 if it is broken everything very destroyed 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.990
 to the alarm clock and it turns out that it's a 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.820
 pity is the only alarm clock we have 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.760
 Now that I'm going to do, I have to pick up 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.940
 my client at 5:30 I was trained 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.630
 I'm lost 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.060
 and so I do not have to wake up if I do not 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.830
 I sleep I'll stay awake all the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.750
 night and how 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.750
 just watch 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.410
 There was so much silence since without use 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.340
 the cement of dad's denture like 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.110
 toothpaste 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.860
 I think a good crime book does not 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.810
 will keep awake 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.000
 the butler did it 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.760
 I hope that jack the ripper kills that 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.010
 tonight I whisper her at bedtime 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.370
 on its huge as the bed the purse 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.760
 soft and inviting to covered his face with 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:16.390
 a warm and cozy blanket and sigh not 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.390
 there's nothing like a good night's sleep 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.270
 true 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.370
 I think it was not such a good idea to read a 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.370
 book 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.670
 but there are always good programs 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.599
 nocturnal 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.239
 he is much better with my next 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:45.489
 trick I guarantee you that you will eat from me 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.489
 hand lists assistants 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.460
 you are getting a lot of sleep 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.580
 you are falling into a deep sleep 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.120
 and what is this about if I wanted 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.389
 sleep would put them to see a program 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.389
 educational 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.910
 finish 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.600
 I have to find something to keep me 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.600
 awake 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.640
 a couple of these outweigh the sugar 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:42.449
 I should not have opened the second can 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.449
 I'm so full that I just want to sleep 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.930
 I do not have to be awake 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:54.139
 yes but how do I do it 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:58.750
 listen to the bathroom 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.750
 good if I keep awake with me 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.889
 carrie boy you are a true genius 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.119
 you would like to stay up all the 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.969
 night 

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:16.479
 I can only letters will be fun 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.479
 What do you say 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.439
 the night to sleep 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.660
 ah 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.320
 is what my heart needed to 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.320
 wake 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.800
 It has been a very long night but I am 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:58.310
 point to achieve it 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:06:00.349
 if only one hour is left I managed it is a 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.210
 wonderful day to play is not true 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.310
 I have been told that it is very good 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.719
 I hope you put one on the green 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.719
 good friend 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.690
 but improvable 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.690
 Thank you 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.979
 we are making gorgoritos with your 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:38.319
 own drool and we thought he deserved a 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:41.760
 applause but other than that I was convinced 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:45.890
 because half a day 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.890
 if we can
