00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
first of all it's going to be in G so I

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.369 
first of all it's going to be in G so I
thought<00:00:38.870> then<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.140> E<00:00:40.469> minor<00:00:42.230> here's<00:00:43.230> the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
that's a correct because and then

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
guitar just does that and that chord is

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.609
