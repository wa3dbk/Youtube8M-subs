moss<00:00:53.100> growing<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.360> reason<00:00:54.600> it's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
moss growing and the reason it's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.110 
moss growing and the reason it's
changing<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:56.160> because<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.670> leaking

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
changing it's because it's leaking
