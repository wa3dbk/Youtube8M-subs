00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.929
 hello, I'm elizabeth, they've been made and today 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.910
 we want to explain how the 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.380
 adhesive interlock bankruptcy script that 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.380
 you can find on our website 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.119
 www.youtube.com its operation is very 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.250
 simple what allows you this 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 Entretela is to carry out any project 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.659
 with grid 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.769
 with this size or lower 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.769
 basically it is also used a lot 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.620
 to perform the water color then 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.500
 this interlining as it works on the one hand 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.440
 has a grid drawn and by the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.989
 another side is adhesive on this side 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.719
 adhesive we will go placing the pieces of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.010
 fabric in each of the boxes or 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.090
 in 4 or 9 we will be placing them performing 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.090
 the drawing and then 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.579
 we will join with a straight machine seam 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.040
 by the lines 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.369
 we are going to explain how it works step to 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.369
 He passed 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.310
 this is the drawing we want to make 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.430
 and translate it into our kit then to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.710
 from here we will move it to the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.159
 free adhesive celina with grids 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.200
 now we have a part mounted and 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.830
 we just assembled what is the tree 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.710
 we have cut the pieces of cloth in 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.909
 the shape of four squares can be 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.420
 of 1 of 4 of 9 as we have already commented 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.420
 Y 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.520
 we put them 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.790
 and now for example, we already have the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.610
 full tree we have the house and now 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.980
 we start filling what would 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.980
 the sky all 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.790
 The entire drawing must be complete 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.030
 fabric in this case for example let's 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.179
 placing bits but if you want to go 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.480
 a little bit faster and always be the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.910
 same fabric you can do for example as 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.130
 we will place a strip here 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.580
 whole cloth to finish making 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.680
 the sky when it causes it to like 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.570
 we will do the sewing here and we 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.570
 the grid will remain 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.170
 we are finishing placing all the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.920
 pieces as we have commented so that 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.920
 is completely covered in cloth 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.430
 when we have cover 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.530
 all the image we want with fabrics what 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.220
 we must iron slowly 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.470
 without steam and keeping it for 10 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.180
 seconds so that it is fixed well 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.590
 the cloth 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.769
 we will have to pass the iron 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.650
 for all the fabrics to go 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.650
 adhering to the rigid interlining 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.370
 we have all the ironed fabrics and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.780
 Adhered in freezer adhesive line 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.290
 What we will do is sew the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.900
 seams from behind we have the lines 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.079
 drawn and we will start as we have 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 done in grid of 4 we will start by 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.579
 this first we will double we will make sure 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.180
 that is in a straight line and we will pass it 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.639
 by the sewing machine then we will double 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.730
 the next one not the other the next one 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.569
 the other will continue sewing all 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.129
 strips 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.129
 I taught ourselves how 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.200
 concentrated 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.110
 This is the result of having done 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.240
 all the straight lines that we have gone 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.790
 sewing here back as indicated 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.030
 let's go to the beginning then it's go catching 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.330
 each line fold it and make a 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.790
 sewing here once we have all 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.240
 the straight lines is time to make 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.420
 the perpendiculars if you want you can 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.900
 iron as soon as possible to take a 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.470
 good posture and then you will do what 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.130
 same 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.450
 fold and sew here 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.450
 right now when we teach 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.930
 we have the fabric we have ironed and 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.400
 we have put all the seams in the 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.340
 same direction 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.159
 now we double here as we have 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.159
 done previously we confirm 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.190
 a coastal 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.259
 we will repeat 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.259
 for all the 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.690
 that marks the silva interlining 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.690
 grid 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.100
 as you see 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.990
 because it is staying 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.530
 with the grid form and now you 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.530
 we will teach 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.610
 this is the final result we have already 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.879
 finished 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.250
 here we have made all the lines 

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:08.770
 horizontal we have ironed them all 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.500
 in the same direction 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.259
 and good and as we have seen 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.710
 performed this cushion in a very 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:20.050
 simple first we have been placing the 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.000
 pieces in place then we have 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.180
 ironed and from behind we have gone 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.520
 joining with a straight seam and at the end 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.560
 for we have assembled this cushion as 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.289
 we remember that you can find the 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.909
 adhesive interlining with grid in 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:38.470
 our website www.youtube.com and 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:41.639
 We hope you have been very helpful 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.639
 thank you
