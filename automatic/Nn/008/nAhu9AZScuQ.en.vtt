00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
which will allow you to split the middle

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.590 
which will allow you to split the middle
of<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.570> top<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> car<00:02:16.790> out<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
of the top of the car out like that and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.630 
of the top of the car out like that and
then<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:18.840> fold<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.770> rest<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.190> spoilers

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
then we fold the rest of the spoilers

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.180 
then we fold the rest of the spoilers
down<00:02:20.910> take<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.960> front<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.260> car<00:02:22.440> split<00:02:23.070> it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
down take the front of the car split it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.270 
down take the front of the car split it
in<00:02:23.310> half<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.850> then<00:02:24.300> rotate<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> 90<00:02:25.230> degrees

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
in half and then rotate it 90 degrees

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.510 
in half and then rotate it 90 degrees
inward<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.640> form<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.000> feet<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:28.190> then<00:02:29.190> take

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
inward to form the feet and then take

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.130 
inward to form the feet and then take
the<00:02:29.640> arms<00:02:30.030> twist<00:02:31.020> them<00:02:31.290> about<00:02:32.280> 180<00:02:32.850> degrees<00:02:33.140> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the arms twist them about 180 degrees to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.950 
the arms twist them about 180 degrees to
expose<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.980> hands<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:38.540> there's<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.780> face

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
expose the hands then there's the face

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.020 
expose the hands then there's the face
just<00:02:40.620> simply<00:02:41.270> flip<00:02:42.270> up<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.450> visor<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:44.030> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
just simply flip up the visor and you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.110 
just simply flip up the visor and you
have<00:02:45.240> one<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.570> if<00:02:45.990> not<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.410> most<00:02:46.620> lazy<00:02:47.460> robot

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
have one of if not the most lazy robot

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.170 
have one of if not the most lazy robot
mode<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.960> robot<00:02:49.110> modes<00:02:49.530> ever<00:02:50.210> it's<00:02:51.210> not<00:02:51.770> awful

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
mode the robot modes ever it's not awful

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.200 
mode the robot modes ever it's not awful
but<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.330> not<00:02:54.510> good<00:02:54.780> either<00:02:55.730> now<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.790> can

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
but it's not good either now you can

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.310 
but it's not good either now you can
attach<00:02:57.450> jolt<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.980> any<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.460> them<00:02:59.930> Minicon<00:03:00.930> ports

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
attach jolt to any of them Minicon ports

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.630 
attach jolt to any of them Minicon ports
but<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.640> chief<00:03:02.910> one<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.390> back<00:03:03.750> here<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.640> Hot

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
but the chief one is back here on Hot

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.940 
but the chief one is back here on Hot
Shots<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:07.220> first<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.370> peg<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.950> then

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
Shots but first you peg it in and then

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.730 
Shots but first you peg it in and then
well<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:12.240> problem<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:12.780> when<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.170> peg<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.410> in

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
well the problem is when you peg it in

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.000 
well the problem is when you peg it in
its<00:03:14.700> supposed<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.120> flip<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.750> rear<00:03:16.440> axle<00:03:16.920> out

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
its supposed to flip this rear axle out

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.550 
its supposed to flip this rear axle out
but<00:03:17.340> when<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:17.550> do<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.030> when<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.020> peg<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.260> in

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
but when you do that when you peg it in

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.780 
but when you do that when you peg it in
it<00:03:19.800> interferes<00:03:20.610> with<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.970> clip<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:23.130> so

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
it interferes with this clip and it so

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.550 
it interferes with this clip and it so
you<00:03:23.850> kind<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.210> have<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.170> side

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
you kind of have to do it on the side

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.650 
you kind of have to do it on the side
and<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.990> silly<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.330> do<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.600> and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
and it's just silly so you do that and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.450 
and it's just silly so you do that and
it<00:03:30.930> flips<00:03:31.140> up<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.440> it's<00:03:31.620> supposed<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.190> twist

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
it flips up and it's supposed to twist

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.980 
it flips up and it's supposed to twist
and<00:03:32.880> fire<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.270> missile<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.890> missile<00:03:35.070> being

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
and fire a missile the missile being

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.900 
and fire a missile the missile being
right<00:03:36.990> there<00:03:37.320> but<00:03:38.310> mine<00:03:38.670> has<00:03:39.060> long<00:03:39.630> since<00:03:40.140> I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
right there but mine has long since I

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.699 
right there but mine has long since I
stopped<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.150> function<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.380> kind<00:03:43.650> of

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
stopped that function so you kind of

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.500 
stopped that function so you kind of
have<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.920> get<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.459> here<00:03:44.490> and<00:03:44.760> push<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.360> little

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
have to get in here and push the little

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.460 
have to get in here and push the little
piece<00:03:45.720> down<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:47.900> then<00:03:48.900> it'll<00:03:49.050> fire<00:03:49.320> the

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
piece down and then it'll fire the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.820 
piece down and then it'll fire the
missile<00:03:49.740> anyway<00:03:50.660> now<00:03:51.660> if<00:03:51.900> you've<00:03:52.050> watched<00:03:52.440> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
missile anyway now if you've watched the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.190 
missile anyway now if you've watched the
show<00:03:52.860> or<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.490> Transformers<00:03:54.180> Armada<00:03:54.510> TV<00:03:54.959> show

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
kind of lame and there have been images

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.890 
kind of lame and there have been images
of<00:04:19.470> prototypes<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.729> hot<00:04:20.970> shot<00:04:21.299> floating

this<00:04:31.210> guy<00:04:31.419> was<00:04:31.840> pretty<00:04:32.289> much<00:04:32.470> engineered<00:04:33.220> with

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
this guy was pretty much engineered with

actually not fair this isn't a horrible
gimmick<00:04:39.280> it's<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.759> a<00:04:39.850> not<00:04:40.000> well<00:04:40.300> realized

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
so is this a good figure now not really

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.820 
so is this a good figure now not really
unfortunately<00:05:32.349> this<00:05:33.070> figure<00:05:33.490> is<00:05:33.699> pretty

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
unfortunately this figure is pretty

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.129 
unfortunately this figure is pretty
plain<00:05:35.830> not<00:05:36.789> bad<00:05:37.630> just<00:05:38.490> lame<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.909> it<00:05:40.750> could<00:05:40.990> be

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
plain not bad just lame and it could be

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.189 
plain not bad just lame and it could be
so<00:05:41.590> much<00:05:41.830> better<00:05:41.889> if<00:05:42.430> they<00:05:43.030> weren't<00:05:43.240> if<00:05:43.960> the

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
so much better if they weren't if the

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.760 
so much better if they weren't if the
designers<00:05:44.620> weren't<00:05:44.979> saddled<00:05:45.639> by<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:46.770> poor

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
designers weren't saddled by a poor

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.570 
designers weren't saddled by a poor
gimmick<00:05:48.580> now<00:05:49.539> I<00:05:49.630> will<00:05:49.900> admit<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.470> like<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.159> car

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
gimmick now I will admit I like the car

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.180 
gimmick now I will admit I like the car
mode<00:05:51.820> I<00:05:52.060> like<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.990> car<00:05:53.199> mode<00:05:53.409> I<00:05:53.590> think<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.949> car

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
mode I like the car mode I think the car

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.460 
mode I like the car mode I think the car
mode<00:05:54.400> looks<00:05:54.699> good<00:05:54.970> and<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:55.570> think<00:05:55.780> is<00:05:55.870> repaint

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
mode looks good and I think is repaint

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.520 
mode looks good and I think is repaint
or<00:05:57.039> his<00:05:57.190> powerlinx<00:05:57.880> version<00:05:58.360> later<00:05:59.199> in<00:05:59.440> the
