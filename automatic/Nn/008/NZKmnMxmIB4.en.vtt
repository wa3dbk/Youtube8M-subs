few reasons on what sets the mi 4i apart

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.819 
few reasons on what sets the mi 4i apart
from<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.110> phones<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> mid-range

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
from the other phones in the mid-range

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.490 
from the other phones in the mid-range
price<00:00:35.280> segment<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.350> can

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
price segment and this is what you can

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.130 
price segment and this is what you can
see<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> could<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.450> fall<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
see that you could have a fall that

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.119 
see that you could have a fall that
might<00:00:40.860> actually<00:00:41.780> look<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.960> paper<00:00:43.170> like

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
might actually look on paper like

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.380 
might actually look on paper like
something<00:00:44.550> that's<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:44.879> similar<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.329> not

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
something that's very similar if not

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
something that's very similar if not
identical<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.930> very<00:00:46.140> similar<00:00:46.320> specs<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
identical with very similar specs but it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.940 
identical with very similar specs but it
would<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.940> thicker<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.750> would<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.989> larger<00:00:49.559> they

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
would be thicker it would be larger they

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.060 
would be thicker it would be larger they
would<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.280> far<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.260> less<00:00:52.649> high<00:00:52.829> less

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
would have far you know less high less

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
would have far you know less high less
quality<00:00:53.399> lesser<00:00:53.760> quality<00:00:53.969> components<00:00:54.660> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
quality lesser quality components you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.630 
quality lesser quality components you
probably<00:00:55.500> wouldn't<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> talk<00:00:56.250> about<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
probably wouldn't want to talk about the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.590 
probably wouldn't want to talk about the
suppliers<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.149> some<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> these<00:00:57.390> components

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
suppliers and some of these components

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.760 
suppliers and some of these components
came<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.289> nobody<00:00:58.410> would<00:00:58.739> ever

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
came from because nobody would ever

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.340 
came from because nobody would ever
heard<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
heard of them so I want to go into a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.270 
heard of them so I want to go into a
little<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.649> detail<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.010> let<00:01:02.160> me<00:01:02.250> just

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
little bit more detail but let me just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.070 
little bit more detail but let me just
take<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> few<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:03.930> going

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
take out a few things here so I'm going

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.320 
take out a few things here so I'm going
to<00:01:04.110> take<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.530> look<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.549> these<00:01:05.640> attachments

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to take out look at these attachments

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.850 
to take out look at these attachments
how<00:01:06.720> beautiful<00:01:07.110> they<00:01:07.200> are

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
how beautiful they are

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.250 
how beautiful they are
really<00:01:09.250> really<00:01:09.460> nice<00:01:10.150> that's<00:01:10.750> how<00:01:10.900> all<00:01:10.930> the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
really really nice that's how all the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
really really nice that's how all the
components<00:01:11.410> attached<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.130> motherboard

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
components attached to the motherboard

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.440 
components attached to the motherboard
so<00:01:12.760> a<00:01:12.790> little<00:01:12.940> editing<00:01:13.210> on<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> battery<00:01:13.900> here

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so a little editing on the battery here

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.310 
so a little editing on the battery here
that's<00:01:16.450> job<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.630> few<00:01:19.810> things<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.200> you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
that's job and a few things that you

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.620 
that's job and a few things that you
notice<00:01:20.650> so<00:01:20.950> first<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.250> all<00:01:21.340> we<00:01:22.300> basically

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
notice so first of all we basically

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.030 
notice so first of all we basically
built<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.820> smallest<00:01:26.010> motherboard<00:01:27.010> that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
built the smallest motherboard that

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.940 
built the smallest motherboard that
we've<00:01:27.280> ever<00:01:27.460> built<00:01:27.960> which<00:01:28.960> I've<00:01:29.200> gotten<00:01:29.650> taken

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
we've ever built which I've gotten taken

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.060 
we've ever built which I've gotten taken
out<00:01:30.220> here<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.300> it's<00:01:31.870> obviously<00:01:32.620> a<00:01:32.680> dual

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
out here and so it's obviously a dual

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.780 
out here and so it's obviously a dual
side<00:01:33.600> unemployed<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:36.040> it's<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.340> densest

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
side unemployed and it's the densest

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.790 
side unemployed and it's the densest
motherboard<00:01:37.240> we've<00:01:37.390> built<00:01:37.630> with<00:01:38.500> more

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
motherboard we've built with more

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.620 
motherboard we've built with more
components<00:01:39.460> on<00:01:39.730> it<00:01:39.790> right<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.390> we<00:01:40.480> have<00:01:40.600> a

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
components on it right so we have a

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.200 
components on it right so we have a
larger<00:01:41.200> RF<00:01:41.620> area<00:01:41.979> because<00:01:42.310> we<00:01:42.430> support<00:01:42.580> 16

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
larger RF area because we support 16

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.900 
larger RF area because we support 16
bands<00:01:43.570> 16<00:01:44.020> 16<00:01:44.350> different<00:01:44.470> RF<00:01:44.740> bands<00:01:44.979> on<00:01:45.760> this

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
bands 16 16 different RF bands on this

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.040 
bands 16 16 different RF bands on this
device<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.950> obviously<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.280> micro<00:01:49.240> 2<00:01:49.630> Micro

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
device and obviously it is micro 2 Micro

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.280 
device and obviously it is micro 2 Micro
SIM<00:01:50.200> cards<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.710> see<00:01:51.070> how<00:01:51.280> large<00:01:51.790> an<00:01:52.240> area<00:01:53.050> on

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
SIM cards and see how large an area on

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.430 
SIM cards and see how large an area on
the<00:01:53.350> motherboard<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.400> actual<00:01:55.119> SD<00:01:55.840> cards<00:01:56.170> take

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
the motherboard the actual SD cards take

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.469 
the motherboard the actual SD cards take
right<00:01:56.800> so<00:01:56.979> designing<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.940> motherboard<00:01:58.210> like

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
right so designing a motherboard like

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.780 
right so designing a motherboard like
this<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.470> work<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.860> art<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.220> can<00:02:00.460> look

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
this is a work of art and you can look

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.250 
this is a work of art and you can look
at<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.150> comparison<00:02:01.420> with<00:02:01.690> some<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:02.080> other

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
at it in comparison with some of other

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.580 
at it in comparison with some of other
wire<00:02:02.500> boards<00:02:02.740> for<00:02:02.950> example<00:02:03.660> this<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.080> this

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
wire boards for example this is the this

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.940 
wire boards for example this is the this
is<00:02:05.740> an<00:02:05.860> e<00:02:05.979> note<00:02:06.160> on<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.000> board<00:02:07.229> mu4<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.290> actually

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
is an e note on the board mu4 I actually

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.770 
is an e note on the board mu4 I actually
has<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.340> smaller<00:02:09.520> more<00:02:10.030> compact

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
has a smaller more compact

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.920 
has a smaller more compact
on<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.320> board<00:02:11.530> than<00:02:11.950> me<00:02:12.130> note<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.660> basically

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
on the board than me note so basically

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.390 
on the board than me note so basically
what<00:02:14.140> we<00:02:14.230> were<00:02:14.320> trying<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:14.769> with<00:02:15.010> me<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.370> I

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
what we were trying to do with me for I

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.050 
what we were trying to do with me for I
is<00:02:15.820> design<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.930> phone<00:02:17.410> where<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.400> components

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
is design a phone where the components

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.390 
is design a phone where the components
the<00:02:19.150> electronic<00:02:19.660> components<00:02:20.170> were<00:02:20.290> tucked<00:02:21.070> as

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
the electronic components were tucked as

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.060 
the electronic components were tucked as
far<00:02:22.090> out<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.720> possible<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.500> can<00:02:23.620> see<00:02:23.860> how

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
far out as possible and you can see how

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.880 
far out as possible and you can see how
insanely<00:02:24.610> detailed<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.420> dense<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
insanely detailed and dense the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.590 
insanely detailed and dense the
components<00:02:27.400> are<00:02:27.580> as<00:02:27.760> they're<00:02:27.970> laid<00:02:28.150> out<00:02:28.300> here

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
components are as they're laid out here

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.259 
components are as they're laid out here
such<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.500> could<00:02:29.620> then<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.430> large

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
such that you could then have a large

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.290 
such that you could then have a large
area<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> battery<00:02:32.739> which<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:33.850> allows

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
area for the battery which then allows

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.390 
area for the battery which then allows
the<00:02:34.540> battery<00:02:34.780> itself<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.860> be<00:02:35.950> pretty<00:02:36.190> thin

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the battery itself to be pretty thin

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.090 
the battery itself to be pretty thin
right<00:02:37.050> if<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.140> didn't<00:02:38.380> have<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.620> much<00:02:38.739> space

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
right if you didn't have as much space

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.590 
right if you didn't have as much space
here<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.670> still<00:02:39.910> wanted<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.360> a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
here and you still wanted to have a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.620 
here and you still wanted to have a
battery<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.590> know<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> 3,000<00:02:42.400> 120<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.480> would

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
battery you know a 3,000 120 it would

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.120 
battery you know a 3,000 120 it would
end<00:02:43.750> up<00:02:43.810> being<00:02:44.050> thicker<00:02:44.350> which<00:02:44.800> would<00:02:44.980> make

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
end up being thicker which would make

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.460 
end up being thicker which would make
the<00:02:45.280> whole<00:02:45.459> device<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.209> figure<00:02:46.480> now<00:02:47.260> here's

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
the whole device and figure now here's

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.070 
the whole device and figure now here's
another<00:02:47.530> interesting<00:02:47.860> thing<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.780> what<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.900> have

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
another interesting thing so what I have

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.120 
another interesting thing so what I have
right<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.320> is<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:52.600> display<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.920> what<00:02:54.040> I'm

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
right here is the display so what I'm

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.100 
right here is the display so what I'm
holding<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.880> entire<00:02:55.300> display<00:02:55.810> assembly

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
holding is the entire display assembly

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.220 
holding is the entire display assembly
this<00:02:56.890> includes<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.489> LCD<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.709> includes<00:02:59.709> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
this includes the LCD and includes the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.080 
this includes the LCD and includes the
touch-panel<00:03:00.409> in<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> glass<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.670> one<00:03:01.879> solution

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
touch-panel in the glass in one solution

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.690 
touch-panel in the glass in one solution
and<00:03:02.599> when<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.590> look<00:03:03.769> at<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.400> like

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
and when you look at this this is like

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.030 
and when you look at this this is like
maybe<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.780> little<00:03:06.049> bit<00:03:06.260> thicker<00:03:06.470> than<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.680> credit

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
maybe a little bit thicker than a credit

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.550 
maybe a little bit thicker than a credit
card<00:03:07.129> right<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.269> an<00:03:08.390> incredibly<00:03:09.019> incredibly

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
card right it's an incredibly incredibly

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.490 
card right it's an incredibly incredibly
thin<00:03:10.099> part<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.599> is<00:03:11.659> actually<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> custom

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
thin part this is actually a custom

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.920 
thin part this is actually a custom
glass<00:03:12.860> solution<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.909> Corney<00:03:14.330> made<00:03:14.540> for<00:03:14.900> us

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
glass solution that Corney made for us

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.199 
glass solution that Corney made for us
with<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.890> same<00:03:16.099> base<00:03:16.459> composition<00:03:16.910> that's

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
with the same base composition that's

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.390 
with the same base composition that's
going<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.450> class<00:03:17.660> 3<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.739> offers<00:03:19.220> that

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
going to the class 3 so it offers that

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.130 
going to the class 3 so it offers that
same<00:03:19.730> level<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.150> scratch<00:03:20.420> resistance<00:03:20.959> and

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
same level of scratch resistance and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.920 
same level of scratch resistance and
basically<00:03:21.980> when<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.280> put<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.610> battery<00:03:22.930> or

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
basically when you put the battery or

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.240 
basically when you put the battery or
display<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.349> top<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.709> battery

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
display on top of the battery

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.180 
display on top of the battery
that's<00:03:25.790> essentially<00:03:26.329> what<00:03:26.510> defines<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
that's essentially what defines the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.819 
that's essentially what defines the
thickness<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:28.940> device<00:03:29.440> it's<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.620> exact

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
thickness of the device it's the exact

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.440 
thickness of the device it's the exact
same<00:03:30.860> technology<00:03:31.549> in<00:03:31.610> fact<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.030> use<00:03:32.150> for

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
same technology in fact that we use for

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.690 
same technology in fact that we use for
me<00:03:32.540> notes<00:03:32.780> right<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:33.319> you<00:03:33.379> can<00:03:33.560> see<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:33.890> the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
me notes right so you can see that the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.270 
me notes right so you can see that the
camera<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.209> need<00:03:35.360> 4i<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.440> flush<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:37.250> the

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
camera on need 4i is a flush to the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.520 
camera on need 4i is a flush to the
surface<00:03:37.370> flat<00:03:37.970> on<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.209> surface<00:03:38.569> like<00:03:38.750> for<00:03:39.410> me

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
surface flat on the surface like for me

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.960 
surface flat on the surface like for me
note<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:39.890> we're<00:03:40.010> actually<00:03:40.160> using<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.579> exact

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
note so we're actually using the exact

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.680 
note so we're actually using the exact
same<00:03:41.620> camera<00:03:42.620> assembly<00:03:43.190> as<00:03:43.819> we<00:03:44.030> used<00:03:44.209> on<00:03:44.359> email

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
same camera assembly as we used on email

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.030 
same camera assembly as we used on email
which<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:45.019> course<00:03:45.049> is<00:03:45.379> our<00:03:45.500> highest<00:03:45.709> end

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
which of course is our highest end

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.809 
which of course is our highest end
device<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.090> it's<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.569> same<00:03:47.810> sensor<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.340> what

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
device and it's the same sensor so what

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.580 
device and it's the same sensor so what
we<00:03:49.910> do<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.239> I'm<00:03:50.480> going<00:03:50.599> to<00:03:50.690> simulate<00:03:50.930> basically

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
we do is I'm going to simulate basically

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.860 
we do is I'm going to simulate basically
bright<00:03:51.799> sunlight<00:03:52.220> here<00:03:52.579> and<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:53.599> know<00:03:53.690> watch

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
bright sunlight here and you know watch

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.229 
bright sunlight here and you know watch
what<00:03:54.079> happens<00:03:54.470> when<00:03:55.280> we<00:03:55.579> basically<00:03:55.790> take<00:03:56.060> this

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
what happens when we basically take this

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.000 
what happens when we basically take this
device<00:03:56.480> into<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:56.810> very<00:03:57.019> brightly<00:03:57.680> lit

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
device into a very brightly lit

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.530 
device into a very brightly lit
environment<00:03:58.160> here<00:03:58.640> even<00:03:58.879> in<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.090> dark<00:03:59.329> you

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
environment here even in the dark you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.930 
environment here even in the dark you
can't<00:03:59.780> see<00:03:59.840> things<00:04:00.109> well<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.549> very

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
can't see things well this is a very

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.910 
can't see things well this is a very
kind<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.569> extreme<00:04:02.930> image<00:04:03.230> but<00:04:03.440> imagine

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
kind of extreme image but imagine

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.259 
kind of extreme image but imagine
looking<00:04:04.160> at<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.549> Sun<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:05.000> basically

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
looking at this in the Sun you basically

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.740 
looking at this in the Sun you basically
wouldn't<00:04:05.569> see<00:04:05.870> anything<00:04:07.599> see<00:04:08.599> your

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
wouldn't see anything see your

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
wouldn't see anything see your
tremendous

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.940 

right<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:13.640> can

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.910 

so<00:04:17.950> basically<00:04:18.280> what<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:18.609> allows<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:20.709> happen

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
so basically what this allows to happen

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.340 
so basically what this allows to happen
is<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.519> go<00:04:21.670> into<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.090> Sun<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.870> no<00:04:23.020> longer

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
is you can go into the Sun you no longer

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.290 
is you can go into the Sun you no longer
have<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.560> crank<00:04:24.130> up<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.550> brightness<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:25.210> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
have to crank up the brightness of the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.930 
have to crank up the brightness of the
display<00:04:25.660> which<00:04:26.320> obviously<00:04:26.650> is<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> very<00:04:27.130> very

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
display which obviously is a very very

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.570 
display which obviously is a very very
consuming<00:04:28.750> task<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.620> can<00:04:30.100> still<00:04:30.340> bring

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
consuming task and you can still bring

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.130 
consuming task and you can still bring
out<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.120> lot<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.570> detail<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:31.930> you

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
out a lot of the detail that you

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.010 
out a lot of the detail that you
absolutely<00:04:32.710> would<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.280> be<00:04:33.610> able<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.850> see<00:04:34.120> in

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
absolutely would not be able to see in

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.530 
absolutely would not be able to see in
bright<00:04:35.260> sunlight<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:36.010> but<00:04:36.160> from<00:04:36.400> what<00:04:36.640> all<00:04:36.760> he

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
bright sunlight so but from what all he

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.660 
bright sunlight so but from what all he
showed<00:04:37.960> in<00:04:38.110> this<00:04:38.320> way<00:04:39.220> ask<00:04:39.400> them<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.640> few

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
showed in this way ask them a few

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.730 
showed in this way ask them a few
questions<00:04:39.910> one<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.390> them<00:04:40.630> is<00:04:40.780> about<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.050> size

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
questions one of them is about the size

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.260 
questions one of them is about the size
of<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.950> SIM<00:04:42.100> card<00:04:42.130> slots<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:42.880> micro<00:04:43.120> SD

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
of the SIM card slots and the micro SD

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.990 
of the SIM card slots and the micro SD
card<00:04:43.450> slot<00:04:43.620> availability<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:45.550> size<00:04:45.760> of<00:04:45.910> the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
card slot availability the size of the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.640 
card slot availability the size of the
sim<00:04:46.180> slot<00:04:46.480> already<00:04:46.900> take<00:04:47.050> up<00:04:47.170> a<00:04:47.260> lot<00:04:47.470> and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
sim slot already take up a lot and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.990 
sim slot already take up a lot and
that's<00:04:47.830> what<00:04:48.040> Xiaomi<00:04:48.370> claims<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.790> be<00:04:48.880> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
that's what Xiaomi claims to be the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.370 
that's what Xiaomi claims to be the
reason<00:04:49.300> why<00:04:49.419> there<00:04:49.600> is<00:04:49.660> no<00:04:49.750> micro<00:04:50.020> SD<00:04:50.200> card

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
reason why there is no micro SD card

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.530 
reason why there is no micro SD card
slot<00:04:50.410> and<00:04:50.800> though<00:04:51.400> we<00:04:51.610> would<00:04:51.700> have<00:04:51.910> loved<00:04:52.510> to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
slot and though we would have loved to

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.900 
slot and though we would have loved to
see<00:04:52.750> one<00:04:53.620> of<00:04:53.740> them<00:04:53.890> being<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.310> nano<00:04:54.490> SIM<00:04:54.700> card

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
see one of them being a nano SIM card

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.909 
see one of them being a nano SIM card
slot<00:04:55.090> doubling<00:04:55.419> as<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.600> micro<00:04:55.900> SD<00:04:56.110> one<00:04:56.230> there

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
slot doubling as a micro SD one there

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.440 
slot doubling as a micro SD one there
are<00:04:57.010> some<00:04:57.160> device<00:04:57.400> already<00:04:57.580> doing<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.210> and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
are some device already doing that and

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.180 
are some device already doing that and
xiaomi<00:04:58.900> should<00:04:59.080> try<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.650> do<00:04:59.770> that<00:04:59.919> in<00:05:00.100> the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
xiaomi should try and do that in the

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.940 
xiaomi should try and do that in the
next<00:05:00.370> flagship<00:05:00.790> at<00:05:00.940> least<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:02.020> far<00:05:02.260> though<00:05:02.800> the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
next flagship at least so far though the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.500 
next flagship at least so far though the
device<00:05:03.220> looks<00:05:03.580> brilliant<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.360> whatever

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
device looks brilliant and whatever

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.510 
device looks brilliant and whatever
you're<00:05:04.810> paying<00:05:05.050> for<00:05:05.290> it<00:05:05.440> it's<00:05:05.710> totally<00:05:06.130> worth

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
you're paying for it it's totally worth

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.300 
you're paying for it it's totally worth
the<00:05:06.700> money<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.960> this<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:08.290> what<00:05:08.500> we<00:05:08.919> feel<00:05:09.100> about

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
the money so this is what we feel about

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.850 
the money so this is what we feel about
the<00:05:09.550> mi<00:05:09.880> 4i<00:05:10.150> right<00:05:10.480> now<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:11.680> will<00:05:11.770> be
