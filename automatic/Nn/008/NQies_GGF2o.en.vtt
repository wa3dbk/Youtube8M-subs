00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.800 
is but look at his stuff look at this
stuff<00:01:24.990> okay<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.680> he<00:01:26.159> starts<00:01:26.490> off<00:01:26.640> early<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
stuff okay so he starts off early on and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.359 
stuff okay so he starts off early on and
he's<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.110> I've<00:01:28.259> got<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.530> model<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
he's like I've got this model right it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.210 
he's like I've got this model right it
shows<00:01:29.670> hehe<00:01:29.909> gives<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.409> he<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
shows hehe gives you the he got the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.530 
shows hehe gives you the he got the
assumptions<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> model<00:01:33.150> he's<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.390> like

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
assumptions of the model he's all like

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
assumptions of the model he's all like
look<00:01:33.750> look<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:35.040> model<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.579> takes<00:01:35.820> into

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
look look this model it takes into

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
look look this model it takes into
account<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> polls<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.900> adjusts<00:01:37.470> some<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
account of the polls it adjusts some of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
account of the polls it adjusts some of
the<00:01:37.740> polls<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.579> are

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the polls because some of them are

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
the polls because some of them are
stupid<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.299> Rasmus<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.020> dumb<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
stupid like Rasmus and it's dumb and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.120 
stupid like Rasmus and it's dumb and
then<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> goes<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.930> goes<00:01:42.960> along<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.710> says<00:01:43.890> okay

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
then it goes it goes along and says okay

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.440 
then it goes it goes along and says okay
well<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.430> economic<00:01:44.640> data<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.240> looks

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
well there's economic data here looks

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
well there's economic data here looks
better<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:45.720> Obama<00:01:45.990> maybe<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.740> get<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> little

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
better for Obama maybe it's get a little

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.350 
better for Obama maybe it's get a little
bit<00:01:47.159> worse<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> probability

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
bit worse but it's this probability

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
bit worse but it's this probability
based<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.079> ever<00:01:49.259> since<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.710> early

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
based on like ever since you know early

actually really weird that looks really
solid<00:04:03.330> Obama<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.780> don't<00:04:03.930> think<00:04:04.110> that's

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
solid Obama I don't think that's

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.680 
solid Obama I don't think that's
actually<00:04:04.470> ninety<00:04:05.250> ninety<00:04:06.000> percent<00:04:06.209> chance

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
actually ninety ninety percent chance

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.540 
actually ninety ninety percent chance
okay<00:04:07.140> so<00:04:07.200> Nate<00:04:07.709> called<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.160> ninety<00:04:08.430> percent

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
okay so Nate called a ninety percent

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.460 
okay so Nate called a ninety percent
chance<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.060> winning<00:04:09.300> winning<00:04:09.480> Ohio<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.260> if<00:04:10.380> he

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
chance of winning winning Ohio so if he
