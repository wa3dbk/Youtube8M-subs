00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.380
 translated and voiced link the figure manna 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.650
 student orbit record specifically for 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.580
 the doctor is right there dot com 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:26.010
 ready to go today I will answer for 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.260
 the question you asked me is my camilla 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.239
 winters she participates in the organization 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.600
 competition strongman and strong women and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.530
 the question of what I think about the basic 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.530
 sports nutrition and what I think about my 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.110
 nutrition is not a preparation for competitions 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.110
 powerlifting 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 perhaps start with the fact that when I 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.210
 competed food for me was mega 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.460
 but important 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.199
 what I ate with was on country 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.850
 I practiced overeat 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.689
 six times I ate double cheeseburgers and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:17.330
 I thought that this is enough to ebashit 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:20.640
 this is a large number of days liver 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 drained for draining your liver so 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.600
 It was 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 of cause or press I ate up to 200 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.280
 Liver scouring tablets have seen six or 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.640
 seven whale burgers wars a day and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 top ten and day it was my diet 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.490
 competing athlete and what do i think about 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.590
 the importance of sports nutrition 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.530
 I think it is very important to throw it. 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.710
 way to get energy from carbohydrates 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.860
 we are all slightly different to whom carbohydrates 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.869
 fat and personally i love more 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 carbohydrate 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.329
 maybe because i'm old i need 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.340
 more energy carbohydrates for me very 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:15.489
 important now i get all belkin 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.099
 from food i use powdered protein but 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.590
 most of it i get with food i 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:25.230
 I think that it is much better 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.230
 better than introduced from sports nutrition 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.650
 for example egg white 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.610
 meat pie steaks from this i get 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.400
 your protein for powerlifter is very important 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.810
 as soon as possible to determine the fact that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.379
 more important to him 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.410
 protein or carbohydrates not everything works for 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.739
 all the same nichrome not so you 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.879
 good for me sucks for myself and what 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.239
 do the same experiment i know it 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.599
 doesn't sound scientific unprofessional 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.750
 but fucking did it, I experimented and 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:10.290
 the only way I knew at stake and we 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.209
 okhuyenny bonus question the question itself 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.060
 does your popularity motivate you 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:24.030
 fuck more clear dick i don't want to go 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.030
 somewhere in the cinema and hear from people 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.530

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.160
 this fat wack of this he doesn't look like 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.709
 the one who on video turns out that it is yes 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.660
 motivates me 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:46.329
 to it motivates me to tear off 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:49.630
 yellow and train will have to train 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.750
 and now I have no right to choose for 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:57.160

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:01.810
