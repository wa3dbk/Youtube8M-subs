with<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.130> you're<00:01:50.280> molding<00:01:50.579> earphones

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
with it now if you're molding earphones

with it now if you're molding earphones
instead<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> earbuds<00:01:52.140> don't<00:01:52.500> worry<00:01:52.770> because

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
instead of earbuds don't worry because

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
instead of earbuds don't worry because
the<00:01:53.610> molding<00:01:53.939> process<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.600> exactly<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.200> same

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the molding process is exactly the same

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.249 
the molding process is exactly the same
roll<00:01:56.250> interest<00:01:56.670> sausage<00:01:57.060> around<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> stem

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
roll interest sausage around the stem

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.530 
roll interest sausage around the stem
and<00:01:58.500> fill<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> gaps<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> same<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.149> he<00:02:00.360> did

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and fill the gaps the same way he did

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.330 
and fill the gaps the same way he did
with<00:02:00.659> your<00:02:00.840> ear<00:02:00.930> buds<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.920> plugs<00:02:02.189> are<00:02:02.310> a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
with your ear buds here plugs are a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.639 
with your ear buds here plugs are a
little<00:02:02.520> bit<00:02:02.610> more<00:02:02.820> simple<00:02:03.200> as<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.439> have

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
little bit more simple as we don't have

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.780 
little bit more simple as we don't have
to<00:02:04.770> worry<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.070> more<00:02:05.280> evening<00:02:05.549> around<00:02:05.729> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to worry about more evening around a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.270 
to worry about more evening around a
pair<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
pair of you

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.960 
pair of you
but<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:08.110> we<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.560> take<00:02:08.979> Aria<00:02:09.399> candy<00:02:09.789> as

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
but so we do is take Aria candy as

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.210 
but so we do is take Aria candy as
before<00:02:10.420> instead<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.990> splitting<00:02:11.170> into<00:02:11.530> three

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
before instead of splitting into three

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.640 
before instead of splitting into three
we<00:02:12.340> only<00:02:12.490> split<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.880> into<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.500> mold<00:02:14.500> it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
we only split it into to mold it

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.040 
we only split it into to mold it
together<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.130> same<00:02:15.370> way<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.480> we<00:02:16.569> get<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> nice

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
together the same way so we get a nice

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.190 
together the same way so we get a nice
even<00:02:17.440> mix<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.220> an<00:02:18.310> even<00:02:18.670> color<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.810> instead<00:02:20.140> of

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
even mix in an even color but instead of

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.960 
even mix in an even color but instead of
rolling<00:02:20.470> into<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.860> sausage<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.520> time<00:02:21.790> we're

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
rolling into a sausage this time we're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.690 
rolling into a sausage this time we're
going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.150> turn<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.510> into<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.780> teardrop<00:02:23.350> shape

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
going to turn it into a teardrop shape

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.190 
going to turn it into a teardrop shape
the<00:02:24.700> end<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.030> teardrop<00:02:25.450> goes<00:02:25.660> down<00:02:25.989> into

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
the end of the teardrop goes down into

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.020 
the end of the teardrop goes down into
your<00:02:26.350> ear<00:02:26.530> canal<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.040> then<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.610> rest<00:02:27.850> is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
your ear canal and then the rest is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.550 
your ear canal and then the rest is
molded<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.540> fill<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> remaining<00:02:29.200> gaps

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
molded to fill up the remaining gaps

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.010 
molded to fill up the remaining gaps
this<00:02:30.310> ensures<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.180> good<00:02:31.450> seal<00:02:31.750> a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
this ensures that you get a good seal a
