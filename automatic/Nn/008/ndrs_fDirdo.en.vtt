 Once a year, slaughterhouse 72 5

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.059
 small 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.489
 and that at outstanding temperatures 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:37.670
 the event also attracted attention 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.830
 the budget bmx contest for the professionals 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.410

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.909
 Gray 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.849
 between the competitions could 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.099
 sugar tournaments are attended 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.590
 be jumped on the bungee trampoline 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.860

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.640
 The sport stools are tested sport 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.600
 process is stupid said the sport knew 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.350
 where is as much as possible of 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.700
 add 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.180
 in the end, it is a mixture of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.430
 juggling breakdance skateboarding and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.819
 paco elements and are so many 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.470
 There had always been interesting ones 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.330

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.640

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.120
 Kiwis pass by then we tricks 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.120

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.850
 this is also becoming increasingly popular 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.310
 Slacklining that with the support 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.060
 unfortunately that was in the golfpark 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.390
 We were allowed to try it out 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.520

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.200

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.580

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.840
