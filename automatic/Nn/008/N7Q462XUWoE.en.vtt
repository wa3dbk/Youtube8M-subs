 hello good in this case as with this 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:12.599
 hairstyle are you going to see what I did a little 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.260
 that it goes this way to be able to put 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.170
 over your shoulder you will see it too 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.720
 performed only in the back 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.349
 you will see different ornaments well what 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 it would be where the rubber or 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.370
 adorning in some areas of the braid 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.190
 is the hair goes inside and then goes 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.430
 all braided with the sides then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 tell you that ideal for girls for theme 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.400
 of communion for brides who want 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.380
 wear a braid then it depends on the 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.210
 adornment that you are going to see an ornament that 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.460
 it costs so it looks very thin and very 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 beautiful 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.739
 for anyone depends on how 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 several ribs for day to day is 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.090
 very comfortable people that you ask me to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.649
 gym because in the end you take all the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.800
 hair removed the face can you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.540
 serve if you want to go to the gym 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.280
 in your case made with straight hair 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.900
 because the photo had sued 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.570
 straight hair you can do it 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.630
 with the hair as you want smooth 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 curly wavy keep in mind that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 will always modify the hairstyle on 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.260
 everything if we go to canceled and curled 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.870
 but it will also look very nice 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.820
 hair all curly hair and that 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.540
 go the braid has to stay 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.070
 also precious depends on the background of the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.080
 hair that you have then it will not do 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 more combed or less combed even the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.810
 clothes that you wear so nothing has 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.030
 liked to put here you have the step by step 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 in my case I'm going to do with the line a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 but you decide if you want the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.100
 stripe in half without stripe simply that 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.330
 go all the hair from the front area 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.420
 diagonally back zigzag 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.420
 ah 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.119
 once he left the line on that side I'm going 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 to take a part to one side of the line and 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:11.130
 another part to the other side and I start 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.190
 on the back I make three 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.640
 divisions and I will start to perform 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.470
 the braid touches me to pass the lock of the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.830
 left so I take a lock in 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.450
 that side whenever it's the most external 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.890
 possible one to the chin that I have to pass 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.670
 and now touch the other side 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.590
 I pick up a strand once and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.549
 always that last section that we have 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.760
 taken that is as more cortita although 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.319
 then always everything to your liking 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.840
 Touch through the lock on the other side 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.880
 in this case we go down and towards the side 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.850
 we take a lock 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:58.320
 we joined it and we had the other side 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:00.600
 the same now as the hair in the area 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.340
 front is over then let's go 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.740
 grabbing the mane that is loose 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.130
 always what is more towards the 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.130
 Exterior 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:27.319
 and you will see if you want to leave the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.040
 braid looser less loose 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.420
 but you see that the section that we unite 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.420
 we leave more loose 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.280
 you will see how high you want 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.450
 get the braid if you simply want 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.450
 at half height 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.540
 just have joined the area until the 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.750
 area of the sideburns and have left as 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.580
 a semirecogido 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.790
 and in this case I'm going to do it here 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.910
 and another option is simply with a 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:09.310
 gum placed and the hair loose or 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.380
 just the whole mane this 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.140
 example would be 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:19.989
 an ornament of a flower more youthful 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:29.140
 well or childish and even then with a 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:34.990
 tie to make a loop this would be another 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:37.480
 more elegant option and now let's see 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.010
 the braid as I have taught it to 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:45.670
 principle that goes towards a lateral like this 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:49.000
 that we already started the braid wearing it 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.450
 towards a side and as you see all the 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.280
 rest is worked exactly the same 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.790
 you also choose in this case if 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.650
 you want the braid down in the middle of 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:05.080
 the head and this would be another good ornament 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.510
 well this was the video today I hope 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.660
 that you liked it, it's very easy for you 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.660
 to do and see you soon see you later
