pipeline<00:04:59.530> probably<00:05:00.280> because<00:05:00.670> that<00:05:00.940> wave<00:05:01.180> is

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
pipeline probably because that wave is

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.930 
pipeline probably because that wave is
the<00:05:02.260> gnarliest<00:05:02.680> wave<00:05:03.010> in<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.310> world<00:05:03.460> and

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
the gnarliest wave in the world and

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.560 
the gnarliest wave in the world and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
you're probably one of only a handful of

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.870 
you're probably one of only a handful of
people<00:05:08.050> who<00:05:08.200> know<00:05:08.350> that<00:05:08.380> way<00:05:08.800> very<00:05:09.220> well<00:05:09.520> you

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.080 
the first three ways I took off pro
and<00:06:40.180> I<00:06:40.480> literally<00:06:40.810> was<00:06:41.650> beyond<00:06:42.160> invert<00:06:42.760> on<00:06:42.970> the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
and I literally was beyond invert on the

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.300 
and I literally was beyond invert on the
drop<00:06:43.389> because<00:06:44.050> the<00:06:44.350> way<00:06:44.470> the<00:06:44.650> wave<00:06:44.800> sucks<00:06:45.100> up

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
drop because the way the wave sucks up

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.610 
drop because the way the wave sucks up
and<00:06:45.520> every<00:06:46.180> time<00:06:46.389> I<00:06:46.419> hit<00:06:46.720> the<00:06:46.870> bottom<00:06:47.199> my<00:06:47.320> nose

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
and every time I hit the bottom my nose

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.070 
and every time I hit the bottom my nose
actually<00:06:47.889> dug<00:06:48.280> into<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:48.699> water<00:06:48.910> and<00:06:49.210> that<00:06:49.990> was

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
actually dug into the water and that was

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.050 
actually dug into the water and that was
for<00:06:50.260> like<00:06:50.380> three<00:06:50.710> waves<00:06:50.949> in<00:06:51.160> a<00:06:51.250> row<00:06:51.430> and<00:06:51.729> then

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
for like three waves in a row and then

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.510 
for like three waves in a row and then
it<00:06:52.180> became<00:06:52.479> a<00:06:52.540> point<00:06:52.900> where<00:06:53.229> it<00:06:53.889> wasn't<00:06:54.130> even

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
it became a point where it wasn't even

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.610 
it became a point where it wasn't even
funny<00:06:54.880> anymore<00:06:55.000> it<00:06:55.540> was<00:06:55.720> just<00:06:55.930> like<00:06:56.080> I<00:06:56.199> take

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
funny anymore it was just like I take

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.350 
funny anymore it was just like I take
off<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.070> like<00:06:57.190> oh<00:06:57.430> shit<00:06:57.699> oh<00:06:57.940> shit<00:06:58.030> oh<00:06:58.270> shit

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
off and like oh shit oh shit oh shit

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.180 
off and like oh shit oh shit oh shit
trying<00:06:58.870> to<00:06:58.960> get<00:06:59.110> out<00:06:59.290> of<00:06:59.350> the<00:06:59.620> wave<00:06:59.800> trying<00:07:00.070> to

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
trying to get out of the wave trying to

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.820 
trying to get out of the wave trying to
basically<00:07:00.460> save<00:07:00.940> my<00:07:01.060> life<00:07:01.300> and<00:07:01.540> so<00:07:02.110> right<00:07:02.680> when

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
basically save my life and so right when

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.790 
basically save my life and so right when
I<00:07:02.860> did<00:07:02.949> that<00:07:03.340> I<00:07:03.669> was<00:07:04.360> like<00:07:04.419> okay<00:07:04.930> I'm<00:07:05.290> over<00:07:05.530> this

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
I did that I was like okay I'm over this

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.640 
I did that I was like okay I'm over this
this<00:07:06.160> makes<00:07:06.400> no<00:07:06.580> sense<00:07:06.910> and<00:07:07.150> the<00:07:08.050> boy<00:07:08.199> started

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
this makes no sense and the boy started

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.960 
this makes no sense and the boy started
toying<00:07:08.860> and<00:07:09.190> I<00:07:09.250> had<00:07:09.400> to<00:07:09.490> start<00:07:09.699> clothes

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
toying and I had to start clothes

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.720 
toying and I had to start clothes
surfing<00:07:10.360> by<00:07:10.479> then
