okay<00:00:45.980> here<00:00:46.250> on<00:00:46.460> simulation<00:00:47.420> for<00:00:48.610> that's<00:00:49.610> so

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
okay here on simulation for that's so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.939 
okay here on simulation for that's so
cool

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
cool

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.520

I think Fairview must be inside a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:44.960 
I think Fairview must be inside a
simulation<00:02:35.510> whole<00:02:36.510> yard<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.260> carpet<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
