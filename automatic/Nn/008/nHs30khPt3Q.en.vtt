created<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.949> managed<00:00:26.250> package<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.670> Salesforce

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
created a managed package in Salesforce

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
created a managed package in Salesforce
it's<00:00:27.300> an<00:00:27.390> online<00:00:27.539> payment<00:00:27.840> payment<00:00:28.619> package

it's an online payment payment package
it's<00:00:29.160> managed<00:00:29.689> but<00:00:30.689> there's<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.050> few

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it's managed but there's a few

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
it's managed but there's a few
interesting<00:00:31.679> pieces<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> wanted

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
interesting pieces of this that I wanted

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.700 
interesting pieces of this that I wanted
to<00:00:33.270> show<00:00:33.480> off<00:00:33.630> today<00:00:33.719> they're<00:00:34.380> interesting

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to show off today they're interesting

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
to show off today they're interesting
from<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> technical<00:00:35.219> perspective<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> package

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
from a technical perspective the package

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.840 
from a technical perspective the package
is<00:00:37.290> managed<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> classes<00:00:38.670> within

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
is managed but all of the classes within

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.959 
is managed but all of the classes within
the<00:00:39.030> package<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:40.399> global<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the package are global and all the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.810 
the package are global and all the
methods<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.540> global<00:00:43.020> virtual<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.550> things

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
methods are global virtual so so things

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.990 
methods are global virtual so so things
can<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.149> overridden<00:00:45.600> within<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> package

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
can be overridden within the package

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.459 
can be overridden within the package
let's<00:00:48.000> take<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> look<00:00:48.690> around<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
let's take a look around here so this is

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.439 
let's take a look around here so this is
a<00:00:49.500> sites<00:00:49.770> page<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:51.030> we've<00:00:51.239> created

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
a sites page that's that we've created

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.110 
a sites page that's that we've created
for<00:00:51.660> registration<00:00:52.289> payments<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.460> talks<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
for registration payments it talks to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
for registration payments it talks to
the<00:00:54.480> payment<00:00:54.930> package<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.410> talk<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> us<00:00:56.100> net

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the payment package can talk to us net

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.479 
the payment package can talk to us net
and<00:00:56.699> PayPal<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.660> payment<00:00:58.020> gateways<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:59.340> this

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and PayPal as payment gateways so this

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.510 
and PayPal as payment gateways so this
sites<00:00:59.730> page<00:01:00.000> hands<00:01:00.449> hands<00:01:01.199> off<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.949> site's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
package for its payment processing so it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.660 
package for its payment processing so it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
cool about it is that we've completely

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
cool about it is that we've completely
abstracted<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.479> talking<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> PayPal<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.170> the

that from from all of the database
processing<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.150> I'll<00:01:39.659> show<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> mean

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
processing and I'll show you what I mean

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.020 
processing and I'll show you what I mean
here<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.740> let's<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.220> take<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> look<00:01:41.790> under<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
here so let's go take a look under the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.780 
here so let's go take a look under the
hood<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> online<00:01:43.560> payments<00:01:44.220> app

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
hood so this is the online payments app

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
hood so this is the online payments app
in<00:01:45.119> Salesforce<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> way<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in Salesforce here we have a way to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.550 
in Salesforce here we have a way to
configure<00:01:47.899> different<00:01:48.899> types<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> payment

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
configure different types of payment

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.690 
configure different types of payment

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
different type of logic and the way that

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.310 
different type of logic and the way that
we've<00:03:17.140> done<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> simple

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
we've done that is is with a simple

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.979 
we've done that is is with a simple
factory<00:03:21.280> pattern<00:03:21.700> here<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.060> we<00:03:22.150> use<00:03:22.420> we

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
factory pattern here and we use we

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.520 
factory pattern here and we use we
creatively<00:03:23.470> we<00:03:23.650> use<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.070> JSON<00:03:24.489> parser<00:03:25.270> to<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
creatively we use the JSON parser to to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.470 
creatively we use the JSON parser to to
do<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.800> so<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.340> JSON<00:03:27.640> parser<00:03:27.970> allows<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.390> to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
do this so the JSON parser allows you to

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.600 
do this so the JSON parser allows you to
basically<00:03:28.920> dynamically<00:03:29.920> instantiate<00:03:30.580> a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
basically dynamically instantiate a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.270 
basically dynamically instantiate a
class<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:32.170> that's<00:03:32.410> exactly<00:03:32.860> what<00:03:33.160> we're

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280

Leadership<00:03:47.560> Institute<00:03:47.680> they<00:03:48.100> needed<00:03:48.459> a

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
Leadership Institute they needed a

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.009 
Leadership Institute they needed a
specific<00:03:48.730> type<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.300> processing<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:49.750> their

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
specific type of processing for their

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.140 
specific type of processing for their
their<00:03:50.560> registration<00:03:51.370> payments<00:03:51.820> which<00:03:51.970> were

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
their registration payments which were

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.550 
their registration payments which were
sort<00:03:52.360> of<00:03:52.450> really<00:03:52.690> unique<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.080> them<00:03:53.230> right<00:03:53.410> this

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
sort of really unique to them right this

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.350 
sort of really unique to them right this
is<00:03:53.680> not<00:03:53.830> generic<00:03:54.190> their<00:03:54.640> business<00:03:54.940> process

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
is not generic their business process

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.630 
is not generic their business process
and<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:55.989> we<00:03:56.230> needed<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.620> create<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:57.160> special

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
and so we needed to create a special

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.640 
and so we needed to create a special
payment<00:03:57.970> processing<00:03:58.480> class<00:03:58.750> which<00:03:59.530> is

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
payment processing class which is

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.120 
payment processing class which is
actually<00:04:00.040> an<00:04:00.160> overwritten<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:02.130> overridden

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
actually an overwritten and a overridden

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.330 
actually an overwritten and a overridden
class<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:04.360> one<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.440> classes<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.070> lives

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
class of one of the classes that lives

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.310 
class of one of the classes that lives
inside<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.660> online<00:04:07.930> payments

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
inside of the the online payments

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.620 
inside of the the online payments
managed<00:04:08.769> package<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.820> we<00:04:09.940> override<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.510> and

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
managed package and we override that and

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.810 
managed package and we override that and
we<00:04:10.690> override<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.110> handful<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.650> methods<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.340> in

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
we override a handful of methods and in

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.580 
we override a handful of methods and in
fact<00:04:13.030> there's<00:04:13.209> only<00:04:13.330> about<00:04:13.480> sixty<00:04:14.200> lines<00:04:14.410> of

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
fact there's only about sixty lines of

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.199 
fact there's only about sixty lines of
code<00:04:14.800> that<00:04:14.830> does<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> overriding<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.120> a

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
code that does the overriding and a

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.810 
code that does the overriding and a
handful<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.019> tests<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:18.280> allows<00:04:18.580> us<00:04:18.609> to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
handful of tests and that allows us to

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.849 
handful of tests and that allows us to
do<00:04:19.000> our<00:04:19.120> own<00:04:19.150> custom<00:04:19.750> processing<00:04:20.260> on<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.709> back

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
do our own custom processing on the back

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.740 
do our own custom processing on the back
end<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.310> database<00:04:21.460> so<00:04:21.970> we<00:04:22.210> create<00:04:22.570> these

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
end in the database so we create these

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.360 
end in the database so we create these
special<00:04:23.169> registration<00:04:23.500> records<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:24.190> things

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
special registration records and things

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.220 
special registration records and things
that<00:04:24.460> are

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
that are

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.710 
that are
unique<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.310> specific<00:04:26.790> client<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.570> we're

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
unique to the specific client that we're

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.850 
unique to the specific client that we're
serving<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.770> really<00:04:29.220> cool<00:04:29.340> ability<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.300> to

serving so a really cool ability to to

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.590 
serving so a really cool ability to to
to<00:04:31.860> have<00:04:32.340> an<00:04:32.460> online<00:04:32.610> payment<00:04:32.910> solution<00:04:33.480> that
