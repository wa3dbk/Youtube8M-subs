00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.000
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.550
 black ops as you are seeing is a trick 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.750
 that is already supposed to be patched but 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.480
 as you are watching we are playing 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.430
 online and we can disable the patches 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.230
 to say it somehow now you are going 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.450
 to see that we are in 1.13 already teach 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.310
 a trick earlier on the map of 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.670
 five doing exactly the same thing 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.500
 as I am watching the update 1.13 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.059
 ok and good now you are going to see the process 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.520
 what needs to be done do we need to have the 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.780
 ps3 pirated or released as you want 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.030
 call him vale we need our 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.309
 playstation if we can not do it 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.600
 it's worth those who have the pirate play 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.070
 you all know the multi bad when 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.870
 we are in the multi- hand we go to the manager 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.550
 of files that is this here is worth and 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.769
 we get this this we are in the play in 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.390
 the pirate movie is worth it and what we do 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.850
 we open a window here and we go 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.429
 to the hd folder from scratch that is our 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.929
 hard drive we go to the game folder 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.640
 ok that's where the 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.010
 authorizations we look for those of the bless 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.600
 1,032 that would be the black ops us 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.580
 let's sink and enter the folder 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.380
 spanish and within the spanish folder 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.909
 here there are quite a few files that are the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.650
 patches that have been putting along 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.480
 of all this time to the game of black 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.880
 ops or the zombies is worth only in the 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.829
 zombies and how are you seeing then all 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.509
 to put zombie zombie zombie all that 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.100
 you have to eliminate it 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.130
 we eliminate all this that are the patches 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.090
 that they have been putting in all this time 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.159
 ok and the next thing we have to 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.500
 do is replace this file there 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.179
 up here I'm going to leave my page 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.189
 web I already said in the previous video worth 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.840
 exactly the same and we use the 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.659
 Same file is worth that file 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.119
 it only works so why not watch totem and 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.189
 for five this file what it does is 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.130
 put say is the activation of the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.319
 patches of 1.02 means that at 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.429
 pass this patch to the folder is 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.289
 where we just deleted all the 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.149
 worth files will tell us that if not 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.610
 we want to replace we say yes and 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.679
 it is already we can play what we are going to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.069
 do will continue if we will continue to have 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.080
 the game at 1.13 but let's say that 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.250
 is the activation of the 1.0 two of the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.560
 patches means that then the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.870
 patches is as if there are no vouchers 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.430
 are activated then we can do 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.890
 the tricks we used to do in the past 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.269
 in previous times although as you are 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.310
 seeing then is as simple as having the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.569
 titan will leave the last lame zombie and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.950
 just when he hits us up here 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.870
 we hit a jump and we're here 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.180
 above the turret this is one of the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.920
 oldest tricks that there are of 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.569
 good of what is the black ops was of 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.599
 The first thing that came out was not to see you 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.549
 and good is a trick that to me in my 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.459
 old channel gave me about three hundred 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.989
 thousand visits so the truth that good was 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.689
 one of the videos that most were in 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.519
 my old channel and good has returned me to 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.319
 like not where we can again 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.689
 turn off the patches as you are seeing 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.549
 in 1.13 we're not doing anything 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.189
 weird about all this usually go pri 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.599
 pirates is worth so good is the only 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.459
 way to be able to do these 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.079
 tricks and as you can see we can play online 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.970
 if we connect talk to a friend 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.220
 well, we can do it, so it's good 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.500
 simply this as I said I have to 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.790
 bring also a couple more teach a couple 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.040
 of tricks more also we can do 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.750
 and good and I will pass another file that is 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.389
 for more tension and so we will be doing 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.219
 all we can of another map is worth 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.120
 so well just this I hope 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.980
 that you liked it if you liked it 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.480
