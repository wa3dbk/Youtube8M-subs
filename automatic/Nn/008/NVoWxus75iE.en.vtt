00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.130
 Hi everyone, today I want to show you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.900
 how to make this pivot that I have 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.150
 created using beads 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.669
 if you want to know how to do it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.849
 the pendant part of this earring vi 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.409
 I recommend watching this other video 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.999
 to make the pin in question 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.749
 you need a needle i'm 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:30.210
 then using a good james measure 12 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.120
 I use the wire I'm using del 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 nylon traced wire like the fire 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.469
 line measures 0.12 mm then you need 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 of rocaille beads and I'm using 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.679
 of the beads measure 15 0 and finally vi 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.219
 need a pin but you feel you are done in 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:53.100
 this way insert 4 beads on the lake 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.579
 rails size 15 0 and take them to the end 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.170
 of the thread then passed again with the lake 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 through the beads several times 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.659
 even three times four times so 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.489
 close the job in a circle on 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.380
 I advise you not to make knots because 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.320
 as the beads are very small 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.640
 you may have problems 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.270
 we start the first lap by entering on 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.940
 lake a bead silver rails 15 0 e 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.350
 then that lake we pass through the pro 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.020
 cai and later 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.460
 in this way and repeat the same 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.460
 pass three more times 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.460
 now I have to insert the last one at work 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 lap bead then I insert the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.370
 bead on the lake and then with the needle step 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 through the next two beads into 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.940
 this way 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.880
 now they start the second round ho 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.450
 inserted on a pair of beads 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.240
 silver measure 15 0 then jump this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.340
 bead and I make the lake pass in the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.760
 next silver sedan in this 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.160
 way and repeat the same step for 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.170
 three more times it's really a lot 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.960
 simple you just have to be careful 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.270
 because we are using beads all in the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.490
 same color 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.250
 now I have to add the last two 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.560
 round beads I inserted the beads 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.630
 on the co and then with the co 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.620
 as usual jump this sedan ed 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.470
 entered the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.379
 next in this way to be 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.200
 ready to start a new lap without 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.019
 add new sedans to the lake I do 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.750
 pass lake through the two beads 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.209
 in this way this is the next 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.069
 result you need to get now for 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.510
 start a new lap I insert on the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.480
 lake a new pair of beads 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.420
 silver and then with the needle step 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 through the next two sedans in 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.730
 this way and I repeat exactly it 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.910
 same passage three more times here 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.859
 here and here 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.959
 now I have to add the last pair 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.629
 of silver beads of this round 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.340
 I insert the beads on the lake and then 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.489
 I make the lake pass 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.920
 be careful here in the following 3 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.510
 silver beads because so in this 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.099
 so I will be ready to start a new one 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.959
 round 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.200
 believe me it's really easy to do 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.060
 as a creation you just have to do 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.560
 very careful because we all have 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.120
 for lines of the same color then it is 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.769
 easy to miss 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.870
 now the last round consists 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.150
 when inserting a silver bead on the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.709
 lake and then with the needle go through 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 the four successive silver beads 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.109
 and then repeat the same passage for 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.280
 three more times here and here 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.500
 now I have to add the last one to 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.510
 bead of the tour I inserted the perina 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.379
 on the agcom as usual I go to pass 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.489
 in the next four beads being 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.049
 the last bead proper of the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.690
 processing now we have to close the 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.669
 job you can ask for it with a node e 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.470
 then I refer you to this video a 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.540
 this tutorial otherwise you can 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.340
 simply brush up on the lines 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.730
 several times until you hear 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.410
 that the thread is well fixed inside 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.239
 of the processing that the beads do not 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.629
 move and then cut the thread in 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.269
 excess I now take my component 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.510
 for earrings and I insert it in the center 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:13.079
 of processing in this way you do 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.079
 beware that the sedan you find 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.000
 here on the vertex of the square minimum is 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.510
 positioned in the center of the ring in 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.340
 this way I realized another 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.990
 component exactly identical to 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.500
 previous just the same 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.419
 and now you have to sew together ddv 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.030
 get out of one of the beads that is 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.030
 found at the top of this square 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.930
 we have these four vertices here and 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.580
 I'm getting out of this bead here 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.310
 now take the two components and there 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.169
 put your own face a 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.830
 face 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:53.190
 ok very simply so i am 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.250
 coming out of this bead and entered into the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.419
 sedan facing in 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.069
 opposite direction 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:04.440
 in this way you see now review 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.520
 in the sedan from which I started 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.909
 in the opposite direction 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.590
 in this way we go to 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:15.810
 connect the two vertices of the two squares 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.139
 and repeat the same passage a couple 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.830
 of times 23 times really a lot 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.840
 simple you just have to be careful 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.550
 now we have connected the first ones 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.789
 first vertex of the two squares 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.580
 we must move forward to move forward 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.849
 step through all the beads of the 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.120
 side of the square until you reach the 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.740
 next summit in this way 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.070
 now I have to repeat exactly that 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.530
 same passage then step with lake 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.550
 through the berlin on purpose 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.440
 ok even pass through the 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.240
 bead from which they started in 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.880
 opposite direction 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.719
 and repeat this passage for two more 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.840
 three times when you arrive at the top that 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.490
 we say surrounded by the ring 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.319
 the steps are exactly the same 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.880
 you only have to go through 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:14.909
 the ring in this way then pass 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.319
 through the bead that is found from 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:21.030
 opposite side of the ring ok 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.039
 direction also opposite to the 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.849
 previous one 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.680
 then pass through the ring is then 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.979
 passed through the bead from 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.570
 which you started in the opposite direction 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.849
 and repeat this passage for others 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.680
 two three times 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.449
 in this way the component 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.300
 ricchini does not move within the 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.100
 processing because then locked for 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.750
 close the job of course you can 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.060
 make a knot otherwise you can pass 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.000
 through the beads several times e 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.009
 cut the thread in excess this is the 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.600
 completed pin I hope it was 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:57.830
 all clear and talk to each other 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.830
 video bye bye bye
