00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
science and basically the way the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.100 
science and basically the way the
science<00:01:13.979> goes<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.270> perfectly

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
science goes is it has to be perfectly

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.020 
science goes is it has to be perfectly
toasted<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.189> same<00:01:17.460> rate<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> it's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
toasted at the same rate that it's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580 
toasted at the same rate that it's
perfectly<00:01:18.420> melted<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.409> too

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
perfectly melted and a little bit too

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.170 
perfectly melted and a little bit too
high<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.040> heat<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.610> gonna<00:01:20.759> work<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
high of heat that's not gonna work in a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.520 
high of heat that's not gonna work in a
little<00:01:21.390> bit<00:01:21.509> too<00:01:21.689> low<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.020> heat<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.290> not

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
little bit too low of heat that's not

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.480 
little bit too low of heat that's not
gonna<00:01:22.650> work<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.040> takes<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
gonna work so it takes a lot of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.190 
gonna work so it takes a lot of
attention<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> detail<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.600> whoever<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.020> on
