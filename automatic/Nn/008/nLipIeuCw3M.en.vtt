the bed chair and that's operated by
like<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> metal<00:00:34.380> lever<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> back<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.340> that

like a metal lever at the back here that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
like a metal lever at the back here that
I<00:00:35.489> literally<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:35.910> pull<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I literally just pull up and that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.470 
I literally just pull up and that
releases<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.670> into<00:00:39.090> each<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.390> its

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
releases it up into each of its

because you can fish with it 365 days a
year<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.140> reason<00:01:42.320> for<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.710> is<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.670> in

year and the reason for that is this in
a<00:01:44.119> skin<00:01:44.420> system<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.440> in<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.619> summer<00:01:45.770> time<00:01:46.100> you

a skin system so in the summer time you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.219 
a skin system so in the summer time you
literally<00:01:46.910> just<00:01:47.150> use<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.540> outer<00:01:47.690> skin<00:01:48.080> this

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
literally just use the outer skin this

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.170 
literally just use the outer skin this
is<00:01:48.290> fully<00:01:48.680> waterproof<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:49.820> don't<00:01:50.030> need<00:01:50.090> a

stop the water getting on it if you're
sitting<00:01:53.300> on<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.140> then<00:01:54.260> in<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.470> winter

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
sitting on it and then in the winter

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.490 
sitting on it and then in the winter
time<00:01:55.040> you'd<00:01:55.520> add<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:55.820> extra<00:01:56.000> skin<00:01:56.390> into<00:01:57.350> it

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
time you'd add this extra skin into it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.530 
time you'd add this extra skin into it
now<00:01:57.830> it's<00:01:58.310> fully<00:01:58.520> reversible<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.420> can

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
now it's fully reversible so you can

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.210 
now it's fully reversible so you can
fish<00:01:59.750> with<00:01:59.930> fleece<00:02:00.170> against<00:02:00.619> your<00:02:00.770> skin<00:02:00.979> or

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
just with this more slippery material i

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.749 
just with this more slippery material i
prefer<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:03.830> one<00:02:04.040> because<00:02:04.160> i<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.430> get<00:02:04.580> out<00:02:04.729> of

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
prefer this one because i can get out of

prefer this one because i can get out of
it<00:02:04.940> easier<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.050> also<00:02:06.200> gives<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:06.680> the

hooks over the bed chair so it's not

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
of it because you get a bite just see

of it because you get a bite just see
there<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.120> got<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.269> crash<00:02:32.540> dip<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.560> get

there it's got a crash dip so you get
straight<00:02:34.100> out<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:35.480> into<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> fish<00:02:36.110> and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
at the top end if I just take you up to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.070 
at the top end if I just take you up to
here<00:02:38.360> let's<00:02:38.600> just<00:02:38.690> zip<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.110> up<00:02:39.230> all<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.280> way<00:02:41.080> up

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
here let's just zip it up all the way up

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.860 
here let's just zip it up all the way up

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
to there but as if on either side so you

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.240 
to there but as if on either side so you
don't<00:02:45.049> have<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.230> keep<00:02:45.380> changing<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.830> round<00:02:46.070> on

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
don't have to keep changing it round on

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.920 
don't have to keep changing it round on
the<00:02:46.340> bed<00:02:46.519> chair<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.330> go<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.600> that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
the bed chair and if we just go to that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.199 
the bed chair and if we just go to that
clip<00:02:48.230> there<00:02:48.500> if<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.459> was<00:02:49.549> going<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.760> get<00:02:49.910> out<00:02:50.030> the

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
clip there if I was going to get out the

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.270 
clip there if I was going to get out the
other<00:02:50.330> side<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.989> then<00:02:51.709> I'll<00:02:51.860> just<00:02:52.070> do<00:02:52.250> that

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
other side of it then I'll just do that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.310 
other side of it then I'll just do that
up<00:02:52.519> so<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.760> doesn't<00:02:53.000> keep<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.299> unzipping<00:02:53.989> on

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
up so it doesn't keep this unzipping on

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.930 
up so it doesn't keep this unzipping on
the<00:02:54.890> side<00:02:55.070> you're<00:02:55.280> not<00:02:55.340> going<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.670> get<00:02:55.730> out<00:02:55.910> of
