00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:03.620
 We will solve the following operation 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.400
 - two 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.220
 5 multiplying ja 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.149
 3-2 plus 4-1 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.039
 below - 3-2 which is multiplying - May 1 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.769
 of this type of operations 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.480
 we have like him 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.650
 a number that is multiplying soap what is inside the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.890
 parentheses in this case on 5 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.630
 and there is another number that is 2 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.710
 that also multiplies everything that this entity the interior of the country 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.350
 the first thing we will have kart to do the test 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.350
 solve the interior of the country 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.890
 to solve the inside of the parenthesis leaves us monte kind of 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.590
 TraiguÃ©n operations 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.070
 we have in the first pair that is 3-2 plus 4-1 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.199
 they are a whole number with a positive sign 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.170
 negative 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 there is no other operation like multiply and divide 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.980
 therefore what I have to do is to the group to 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.890
 the positive numbers 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.890
 and on the other hand from his thousandth party 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.550
 all wrong 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.950
 for now it leaves very good 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.400
 ceacop I love positive number we will have 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 +3 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.160
 +4 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.330
 on the one hand 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.620
 that would be more 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.320
 7 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.310
 and on the other hand Europe mod the negative 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.040
 - 2 - you 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.210
 if we add two with one 3 therefore 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 we will have - 3 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.240
 we integrate the parenthesis 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.650
 then we solve the inside of the next parenthesis 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.249
 all wrong we leave it 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.440
 exactly the same 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.830
 in this case we do not have multiplication operations either 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.110
 we have less a 2-2 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.500
 Mars 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 we all go on the one hand the positive grounds 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.950
 and on the other hand cross we go negative 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.440
 - 1-2 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.240
 and we put hussein 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.299
 2 and one 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.279
 result - 3 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.799
 and we close the panel 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.439
 below as still the parentheses are not resolved in your 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.079
 interior we continue being the operations of the interior of the country 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.199
 in the first pair with each other 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.779
 we have no number with positive sign +7 and the other with a negative sign 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.299
 -3 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.240
 that we are 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.010
 and we put 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.429
 the sign of the greatest number 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.439
 to 7 we remove 3 are four 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.439
 without a larger number 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.400
 what we leave out of the parentheses is very similar and now 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.779
 we continue with the next one for it 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:49.999
 +3 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.249
 - 3 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:52.859
 in this case we have 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.689
 numbers consigned different 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.989
 loan and we put him May terzigno 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.989
 in this case 3-3 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.809
 the operations of the interior of the parentheses returns 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.329
 we went through multiplication 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.039
 says that the addition and subtraction 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.029
 as we have two multiplication he 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.180
 +5 by 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.649
 more 4 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.469
 and -2% 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.909
 it will be the first thing he will do in 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.909
 the rest leaves it very bad 3-2 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.509
 still the same 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.299
 and we perform the ump multiplication operation 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.209
 first the five 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.039
 for more 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.209
 and 5 by 4 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.219
 the -3 as it is not multiplying we leave it exactly the same 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.279
 and then multiply -2 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.930
 in this case less porn - for more - is equal to the result of 0 2 for 0 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:10.339
 next group positive moss on the one hand and negative own 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.339
 positive plus 20 negative 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.120
 finally sub mod and put the sign of the largest number 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.229
 in this case pumps 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.139
 --results
