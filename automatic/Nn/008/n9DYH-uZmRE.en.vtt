00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
to learn what I call each of my

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.310 
to learn what I call each of my
individual<00:00:36.980> tap<00:00:37.280> sounds<00:00:37.730> I<00:00:37.989> promise<00:00:38.989> I'll<00:00:39.170> be

consistent<00:00:39.860> throughout<00:00:39.980> all<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.550> my<00:00:40.730> later

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
consistent throughout all of my later

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.090 
consistent throughout all of my later
videos<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:42.020> even<00:00:42.380> if<00:00:42.470> you<00:00:42.650> might<00:00:42.860> call

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
videos so even if you might call

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.890

something a different name than I do you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.020 
something a different name than I do you
can<00:00:45.080> learn<00:00:45.200> here<00:00:45.710> what<00:00:46.010> I<00:00:46.040> call<00:00:46.460> each<00:00:46.670> sound

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
can learn here what I call each sound

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.000 
can learn here what I call each sound
and<00:00:47.330> then<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:48.170> can<00:00:48.230> be<00:00:48.530> on<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.770> same

and then you and I can be on the same

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.470 
and then you and I can be on the same
page<00:00:49.220> in<00:00:49.460> terms<00:00:49.700> of<00:00:49.880> our<00:00:50.000> tap<00:00:50.240> dance

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
terminology for later videos so let's

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.200 
terminology for later videos so let's
get<00:00:53.420> started<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:55.130> first<00:00:55.160> thing<00:00:55.700> I'd<00:00:55.850> like<00:00:56.030> you

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
tap shoe has a toe tap a heel tap or you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.810 
tap shoe has a toe tap a heel tap or you
could<00:01:05.810> use<00:01:05.930> both<00:01:06.170> taps<00:01:06.590> at<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.979> same<00:01:07.250> time<00:01:07.610> to

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
could use both taps at the same time to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.179 
could use both taps at the same time to
make<00:01:08.000> each<00:01:08.299> sound<00:01:08.659> definitely<00:01:09.590> make<00:01:10.159> sure

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
make each sound definitely make sure

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.100 
make each sound definitely make sure
you're<00:01:10.670> paying<00:01:10.850> attention<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.420> which<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:12.049> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
you're paying attention to which of the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.889 
you're paying attention to which of the
taps<00:01:12.530> if<00:01:12.799> not<00:01:13.159> both<00:01:13.460> you're<00:01:14.119> trying<00:01:14.539> to<00:01:14.719> use

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
taps if not both you're trying to use

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:23.760 
taps if not both you're trying to use
for<00:01:15.320> each<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.829> our<00:01:15.979> one<00:01:16.340> sound<00:01:16.729> tap<00:01:17.060> steps

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.830 

in<00:01:24.770> order<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.250> do<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.490> step<00:01:25.880> you're<00:01:26.450> going<00:01:26.630> to

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
in order to do a step you're going to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.500

use<00:01:26.990> your<00:01:27.260> toe<00:01:27.500> tap<00:01:27.770> only<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.490> shift<00:01:29.030> weight

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.330 

multiple<00:01:32.510> steps<00:01:32.810> would<00:01:33.020> shift<00:01:33.320> feet<00:01:33.950> each

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
multiple steps would shift feet each

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:45.760 
multiple steps would shift feet each
time<00:01:34.820> right<00:01:42.040> in<00:01:43.300> order<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.479> do<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> touch<00:01:45.080> you're

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
not shift waist touch in order to do a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.279 
not shift waist touch in order to do a
stamp<00:02:01.310> you're<00:02:01.910> going<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.509> shift<00:02:02.750> weight<00:02:03.020> like

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
stamp you're going to shift weight like

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.290 
stamp you're going to shift weight like
a<00:02:03.320> step<00:02:03.740> but<00:02:04.160> we're<00:02:04.340> going<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.610> use<00:02:04.789> our<00:02:04.910> full

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
a step but we're going to use our full

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.529 
a step but we're going to use our full
tap<00:02:05.720> toe<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.470> heel<00:02:06.890> at<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.220> same<00:02:07.429> time<00:02:07.729> think

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
tap toe and heel at the same time think

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.259 
tap toe and heel at the same time think
about<00:02:08.899> your<00:02:09.170> arch<00:02:09.440> hitting<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.130> floor<00:02:10.340> step

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
about your arch hitting the floor step

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.560 
about your arch hitting the floor step
and<00:02:11.510> then<00:02:12.470> other<00:02:12.709> foot<00:02:13.070> would<00:02:13.190> be<00:02:13.310> free<00:02:13.580> many

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
and then other foot would be free many

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:24.270 
and then other foot would be free many
stamps<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.500> row<00:02:15.709> would<00:02:16.370> look<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:16.760> marching

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.940 

for<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.310> stop<00:02:25.760> we<00:02:26.450> are<00:02:26.690> not<00:02:27.140> going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.620> shift

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
for a stop we are not going to shift

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.370 
for a stop we are not going to shift
weight<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:28.519> we<00:02:28.640> are<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:29.329> to<00:02:29.480> use<00:02:29.660> our<00:02:29.930> full

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
weight but we are going to use our full

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:45.449 
weight but we are going to use our full
foot<00:02:31.220> both<00:02:31.880> texts<00:02:33.850> if<00:02:34.850> we<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.209> many<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.630> row
