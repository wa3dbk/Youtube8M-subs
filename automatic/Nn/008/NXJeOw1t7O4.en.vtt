00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.399
 and good to all friends of youtube them 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.639
 talk ramirez exc tutorials and this time 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.890
 with a tutorial on how to download the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.519
 call of duty 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:19.170
 1 portable 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.440
 in Spanish and well completely 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.110
 Wifi 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.150
 As you can see here is the link of the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.510
 download if you leave them in the description 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.099
 of the video and they will have an auto file 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.700
 removable 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.160
 so they only give double click 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 and this window will be opened here 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.230
 in examining where they want 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.350
 extract the game in my case I will 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.350
 on a desk I will create a new 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.230
 and they give him in install 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.010
 an indispensable requirement for this is 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.300
 have the winrar which is what it is with 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.900
 open this file 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.260
 and well here is this strange extracting 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.260
 all 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.310
 that is very good game I recommend it 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.560
 the graphics are not current 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.659
 but good not because I do not have good 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.920
 graphics means that it is not a good 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.180
 game 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.180
 the new one in play 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.359
 waiting for 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.310
 did not pass the video because they have reached me 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.070
 comments 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.280
 telling me that when he passed the videos 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.900
 I do other things to serve and everything 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.480
 and then not 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.040
 they say that the files serve us or not 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.320
 I know then here you are seeing that yes 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.320
 and if you are extracting everything and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.379
 the next tutorial will be about how dzeko 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.379
 the west that you see here 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.560

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 is call of dutty in important Spanish 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.790
 because he will have these files 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.960

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.550

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.310

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.970

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.950
 they are going to open and the one that says code mp is going to 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:07.099
 be the multiplayer 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.099

 I'm recording 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.450
 can see the game is tied in 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.560
 fullscreen 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.989

 if you are seeing it 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.329

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.329
