passionate<00:00:37.020> fan<00:00:37.230> bases<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:38.000> little<00:00:39.000> bit<00:00:39.090> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
passionate fan bases a little bit of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.760 
passionate fan bases a little bit of
rust<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.660> team's<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.079> led<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> kind<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
rust on the team's that led to kind of a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.740 
rust on the team's that led to kind of a
not<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> most<00:00:41.280> exciting<00:00:41.430> first<00:00:41.940> half<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.510> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
not the most exciting first half but I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
not the most exciting first half but I
think<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> big<00:00:43.350> takeaways<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> game

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
think the big takeaways from the game

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.610 
think the big takeaways from the game
are<00:00:44.570> surprisingly<00:00:45.570> poor<00:00:45.899> game<00:00:46.140> by<00:00:46.289> Victor

year that they were a very good team
last<00:03:42.709> year<00:03:42.859> with<00:03:43.099> based<00:03:43.579> on<00:03:43.790> just<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.180> defense

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
last year with based on just a defense

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.599 
last year with based on just a defense
and<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.840> running<00:03:45.139> game<00:03:45.319> now<00:03:45.829> they've<00:03:46.129> added<00:03:46.459> a

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609

the<00:03:49.400> same<00:03:49.609> injury<00:03:49.909> concerns<00:03:50.269> for<00:03:50.599> peyton

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
the same injury concerns for peyton

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.569 
the same injury concerns for peyton
manning<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.379> everybody<00:03:51.709> else<00:03:51.889> seems<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.250> I

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
manning that everybody else seems to I

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.369 
manning that everybody else seems to I
think<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.120> Broncos<00:03:53.479> get<00:03:53.629> through<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.930> AFC

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
think the Broncos get through the AFC

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.469 
think the Broncos get through the AFC
and<00:03:54.590> on<00:03:54.949> the<00:03:55.040> other<00:03:55.129> side<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.669> think<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:56.419> the

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:56.479 
and on the other side I think that the

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.759 
and on the other side I think that the
packers<00:03:56.720> are<00:03:56.959> going<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.199> be<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.379> class<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.680> the

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
packers are going to be the class of the

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.189 
packers are going to be the class of the
NFC<00:03:58.099> yet<00:03:58.310> again<00:03:58.579> maybe<00:03:59.030> not<00:03:59.150> have<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.690> 15<00:04:00.079> in

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
NFC yet again maybe not have that 15 in

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.539 
NFC yet again maybe not have that 15 in
one<00:04:00.379> season<00:04:00.650> but<00:04:00.979> they're<00:04:01.099> going<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.250> turn<00:04:01.400> it

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549
