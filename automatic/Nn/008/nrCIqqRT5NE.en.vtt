00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 just like the iphone did last week 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 Apple presented her latest product 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.750
 the apple board on their website 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.000
 describe the clock as that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 most personal product ever 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 have made and exactly from this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.550
 reason is it for each style one 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.859
 give appropriate clock for each person 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.130
 a matching electronic bracelet 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.320
 That's why there are exactly three jewels 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 different ones up for him a good one 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.130
 Actually, there are only three 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.900
 different types of people or 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.740
 People who buy apple products as 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.660
 Of course, there are the first ones 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.300
 super-rich are an 18- karat 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.960
 gold only for about 11,000 euros plus 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.989
 to buy 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 which can be exactly the same as the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.960
 cheap rest on anyway you can 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.110
 so of course in millionaire's club or 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.420
 probably indicate cool in golf club 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.800
 no idea the second clock he is for 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.480
 the athletic people are thought too 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.920
 a little cheaper and has seemingly 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.840
 functions with which one, so to speak 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.789
 can measure how far you have gone 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.960
 and also offers goals as one 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.760
 can improve I think it's great 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.109
 I actually think it sounds plausible 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.030
 and of course there are those 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.979
 normal for the normal apple fanboy 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.049
 neither very rich nor special 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 Sporty is probably through the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.500
 but still lose weight if you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.729
 first 100 euros for a clock 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.229
 it probably will be spent 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.490
 be quite difficult the rest 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.590
 of the month to be able to afford it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.939
 no matter what sense this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.920
 but i have a whole 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.170
 asked another question who wears today 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.310
 still wristwatches from practical 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.530
 I mean we have ours 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.180
 smartphone anyway 24/7 here and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.420
 why should I then extra money 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.130
 spend a watch the same 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.020
 I can and probably less 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.939
 My good apple watch may have heartbeats 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.079
 but in principle, the thing can 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.790
 even with heartbeats 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.560
 be more disappointing than just once 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.210
 news if you do not give anyone one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.310
 very personal heartbeat sends and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.920
 then read this confirmation 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 but does not get back heartbeat 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 read back that the person is not dead 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.100
 may be someone who is not dead 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.140
 a heartbeat and someone's one 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.159
 heartbeat and not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.159
 sent back then 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.759
 but maybe someone of you has 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.890
 I could go out there sometime 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.750
 Comments write what sense this 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.610
 So there is some sense in the clock 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.799
 which this clock can fulfill for me 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.230
 can not imagine being honest 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.620
 except as a status icon as well as the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.620
 iphone 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.600
 I mean some people buy it 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.920
 also because they just like it better 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.840
 or because maybe in some 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.670
 score better or different than 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 maybe cheaper alternatives though 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.120
 Let's face it, buy some people 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.210
 the thing is definitely because it is 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.010
 either young hip young stayed rich 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.510
 or want to act trendy that is one 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.340
 a bit like adult men 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.770
 middle 40 suddenly start to cap 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.180
 wear and everything with the word cool to 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.290
 But they also do that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.720
 pronounce the same way 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.910
 cool or cool women who want to show 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.250
 how crazy are and with 35 again 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.630
 100% crazy tattoo on the forearm 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.810
 leave only with the difference that it 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.180
 the iphone somehow acts alone 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.550
 In the last quarter, over 75 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.650
 millions of iPhones are sold 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.350
 It's like having a German one 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.700
 iphone from lower saxony sorry 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.470
 Lower Saxony so what can we now 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.420
 learn from it that apple products 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.100
 tend to be more expensive than others 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.020
 did we know and that some are the ones 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.460
 Just buy things as status symbols 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.480
 also and to be around 11 I think so too 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.610
 really not bad if someone 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.140
 simply better by an object 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.190
 feels so long so does not indicate and 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.150
 a blatant goes on the nerves 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.680
 more important on the other 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.120
 Do not dazzle something like that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.260
 except you may see that 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.450
 sense behind an apple watch or 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.920
 just like me somehow just the point 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.180
 not quite that writes me on everyone 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.950
 fall into the comments because I 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.020
 I really would like to know if I'm the only one 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.610
 I do not understand that or if it is 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.960
 maybe even good reasons 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.790
 There is a clock for that to buy 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.380
 and why everyone barely has such a profession 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.030
 has I know if I won the video 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.540
 me of course with my thumb after 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.980
 look up 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.810
 Here below comes again to mine 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.560
 both last videos and I would 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.240
 say yes 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.930
 thank you for watching, we see ourselves 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.930
 soon 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.140
 cool
