00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.200
 and intestinal cleansing 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.090
 According to experts, most of the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.660
 health disorders are a consequence 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.790
 of a toxic colon because simply 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.919
 because the tradition of eating and drinking 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.790
 meals loaded with condoms 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:34.220
 chemical white flour sugar fat 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.670
 mucous foods that are products 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.860
 milk derivatives tobacco alcohol and still 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.170
 the air we breathe causes a 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.710
 accumulation of stagnant fecal matter 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.200
 in the intestinal tract the colon is a 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.360
 drainage system but by negligence 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.390
 and abuse becomes a dumpster 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.480
 when it's clean and normal we're fine 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.960
 and happy let it stagnate and distill 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.739
 poisons fermentation and rot 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.950
 poisoning the brain and the system 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.530
 nervous the heart the lungs and the 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.130
 blood the digestive organs in order 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.079
 the whole body in general imagine if 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.649
 they do not brush their teeth for 5 months 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.920
 what would happen with your mouth imagine if not 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.799

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.130
 would happen with his body that same thing is 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.140
 pass 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.140
 with your body inside in your system 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.170
 intestinal did you know that in ten 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.689
 people eight have parasites earthworms 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.929
 if you do not believe it just read the book by 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.329
 author at luis guillÃ³n in 10 walking to 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.960

 fecal matter excrement crap in the 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.119
 wise colon is here a piece of meat 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.149
 it rots faster in the colon than 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.679
 If you leave it outside the refrigerator 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.170
 Did you know that the chicken you buy in 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.090
 your supermarket sometimes brings hormones 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.390
 that can cause problems and 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.670
 hormonal imbalances in your body 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.369
 in short, did you know that death 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.009
 begins in the colon and if there is one 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.870
 intestinal cleansing little by little is 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.640
 committing suicide 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.950
 the accumulation of fecal matter can 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.720
 cause a state of putrefaction that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.920
 It can result in many diseases 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.019
 like diabetes inflammation of the liver 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.950
 fatigue, overweight, constipation 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.520
 wrinkles premature aging 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.340
 infections 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.090
 pressure physical cholesterol defects 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.090
 weak lungs unpleasant odors 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.730
 dark circles headaches migraines cancer 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.420
 skin problems like psoriasis acne 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.940
 and much more last year more than 150,000 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.820
 people died colon cancer in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.460
 this country doctor john christopher 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.010
 international scientist and author of 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.230
 several nutrition books states that the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.200
 Most diseases are the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.010
 result of intoxication and deficiencies 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.010
 in the body 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.780
 [Applause] 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.640
 we are really not only what we eat 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.730
 but also what we said and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.760
 we eliminate remember not everything 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.800
 come in , you have to remember that everything 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.430
 what we eat we have to digest it and 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.890
 eliminate it within 24 to 32 hours the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.130
 Chronic constipation increases the risk 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.600
 of breast cancer in women 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.940
 remember that the body does not heal unless 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.100
 that is clean inside throw him 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.890
 medicines and food to a dirty body 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.320
 it's like eating from a dirty dish on 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.010
 famous doctor of james a remarkable 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.320
 Colon specialist says the following 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.170
 in my opinion there is only one 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.840
 illness and that disease is the auto 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.630
 intoxication the body poisoning if a 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.000
 itself is the crap our system 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.370
 that kills us I'm convinced that a 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.040
 unless you cleanse your colon it never goes 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.230
 to enjoy good health we are like a 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.410
 you would not buy a new car 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.970
 and never change the oil then 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.970
 because you do not also make a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.800
 change of oil to your body 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.110
 remember no matter how many 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.209
 we see the car on the outside if it does not 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.150
 we change the oil to the engine with the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.430
 time that engine is going to upset itself 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.350
 same is with our body all the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.260
 days when we get up we bathe 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.450
 we clean the body on the outside but never 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.550
 it occurs to us to clean it inside and there 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.550
 There is the detail as cantinflas used to say
