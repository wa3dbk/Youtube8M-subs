00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
rookie Jabari Parker now Jabari Parker

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.240 
rookie Jabari Parker now Jabari Parker
did<00:00:13.889> get<00:00:14.130> drafted<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.820> bucks<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:16.250> well

did get drafted to the bucks and well

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.660 
did get drafted to the bucks and well
these<00:00:17.789> are<00:00:18.060> his<00:00:18.240> stats<00:00:18.510> according<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> me<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.130> do

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
these are his stats according to me I do

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.650 
these are his stats according to me I do
think<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> 79<00:00:22.350> overall<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.580> he<00:00:24.570> has

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
think it will be a 79 overall and he has

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
think it will be a 79 overall and he has
not<00:00:24.900> played<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> game<00:00:25.439> yet<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> NBA<00:00:26.369> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
not played a game yet in the NBA so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.390 
not played a game yet in the NBA so
these<00:00:26.970> stats<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.960> by<00:00:28.199> how<00:00:28.980> he<00:00:29.039> has

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
these stats are going by how he has

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.990 
these stats are going by how he has
played<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.060> his<00:00:30.599> college<00:00:31.080> years<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:32.000> that's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
played in his college years so that's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.440 
played in his college years so that's
how<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.680> estimated<00:00:34.680> those<00:00:34.890> stats<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.550> didn't

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
how I estimated those stats I didn't

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.200 
how I estimated those stats I didn't
think<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.690> did<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:36.960> expect<00:00:37.110> him<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:38.129> go<00:00:38.340> past<00:00:38.790> 80

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
think I did not expect him to go past 80

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.350 
think I did not expect him to go past 80
because<00:00:40.050> usually<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> pay<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> rookies

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
because usually and to pay the rookies

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
because usually and to pay the rookies
don't<00:00:42.690> pass<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.140> either<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.309> best<00:00:44.550> ones<00:00:44.789> are

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
don't pass it either the best ones are

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
don't pass it either the best ones are
usually<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> 70s<00:00:45.989> range<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.680> just

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
usually in the 70s range and that's just

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.569 
usually in the 70s range and that's just
how<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.280> goes<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.760> how<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> 79<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
how it goes is how it is so 79 is a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.060 
how it goes is how it is so 79 is a
pretty<00:00:51.449> good<00:00:51.750> overall<00:00:52.110> rating<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.710> Jabari

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
pretty good overall rating for Jabari

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850

the<00:00:56.010> NBA<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.789> believe<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.480> his<00:00:57.719> overall

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the NBA I do believe that his overall

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
the NBA I do believe that his overall
rating<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> roster

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
rating will go up with the roster

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.990 
rating will go up with the roster
updates<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.109> NBA<00:01:01.440> 2k<00:01:01.890> usually<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:02.520> every

updates that NBA 2k usually has every
now<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> that's<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.400> i

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
now and then so that's that's what i

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.810 
now and then so that's that's what i
expect<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.119> him<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:08.010> i<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.369> expect

um it's not exactly his this is what i'm

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.770 
um it's not exactly his this is what i'm
using<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.689> NBA<00:01:31.290> 2k14<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:32.579> give<00:01:32.790> him<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.570> 2

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
using from NBA 2k14 to give him but in 2

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.649 
using from NBA 2k14 to give him but in 2
K<00:01:33.930> 15<00:01:34.140> K<00:01:34.380> probably<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.369> his<00:01:35.549> own<00:01:35.790> set<00:01:36.420> up

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
K 15 K probably will have his own set up

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.069 
K 15 K probably will have his own set up
shots<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.320> stuff<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.329> but<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.780> for

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
shots and stuff like that but just for

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.160

now<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.590> using<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.659> think<00:01:43.020> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
now I'm using that so I do think that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490 
now I'm using that so I do think that
these<00:01:43.710> shots<00:01:44.520> these<00:01:44.970> dance<00:01:45.299> other<00:01:45.720> things<00:01:46.229> all

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
these shots these dance other things all

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.470 
these shots these dance other things all
these<00:01:46.680> things<00:01:46.740> are

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
these things are

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.850 
these things are
pretty<00:01:47.660> accurate<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:49.070> Jabari<00:01:49.490> Parker<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:50.860> also
