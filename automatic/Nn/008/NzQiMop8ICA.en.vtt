the<00:01:03.719> hdmi<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:06.049> 1.8

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the hdmi now this one is about 1.8

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.160 
the hdmi now this one is about 1.8
meters<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.640> long<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.750> after<00:01:10.020> let

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
meters so it is very long but after let

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.649 
meters so it is very long but after let
you<00:01:10.290> know<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.010> very<00:01:11.250> flexible<00:01:11.659> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
you know that it is very flexible so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.240 
you know that it is very flexible so
it's<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> other<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> i<00:01:13.979> have

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it's not like the other one that i have

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.880 
it's not like the other one that i have
it<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> very<00:01:15.030> clunky<00:01:15.420> i<00:01:15.840> should<00:01:16.619> say<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.860> very

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it is very clunky i should say it's very

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.399 
it is very clunky i should say it's very
big<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.659> compared<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> this

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
big the other one and compared to this

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.249 
big the other one and compared to this
one<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.909> there's<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.810> huge

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
one as you can see there's a huge

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.660 
one as you can see there's a huge
difference<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.950> between<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.380> thickness<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
difference in between the thickness and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.870 
difference in between the thickness and
also<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.000> does<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:27.810> quality<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
also it does the same quality as the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.420 
also it does the same quality as the
other<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:32.250> lot
