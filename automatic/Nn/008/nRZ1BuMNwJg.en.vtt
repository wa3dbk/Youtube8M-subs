hello<00:00:01.050> everyone<00:00:01.620> some<00:00:02.460> time<00:00:02.490> ago<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.300> decided

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hello everyone some time ago I decided

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.860 
hello everyone some time ago I decided
to<00:00:04.500> take<00:00:04.859> these<00:00:05.130> old<00:00:05.580> batteries<00:00:06.359> from<00:00:06.629> some

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to take these old batteries from some

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.919 
to take these old batteries from some
phones<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.529> don't<00:00:07.740> use<00:00:07.919> anymore<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.809> for<00:00:09.809> that

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
phones I don't use anymore and for that

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.930 
phones I don't use anymore and for that
project<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.860> used<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.880> little<00:00:12.360> thing<00:00:12.950> so<00:00:13.950> this

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
project I used this little thing so this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.570 
project I used this little thing so this
is<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.949> light<00:00:16.949> power<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.940> Sparkfun<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:20.130> what

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
is the light power from Sparkfun it what

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.380 
is the light power from Sparkfun it what
it<00:00:20.699> does<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.720> takes<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:23.000> 3<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.150> 4

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it does is that it takes the 3 or 4

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.570 
it does is that it takes the 3 or 4
volts<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.900> comes<00:00:25.199> out<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.890> battery

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
volts that comes out of this battery

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.650 
volts that comes out of this battery
pack<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.680> converts<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.060> 5<00:00:30.060> volts<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:30.630> is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
pack and converts it to 5 volts which is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.160 
pack and converts it to 5 volts which is
suitable<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.590> charging<00:00:32.520> phones<00:00:33.440> with<00:00:34.440> USB

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
suitable for charging phones with USB

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.160 
suitable for charging phones with USB
but<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:38.070> problem<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.600> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
but the problem with that is that it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.819 
but the problem with that is that it
costed<00:00:40.860> me<00:00:40.890> 20<00:00:41.760> euros<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> for

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
costed me 20 euros or you can get it for

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.680 
costed me 20 euros or you can get it for
nineteen<00:00:44.370> ninety<00:00:44.670> five<00:00:44.820> bucks<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> have

live in the US for that price you can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.880 
live in the US for that price you can
get<00:00:48.450> any<00:00:48.690> USB<00:00:49.260> powered<00:00:49.890> battery<00:00:50.370> charger<00:00:51.059> and

get any USB powered battery charger and
of<00:00:52.890> course<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.660> use

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
of course then you don't have to use

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.910 
of course then you don't have to use
your<00:00:55.530> own<00:00:55.800> batteries<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.770> get

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
your own batteries so if you want to get

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.020 
your own batteries so if you want to get
away<00:00:59.039> cheaper<00:00:59.670> we<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:01.020> look<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.559> some

alternatives to this little thing so
here<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.820> two<00:01:09.090> gadgets<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.320> ordered

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
here we have two gadgets for I ordered

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.270 
here we have two gadgets for I ordered
from<00:01:11.130> dealextreme<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.330> China<00:01:13.070> they<00:01:14.070> might

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
from dealextreme in China they might

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
from dealextreme in China they might
look<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> same<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.659> very

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
look the same but they are actually very

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.760 
look the same but they are actually very
different<00:01:17.540> we<00:01:18.540> are<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.900> interested<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
different we are more interested in this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.420 
different we are more interested in this
one<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.360> boost<00:01:21.900> converter<00:01:22.430> then

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
one because it's a boost converter then

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
one because it's a boost converter then
this<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.600> hand<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> buck

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
this one on the other hand is a buck

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.090 
this one on the other hand is a buck
converter<00:01:26.180> which<00:01:27.409> transforms<00:01:28.409> down<00:01:28.710> higher

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
converter which transforms down higher

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.230 
converter which transforms down higher
voltage<00:01:29.670> into<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> lower<00:01:30.390> voltage<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> one

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
voltage into a lower voltage so this one

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.420 
voltage into a lower voltage so this one
actually<00:01:33.390> only<00:01:33.869> cost<00:01:34.229> 6<00:01:34.619> bucks

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
actually only cost 6 bucks

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870 
actually only cost 6 bucks
in<00:01:35.759> contrast<00:01:36.390> hey<00:01:36.990> 20<00:01:37.710> bucks<00:01:37.740> Park<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:38.640> one

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
in contrast hey 20 bucks Park for one

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.840 
in contrast hey 20 bucks Park for one
and<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.509> also<00:01:39.720> differs<00:01:40.049> from<00:01:40.470> Sparkfun<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.520> in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and it also differs from Sparkfun one in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
and it also differs from Sparkfun one in
the<00:01:42.000> sense<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.229> handle<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.680> much

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the sense that this can handle a much

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310 
the sense that this can handle a much
higher<00:01:44.130> current<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.540> cannot<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.170> two

question is if

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.920 
question is if
one<00:02:13.920> has<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> stable<00:02:14.910> enough<00:02:15.180> voltage<00:02:15.870> to

one has a stable enough voltage to
charge<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.950> phone<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.360> doesn't<00:02:18.870> drift<00:02:19.260> too

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
charge a phone so it doesn't drift too

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.510 
charge a phone so it doesn't drift too
much<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.790> USB<00:02:21.570> spec<00:02:21.840> says<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:23.340> voltage

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
much the USB spec says that the voltage

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.010 
much the USB spec says that the voltage
of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.180> USB<00:02:24.480> port<00:02:25.020> my<00:02:25.410> very<00:02:25.920> about<00:02:26.660> 5%<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:27.900> I

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
of the USB port my very about 5% if I

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.720 
of the USB port my very about 5% if I
remember<00:02:28.620> they<00:02:29.040> are<00:02:29.160> quite<00:02:29.490> high

remember they are quite high

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.640 
remember they are quite high
requirements<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.870> want<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.200> charge<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
requirements if you want to charge a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.280 
requirements if you want to charge a
phone<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.580> ripple<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.330> Hyden<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.050> will

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
phone if the ripple is to Hyden it will

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.040 
phone if the ripple is to Hyden it will
disturb<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.040> touchscreen<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.690> can't

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
disturb the touchscreen so so you can't

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.050 
disturb the touchscreen so so you can't
use<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.470> touchscreen<00:02:37.710> while<00:02:38.430> while<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
use the touchscreen while while the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.650 
use the touchscreen while while the
phone<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.420> charging<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.820> we<00:02:41.820> will<00:02:42.000> see<00:02:42.270> if<00:02:42.450> this

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
phone is charging so we will see if this

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.540 
phone is charging so we will see if this
one<00:02:42.960> actually<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:44.490> be<00:02:44.700> used<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.450> charge<00:02:45.720> phone

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
one actually can be used to charge phone

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.940 
one actually can be used to charge phone
so<00:02:47.550> now<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.850> have<00:02:48.240> got<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.660> converter<00:02:49.080> set<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
so now I have got the converter set and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.130 
so now I have got the converter set and
the<00:02:50.670> first<00:02:50.910> thing<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.240> will<00:02:51.390> do<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.720> measure<00:02:51.960> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the first thing I will do is measure the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.890 
the first thing I will do is measure the
voltage<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.920> battery<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.760> about<00:02:54.000> 4<00:02:54.420> volts

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
voltage of the battery to about 4 volts

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.600 
voltage of the battery to about 4 volts
then<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:56.040> will<00:02:56.400> move<00:02:56.670> my<00:02:57.150> meter<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.980> output

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
then I will move my meter to the output

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.160 
then I will move my meter to the output
and<00:03:00.740> see<00:03:01.740> which<00:03:02.370> range<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.180> thing<00:03:03.420> has<00:03:03.630> so

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and see which range this thing has so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.390 
and see which range this thing has so
the<00:03:04.350> lowest<00:03:04.500> output<00:03:04.920> voltage<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.790> 3.7<00:03:06.660> and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
the lowest output voltage is 3.7 and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:15.110 
the lowest output voltage is 3.7 and
let's<00:03:08.400> turn<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.880> up<00:03:12.590> yes<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.220> goes<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:14.790> lit

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
let's turn it up yes and it goes is lit

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.110 
let's turn it up yes and it goes is lit
about<00:03:15.480> 9<00:03:15.780> volts<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:17.160> bulb<00:03:17.460> is<00:03:17.610> rated<00:03:18.000> at

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
about 9 volts and this bulb is rated at

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.100 
about 9 volts and this bulb is rated at
9<00:03:18.630> volts<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.710> will<00:03:19.980> disconnect<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.910> here<00:03:21.240> so

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
9 volts so I will disconnect it here so

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.690 
9 volts so I will disconnect it here so
we<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.410> see<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:22.890> voltage<00:03:23.010> does<00:03:23.490> not

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
we can see that the voltage does not

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.790 
we can see that the voltage does not
change<00:03:23.940> too<00:03:24.270> much<00:03:24.480> when<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.780> connect<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.560> bulb

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
change too much when I connect the bulb

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.990 
change too much when I connect the bulb
and<00:03:26.480> we<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:28.740> some<00:03:29.040> extra<00:03:29.130> position<00:03:29.880> if

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
and we can have some extra position if

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.170 
and we can have some extra position if
we<00:03:30.150> want<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.890> got<00:03:32.190> 2<00:03:32.400> decimals<00:03:32.910> on<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
we want so now I got 2 decimals on the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.960 
we want so now I got 2 decimals on the
meter<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.110> see<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:35.070> only<00:03:35.280> goes<00:03:35.670> down

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
meter and you see that it only goes down

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.840 
meter and you see that it only goes down
just<00:03:36.210> a<00:03:36.600> little<00:03:36.630> when<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.380> connect<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.370> bulb<00:03:38.580> so

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
just a little when I connect the bulb so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.670 
just a little when I connect the bulb so
it's<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.510> good<00:03:39.660> thing<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.170> voltage<00:03:40.470> does

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
it's a good thing that the voltage does

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.670 
it's a good thing that the voltage does
not<00:03:40.890> drop<00:03:41.100> too<00:03:41.370> much<00:03:41.870> but<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:42.960> will<00:03:43.140> continue<00:03:43.500> to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
not drop too much but I will continue to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.730 
not drop too much but I will continue to
turn<00:03:44.040> up<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.520> screw<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.780> see<00:03:45.990> how<00:03:46.230> high<00:03:46.500> it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
turn up the screw to see how high it

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.210 
turn up the screw to see how high it
really<00:03:47.160> gets<00:03:50.240> so<00:03:51.240> it<00:03:51.390> stopped<00:03:51.720> at<00:03:51.990> 38<00:03:52.740> volts

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
really gets so it stopped at 38 volts

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.280 
really gets so it stopped at 38 volts
which<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.460> quite<00:03:54.000> impressive<00:03:54.300> if<00:03:54.810> we<00:03:55.110> think

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
which is quite impressive if we think

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.260 
which is quite impressive if we think
about<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.100> maximum<00:03:56.670> rated<00:03:57.120> output

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
about that the maximum rated output

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.310 
about that the maximum rated output
voltage<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.380> 35<00:03:59.130> volts<00:03:59.700> and<00:04:00.290> yeah<00:04:01.290> I

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
voltage of this is 35 volts and yeah I

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.160 
voltage of this is 35 volts and yeah I
mean<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:02.040> input<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.880> minimum<00:04:03.330> in<00:04:03.480> fittest<00:04:03.840> 4

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
mean the input the minimum in fittest 4

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.320 
mean the input the minimum in fittest 4
volts<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:04.830> are<00:04:04.980> basically<00:04:05.670> living<00:04:05.850> on<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
volts so we are basically living on the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.320 
volts so we are basically living on the
limit<00:04:06.660> there<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.140> this<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.040> good<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:08.880> see

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
limit there and this is good but see

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:19.009 
limit there and this is good but see
what<00:04:09.450> happens<00:04:09.870> when<00:04:10.050> hook<00:04:10.290> up<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.590> load<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:11.220> this

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.810 

another<00:04:20.019> cool<00:04:20.290> usage<00:04:20.680> for<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.010> converter<00:04:21.400> is

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
another cool usage for the converter is

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.630 
another cool usage for the converter is
to<00:04:22.030> try<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.270> power<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.990> stereo<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:24.160> normally

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
to try to power this stereo it normally

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.600 
to try to power this stereo it normally
runs<00:04:24.940> off<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.210> six<00:04:25.900> batteries<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:27.310> gives

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
runs off of six batteries and that gives

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.960 
runs off of six batteries and that gives
us<00:04:27.760> nine<00:04:28.330> volts<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.590> if<00:04:30.010> we<00:04:30.250> use<00:04:30.490> this<00:04:30.700> is<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
us nine volts so if we use this is the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.930 
us nine volts so if we use this is the
battery<00:04:31.390> emulator<00:04:32.490> yeah<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.550> see<00:04:33.790> the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
battery emulator yeah you see the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.240 
battery emulator yeah you see the
voltage<00:04:34.270> drops<00:04:34.600> just<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.990> little<00:04:35.320> when<00:04:35.770> we<00:04:35.950> turn

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
voltage drops just a little when we turn

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.500 
voltage drops just a little when we turn
on<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.610> thing<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:38.370> then<00:04:39.370> we<00:04:39.610> turn<00:04:40.090> on<00:04:40.240> some

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
on the thing and then we turn on some

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.679 
on the thing and then we turn on some
music

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:47.689 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.330 

you<00:04:48.689> hear<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.169> there<00:04:49.319> is<00:04:49.379> a<00:04:49.469> stupid<00:04:50.039> coil

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
you hear that there is a stupid coil

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.429 
you hear that there is a stupid coil
wine<00:04:50.639> coming<00:04:51.060> from<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.419> converter<00:04:51.780> all<00:04:52.139> the

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
wine coming from the converter all the

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.580 
wine coming from the converter all the
time<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:53.240> as<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.419> heard<00:04:54.569> when<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:54.960> turn<00:04:55.379> on

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
time and as you heard when we turn on

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.020 
time and as you heard when we turn on
the<00:04:55.770> music<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:57.539> coil<00:04:57.840> wine<00:04:58.199> actually<00:04:59.030> gets

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
the music the coil wine actually gets

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.350 
the music the coil wine actually gets
louder<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> music<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:01.979> so<00:05:02.729> that's<00:05:02.909> quite<00:05:03.300> a

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
louder to the music so so that's quite a

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:14.430 
louder to the music so so that's quite a
cool

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.750 

so<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.500> answer<00:05:15.710> my<00:05:16.100> question<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.700> the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
so to answer my question in the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.150 
so to answer my question in the
beginning<00:05:17.240> of<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.510> video<00:05:17.660> can<00:05:18.320> you<00:05:18.350> charge<00:05:18.830> a

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
beginning of the video can you charge a

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.540 
beginning of the video can you charge a
phone<00:05:19.520> with<00:05:19.880> this<00:05:20.150> thing<00:05:20.420> and<00:05:21.220> well<00:05:22.220> that

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
phone with this thing and well that

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.410 
phone with this thing and well that
really<00:05:22.790> depends<00:05:23.300> on<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:23.960> ripple<00:05:24.380> that<00:05:24.620> means

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
really depends on the ripple that means

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.170 
really depends on the ripple that means
if<00:05:26.420> there<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:26.750> any<00:05:26.990> noise<00:05:27.200> in<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.770> voltage<00:05:28.490> so

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
if there is any noise in the voltage so

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.850 
if there is any noise in the voltage so
I<00:05:29.210> don't<00:05:29.450> have<00:05:29.570> an<00:05:29.720> austrial<00:05:30.230> scope<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.650> test

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
I don't have an austrial scope to test

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.970 
I don't have an austrial scope to test
that<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:31.640> I<00:05:31.970> will<00:05:32.210> just<00:05:32.390> charge<00:05:32.960> my<00:05:33.320> stupid

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
that so I will just charge my stupid

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:40.390 
that so I will just charge my stupid
phone<00:05:37.090> there<00:05:38.090> nothing<00:05:38.300> yeah<00:05:38.600> yes<00:05:39.500> yes<00:05:39.800> yes

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
phone there nothing yeah yes yes yes

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.780 
phone there nothing yeah yes yes yes
Oh<00:05:40.930> Derek<00:05:41.930> charges<00:05:42.500> um<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.970> as<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:44.210> said<00:05:45.640> aha<00:05:46.670> a

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
Oh Derek charges um and as I said aha a

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.430 
Oh Derek charges um and as I said aha a
200<00:05:47.450> all<00:05:47.840> yes<00:05:48.110> if<00:05:48.380> all<00:05:48.590> this<00:05:48.770> went<00:05:49.070> down<00:05:49.160> there

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
200 all yes if all this went down there

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.060 
200 all yes if all this went down there
as<00:05:51.440> I<00:05:51.650> said<00:05:51.920> a<00:05:52.160> too<00:05:52.580> high<00:05:52.760> ripple<00:05:53.920> disturbs<00:05:54.920> the

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
as I said a too high ripple disturbs the

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.470 
as I said a too high ripple disturbs the
touchscreen<00:05:55.490> because<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.090> touchscreen

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
touchscreen because the touchscreen

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.290 
touchscreen because the touchscreen
reads<00:05:57.140> the<00:05:57.470> small<00:05:57.770> voltage<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.640> conductive

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
reads the small voltage and conductive

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.640 
reads the small voltage and conductive
nosov<00:05:59.720> your<00:06:00.680> fingers<00:06:01.160> so<00:06:02.170> really<00:06:03.170> a<00:06:03.200> ripple

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
nosov your fingers so really a ripple

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.630 
nosov your fingers so really a ripple
can<00:06:03.890> really<00:06:04.190> disturb<00:06:04.640> the<00:06:04.820> touchscreen<00:06:05.210> much

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
can really disturb the touchscreen much

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.300 
can really disturb the touchscreen much
but<00:06:07.640> I<00:06:07.760> mean<00:06:07.910> really<00:06:08.120> it<00:06:08.420> works<00:06:08.780> great<00:06:09.310> the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
but I mean really it works great the

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.470 
but I mean really it works great the
voltage<00:06:10.640> lift<00:06:10.910> down<00:06:11.270> a<00:06:11.300> bit<00:06:12.850> but<00:06:13.850> as<00:06:14.150> long<00:06:14.450> as

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
voltage lift down a bit but as long as

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.720 
voltage lift down a bit but as long as
it's<00:06:14.780> stable<00:06:15.380> at<00:06:15.470> four<00:06:15.770> point<00:06:16.010> eight<00:06:16.220> one<00:06:16.490> and

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
it's stable at four point eight one and

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.290 
it's stable at four point eight one and
doesn't<00:06:17.480> worry<00:06:17.900> um<00:06:18.460> well<00:06:19.460> it's<00:06:19.610> a<00:06:19.700> good<00:06:19.820> good

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
doesn't worry um well it's a good good

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.320 
doesn't worry um well it's a good good
thing<00:06:20.570> it<00:06:21.440> has<00:06:21.680> some<00:06:21.950> bad<00:06:22.460> noise<00:06:22.820> and<00:06:23.240> the

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
thing it has some bad noise and the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.080 
thing it has some bad noise and the
voltage<00:06:23.780> release<00:06:24.200> it's<00:06:25.190> done<00:06:25.490> we<00:06:25.700> can<00:06:25.880> turn

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
voltage release it's done we can turn

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.930 
voltage release it's done we can turn
the<00:06:26.240> workshop<00:06:26.840> but<00:06:27.830> you<00:06:27.980> can<00:06:28.130> see<00:06:28.310> charging

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
the workshop but you can see charging

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:37.860 
the workshop but you can see charging
well

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.810 

okay<00:06:38.650> now<00:06:38.830> we<00:06:38.889> have<00:06:39.010> a<00:06:39.160> little<00:06:39.370> higher<00:06:39.580> voltage

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
okay now we have a little higher voltage

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.220 
okay now we have a little higher voltage
really<00:06:42.820> no<00:06:42.940> problems<00:06:43.419> whatsoever

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
really no problems whatsoever

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.120 
really no problems whatsoever
so<00:06:45.220> as<00:06:45.340> you<00:06:45.520> saw<00:06:45.760> earlier<00:06:46.560> when<00:06:47.560> I<00:06:47.650> put<00:06:47.919> the

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
so as you saw earlier when I put the

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.100 
so as you saw earlier when I put the
thing<00:06:48.460> to<00:06:48.729> charging<00:06:49.389> the<00:06:49.479> voltage<00:06:49.840> really

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
thing to charging the voltage really

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.250 
thing to charging the voltage really
went<00:06:50.290> down<00:06:50.560> a<00:06:50.590> bit<00:06:50.800> and<00:06:51.190> if<00:06:52.120> we<00:06:52.360> want<00:06:52.690> it<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:52.990> be

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
went down a bit and if we want it to be

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.740 
went down a bit and if we want it to be
according<00:06:53.770> to<00:06:53.919> usb<00:06:54.430> specs<00:06:54.760> the<00:06:55.360> voltage

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
according to usb specs the voltage

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:03.330 
according to usb specs the voltage
should<00:06:55.780> be<00:06:56.229> between<00:06:58.470> 5.25<00:06:59.470> and<00:07:01.169> 4.75<00:07:02.169> volts<00:07:02.770> so

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
should be between 5.25 and 4.75 volts so

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.520 
should be between 5.25 and 4.75 volts so
I<00:07:03.370> mean<00:07:03.850> now<00:07:04.000> it's<00:07:04.240> in<00:07:04.449> the<00:07:04.570> upper<00:07:04.870> limit<00:07:05.050> and

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
I mean now it's in the upper limit and

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.689 
I mean now it's in the upper limit and
and<00:07:06.520> when<00:07:06.970> I<00:07:07.060> plug<00:07:07.300> it<00:07:07.479> in<00:07:08.100> it<00:07:09.100> keeps<00:07:09.430> the

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:09.699 
and when I plug it in it keeps the

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.120 
and when I plug it in it keeps the
voltage<00:07:10.120> yeah<00:07:10.870> I<00:07:10.900> mean<00:07:11.229> how<00:07:11.410> it<00:07:11.530> isn't<00:07:11.860> went

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
voltage yeah I mean how it isn't went

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.969 
voltage yeah I mean how it isn't went
out<00:07:12.370> under<00:07:12.790> five<00:07:13.450> but<00:07:14.110> yeah<00:07:14.260> I<00:07:14.290> mean<00:07:14.650> it<00:07:14.800> keeps

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:14.979 
out under five but yeah I mean it keeps

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.670 
out under five but yeah I mean it keeps
the<00:07:15.190> voltage<00:07:15.580> in<00:07:15.940> range<00:07:16.270> for<00:07:16.690> the<00:07:16.810> USB<00:07:17.050> specs

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
the voltage in range for the USB specs

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.580 
the voltage in range for the USB specs
so<00:07:17.979> that's<00:07:18.160> a<00:07:18.310> good<00:07:18.460> thing<00:07:18.810> but<00:07:19.810> of<00:07:20.050> course<00:07:20.380> the

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
so that's a good thing but of course the

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.230 
so that's a good thing but of course the
question<00:07:21.100> is<00:07:21.190> can<00:07:21.430> you<00:07:21.490> live<00:07:21.850> with<00:07:22.060> it

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
question is can you live with it

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.830 
question is can you live with it
breaking<00:07:23.080> sound<00:07:23.590> I<00:07:23.979> mean<00:07:24.520> really<00:07:25.180> this<00:07:25.630> is

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
breaking sound I mean really this is

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.469 
breaking sound I mean really this is
this<00:07:26.350> is<00:07:26.560> really<00:07:26.830> high<00:07:27.040> now<00:07:27.340> I<00:07:27.610> think<00:07:28.180> if<00:07:28.330> I

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 
this is really high now I think if I

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.570 
this is really high now I think if I
turn<00:07:28.780> the<00:07:28.960> voltage<00:07:29.139> down<00:07:29.710> a<00:07:29.740> little<00:07:30.130> it<00:07:30.370> will

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580 
turn the voltage down a little it will

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.879 
turn the voltage down a little it will
get<00:07:30.789> a<00:07:32.430> little<00:07:33.430> better<00:07:33.789> but<00:07:34.660> really<00:07:35.050> that<00:07:35.560> that

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
get a little better but really that that

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.420 
get a little better but really that that
was<00:07:36.490> the<00:07:36.699> worse<00:07:36.910> now<00:07:37.470> will<00:07:38.470> this<00:07:38.680> is<00:07:38.889> bad<00:07:39.100> too

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430
