00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
feel as heavy as you think it ought to

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.749 
feel as heavy as you think it ought to
which<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.350> nice<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.979> weren't<00:01:07.189> unbalanced<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
really get in your view too much which

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.139 
really get in your view too much which
is<00:01:13.850> pretty<00:01:14.179> neat<00:01:14.590> we're<00:01:15.590> powered<00:01:15.859> by<00:01:16.039> a<00:01:16.789> pair

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
is pretty neat we're powered by a pair

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.679 
is pretty neat we're powered by a pair
of<00:01:17.209> double-a<00:01:17.630> batteries<00:01:18.049> for<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.350> one<00:01:18.560> and

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
of double-a batteries for this one and

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.779 
of double-a batteries for this one and
the<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:21.590> overall<00:01:21.859> build<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.219> it<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.399> very<00:01:22.520> nice

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
the the overall build of it is very nice

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.059 
the the overall build of it is very nice
it's<00:01:23.240> not<00:01:23.539> it's<00:01:23.899> not<00:01:24.079> overly<00:01:24.469> heavy<00:01:24.679> but<00:01:24.979> it

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
it's not it's not overly heavy but it

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:28.330 
it's not it's not overly heavy but it
feels<00:01:25.310> solid<00:01:25.609> we've<00:01:25.999> got<00:01:26.209> rubber<00:01:27.219> gasket<00:01:28.219> on

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
feels solid we've got rubber gasket on

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.769 
feels solid we've got rubber gasket on
the<00:01:28.459> hot<00:01:28.639> shoe<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:29.209> and<00:01:30.549> rubberized<00:01:31.779> ports

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:32.779 
the hot shoe here and rubberized ports

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:38.620 
the hot shoe here and rubberized ports
on<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.049> side<00:01:33.259> here<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:35.619> overall<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:36.649> think<00:01:37.630> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
on the side here so overall I think the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.709 
on the side here so overall I think the
design<00:01:38.959> definitely<00:01:39.439> complements<00:01:40.389> the<00:01:41.389> build

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
design definitely complements the build

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.179 
design definitely complements the build
quality<00:01:41.899> of<00:01:42.079> their<00:01:42.350> top<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.740> flashes

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
quality of their top and flashes

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.410 
quality of their top and flashes
recently<00:01:43.549> we<00:01:43.639> also<00:01:43.759> have<00:01:43.939> a<00:01:43.999> rubber<00:01:44.209> gasket

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
recently we also have a rubber gasket

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.120 
recently we also have a rubber gasket
inside<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.109> battery<00:01:45.439> compartment<00:01:45.469> so

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
inside the battery compartment so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.010 
inside the battery compartment so
they're<00:01:46.700> saying<00:01:46.939> that<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.209> weather<00:01:47.719> sealing

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
they're saying that the weather sealing

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.569 
they're saying that the weather sealing
will<00:01:48.319> be<00:01:48.409> maintained<00:01:48.889> when<00:01:49.099> you<00:01:49.189> put<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.429> on<00:01:49.549> a

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
will be maintained when you put it on a

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.109 
will be maintained when you put it on a
1-series<00:01:50.090> body<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.439> on<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.799> 5d<00:01:52.189> 3<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.729> all

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
1-series body and on the 5d 3 and all

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.169 
1-series body and on the 5d 3 and all
that<00:01:53.270> sort<00:01:53.539> of<00:01:53.569> stuff<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:55.490> design<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:56.029> it

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
that sort of stuff so the design of it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.190 
that sort of stuff so the design of it
is<00:01:56.439> actually<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.740> mirror<00:01:58.399> image<00:01:58.579> of<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.299> 600px

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
is actually a mirror image of the 600px

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.379 
is actually a mirror image of the 600px
r/t<00:02:00.799> flash<00:02:01.130> itself<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.729> that's<00:02:01.909> pretty<00:02:02.119> cool

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389 
r/t flash itself so that's pretty cool

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.149 
r/t flash itself so that's pretty cool
once<00:02:03.020> you've<00:02:03.139> got<00:02:03.289> one<00:02:03.469> figured<00:02:03.799> out<00:02:03.919> you

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
once you've got one figured out you

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.409 
once you've got one figured out you
pretty<00:02:04.340> much<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.759> other<00:02:04.969> one<00:02:05.119> figured

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:05.419 
pretty much have the other one figured

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:06.609 
pretty much have the other one figured
out<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:05.749> you<00:02:05.810> don't<00:02:05.899> have<00:02:06.079> to<00:02:06.229> worry<00:02:06.409> too<00:02:06.590> much

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
out so you don't have to worry too much

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.389 
out so you don't have to worry too much
about<00:02:06.770> that

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
about that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.809 
about that
the<00:02:08.090> menu<00:02:08.509> system<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.899> pretty<00:02:09.110> intuitive<00:02:09.819> down

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
the menu system is pretty intuitive down

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.850 
the menu system is pretty intuitive down
here<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.269> have<00:02:11.450> an<00:02:11.629> on/off<00:02:12.200> unlock<00:02:12.650> switch

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
here we have an on/off unlock switch

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.290 
here we have an on/off unlock switch
you<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:14.520> when<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.730> lights<00:02:14.910> up<00:02:15.090> it's

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
you can see when it lights up it's

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.880 
you can see when it lights up it's
bright<00:02:15.510> green<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.140> also<00:02:16.290> change<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.830> to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
bright green you can also change this to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.820 
bright green you can also change this to
orange<00:02:17.810> or<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.170> orange<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.710> when

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
orange or you can have orange for when

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.890 
orange or you can have orange for when
it's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.070> slave<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.820> green<00:02:21.540> when<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
it's a slave and green when it's a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.360 
it's a slave and green when it's a
master<00:02:22.380> or<00:02:22.410> something<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.220> can

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
master or something like that you can

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.820 
master or something like that you can
pick<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.610> choose<00:02:23.990> but<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.080> menu<00:02:25.320> system<00:02:25.680> is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
pick and choose but the menu system is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.220 
pick and choose but the menu system is
as<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.400> said<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:26.700> pretty<00:02:26.880> intuitive<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:28.020> four

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
as I said it's pretty intuitive the four

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.600 
as I said it's pretty intuitive the four
buttons<00:02:28.560> across<00:02:28.740> here<00:02:29.100> actually<00:02:29.460> aren't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
buttons across here actually aren't

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.070 
buttons across here actually aren't
physically<00:02:30.210> labeled<00:02:30.630> they're<00:02:30.780> labeled

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
physically labeled they're labeled

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.470 
physically labeled they're labeled
on-screen<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:31.980> their<00:02:32.190> function<00:02:33.030> changes

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
on-screen so their function changes

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.420 
on-screen so their function changes
depending<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.930> which<00:02:34.110> mode<00:02:34.320> you're<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
depending on which mode you're in and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.030 
depending on which mode you're in and
then<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> normal<00:02:36.780> scroll<00:02:37.230> wheel<00:02:37.830> in

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
then you have the normal scroll wheel in

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.240 
then you have the normal scroll wheel in
the<00:02:38.130> middle<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:39.470> yep<00:02:40.500> all<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> menu

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the middle here yep all of the menu

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.660 
the middle here yep all of the menu
functions<00:02:42.320> are<00:02:43.320> fairly<00:02:43.680> obvious<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
functions are fairly obvious and and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.130 
functions are fairly obvious and and
similar<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.780> what<00:02:45.810> we've<00:02:46.080> seen<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> 580<00:02:48.140> x2

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
similar to what we've seen on the 580 x2

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.280 
similar to what we've seen on the 580 x2
in<00:02:49.560> some<00:02:49.860> ways<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.790> lot<00:02:51.209> easier<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.870> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
in some ways but a lot easier to to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.900 
in some ways but a lot easier to to
delve<00:02:52.500> into<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.890> different<00:02:53.190> menus<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.760> now

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
delve into the different menus and now

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.650 
delve into the different menus and now
when<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.600> go<00:02:54.750> into<00:02:54.930> things<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
when we go into things like the the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.390 
when we go into things like the the
custom<00:02:58.080> function<00:02:58.440> menu<00:02:58.620> like<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:58.920> one<00:02:59.250> right

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
custom function menu like this one right

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400 
custom function menu like this one right
here<00:02:59.459> we<00:03:00.000> actually<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.540> some<00:03:00.780> description

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
here we actually have some description

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.370 
here we actually have some description
as<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.790> what<00:03:02.970> each<00:03:03.180> function<00:03:03.450> does<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.170> so

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
as to to what each function does now so

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.810 
as to to what each function does now so
it's<00:03:04.530> not<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> mystery<00:03:05.370> anymore<00:03:05.459> you

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
it's not really a mystery anymore you

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.670 
it's not really a mystery anymore you
won't<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.330> always<00:03:06.900> have<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.440> flash

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
won't have to always have the flash

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.440 
won't have to always have the flash
manual<00:03:08.100> with<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.520> your<00:03:08.640> camera<00:03:08.850> bag<00:03:08.970> so

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
manual with you in your camera bag so

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.910 
manual with you in your camera bag so
it's<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.350> lot<00:03:10.530> easier<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.950> use<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.459> respect

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
it's a lot easier to use in that respect

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.660 
it's a lot easier to use in that respect
moving<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:15.270> flash<00:03:15.540> itself<00:03:16.459> take<00:03:17.459> this

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
moving on to the flash itself take this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.150 
moving on to the flash itself take this
shoe<00:03:18.239> off<00:03:20.239> physically<00:03:21.350> very<00:03:22.350> slightly<00:03:22.709> larger

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
shoe off physically very slightly larger

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.509 
shoe off physically very slightly larger
than<00:03:23.190> my<00:03:24.120> old<00:03:24.540> 580<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.920> particular<00:03:26.190> this

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
than my old 580 the in particular this

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.180 
than my old 580 the in particular this
part<00:03:26.850> here<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.989> now<00:03:28.230> seems<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.709> 200

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
part here it now seems to 200

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.830 
part here it now seems to 200
millimeters<00:03:29.670> where<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.239> old<00:03:30.390> one<00:03:30.570> was<00:03:30.690> only

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
millimeters where the old one was only

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.170 
millimeters where the old one was only
135<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.040> that's<00:03:32.190> no<00:03:32.370> doubt<00:03:32.549> added<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
135 so that's no doubt added to the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.430 
135 so that's no doubt added to the
physical<00:03:33.690> size<00:03:33.930> here

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
physical size here

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.100 
physical size here
the<00:03:34.799> body<00:03:35.040> itself<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.580> not<00:03:35.930> physically<00:03:36.930> too

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
the body itself is not physically too

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.740 
the body itself is not physically too
different<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.650> size<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:38.430> quite<00:03:39.239> different<00:03:39.630> in

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
different in size but quite different in

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.949 
different in size but quite different in
in<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> button<00:03:40.470> layout<00:03:40.680> obviously<00:03:41.810> again<00:03:42.810> we

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
it we have some colored gels so it's a

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.469 
it we have some colored gels so it's a
it's<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.070> little<00:04:23.280> booklet<00:04:23.460> unfortunately<00:04:24.360> they

it's a little booklet unfortunately they

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.880 
it's a little booklet unfortunately they
only<00:04:24.510> give<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.900> two<00:04:25.169> different<00:04:25.410> colors<00:04:25.860> of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
only give you two different colors of

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.260 
only give you two different colors of
gels<00:04:26.250> even<00:04:26.760> though<00:04:26.849> there's

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
gels even though there's

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.150 
gels even though there's
more<00:04:27.630> pockets<00:04:28.020> than<00:04:28.199> that<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.560> there<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.919> don't

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
more pockets than that in there I don't

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.260 
more pockets than that in there I don't
really<00:04:29.310> know<00:04:29.430> why<00:04:29.580> they<00:04:29.729> did<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:30.210> it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
really know why they did that but it

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.230 
really know why they did that but it
seems<00:04:30.860> seems<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:32.069> an<00:04:32.220> unnecessary<00:04:32.340> shortcut

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
seems seems like an unnecessary shortcut

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.939 
seems seems like an unnecessary shortcut
really<00:04:33.509> for<00:04:33.690> such<00:04:33.810> an<00:04:33.930> expensive<00:04:34.410> flash<00:04:34.710> so

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
really for such an expensive flash so

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.439 
really for such an expensive flash so
they<00:04:35.250> give<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.639> little<00:04:35.880> bag<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.210> put<00:04:36.300> it

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
they give you this little bag to put it

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.460 
they give you this little bag to put it
in<00:04:36.569> and<00:04:36.830> we<00:04:37.830> have<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.009> gel<00:04:38.340> holder<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.349> is

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
in and we have a gel holder so this is

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.040 
in and we have a gel holder so this is
the<00:04:40.530> first<00:04:40.770> time<00:04:41.009> canon<00:04:41.970> have<00:04:42.120> provided<00:04:42.599> gels

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
the first time canon have provided gels

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.439 
the first time canon have provided gels
they're<00:04:43.860> finally<00:04:44.220> catching<00:04:44.550> up<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.699> nikon<00:04:45.330> in

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
they're finally catching up to nikon in

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.330 
they're finally catching up to nikon in
that<00:04:45.599> respect<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.229> basically<00:04:46.830> put<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.130> gel

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
that respect you basically put the gel

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.059 
that respect you basically put the gel
in<00:04:47.490> here<00:04:47.789> hook<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.479> onto<00:04:48.599> the<00:04:48.750> bottom<00:04:49.110> clips<00:04:49.889> on

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
in here hook it onto the bottom clips on

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.580 
in here hook it onto the bottom clips on
the<00:04:50.160> top<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:51.110> sensor<00:04:52.110> under<00:04:52.349> here

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
the top like that sensor under here

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.890 
the top like that sensor under here
actually<00:04:53.280> determines<00:04:53.789> which<00:04:54.090> gel<00:04:54.449> is<00:04:54.660> in

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
actually determines which gel is in

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.050 
actually determines which gel is in
there<00:04:55.139> and<00:04:55.380> when<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.039> camera<00:04:56.520> well<00:04:56.729> sorry

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
there and when the camera well sorry

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.240 
there and when the camera well sorry
when<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.330> flash<00:04:57.569> is<00:04:57.750> on<00:04:57.870> one<00:04:58.440> of<00:04:58.560> canons<00:04:58.979> new

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
when the flash is on one of canons new

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.370 
when the flash is on one of canons new
cameras<00:04:59.759> from<00:05:00.180> 2012<00:05:00.690> onwards<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.229> we're

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
cameras from 2012 onwards so we're

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.999 
cameras from 2012 onwards so we're
talking<00:05:01.470> 1<00:05:02.340> DX<00:05:02.639> 5<00:05:03.000> d3<00:05:03.509> the<00:05:04.440> flash<00:05:04.680> will

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
talking 1 DX 5 d3 the flash will

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.909 
talking 1 DX 5 d3 the flash will
communicate<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.789> camera<00:05:06.410> which<00:05:07.410> gel<00:05:07.770> is

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
communicate to the camera which gel is

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.920 
communicate to the camera which gel is
in<00:05:08.099> there<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:08.580> it<00:05:08.940> will<00:05:09.060> then<00:05:09.210> automatically

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
in there and it will then automatically

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.379 
in there and it will then automatically
set<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:11.099> white<00:05:11.400> balance<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:11.970> that's<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.210> pretty

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
set the white balance so that's a pretty

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.379 
set the white balance so that's a pretty
neat<00:05:12.570> feature<00:05:13.550> one<00:05:14.550> shortcoming<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.210> saw

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
neat feature one shortcoming I saw

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.730 
neat feature one shortcoming I saw
immediately<00:05:15.930> though<00:05:16.080> which<00:05:16.289> I<00:05:16.410> was<00:05:16.530> quite

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
immediately though which I was quite

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.659 
immediately though which I was quite
disappointed<00:05:17.340> about<00:05:17.430> was<00:05:19.310> during<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.400> launch

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
disappointed about was during the launch

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.999 
disappointed about was during the launch
of<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:21.000> system<00:05:21.419> Canon<00:05:21.990> made<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.229> big<00:05:22.530> deal<00:05:22.770> of

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
of the system Canon made a big deal of

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.830 
of the system Canon made a big deal of
the<00:05:23.729> fact<00:05:23.759> that<00:05:24.090> this<00:05:24.150> was<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.330> 2-way

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
the fact that this was a 2-way

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.809 
the fact that this was a 2-way
communicating<00:05:25.590> system<00:05:26.009> so<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.310> flash<00:05:26.550> can

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
communicating system so the flash can

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.450 
communicating system so the flash can
actually<00:05:27.120> talk<00:05:27.389> back<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.770> on-camera

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
actually talk back to the on-camera

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.580 
actually talk back to the on-camera
transmitter<00:05:29.970> and<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.380> it<00:05:31.380> communicates

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
transmitter and that it communicates

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.879 
transmitter and that it communicates
things<00:05:32.250> like<00:05:32.580> when<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:33.240> is<00:05:33.620> recharged<00:05:34.620> and

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
things like when this is recharged and

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.659 
things like when this is recharged and
recycled<00:05:35.789> and<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.479> get<00:05:36.630> an<00:05:36.720> audible<00:05:37.080> beep<00:05:37.139> on

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
recycled and you get an audible beep on

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.800 
recycled and you get an audible beep on
on-camera<00:05:38.669> which<00:05:38.849> is<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.030> nice<00:05:39.270> feature<00:05:39.509> but

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
on-camera which is a nice feature but

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.200 
on-camera which is a nice feature but
they<00:05:39.990> they<00:05:40.770> haven't<00:05:41.130> taken<00:05:41.400> that<00:05:41.610> two-way

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
they they haven't taken that two-way

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.629 
they they haven't taken that two-way
communication<00:05:43.099> to<00:05:44.099> all<00:05:44.130> of<00:05:44.490> its

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
communication to all of its

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.879 
communication to all of its
possibilities<00:05:45.060> in<00:05:45.509> my<00:05:45.630> opinion<00:05:46.050> for<00:05:46.830> example

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
possibilities in my opinion for example

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.950 
possibilities in my opinion for example
as<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.430> said<00:05:47.460> when<00:05:47.789> this<00:05:47.880> flash<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.210> on<00:05:48.479> camera

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
as I said when this flash is on camera

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.779 
as I said when this flash is on camera
with<00:05:49.139> a<00:05:49.169> gel<00:05:49.469> and<00:05:49.500> it<00:05:49.770> communicates<00:05:50.159> to<00:05:50.669> the

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
with a gel and it communicates to the

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.430 
with a gel and it communicates to the
camera<00:05:51.210> what<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.690> white<00:05:51.840> balance<00:05:52.050> should<00:05:52.380> be

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
camera what the white balance should be

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.909 
camera what the white balance should be
I<00:05:53.310> don't<00:05:53.909> see<00:05:54.090> why<00:05:54.389> in<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:54.870> case<00:05:55.320> when<00:05:55.800> the

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
I don't see why in that case when the

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.189 
I don't see why in that case when the
camera<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.490> when<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.180> flash<00:05:57.419> is<00:05:57.630> off-camera

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
camera is when the flash is off-camera

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.560 
camera is when the flash is off-camera
why<00:05:58.979> it<00:05:59.039> also<00:05:59.610> can't<00:05:59.880> use<00:05:59.969> this<00:06:00.210> two-way

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
why it also can't use this two-way

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.529 
why it also can't use this two-way
communication<00:06:01.349> to<00:06:01.740> communicate<00:06:02.370> via<00:06:03.150> the

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
communication to communicate via the

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.170 
communication to communicate via the
transmitter<00:06:04.229> back<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.680> camera<00:06:05.070> the<00:06:05.820> exact

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
transmitter back to the camera the exact

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.540 
transmitter back to the camera the exact
same<00:06:06.389> information<00:06:06.599> so<00:06:07.219> unfortunately<00:06:08.219> that

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
same information so unfortunately that

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.430 
same information so unfortunately that
isn't<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:08.909> case<00:06:09.060> when<00:06:09.509> you're<00:06:09.780> using<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.169> gel

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
isn't the case when you're using the gel

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.980 
isn't the case when you're using the gel
remotely<00:06:11.370> you<00:06:11.580> have<00:06:11.759> to<00:06:11.880> dial<00:06:12.150> in<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.599> white

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
remotely you have to dial in the white

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.959 
remotely you have to dial in the white
balance<00:06:13.169> manually<00:06:14.099> on<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:14.430> camera<00:06:14.729> so<00:06:14.880> that's

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
balance manually on the camera so that's

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:17.890 
balance manually on the camera so that's
a<00:06:15.150> real<00:06:15.300> missed<00:06:15.539> trick<00:06:15.810> if<00:06:16.050> you<00:06:16.680> ask<00:06:16.889> me

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
a real missed trick if you ask me

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.420 
a real missed trick if you ask me
another<00:06:18.900> little<00:06:19.199> thing<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.560> note<00:06:19.770> at<00:06:20.099> the<00:06:20.219> same

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
another little thing to note at the same

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.589 
another little thing to note at the same
time<00:06:22.430> whilst<00:06:23.430> they<00:06:23.580> provide<00:06:23.909> all<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.240> options

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
time whilst they provide all the options

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.120 
time whilst they provide all the options
to<00:06:24.780> change<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:25.169> power<00:06:25.349> settings<00:06:25.860> and<00:06:26.070> all

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
to change the power settings and all

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.529 
to change the power settings and all
this<00:06:26.250> sort<00:06:26.400> of<00:06:26.520> stuff<00:06:26.699> via<00:06:26.909> the<00:06:27.090> transmitter

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
this sort of stuff via the transmitter

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.390 
this sort of stuff via the transmitter
for<00:06:27.719> some<00:06:27.870> reason<00:06:28.199> they<00:06:28.620> don't<00:06:28.800> allow<00:06:29.099> you<00:06:29.159> to

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
for some reason they don't allow you to

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.760 
for some reason they don't allow you to
manually<00:06:29.849> zoom<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:30.900> head<00:06:31.169> of<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.500> remote

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
manually zoom the head of the remote

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.249 
manually zoom the head of the remote
flash<00:06:32.099> so<00:06:32.460> as<00:06:32.639> I<00:06:33.060> said<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.389> zooms<00:06:33.630> to<00:06:33.810> 200

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
flash so as I said the zooms to 200

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.719 
flash so as I said the zooms to 200
millimeters<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:34.860> if<00:06:35.070> you<00:06:35.190> were<00:06:35.279> using<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:35.669> as

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
millimeters and if you were using it as

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.129 
millimeters and if you were using it as
a<00:06:35.789> rim<00:06:36.029> light<00:06:36.060> or<00:06:36.360> something<00:06:36.539> like<00:06:36.719> that

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
a rim light or something like that

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.689 
a rim light or something like that
it<00:06:37.529> would<00:06:37.770> have<00:06:37.860> been<00:06:37.979> really<00:06:38.159> neat<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.490> be

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
it would have been really neat to be

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.550 
it would have been really neat to be
able<00:06:38.849> to<00:06:39.000> control<00:06:39.419> the<00:06:39.599> zoom<00:06:39.839> of<00:06:40.080> each

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
able to control the zoom of each

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.210 
able to control the zoom of each
remotely<00:06:41.040> from<00:06:41.430> the<00:06:41.610> transmitter<00:06:42.120> and<00:06:43.220> you

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
remotely from the transmitter and you

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.780 
remotely from the transmitter and you
know<00:06:44.340> maybe<00:06:45.230> adjust<00:06:46.230> the<00:06:46.800> the<00:06:46.830> spread<00:06:47.520> effect

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
know maybe adjust the the spread effect

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.480 
know maybe adjust the the spread effect
of<00:06:47.940> your<00:06:48.030> room<00:06:48.389> light<00:06:48.600> or<00:06:48.930> or<00:06:49.710> anything<00:06:50.220> like

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
of your room light or or anything like

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.810 
of your room light or or anything like
that<00:06:50.520> it's<00:06:51.180> a<00:06:51.330> real<00:06:51.540> mystery

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
that it's a real mystery

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.980 
that it's a real mystery
well<00:06:53.820> if<00:06:53.970> you<00:06:54.090> ask<00:06:54.270> me<00:06:55.610> overall<00:06:56.610> though<00:06:56.910> I'm<00:06:57.570> so

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
well if you ask me overall though I'm so

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.510 
well if you ask me overall though I'm so
far<00:06:58.230> pretty<00:06:58.440> impressed<00:06:58.800> with<00:06:58.889> the<00:06:59.040> system<00:06:59.400> it

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
far pretty impressed with the system it

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.930 
far pretty impressed with the system it
really<00:06:59.790> really<00:07:00.600> puts<00:07:00.870> the<00:07:01.020> fun<00:07:01.200> back<00:07:01.260> into

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
really really puts the fun back into

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.760 
really really puts the fun back into
single<00:07:02.940> flash<00:07:03.180> off-camera<00:07:03.720> lighting<00:07:04.500> it's<00:07:04.650> a

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
single flash off-camera lighting it's a

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.890 
single flash off-camera lighting it's a
simple<00:07:05.160> system<00:07:05.520> to<00:07:05.639> use<00:07:05.910> you<00:07:06.450> can<00:07:06.570> get<00:07:06.660> it<00:07:06.810> up

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
simple system to use you can get it up

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.170 
simple system to use you can get it up
and<00:07:07.050> running<00:07:07.110> in<00:07:07.410> just<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:07.650> few<00:07:07.860> minutes<00:07:08.160> and<00:07:08.400> I

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
and running in just a few minutes and I

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.820 
and running in just a few minutes and I
was<00:07:09.419> having<00:07:09.570> great<00:07:10.050> fun<00:07:10.290> with<00:07:10.440> it<00:07:10.530> last<00:07:10.680> night

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
was having great fun with it last night

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.090 
was having great fun with it last night
on<00:07:11.130> my<00:07:11.340> 5d<00:07:11.940> mark<00:07:12.210> 3<00:07:12.350> there's<00:07:13.350> definitely<00:07:13.800> a<00:07:13.830> few

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 
on my 5d mark 3 there's definitely a few

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.480 
on my 5d mark 3 there's definitely a few
features<00:07:14.550> which<00:07:15.889> really<00:07:16.889> benefit<00:07:17.460> from

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
features which really benefit from

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.340 
features which really benefit from
having<00:07:17.760> a<00:07:17.970> newer<00:07:18.150> camera<00:07:18.419> so<00:07:18.750> the<00:07:18.840> on-screen

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
having a newer camera so the on-screen

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.350 
having a newer camera so the on-screen
menus<00:07:19.800> that<00:07:19.919> you<00:07:20.010> get<00:07:20.220> with<00:07:20.370> the<00:07:20.490> 5d<00:07:20.880> 3<00:07:21.180> and<00:07:21.300> the

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
menus that you get with the 5d 3 and the

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.540 
menus that you get with the 5d 3 and the
1d<00:07:21.690> x<00:07:21.840> and<00:07:22.110> all<00:07:22.200> the<00:07:22.410> cameras<00:07:22.830> moving<00:07:23.040> forwards

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
1d x and all the cameras moving forwards

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.280 
1d x and all the cameras moving forwards
makes<00:07:24.120> it<00:07:24.270> a<00:07:24.330> lot<00:07:24.419> easier<00:07:24.720> to<00:07:24.750> control<00:07:24.960> the

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.290 
makes it a lot easier to control the

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.290 
makes it a lot easier to control the
functions<00:07:25.740> but<00:07:26.580> it<00:07:26.669> still<00:07:26.880> worked<00:07:27.090> really

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
functions but it still worked really

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.750 
functions but it still worked really
well<00:07:27.419> with<00:07:27.600> my<00:07:28.080> 1d<00:07:28.590> Mark<00:07:28.770> 4<00:07:29.040> when<00:07:29.220> I<00:07:29.250> tried<00:07:29.550> that

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
well with my 1d Mark 4 when I tried that

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.290 
well with my 1d Mark 4 when I tried that
as<00:07:29.970> well<00:07:30.210> and<00:07:31.100> overall<00:07:32.100> yeah<00:07:32.550> I'm<00:07:32.760> excited<00:07:33.210> to

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 
as well and overall yeah I'm excited to

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.520 
as well and overall yeah I'm excited to
use<00:07:33.479> this<00:07:33.660> in<00:07:34.440> my<00:07:34.680> workflow<00:07:35.130> and<00:07:35.310> see<00:07:36.380> see<00:07:37.380> how

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
use this in my workflow and see see how

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.650 
use this in my workflow and see see how
I<00:07:37.560> can<00:07:37.770> really<00:07:37.979> push<00:07:38.550> the<00:07:38.729> system<00:07:38.910> I'm<00:07:39.240> hoping

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 
I can really push the system I'm hoping

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.060 
I can really push the system I'm hoping
to<00:07:39.810> get<00:07:39.960> another<00:07:40.229> couple<00:07:40.530> of<00:07:40.620> these<00:07:40.770> and

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
to get another couple of these and
