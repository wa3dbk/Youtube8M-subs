00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
off with the thousand grit sandpaper and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
off with the thousand grit sandpaper and
you<00:01:14.909> repeat<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> process<00:01:15.570> tilting<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> away

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you repeat the process tilting it away

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
you repeat the process tilting it away
from<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> towards<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.850> straight<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
from you towards you straight up and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.440 
from you towards you straight up and
down<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> 2,000<00:01:21.330> grit

down and then you go to the 2,000 grit

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.440 
down and then you go to the 2,000 grit
sandpaper<00:01:21.810> using<00:01:22.650> those<00:01:22.799> same<00:01:23.070> small<00:01:23.880> circles

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and then with the 3000 grit you stroke

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.800 
and then with the 3000 grit you stroke
it<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.869> direction<00:01:29.090> once<00:01:30.090> you've<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.600> that
