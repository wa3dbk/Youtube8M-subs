00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
resonant body wood so the whole goal

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
resonant body wood so the whole goal
from<00:00:45.960> Ibanez<00:00:46.500> at<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.829> particular<00:00:46.950> time<00:00:47.430> was

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
from Ibanez at that particular time was

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.819 
from Ibanez at that particular time was

mahogany sound the major innovation on
this<00:01:57.749> s<00:01:57.990> Qatar<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.709> in<00:01:59.279> the<00:01:59.429> tremolo

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
this s Qatar is in the tremolo

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.480 
this s Qatar is in the tremolo
okay<00:02:01.259> Ibanez<00:02:01.829> designed<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.700> new<00:02:02.999> tremolo<00:02:03.509> and

okay Ibanez designed a new tremolo and
this<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.639> called<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.090> zero<00:02:06.599> resistance<00:02:07.049> tremolo

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
this is called a zero resistance tremolo

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.809 
this is called a zero resistance tremolo
and<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.490> real<00:02:08.759> unique<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:10.819> normal

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and it's and it's real unique a normal

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.870 
and it's and it's real unique a normal
locking<00:02:12.390> tremolo<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.920> way<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.220> set<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.459> is

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
locking tremolo the way it's set up is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.470 
locking tremolo the way it's set up is
the<00:02:15.599> tremolo<00:02:16.170> actually<00:02:16.890> floats<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.670> it

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the tremolo actually floats and it

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.240 
the tremolo actually floats and it
balances<00:02:18.780> against<00:02:19.680> what<00:02:19.829> is<00:02:19.950> called<00:02:20.159> a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
balances against what is called a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.290 
balances against what is called a
knife-edge<00:02:20.790> it's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
knife-edge it's

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.740 
knife-edge it's
a<00:02:21.390> steel<00:02:21.780> metal<00:02:22.440> plate<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:24.060> friction

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
a steel metal plate and the friction

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.340 
a steel metal plate and the friction
allows<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.830> tremolo<00:02:26.550> arm<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.870> go<00:02:28.110> down

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
allows the the tremolo arm to to go down

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.160 
allows the the tremolo arm to to go down
what<00:02:29.160> they<00:02:29.310> did<00:02:29.520> here<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.210> they<00:02:30.240> removed<00:02:30.780> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
what they did here is they removed that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.430 
what they did here is they removed that
metal<00:02:32.130> plate<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.670> removed<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.440> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
metal plate they removed the the

floats on ball bearings okay ball

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.500 
floats on ball bearings okay ball
bearings<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.310> smoothest<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.180> metal

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
bearings are the smoothest way for metal

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.800 
bearings are the smoothest way for metal
to<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:43.380> move<00:02:43.590> against<00:02:44.040> metal<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:45.270> they<00:02:45.690> have

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
to to move against metal so they have

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.990 
to to move against metal so they have

called<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.300> zero<00:02:48.660> resistance<00:02:49.110> because<00:02:49.740> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
called a zero resistance because it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.920 
called a zero resistance because it
doesn't<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.730> resistance<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.750> knife

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
that's rated in the guitar you take this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.580 
that's rated in the guitar you take this
out<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.910> put<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> back<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.560> can

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
out you put it in the back and you can

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.280 
out you put it in the back and you can
adjust<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.580> intonation<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.510> put<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.050> screw

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
adjust the intonation and put the screw

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
adjust the intonation and put the screw
right<00:03:10.500> back<00:03:10.740> in<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.490> don't<00:03:11.820> end<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:12.240> losing

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
right back in so you don't end up losing

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.310 
right back in so you don't end up losing
the<00:03:12.870> intonation<00:03:13.800> adjustment<00:03:14.130> screw<00:03:15.320> where

this<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.710> really<00:03:17.400> cool<00:03:18.270> is<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.920> back<00:03:20.130> here

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
this is really cool is the back here

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.720 
this is really cool is the back here
there's<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.570> bar<00:03:21.900> which<00:03:22.770> we<00:03:22.980> call<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.370> zero

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
there's a bar which we call the zero

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.850 
there's a bar which we call the zero
point<00:03:24.120> bar<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:26.030> what<00:03:27.030> happens<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.680> every<00:03:28.680> time

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
point bar and what happens is every time

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.560 
point bar and what happens is every time
the<00:03:29.070> tremolo<00:03:29.310> was<00:03:29.580> used<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.150> pops<00:03:30.420> back

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
the tremolo was used it pops back

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.760 
the tremolo was used it pops back
immediately<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.640> pitch<00:03:33.380> okay

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
immediately to to pitch okay

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.050 
immediately to to pitch okay
so<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:35.820> refer<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.690> as<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:37.380> stable<00:03:38.250> double

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
so we refer to this as a stable double

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.910 
so we refer to this as a stable double
locking<00:03:39.420> tremolo<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:42.209> bar<00:03:42.690> can<00:03:43.380> be<00:03:43.530> removed

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
locking tremolo the bar can be removed

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.680 
locking tremolo the bar can be removed
and<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:45.360> will<00:03:45.510> allow<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:47.190> move<00:03:47.400> up<00:03:48.209> and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
and it will allow you to to move up and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.810 
and it will allow you to to move up and
down<00:03:48.750> on<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> tremolo<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:50.040> lot<00:03:50.250> easier<00:03:50.610> but

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
down on the tremolo a lot easier but

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.880 
down on the tremolo a lot easier but
this<00:03:51.000> allows<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.900> return<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.410> pitch<00:03:52.620> and

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
this allows you to return the pitch and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.150 
this allows you to return the pitch and
what's<00:03:53.370> real<00:03:53.820> unique<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.480> on<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:55.160> regular

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
what's real unique is on a regular

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.130 
what's real unique is on a regular

locking tremolo if you break a string
the<00:03:58.830> guitar<00:03:59.160> will<00:03:59.820> go<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.209> tune<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.840> live

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
the guitar will go out of tune and live

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.120 
the guitar will go out of tune and live
it<00:04:02.480> causes<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.540> lot<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.900> headaches<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.800> way

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
it causes a lot of headaches that way

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.390 
it causes a lot of headaches that way
this<00:04:05.970> if<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.840> break<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> string<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.709> stays<00:04:08.160> in

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
this if you break a string it stays in

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.100 
this if you break a string it stays in
tune<00:04:08.640> because<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.330> always<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.780> back<00:04:09.930> to

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110
