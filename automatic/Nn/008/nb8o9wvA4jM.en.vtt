00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.879
 salute to all and welcome to 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 passing game the returned to friday 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.300
 with you andrey docent second night what 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.790
 I had a curious phenomenon when I 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.470
 turned on this game 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.470
 it turned out that at the time of launch as well 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 Once I clicked on the icon for me with neither 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.590
 that it turned out that the second 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.619
 the night is available that is as if I am the first 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.689
 passed though you perfectly know and saw 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.199
 In the previous series that I was on the first 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 nights 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.410
 but nevertheless the game I would like for the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.530
 thought her to be honest so far 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.690
 did not understand that it was okay we will not 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 go into details the second night so 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.809
 the second night we will try not to die 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.820
 this time I launched another 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.980
 compatibility by the way maybe because 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.649
 this time I tried 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.670
 whistle compatibility 2 service pack 2 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.670
 how he offered me there 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.100
 maybe because of this though 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.700
 sometimes the game itself may be buggy maybe I 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.500
 and really somehow passed some sideways 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.110
 yes no I could not pass but passed first 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.520
 once but we flew all so 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.030
 strange kind of game by golly 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.560
 mystical okay, so far as it says 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.370
 says while you there a monkey 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.980
 seemingly elk leads up to 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:43.860
 yes, these are all here at one in the morning 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:51.150
 this one is working properly here 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:54.150
 interesting to me from one interesting to toxic 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.200
 corrected let's say it will be to the end 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.830
 fill up or also yes half so well 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.050
 all the guys went hunting 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.680
 they go in my direction need to be ready 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.760
 to all 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:16.650
 and why the sound is as if somewhere in 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:22.080
 sewer sit like this plays 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.290
 sewage to amusing so here bye 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.710
 no one 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.670
 it's really like everything is flowing. 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.240
 gurgles 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.240
 So 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:48.129
 yes bear we get energy we get 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.599
 we get we get we start like that but he is here 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.579
 can over this thing scare him somehow 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:03:09.260
 I still do not know how to figure out 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:14.030
 I can't do anything we need it 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.109
 us follow our generator and 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.489
 casket th because for now we are still 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:27.530
 never as they say are not dusty 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:30.170
 because of this therefore we do not know what 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:39.699
 here expect well at least i'm exactly 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:43.099
 I do not know and so we all standing there and 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:49.150
 let it cost three hours 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:52.770
 stupid already the fourth hour went so 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:57.560
 we do not start yet 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.560
 oh well have you all already come out 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:15.570
 so nobody anybody nobody is all u 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:19.359
 we are here so these too are good here 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.859
 it is very good that no one is yet 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.220
 but we know something again 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.710
 there will be a bear that will be right 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.780
 in front of me and you don't know what to do 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.210
 what can throw a mask but i don't know 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:37.180
 would not suffocate in it because 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:45.330
 suffocating heads the hero in her is very and 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:52.449
 very quickly yes no one so bear there 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:57.820
 on camera nowhere else so he 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:01.570
 still here ok good ok come on 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:06.240
 just a little bit left 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:15.750
 stretch a little more 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:23.210
 still a little bit yes excellent generator 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:26.639
 tucked up to the maximum everything at the maximum 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:31.050
 until one thing remains a fact 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:36.599
 sit down to play for the first time and time 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:46.460
 faster I want to notice much 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:46.460
 faster than when you sit again and quietly 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.349
 where did the bear go 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:18.800
 so stand anyone 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:27.180
 energize up 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:28.670
 extinguish to no-one come on come on 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.600

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.460

 Most likely if there is 6 when 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:49.740
 4 so curious what we have here about the ban 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.640
