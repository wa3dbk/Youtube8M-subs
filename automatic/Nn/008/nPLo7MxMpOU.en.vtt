00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
hello everybody and welcome to from the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.029 
hello everybody and welcome to from the
depth<00:00:14.280> tutorial<00:00:14.880> video<00:00:15.650> now<00:00:16.650> I've<00:00:16.859> been

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
depth tutorial video now I've been

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.939 
depth tutorial video now I've been
planning<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.609> doing<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.119> let's<00:00:18.539> play<00:00:18.920> from<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
planning on doing a let's play from the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.120 
planning on doing a let's play from the
depth<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.930> I<00:00:21.930> thought<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> would<00:00:22.410> come<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.920> with

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
depth and I thought I would come up with

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.929 
depth and I thought I would come up with
some<00:00:23.400> quick<00:00:24.300> designs<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.109> i<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.380> implement

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
some quick designs that i can implement

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
some quick designs that i can implement
within<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.210> let's<00:00:27.510> play<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.859> been

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
within that let's play and I've been

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
within that let's play and I've been
playing<00:00:29.279> around<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.730> their<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.449> engine

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
playing around with their with engine

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
playing around with their with engine
designs<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> engine<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.059> I've

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
designs and this is the engine that I've

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.940 
designs and this is the engine that I've
come<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:34.700> it's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.820> very<00:00:36.059> powerful<00:00:36.300> engine

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
come up with it's a very powerful engine

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.350 
come up with it's a very powerful engine
it's<00:00:37.950> 61<00:00:38.730> 96.9<00:00:39.660> four<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.879> six<00:00:41.879> thousand<00:00:42.270> one

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
it's 61 96.9 four to six thousand one

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
it's 61 96.9 four to six thousand one
hundred<00:00:42.420> maximum<00:00:43.290> power<00:00:43.500> output<00:00:43.700> with<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> fuel

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
hundred maximum power output with a fuel

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.970 
hundred maximum power output with a fuel
usage<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:46.010> 3.7<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> power<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> 23<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.800> it's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
usage of 3.7 to the power of 23 so it's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.650 
usage of 3.7 to the power of 23 so it's
a<00:00:50.219> extremely<00:00:50.879> efficient<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.539> fuel<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.680> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
believe deep 12 long so I've loaded this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
believe deep 12 long so I've loaded this
engine<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.939> Steam<00:01:06.299> Workshop<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:07.080> from

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the depth is currently the most powerful

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.760 
the depth is currently the most powerful
and<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.549> most<00:01:11.580> economical<00:01:12.420> engine<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.650> the

Steam Workshop certainly for its size so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
Steam Workshop certainly for its size so
for<00:01:18.119> those<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.409> want

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
to be downloading it from the workshop

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
to be downloading it from the workshop
or<00:01:22.650> don't<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.159> game<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> workshop<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
or don't have the game on the workshop I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.280 
or don't have the game on the workshop I
don't<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.570> available<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:25.140> any

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
don't know if it is available in any

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.249 
don't know if it is available in any
other<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.070> than<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.670> steam<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.390> thought

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
other way other than on steam I thought

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
other way other than on steam I thought
I<00:01:28.710> should<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:29.220> through<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> build<00:01:30.000> process

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
I should go through the build process

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.859 
I should go through the build process
with<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.140> least<00:01:31.350> give<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.509> an<00:01:33.509> idea<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
with you or at least give you an idea of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
with you or at least give you an idea of
how<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
how a little bit so this is the the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
how a little bit so this is the the
engine<00:01:36.329> block<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.780> obviously<00:01:37.470> we've<00:01:37.619> got

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
engine block here obviously we've got

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.420 
engine block here obviously we've got
the<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.610> 11<00:01:38.909> crank<00:01:39.210> shafts<00:01:40.189> going<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the the 11 crank shafts going down the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.420 
the the 11 crank shafts going down the
middle<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.850> per<00:01:42.270> pretty<00:01:42.630> usual<00:01:43.310> from<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
middle as per pretty usual from the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.910 
middle as per pretty usual from the
engine<00:01:44.729> block<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.810> go<00:01:45.930> way<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.409> we've

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
engine block if we go way up one we've

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
engine block if we go way up one we've
got<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> carburetor<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.329> cylinder

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
got a carburetor and a cylinder

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
got a carburetor and a cylinder
alternating<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> way<00:01:50.159> down<00:01:50.369> each<00:01:50.520> side

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
alternating all the way down each side

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
alternating all the way down each side
and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> other<00:01:52.560> end<00:01:52.740> we've<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
and then from the other end we've got a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.020 
and then from the other end we've got a
carburetor<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:55.110> supercharger

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
carburetor and a supercharger

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.330 
carburetor and a supercharger
alternating<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.350> known<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.680> last<00:01:58.950> outer

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
alternating I known for this last outer

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.440 
alternating I known for this last outer
most<00:02:00.030> we've<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.630> got<00:02:00.950> fuel<00:02:01.950> tanks

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
most we've just got fuel tanks

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.899 
most we've just got fuel tanks
connecting<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.899> carburetor

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
connecting on to these a carburetor

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.300 
connecting on to these a carburetor
and<00:02:05.780> obviously<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.380> same<00:02:07.009> for<00:02:07.280> each

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
and obviously it's the same for each

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.589 
and obviously it's the same for each
side<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.629> what<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:09.229> going<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:09.410> do<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.890> just

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
side so what I'm going to do is just

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.360 
side so what I'm going to do is just
have<00:02:11.599> my<00:02:11.750> cursor<00:02:12.140> there<00:02:12.349> get<00:02:12.739> rid<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.190> hood

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
have my cursor there get rid of the hood

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.710 
have my cursor there get rid of the hood
so<00:02:14.360> those<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.870> could<00:02:15.110> pause<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.129> can

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
so those of you could pause so you can

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.240 
so those of you could pause so you can
build<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.049> copy<00:02:18.349> at<00:02:18.560> all<00:02:18.680> whatever<00:02:19.160> you

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
build it up copy at all whatever you

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.330 
build it up copy at all whatever you
want<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.489> do<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.230> we're<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.160> next

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340

down and then on each side of the
carburetor<00:03:20.630> rather<00:03:21.109> than<00:03:21.260> having<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.590> fuel

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
carburetor rather than having a fuel

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.620 
carburetor rather than having a fuel
tank<00:03:22.130> we've<00:03:22.430> got<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.730> super<00:03:23.030> charges<00:03:23.450> this

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
tank we've got the super charges this

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.569 
tank we've got the super charges this
time<00:03:25.239> so<00:03:26.239> there's<00:03:26.389> only<00:03:26.480> six<00:03:26.780> on<00:03:26.900> each<00:03:26.989> side

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
time so there's only six on each side

put your notice that we've now got a

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.930 
put your notice that we've now got a
supercharger<00:03:32.919> every<00:03:33.919> side<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
supercharger every side of the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.339 
supercharger every side of the
carburetor<00:03:35.840> there<00:03:36.430> ok<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.690> again<00:03:38.840> I'll<00:03:39.230> just

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
carburetor there ok so again I'll just

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.289 
carburetor there ok so again I'll just
pause<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:41.379> up<00:03:41.620> there<00:03:41.799> for<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.879> get<00:03:43.090> rid<00:03:43.209> of

okay and let the final one it's quite
easy<00:03:50.530> it's<00:03:51.099> just<00:03:51.430> super<00:03:51.909> charges<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.629> top<00:03:53.560> of

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
easy it's just super charges on top of

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.210 
easy it's just super charges on top of
each<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.430> those<00:03:55.049> carburetors<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.890> it's<00:03:57.069> just

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
each of those carburetors so it's just

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.720 
each of those carburetors so it's just
the<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.909> six<00:03:58.150> super<00:03:58.840> charges<00:03:59.200> on<00:03:59.319> top<00:03:59.670> now<00:04:00.670> you

let's<00:04:32.380> play<00:04:32.760> engine<00:04:33.760> which<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.300> smaller<00:04:34.690> one

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
let's play engine which is a smaller one

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.200 
let's play engine which is a smaller one
to<00:04:35.169> be<00:04:35.289> to<00:04:35.620> begin<00:04:35.889> with<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.849> I'll<00:04:37.000> do<00:04:37.180> a

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
to be to begin with so I'll do a

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.689 
to be to begin with so I'll do a
tutorial<00:04:37.750> on<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.470> smaller<00:04:39.009> engine<00:04:39.400> it's<00:04:39.550> got

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
tutorial on the smaller engine it's got

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.339 
tutorial on the smaller engine it's got
about<00:04:39.880> 2<00:04:41.070> 1200<00:04:42.070> power<00:04:42.310> output<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.449> quite<00:04:43.720> quite

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
about 2 1200 power output is quite quite

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.740 
about 2 1200 power output is quite quite
fuel<00:04:44.800> efficient<00:04:45.220> as<00:04:45.370> well<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:46.360> if<00:04:46.419> you<00:04:46.539> want

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
fuel efficient as well but if you want

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.629 
fuel efficient as well but if you want
to<00:04:46.930> see<00:04:47.169> what<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.740> engine<00:04:48.669> is<00:04:48.789> like<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:51.520> a

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
to see what this engine is like in a

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.719 
to see what this engine is like in a
boat<00:04:51.900> then<00:04:52.900> we'll<00:04:53.650> come<00:04:53.860> over<00:04:54.010> here<00:04:54.370> got<00:04:54.669> a

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
boat then we'll come over here got a

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.279 
boat then we'll come over here got a
little<00:04:54.820> guy<00:04:55.180> there<00:04:56.010> let's<00:04:57.010> put<00:04:57.250> them<00:04:57.310> in<00:04:57.460> the

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
little guy there let's put them in the

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.659 
little guy there let's put them in the

tutorial<00:05:36.550> on<00:05:37.000> my<00:05:37.540> very<00:05:38.080> powerful<00:05:38.500> engine<00:05:38.850> as<00:05:39.850> I

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
tutorial on my very powerful engine as I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.280 
tutorial on my very powerful engine as I
say<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.180> think<00:05:40.420> it's<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.600> most<00:05:40.720> powerful<00:05:41.050> on

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
say I think it's the most powerful on

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.900 
say I think it's the most powerful on
steam<00:05:41.590> at<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.800> moment<00:05:42.130> of<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.280> workshop<00:05:42.670> i
