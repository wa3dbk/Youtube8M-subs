00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.270
 classic you have to stay there that I 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.300
 bring you the bayern or kayak and wait 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.459
 that comes with messages open it even though you 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.090
 is going to put the face like a christ 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.100
 man 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.100
 to the eva eva camera 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.849
 and because everything ends in this place of 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.629
 eleventh moment everywhere 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:34.219
 hey then to see how you value the jury 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.589
 and attentive because in this first part 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.240
 value but does not score in agreement but if 

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:39.889
 We want to know the opinion of our 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.949
 experts and we started by going more 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.949
 ahead 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.749
 it's one thing that now my Christmas house 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.819
 and it gives me a courage when it comes in and not 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:58.839
 tell me nothing is the candy dish 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.839
 You have to say nothing 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.290
 in this role the teacher way 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.460
 fantastic of nice javi well fine and 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.499
 look there was an ending that you missed 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.689
 but I do not care because it's 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.339
 testing else is leaving 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.389
 let's enjoy with your voice and that's very 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.879
 important that we really are 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.949
 worried about your efforts for your 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.020
 excesses for your sweats and tonight 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.610
 welcomed the cup that precious time that 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.189
 sang antonio molina and that is 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.110
 wonderful and has done with it for a 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.300
 little thing we just wanted to see you in 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.369
 what is nuance tried a little bit 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.289
 take your voice but at the service of 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:40.789
 the melodies so far I liked 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.789
 much xavi follow if you keep working 

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:46.830
 good night good to see I do not know if it is 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.759
 true that that of sweating less before 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:53.339
 who sweated more with false witnesses 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.139
 that of Sudan - and teaching that it is 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.909
 doing things can not a fight 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.159
 with the cantes you have to take it to your 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.529
 ground in which you are teaching 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.509
 place the voice better and although it reaches 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.550
 the tones but it arrives in its place without 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.019
 squeezing too much that way is very 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.540
 nice we have to sit in the 

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:11.360
 scenario more naturally so 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.670
 so be very lucky if I 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.220
 go ahead good night so temper 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.370
 more good than good I love it like the 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.860
 school progresses properly and also with 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.370
 positive included because very well you 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.440
 challenge was the twists up there placing it 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.330
 and do it without having to squeeze so much and 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.810
 without sweating that it seems to me that you're leaving 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.030
 to keep that country of impact very well 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.220
 because he has not had it or that he uses it since 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.360
 great and it continues working like that because 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.380
 I was doing very well and if not so 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.350
 heap your evolution 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.880
 thank you very much I will forget about 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.280
 jury I live well very well but of course 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.260
 we have a fourth jury and that in this 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.800
 case the most important in the first 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.530
 round 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.690

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.330

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.560
 see who is facing you or with 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.190

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.590
