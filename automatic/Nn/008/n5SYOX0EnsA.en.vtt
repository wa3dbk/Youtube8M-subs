 to reach the archaeological zone of 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.120
 xochicalco will realize that something 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.100
 happens in this town ruled by uses and 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.900
 customs colorful showy pictures 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.760
 striking on the facades of 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.410
 the houses show something to people 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.950
 It's divided, but nobody wants to talk 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.950
 about the topic 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.830
 the pints on the robes reflect a 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.810
 social problem that originated with the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.490
 operation of a Canadian company that 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.530
 aims to exploit the gold and silver of 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.169
 this place belonging to the municipality of 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.800
 temixco of the 154 comuneros that there are in 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.810
 key sea 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.730
 Hipólito García Morán is the only one who 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.410
 opposes the project the mine admitted that 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.489
 to allow the exploitation of gold and 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.989
 silver in the region 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.270
 food runs the risk of disappearing 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.250
 in a span of five years another of the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.740
 polygonal is all the communities of 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.720
 plot 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.300
 and it is probable that 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.460
 probable that is a fact that opens the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.740
 mine and totally the community is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.480
 disappears to each one by ghost 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.920
 since 2012 with the support of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.840
 environmentalists and academics 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.670
 Hipólito leads a group of people 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 who are reluctant to cooperate 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 mining in this indigenous community put 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.480
 that their plots could become contaminated 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 for reasons of him 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.700
 of the damages that will have here the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.520
 mine the pollution that will take 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.850
 with its chemicals that it brings of all kinds 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 because of all kinds because it is clear that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.940
 for example our farming plots 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.560
 they will no longer be useful for crops 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.180
 owners of three plots 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.650
 that most of the rented community members 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.510
 his lands for two thousand five hundred pesos 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.730
 a month what they stopped planting corn 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.770
 beans and sorghum which will be sold 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.510
 to micro-enterprises of the municipalities 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.310
 surrounding in Augustine tetlama is a 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.960
 marginalized indigenous community the majority 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.880
 of its inhabitants is dedicated to the countryside 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 while others work in the trade 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.660
 of construction when hired 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.280
 by companies or individuals although yes 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.170
 goods have stopped being built with 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.940
 adobe material not all of its streets are 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.620
 they find paved the main 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.480
 lack that exists are the services 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.100
 public like drainage and energy 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.350
 electric to say the curator of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.180
 communal property vicente red barriers 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.830
 an arrival of the mining company indicates 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.600
 The comunero intends to improve the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.310
 quality of life among the inhabitants of 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.200
 this area situation that the authority 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.980
 municipal and state has not been worried 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.129
 to attend 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.400
 the field said what is paying us 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.710
 the mine really so for 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.660
 what the field 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.420
 when at least I'm giving by hamas 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.890
 can give about 12 thousand pesos when I go to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.170
 note that the strips is no longer profitable 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.180
 red barriers admitted knowing about the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.040
 possible affectations that it brings and 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.660
 I saw near a mine but he assured that the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.660
 The need of the people is greater 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.090
 possibly possibly if we are going to 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.069
 think that you have those this 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.420
 and we think it will affect it 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.420
 the two plots 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.920
 but we also this people 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.870
 and they allow for the same thing that that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.140
 government does not ignore them government 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.910
 we ask for something he does not see us since 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.590
 a year ago 70 people from the community 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.470
 they work for the mining company with a 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.120
 salary of thousand 750 pesos per week the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.620
