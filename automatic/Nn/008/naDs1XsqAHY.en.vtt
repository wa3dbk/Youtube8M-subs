00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.610 
and the beautiful meat and all the rest
this<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.430> really<00:03:22.880> quite<00:03:23.120> lean<00:03:23.540> if<00:03:23.930> we<00:03:24.200> score

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
this is really quite lean if we score

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.860 
this is really quite lean if we score
that<00:03:24.890> if<00:03:25.010> we<00:03:25.130> stick<00:03:25.340> our<00:03:25.550> knife<00:03:25.790> into<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:26.360> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
that if we stick our knife into it the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.140 
that if we stick our knife into it the
fat<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.530> softest<00:03:28.010> part<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:28.970> will

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
fat is the softest part and so that will

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.280 
fat is the softest part and so that will
render<00:03:29.420> down<00:03:29.720> first

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
render down first

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.350 
render down first
so<00:03:30.680> therefore<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.160> fat<00:03:31.430> will<00:03:31.670> come<00:03:31.940> back<00:03:32.150> on

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
so therefore the fat will come back on

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.380 
so therefore the fat will come back on
to<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.630> skin<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.650> does<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.550> still<00:03:34.880> could<00:03:35.330> be

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
to the skin it does it still could be

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.530 
to the skin it does it still could be
crispy<00:03:36.020> but<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.470> me<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.739> perfect<00:03:37.010> pork<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:38.150> all

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.150 
crispy but to me the perfect pork is all
