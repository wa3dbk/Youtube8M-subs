00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 also known as sar in Algeria what is it 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
 what do you think of him is a month that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.070
 I arrived I was told a lot of 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.619
 well on him in the breeders 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 finally the recruiters of hope 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.920
 maury I heard that good and even 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.970
 friends in me who are born into 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.970
 France so it surprises me that years 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.070
 e 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.779
 young player already humanly it's 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.099
 someone adorable my fall I have the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.450
 chance to share his room with a 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.000
 trailer the chance to share his room 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.530
 with me always at the listened everything is 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.970
 already humanly it's someone 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.559
 exceptional and after I take 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.910
 point of chromium bone think if 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.980
 hope put money on him 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.920
 they do not do anything here and that's 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.629
 rare that hope will engage 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.429
 someone who has great qualities 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.660
 percussive techniques that holds a lot 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.190
 on these people 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 people like that have enough days 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.300
 like that bringing people back to the stage I 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.530
 do not know if in Algeria unfortunately 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 you do not know very well that's 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.470
 it really surprises me because it's a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.690
 explosive player case because a lot 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.420
 of future your thoughts and especially as he 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.520
 head on shoulders 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.590
 I think that vahid you listen to me do you want 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.250
 I had to Paris it would take a day 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.200
 thought of him it's a nice tribute that he 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.860
 makes his rails the merit france less than 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.090
 deserves better 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.340
 I rarely have the opportunity to 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.140
 speak on the Algerian channels and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.330
 its good 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.310
 2 because that day he has full 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.840
 of the future they replaced it to bring back 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.650
 to replace precisely he knows all that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.600
 who is the reference to this post here 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.430
 in tunisia and even in africa because 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.140
 that he was nominated for you so 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.940
 we see that he was 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.490
 he was brought back here the account coach 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.830
 a lot about him he's young it's or 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.170
 this idea of ​​young people but hey he has a 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.759
 big margin of progress and already 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.950
 in addition it is someone who can us 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.550
 bring a lot because it's a 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 unpredictable player 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.960
 here you see him replacing enough 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.770
 easily technical is on the start 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.120
 in the month of December 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.470
 well listen if we can that's why 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.700
 and I'm saying I believe a lot in 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.289
 him and more like I say I 'm with 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 you in the room 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.739
 it's someone who humanly it's 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.469
 very rare in africa 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.240
 I'm sorry to say that is 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.980
 Tunisian lips 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.510
 player of this caliber there still have the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.430
 head on the shoulders it's someone who 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.300
 a lot to the listened that is acquired 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.190
 calls for progress 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.540
 you also see a workout when we 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.410
 speaks to her older speak to him and 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.220
 where he is at the listened 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.690
 and so here I think that 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.730
 I think he has a lot to contribute 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.590
 maybe not today because he 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.660
 is still a bit young but that's for sure 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.690
 knowing that go there that I think he 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.920
 will look into this case there is 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.660
 I think he'll do good to a 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.880
 seleçao radio you knew players 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.880
 Algerians sometimes hear from the crew 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.880
 belhadj 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.970
 we will play with maybe a club but 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.349
 I played I was loaned to gueugnon 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.300
 when i was in paris saint-germain 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.370
 I was ready to say a word 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.260
 excellent player too who is no longer in 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.319
 selection 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.730
 at 30 years old it's after that's the choices of 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.720
 coach does not know it's a choice 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.110
 staff or it's the choices of 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.930
 the coach 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.610
 it's a player who takes I knew 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.900
 as a player was very good after 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.190
 I lost sight of them 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.150
 time 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.140
 will also budge who 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.560
 who unfortunately is hurt 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.210
 right now I thought that he has a 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.290
 player I knew so I'm 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.330
 here you have you know a lot 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.770
 quality in theory it's a pity that 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.360
 but I think that already the arrival of a 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.740
 axis of work I would like to do you 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.420
 a lot of good and the results are 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.620
 there for now 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.080
 so here and 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.550
 kadir foued that I know through 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.920
 friends to gifted 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.680
 good guy and who is doing everything 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.810
 break in France so you have a lot 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.040
 future 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.290
 potential you are always had good 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.020
 players in Algeria lyall small or cep 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.310
 I hope that after a day at the door of 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.780
 the National team 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.810
 now he is young he has time and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.520
 I think that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.430
 as soon as the selection looks at his 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.300
 case they will make the contract with because 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.300
 because he mayor
