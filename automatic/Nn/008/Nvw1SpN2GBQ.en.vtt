to my training program but there's also

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.319 
to my training program but there's also
another<00:00:34.260> version<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> deadlift<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.180> you

that's<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.120> great<00:00:42.329> exercise<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.140> focus<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that's a great exercise to focus on the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's a great exercise to focus on the

vs. stiff legged deadlifts for the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.100 
vs. stiff legged deadlifts for the
difference<00:00:53.640> between<00:00:53.850> those<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
difference between those two and how to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.729 
difference between those two and how to
do<00:00:55.350> each<00:00:55.500> one<00:00:55.789> properly<00:00:57.050> but<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> type<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
do each one properly but the type of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.970 
do each one properly but the type of
deadlift<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:00:59.399> talking<00:00:59.850> about<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.980> using

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
deadlift I'm talking about is using

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.149 
deadlift I'm talking about is using
what's<00:01:02.699> known<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> hex<00:01:03.629> bar<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.830> some

what's known as a hex bar or what some

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.480 
what's known as a hex bar or what some
bodybuilders<00:01:06.030> called<00:01:06.330> trap<00:01:07.049> bar<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.560> name

bodybuilders called trap bar as name

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.280 
bodybuilders called trap bar as name
implies<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.720> hex<00:01:10.049> bar<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> six<00:01:11.850> sided

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
implies the hex bar is a six sided

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
implies the hex bar is a six sided
hexagon<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:16.220> as<00:01:17.220> handles<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> grab<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.630> in

the<00:02:46.110> hex<00:02:46.320> bar<00:02:46.650> they<00:02:47.100> were<00:02:47.160> significantly

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
the hex bar they were significantly

stronger<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.960> deadlift<00:02:49.520> now<00:02:50.520> how<00:02:50.700> can

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
stronger on the deadlift now how can

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760 
stronger on the deadlift now how can
that<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.090> well<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.080> comes<00:02:52.230> down<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
that be well it comes down to the

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.150 
that be well it comes down to the
biomechanics<00:02:53.640> when<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.300> use<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> hex<00:02:54.840> bar<00:02:55.200> let

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
biomechanics when you use a hex bar let

me<00:02:56.310> walk<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.520> through<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.740> they<00:02:58.740> found<00:02:59.070> that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
me walk you through it they found that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.110 
me walk you through it they found that
using<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.880> hex<00:03:00.090> bar<00:03:00.710> allowed<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.980> lifters<00:03:02.460> to

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
using the hex bar allowed the lifters to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.480 
using the hex bar allowed the lifters to
keep<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.900> weight<00:03:04.200> closer<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:05.040> their<00:03:05.190> body

which placed less stress on the lower
back<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:10.470> also<00:03:10.650> allowed<00:03:11.190> them<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.490> use<00:03:11.730> more<00:03:12.330> of

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
back it also allowed them to use more of

the<00:03:39.900> benefit<00:03:40.410> of<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.620> hex<00:03:40.860> bar<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:42.030> it

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
the benefit of the hex bar is that it

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.780 
the benefit of the hex bar is that it
puts<00:03:42.360> less<00:03:42.600> stress<00:03:42.990> on<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.350> lower<00:03:43.470> back<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.730> if

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
puts less stress on the lower back so if

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.420 
puts less stress on the lower back so if
you're<00:03:44.940> someone<00:03:45.240> who<00:03:45.480> does<00:03:45.780> find<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.800> regular

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
you're someone who does find the regular

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
back you can't do them then yes this

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.910 
back you can't do them then yes this
might<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.580> better<00:03:57.060> option<00:03:57.380> allowing<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.710> to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
might be a better option allowing you to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.980 
might be a better option allowing you to
finally<00:03:59.430> do<00:03:59.580> deads<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.420> can<00:04:00.570> build<00:04:00.780> more

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
finally do deads so you can build more

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.610 
finally do deads so you can build more
strength<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.590> power<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.520> well<00:04:02.820> as<00:04:03.030> mass<00:04:03.620> but

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
strength and power as well as mass but

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.620 
strength and power as well as mass but
because<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.130> hex<00:04:05.340> bar<00:04:05.580> forces<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.240> to<00:04:06.480> use

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
because the hex bar forces you to use

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.470 
because the hex bar forces you to use
more<00:04:06.959> quads<00:04:07.380> during<00:04:07.830> deadlifts<00:04:08.480> while

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
more quads during deadlifts while

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.930 
more quads during deadlifts while

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
allowing you to go heavier this is a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.199 
allowing you to go heavier this is a

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
great way to place more overload on your
