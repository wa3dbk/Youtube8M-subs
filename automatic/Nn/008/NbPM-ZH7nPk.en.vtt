well<00:03:36.090> I'm<00:03:36.240> itching<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.570> get<00:03:36.690> man<00:03:40.580> we<00:03:41.580> tried

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
well I'm itching to get man we tried

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.980 
well I'm itching to get man we tried
tonight<00:03:42.240> we<00:03:42.720> had<00:03:42.960> two<00:03:43.830> birds<00:03:44.100> flying<00:03:44.400> around

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
tonight we had two birds flying around

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.070 
tonight we had two birds flying around
they<00:03:45.990> even<00:03:46.230> responded<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.890> tape<00:03:47.190> but<00:03:48.080> it

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
they even responded to the tape but it

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.110 
they even responded to the tape but it
didn't<00:03:49.380> actually<00:03:49.530> come<00:03:49.890> low<00:03:50.100> enough<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.640> land

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
didn't actually come low enough to land

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.610 
didn't actually come low enough to land
in<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.420> net<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.780> fact<00:03:51.990> that<00:03:52.110> wouldn't<00:03:52.320> blow<00:03:52.470> up

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
in the net in fact that wouldn't blow up

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.950 
in the net in fact that wouldn't blow up
at<00:03:52.770> one<00:03:52.920> point<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:54.150> think<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
at one point and I think the the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.650 
at one point and I think the the
nightjars<00:03:55.440> sordin<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.280> net<00:03:56.540> waving<00:03:57.540> around

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
nightjars sordin the net waving around

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.250 
nightjars sordin the net waving around
and<00:03:58.160> avoided<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.280> flew<00:03:59.610> up<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.880> top<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:01.080> I

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
and avoided it flew up the top so I

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.930 
and avoided it flew up the top so I
think<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.590> probably<00:04:01.950> our<00:04:02.280> last<00:04:02.550> chance

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
think this is probably our last chance

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.600 
think this is probably our last chance
because<00:04:03.470> they<00:04:04.470> are<00:04:04.620> virtually<00:04:05.250> on<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.460> move

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
because they are virtually on the move

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.449 
because they are virtually on the move
now<00:04:06.680> maybe<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.770> next<00:04:07.920> couple<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.280> days

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
now maybe the next couple of days

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.310 
now maybe the next couple of days
they'll<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.000> gone<00:04:09.240> heading<00:04:09.870> off<00:04:10.050> towards

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
they'll be gone heading off towards

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.460 
they'll be gone heading off towards
Africa<00:04:10.890> but<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:11.850> tried<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:12.780> had<00:04:13.110> some<00:04:13.260> nice

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
Africa but we tried and we had some nice

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.130 
Africa but we tried and we had some nice
shots<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.180> sights<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.660> them<00:04:15.780> flying<00:04:16.019> around

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
shots and sights of them flying around

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.910 
shots and sights of them flying around
and<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:17.670> think<00:04:18.090> maybe<00:04:18.560> come<00:04:19.560> back<00:04:19.709> again<00:04:19.859> next

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
and I think maybe come back again next

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.190 
and I think maybe come back again next
year<00:04:20.250> during<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> breeding<00:04:21.540> season<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:22.049> see

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
year during the breeding season the see

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:30.830 
year during the breeding season the see
if<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:22.350> could<00:04:22.560> be<00:04:22.680> more<00:04:22.800> successful

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.900 

you
