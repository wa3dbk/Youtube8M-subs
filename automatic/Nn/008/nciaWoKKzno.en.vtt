I<00:03:10.480> because<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.110> didn't<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:12.810> disassembly

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
I because I didn't have a disassembly

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.630 
I because I didn't have a disassembly
guy<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.020> go<00:03:14.170> off<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.470> or<00:03:15.190> any<00:03:15.400> kind<00:03:15.610> of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
guy to go off of or any kind of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.680 
guy to go off of or any kind of
instructions<00:03:16.090> on<00:03:16.209> how<00:03:16.330> this<00:03:16.480> thing<00:03:16.600> comes

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
instructions on how this thing comes

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.449 
instructions on how this thing comes
apart<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.290> didn't<00:03:17.800> want<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> have<00:03:18.100> an<00:03:18.220> hour-long

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
apart I didn't want to have an hour-long

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.090 
apart I didn't want to have an hour-long
video<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.720> disassembly<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.920> this

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
video of the disassembly this of this

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.699 
video of the disassembly this of this
camera<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:24.840> yeah<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:25.870> put<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.380> that's<00:03:26.560> right

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
camera so yeah I put it I that's right

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.740 
camera so yeah I put it I that's right
at<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.860> time<00:03:27.010> lapse<00:03:27.480> there<00:03:28.480> were<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> couple

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
at the time lapse there were a couple

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.690 
at the time lapse there were a couple
little<00:03:29.080> tricky<00:03:29.350> parts<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:30.430> know<00:03:30.519> there's

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
little tricky parts you know there's

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.470 
little tricky parts you know there's
some<00:03:30.820> there's<00:03:31.120> some<00:03:31.209> plastic<00:03:31.480> Clips<00:03:33.480> along

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
some there's some plastic Clips along

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.870 
some there's some plastic Clips along
this<00:03:34.630> top<00:03:34.870> edge<00:03:35.110> here<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:36.370> really<00:03:36.700> just

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
this top edge here that you really just

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.199 
this top edge here that you really just
kind<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.299> got<00:03:37.540> in<00:03:37.660> there<00:03:37.780> with<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.900> flathead

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
kind of I got in there with a flathead

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.310 
kind of I got in there with a flathead
that<00:03:40.209> part<00:03:40.390> was<00:03:40.510> much<00:03:40.690> more<00:03:40.840> difficult<00:03:40.989> that

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
that part was much more difficult that

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.570 
that part was much more difficult that
look<00:03:41.500> like<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:41.860> video<00:03:42.100> obviously<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.489> think

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
look like in the video obviously I think

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.390 
look like in the video obviously I think
the<00:03:42.700> whole<00:03:42.880> process<00:03:43.150> took<00:03:43.390> about<00:03:43.450> 10<00:03:43.750> minutes

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the whole process took about 10 minutes

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.440 
the whole process took about 10 minutes
someone<00:03:45.400> out<00:03:45.519> there<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.850> do<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.090> math<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
someone out there I do the math and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.840 
someone out there I do the math and
prove<00:03:46.570> me<00:03:46.660> wrong<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.430> let's<00:03:48.430> see<00:03:48.549> how<00:03:48.670> long

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
prove me wrong and let's see how long

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.080 
prove me wrong and let's see how long
did<00:03:49.030> how<00:03:49.780> long<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.079> video<00:03:50.200> is<00:03:50.380> at<00:03:51.040> one<00:03:51.790> picture

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
did how long the video is at one picture

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.550 
did how long the video is at one picture
a<00:03:52.120> second<00:03:52.510> one<00:03:52.630> frame<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.900> second<00:03:53.230> played<00:03:53.410> back

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
a second one frame a second played back

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.039 
a second one frame a second played back
at<00:03:53.680> 30<00:03:53.829> frames<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.220> second<00:03:54.579> yeah<00:03:55.450> have<00:03:55.840> fun<00:03:55.870> with

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
at 30 frames a second yeah have fun with

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.710 
at 30 frames a second yeah have fun with
that

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.270 
that
so<00:03:58.720> yeah<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:58.989> top<00:03:59.410> cover<00:03:59.530> here<00:03:59.769> was<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.920> bit<00:04:00.190> of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
so yeah this top cover here was a bit of

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.789 
so yeah this top cover here was a bit of
a<00:04:00.340> trick<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:01.420> then<00:04:01.989> getting<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.410> ribbon

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
a trick and then getting the ribbon

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.030 
a trick and then getting the ribbon
cable<00:04:03.130> in<00:04:03.310> was<00:04:03.760> obnoxious<00:04:04.750> but<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.890> definitely

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
cable in was obnoxious but it definitely

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.090 
cable in was obnoxious but it definitely

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
doable all in all not a horrible camera

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
three screws out this whole piece just

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.279 
three screws out this whole piece just
falls<00:04:29.500> out<00:04:30.030> out<00:04:31.030> once<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.600> take<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.870> flap

falls out out once you take this flap
off<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.620> was<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.800> bit<00:04:33.039> of<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> pain<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.400> get<00:04:33.580> it

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
off it was a bit of a pain to get it

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.200 
off it was a bit of a pain to get it
back<00:04:33.880> in<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.070> make<00:04:36.220> sure<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.430> had<00:04:36.970> done<00:04:37.000> it

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
back in so just make sure I had done it

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.629 
back in so just make sure I had done it
on<00:04:37.300> its<00:04:37.539> side<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:38.229> piece<00:04:38.380> kind<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.680> floats

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
on its side so the piece kind of floats

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.290 
on its side so the piece kind of floats
there<00:04:40.500> otherwise<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:42.010> very<00:04:42.340> easy<00:04:42.699> process<00:04:42.940> I

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
there otherwise a very easy process I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.390 
there otherwise a very easy process I
think<00:04:43.360> most<00:04:43.780> people<00:04:43.900> with<00:04:44.199> a<00:04:44.229> small<00:04:45.070> phillips

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
think most people with a small phillips

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.620 
think most people with a small phillips
screwdriver<00:04:45.580> could<00:04:46.060> do<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:48.630> hopefully

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
screwdriver could do this and hopefully

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.820 
screwdriver could do this and hopefully
my<00:04:49.870> buddy<00:04:50.110> will<00:04:50.229> be<00:04:50.289> a<00:04:50.320> little<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.560> takes<00:04:50.710> more

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
my buddy will be a little it takes more

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.960 
my buddy will be a little it takes more
camp<00:04:51.039> more<00:04:51.250> pictures<00:04:51.639> anyway<00:04:52.449> thanks<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:52.870> lot
