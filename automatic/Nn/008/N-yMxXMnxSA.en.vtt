completes the colorway uh I think so it
makes<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.830> pop<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.400> little<00:01:59.700> bit<00:01:59.820> more<00:01:59.880> makes<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
makes it pop a little bit more makes a

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
makes it pop a little bit more makes a
little<00:02:00.509> bit<00:02:00.600> more<00:02:00.840> complete<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.470> chaos<00:02:01.890> feel

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
little bit more complete that chaos feel

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
little bit more complete that chaos feel
that<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.640> didn't<00:02:02.940> have<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> four<00:02:04.020> fives

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that they didn't have on the four fives

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.460 
that they didn't have on the four fives
and<00:02:04.710> sixes<00:02:05.119> really<00:02:06.119> resembles<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.200> five

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
and sixes really resembles the the five
