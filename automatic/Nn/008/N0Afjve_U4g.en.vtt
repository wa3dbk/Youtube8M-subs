00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.300 
with a scattershot I would not have
pushed<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.140> into<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.619> position<00:01:31.860> right

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
pushed up into that position right

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
pushed up into that position right
that's<00:01:32.520> something<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:32.939> an<00:01:33.750> armor<00:01:34.140> ability

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that's something that an armor ability

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.649 
that's something that an armor ability
like<00:01:34.590> Promethean<00:01:35.250> vision<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:36.180> help<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.630> out

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
like Promethean vision can help you out

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.690 
like Promethean vision can help you out
with<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.140> makes<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.590> aware<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.430> enemy

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
with it makes you aware of the enemy

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.190 
with it makes you aware of the enemy
position<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.659> make<00:01:39.840> more

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
position so that you can make more

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.859 
position so that you can make more
informed<00:01:40.619> decisions<00:01:40.880> survive<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.689> more

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
informed decisions survive more get more

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
informed decisions survive more get more
kills<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.409> did<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> say<00:01:44.430> survive<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.000> yet

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
kills and did I say survive more yet

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
kills and did I say survive more yet
because<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.570> really<00:01:45.810> important<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.790> so

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
because that's really important to do so

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.859 
because that's really important to do so
right<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.180> aware<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> there's<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> guy

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
right here I'm aware that there's a guy

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.090 
right here I'm aware that there's a guy
week<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> means<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
week up here that means I'm going to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
week up here that means I'm going to
push<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.670> aware<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.119> there's<00:01:51.270> another

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
push up I'm aware that there's another

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
push up I'm aware that there's another
guy<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.079> got<00:01:52.229> full<00:01:52.409> shields<00:01:52.649> I'm

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
guy here but I got full shields I'm

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
guy here but I got full shields I'm
gonna<00:01:53.130> challenge<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.759> didn't<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.540> there

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
gonna challenge I didn't know that there

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
gonna challenge I didn't know that there
was<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> guy<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.140> left<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.649> otherwise<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
was a guy on the left there otherwise I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
was a guy on the left there otherwise I
would<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.280> pushed<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.670> even<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.210> into<00:01:57.659> ring

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
would have pushed up even more into ring

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.749 
would have pushed up even more into ring
and<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.009> gotten<00:01:59.369> killed

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and then I would not have gotten killed

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.639 
and then I would not have gotten killed
there<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.390> top<00:02:00.659> players<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.229> normally<00:02:01.619> very

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
there so top players are normally very

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.700 
there so top players are normally very
aware<00:02:02.450> based<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.659> either<00:02:03.869> their<00:02:04.320> own<00:02:04.469> input

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
aware based on either their own input

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590 
aware based on either their own input
where<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.640> they<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.450> they're

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
where what they see what they're

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.059 
where what they see what they're
thinking<00:02:06.810> about<00:02:07.259> where<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> players<00:02:07.920> are

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
thinking about where the players are

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.479 
thinking about where the players are
going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.369> move<00:02:08.599> or<00:02:09.599> they're<00:02:09.840> aware<00:02:10.170> because

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
going to move or they're aware because

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.100 
going to move or they're aware because
they<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.580> radar<00:02:11.819> which<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.599> see<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.989> lot

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
they have radar which you see in a lot

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.880 
they have radar which you see in a lot
of<00:02:13.170> radar<00:02:13.530> games

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
of radar games

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
of radar games
types<00:02:14.040> all<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.520> red<00:02:14.760> dots<00:02:14.790> moving<00:02:15.210> around<00:02:15.569> you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
types all the red dots moving around you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.059 
types all the red dots moving around you
even<00:02:15.990> though<00:02:16.080> players<00:02:16.319> could<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.800> crouching

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
even though players could be crouching

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.340 
even though players could be crouching
which<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.850> where<00:02:18.030> awareness<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.720> very<00:02:19.050> very

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
which is where awareness is very very

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.880 
which is where awareness is very very
important<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.970> also<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.560> call-outs<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
important and you also have call-outs so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.620 
important and you also have call-outs so
if<00:02:23.069> you're<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> team<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:23.880> players<00:02:24.180> making

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
if you're on a team with players making

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.449 
if you're on a team with players making
good<00:02:24.990> call<00:02:25.260> outs<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.069> should<00:02:26.190> not

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
good call outs right here i should not

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.710 
good call outs right here i should not
have<00:02:26.610> challenged<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.090> trying<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> show<00:02:27.690> off

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
have challenged that trying to show off

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
have challenged that trying to show off
getting<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> whip<00:02:28.950> shot<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.580> did<00:02:29.760> not

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
getting the whip shot but it did not

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.770 
getting the whip shot but it did not
work<00:02:30.270> out<00:02:31.760> basically<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.970> want<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.330> always<00:02:33.540> be

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
work out basically you want to always be

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.630 
work out basically you want to always be
aware<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.140> your<00:02:34.350> enemy's<00:02:34.830> positions<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.459> if

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
aware of your enemy's positions like if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
aware of your enemy's positions like if
you<00:02:36.060> were<00:02:36.150> playing<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.510> game<00:02:36.690> type<00:02:36.990> with

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you were playing this game type with

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.920 
you were playing this game type with
indicators<00:02:38.100> over<00:02:38.580> all<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.970> their<00:02:39.120> heads<00:02:39.420> how

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
indicators over all of their heads how

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.780 
indicators over all of their heads how
much<00:02:40.140> easier<00:02:40.560> would<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:41.550> where<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
much easier would it be to know where to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.670 
much easier would it be to know where to
position<00:02:42.000> yourself<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.780> where<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.050> shoot<00:02:43.260> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
position yourself and where to shoot so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.320 
position yourself and where to shoot so
you<00:02:43.770> want<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.160> try<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.670> always<00:02:45.150> have

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
you want to try and and always have

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.960 
you want to try and and always have
indicators<00:02:45.930> overall<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:46.860> players<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.520> their

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
indicators overall for players on their

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.420 
indicators overall for players on their
team<00:02:48.030> mentally<00:02:48.810> right<00:02:49.350> mental<00:02:49.800> indicators

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
team mentally right mental indicators

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.880 
team mentally right mental indicators
where<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.270> are<00:02:51.420> guessing<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.200> every<00:02:52.560> single

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
where you are guessing that every single

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.190 
where you are guessing that every single
one<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.070> their<00:02:53.250> players<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.110> for<00:02:55.110> example

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
one of their players is so for example

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.199 
one of their players is so for example
I'm<00:02:55.560> coming<00:02:55.830> up<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.040> ramp<00:02:56.310> why<00:02:56.820> did<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.060> not

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
I'm coming up this ramp why did I not

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.090 
I'm coming up this ramp why did I not
look<00:02:57.420> right<00:02:57.690> because<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.380> figured<00:02:58.470> there<00:02:58.980> would

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
look right because I figured there would

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.830 
look right because I figured there would
be<00:02:59.130> no<00:02:59.430> one<00:02:59.580> back<00:02:59.790> there<00:03:00.060> that's<00:03:00.480> where<00:03:00.690> we're

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
be no one back there that's where we're

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.120 
be no one back there that's where we're
spawning<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.350> I'm<00:03:01.440> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> focus<00:03:01.830> my

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
spawning so I'm going to focus my

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.190 
spawning so I'm going to focus my
attention<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> left<00:03:03.360> now<00:03:03.540> how<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.050> this

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
attention to the left now how is this

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.290 
attention to the left now how is this
guy<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.739> have<00:03:04.980> no<00:03:05.190> friggin<00:03:05.489> idea<00:03:05.700> because

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
guy here I have no friggin idea because

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.120 
guy here I have no friggin idea because
the<00:03:06.450> rest<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.780> my<00:03:06.870> team<00:03:06.930> was<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.380> purple<00:03:07.739> forest

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the rest of my team was in purple forest

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.340 
the rest of my team was in purple forest
so<00:03:08.459> that's<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.700> weird<00:03:09.000> anomaly<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.810> shows<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
so that's a weird anomaly it shows that

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.770 
so that's a weird anomaly it shows that
even<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.980> are<00:03:11.190> up<00:03:11.790> doing<00:03:12.209> good<00:03:12.480> awareness

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
even if you are up doing good awareness

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.690 
even if you are up doing good awareness
you<00:03:13.170> can<00:03:13.290> sometimes<00:03:13.680> get<00:03:13.920> surprised<00:03:14.370> by<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
you can sometimes get surprised by a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.970 
you can sometimes get surprised by a
really<00:03:15.300> sneaky<00:03:15.780> player<00:03:16.050> who's<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.800> being

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
really sneaky player who's just being

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.979 
really sneaky player who's just being
completely<00:03:17.160> unconventional<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.690> against

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
completely unconventional going against

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.990 
completely unconventional going against
the<00:03:19.079> rules<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.560> spawning<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.640> where<00:03:20.880> you

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
the rules of spawning and where you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.970 
the rules of spawning and where you
think<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.480> their<00:03:21.930> team<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.860> be

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
think that their team is going to be

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.140 
think that their team is going to be
lets<00:03:23.190> say<00:03:23.250> they<00:03:23.370> have<00:03:23.459> three<00:03:23.700> people<00:03:24.000> on<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
lets say they have three people on the

lets say they have three people on the
other<00:03:24.299> side<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.780> map<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.890> wouldn't

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
other side of the map you wouldn't

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.800 
other side of the map you wouldn't
really<00:03:26.280> expect<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:27.000> guy<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.450> sitting

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
really expect one guy to be sitting

really expect one guy to be sitting
behind<00:03:28.200> your<00:03:28.650> spawn<00:03:28.980> that's<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.430> weird<00:03:29.640> here

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
he chases me if he does which is always

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.810 
he chases me if he does which is always
actually<00:03:40.290> usually<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.650> terrible<00:03:41.070> idea<00:03:41.190> then

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
actually usually a terrible idea then

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
he's going to get lit up and we're going

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.170 
he's going to get lit up and we're going
to<00:03:43.049> clean<00:03:43.290> up<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.590> kill<00:03:43.829> now<00:03:44.760> right<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.000> I'm

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
to clean up that kill now right here I'm

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.330 
to clean up that kill now right here I'm
looking<00:03:45.450> for<00:03:45.780> their<00:03:45.989> team<00:03:46.170> awareness<00:03:47.130> I'm

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
looking for their team awareness I'm

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.310 
looking for their team awareness I'm
looking<00:03:47.549> at<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.060> spawns<00:03:48.420> on<00:03:48.630> bottom<00:03:49.049> because

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
looking at the spawns on bottom because

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.740 
looking at the spawns on bottom because
we<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:49.590> ring<00:03:49.890> three<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.459> gold<00:03:50.790> control<00:03:51.269> now

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
we have ring three and gold control now

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.120 
we have ring three and gold control now
we're<00:03:51.930> in<00:03:52.019> purple<00:03:52.380> forest<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:52.980> means

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
we're in purple forest so that means

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.130 
we're in purple forest so that means
that<00:03:53.190> they<00:03:53.370> could<00:03:53.640> be<00:03:53.790> spawning<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.420> gold<00:03:54.690> but

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
that they could be spawning in gold but

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.690 
that they could be spawning in gold but
we're<00:03:55.290> going<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.440> clean<00:03:55.739> up<00:03:55.890> as<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> team<00:03:56.430> that

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
we're going to clean up as a team that

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.370 
we're going to clean up as a team that
guy<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.120> purple<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.690> now<00:03:58.110> we're<00:03:58.200> going<00:03:58.290> to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
guy in purple and now we're going to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.080 
guy in purple and now we're going to
look<00:03:58.530> around<00:03:58.739> looks<00:03:59.070> like<00:03:59.190> they<00:03:59.370> are<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.790> gold

they are scattered around rings so they

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.510

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
Sean was going to clean him up right

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.969 
Sean was going to clean him up right
there<00:05:59.419> with<00:05:59.450> a<00:05:59.570> back<00:05:59.780> smack<00:06:00.140> turns<00:06:00.650> out<00:06:00.919> that

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
there with a back smack turns out that

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.730 
there with a back smack turns out that
it<00:06:01.370> didn't<00:06:01.640> work<00:06:01.760> out<00:06:01.990> we<00:06:02.990> were<00:06:03.110> losing<00:06:03.320> pretty

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
it didn't work out we were losing pretty

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.770 
it didn't work out we were losing pretty
much<00:06:03.890> this<00:06:04.070> entire<00:06:04.400> game<00:06:04.729> until<00:06:05.450> we<00:06:05.630> got

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
much this entire game until we got

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.250 
much this entire game until we got
golden<00:06:06.289> ring<00:06:06.560> control<00:06:07.090> now<00:06:08.090> at<00:06:08.720> first<00:06:08.930> we<00:06:09.110> were

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
golden ring control now at first we were

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.140 
golden ring control now at first we were
aware<00:06:09.560> that<00:06:09.620> they<00:06:09.890> had<00:06:10.160> these<00:06:10.400> control<00:06:11.120> points

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
aware that they had these control points

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.480 
aware that they had these control points
so<00:06:11.600> we<00:06:11.750> had<00:06:11.870> to<00:06:11.990> focus<00:06:12.169> on<00:06:12.470> weakening<00:06:13.039> them<00:06:13.250> and

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
so we had to focus on weakening them and

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.300 
so we had to focus on weakening them and
then<00:06:14.000> pushing<00:06:14.479> forward<00:06:14.930> as<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.110> team<00:06:15.320> but<00:06:16.070> now

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
then pushing forward as a team but now

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.130 
then pushing forward as a team but now
we<00:06:16.370> pretty<00:06:16.789> much<00:06:16.880> have<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:17.900> ring

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
we pretty much have the the ring

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.650 
we pretty much have the the ring
controlled<00:06:18.650> so<00:06:18.890> we<00:06:19.039> can<00:06:19.220> push<00:06:19.520> on<00:06:19.760> to<00:06:20.300> enemy

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
controlled so we can push on to enemy

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.719 
controlled so we can push on to enemy
players<00:06:20.930> who<00:06:21.169> we've<00:06:21.470> weaken<00:06:21.890> right<00:06:22.070> here<00:06:22.340> get

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
going to launch up with this now all my

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.010 
going to launch up with this now all my
teammates<00:06:37.940> were<00:06:38.150> in<00:06:38.270> back<00:06:38.450> gold<00:06:38.720> I<00:06:38.810> should

teammates were in back gold I should

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.630 
teammates were in back gold I should
have<00:06:39.110> been<00:06:39.169> more<00:06:39.380> aware<00:06:39.650> of<00:06:39.710> this<00:06:39.919> so<00:06:40.550> I'm

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640 
have been more aware of this so I'm

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.190 
have been more aware of this so I'm
going<00:06:40.669> to<00:06:40.970> be

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
going to be

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.900 
going to be
alone<00:06:41.500> up<00:06:41.680> here<00:06:41.710> I<00:06:41.950> think<00:06:42.070> that<00:06:42.460> with<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.610> saw

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
alone up here I think that with the saw

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.450 
alone up here I think that with the saw
can<00:06:43.150> challenge<00:06:43.450> two<00:06:43.930> players<00:06:44.260> but<00:06:44.890> I<00:06:44.920> don't<00:06:45.310> I

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
can challenge two players but I don't I

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.340 
can challenge two players but I don't I
get<00:06:45.610> destroyed<00:06:46.180> they<00:06:46.480> get<00:06:46.690> any<00:06:46.840> week<00:06:47.080> and<00:06:47.290> they

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
get destroyed they get any week and they

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.410 
get destroyed they get any week and they
have<00:06:47.440> a<00:06:47.470> really<00:06:47.710> solid<00:06:48.190> push<00:06:48.610> where<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.210> one

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
have a really solid push where the one

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.730 
have a really solid push where the one
drops<00:06:49.720> down<00:06:49.960> and<00:06:50.290> then<00:06:50.410> the<00:06:50.500> other<00:06:50.650> one

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
drops down and then the other one

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.350 
drops down and then the other one
continues<00:06:51.400> shooting<00:06:51.790> at<00:06:51.910> me<00:06:52.060> while<00:06:52.240> I'm

just cleaned up so that shows a really

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.550 
just cleaned up so that shows a really
good<00:07:03.220> example<00:07:03.610> of<00:07:03.730> teamwork<00:07:04.510> awareness<00:07:05.350> on

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560
