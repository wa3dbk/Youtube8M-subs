00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.589
 yes 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.050
 hello youtube it pizza head and welcome 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.130
 to the review taken to the fil 3 of the m-45 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.540
 welcome to this video if we are by 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.220
 here remember that your life of use for 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.510
 demonstrate skills but to see 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.640
 how the weapon works in the hands of a 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.050
 mean boy like I am too 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.850
 if they will put a little love to the button 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.170
 I like I would love it and if it does not have 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.390
 nothing to say they did not know without comment 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 can comment with the word control 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.420
 as well as for control in the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.279
 comments and they will have something to say in 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320
 this occasion very well we start with the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.080
 web review ep 45 real life the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.420
 web 945 in fact web is because it is 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.760
 universal machine gun you already know that they 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.800
 love to make the universal name popo 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 is manufactured because clan take the country 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 of Germany since the year 1999 of 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
 done this version is 45 because 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.610
 uses instead of point 40 smith and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 wesson uses point 45 acp has a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.780
 Cadence shots of 650 shots per 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.280
 something quite stable although not 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.829
 very fast for another type of sub 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 machine guns but for your caliber it's 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.800
 quite high already happening what is for 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.180
 2003 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.410
 this weapon does not need a class in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.090
 specific can be used with 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.490
 any kind since they unlock it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.200
 when they reach rank number 16 what 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.250
 can see on the screen so you can 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.290
 consider a weapon 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.580
 personal defense so as already 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.460
 had said can be used by 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.660
 any class in the game very well 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.880
 let's see a bit more data 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.250
 go ahead in detail let's start with 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.850
 the damage the damage has a maximum of 34 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.220
 high damage points is the weapon of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.950
 personal defense with the most damage in all 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.450
 the game and this from those of the 8 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.510
 meter begins to decrease until 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 reaches a 12.5 when it reaches 40 meters 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.820
 those 12.5 in fact it was done down 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 for while the damage went up 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.140
 principal the first damage the greater damage 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.880
 they raised it a bit this so that for 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.770
 that this is mainly arming 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 used in close combat 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 pegaditos in those 8 meters because if 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.950
 they try to throw bullets at an enemy to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.390
 more than 40 meters is how to paint 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 stones that I say stones is not like 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 ment a cotton ball if the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 cotton reaches there so it does not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.220
 It is highly recommended to shoot at targets 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.170
 too much distance for example from a 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.700
 ammunition of 25 bullets in the most loader 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.380
 one in the bedroom if they have the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 option this is because real life 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.530
 you can only grab 25 bullets of what 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.000
 which is 1 point 45 acp with this weapon 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.620
 in that sense I must say that of the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.720
 weaker points of this weapon because 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.160
 have 25 bullets sometimes with these 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.990
 too close to the enemy is a 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
 problem that later end and instead of 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.250
 start with a more or less recharge 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.600
 quick to have bullets in the bedroom 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.760
 you finish everything and you have to make a 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.080
 slow recharge you're body combat to 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.540
 body can reach you and while 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.940
 reloads is a horror is this problem 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.000
 that does not manage to recharge the recharges of 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.250
 1.8 85 seconds when you have bullets in 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.069
 the breech or 2.70 when you're 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.870
 completely empty so see it so 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.000
 that they see is a little the difference almost of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.950
 a full second so it's very 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.230
 recommended that they directly kill 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.360
 someone take your precautions 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.040
 hide and reload the weapon easily 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.500
 the cadence of 600 rounds per minute 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.110
 50 shots per minute lower than the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.840
 real life this also does so not 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.370
 if that damage was not so bad 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.230
 which is a laser beam is going to kill you 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.540
 obviously with this damage and that cadence 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.850
 shot is more or less balanced and of 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.860
 made a curious fact is that when so 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.780
 within 8 meters 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.060
 this is the personal defense weapon that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.069
 faster kills in the whole game why 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.530
 because if we multiply those 34 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.049
 of damage by 600 gives us a total much 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.790
 greater than for example that of the m 5k or the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.749
 of lmp 7 that are known by 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.609
 shoot huge bursts from 950 to 900 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.829
 shots per minute the speed of 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.689
 shot when it comes out of the canyon is 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.519
 320 meters per second so 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.920
 is the slowest speed of all 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.810
 self defense weapons so if 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.150
 they want to give him a moving target to 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.590
 less extreme and close I'll have to put 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.090
 a little looks at it later where it goes 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.099
 running so that the bullets reach the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.799
 precise moment the shooting mode that 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.560
 has this weapon will be automatic worst 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.450
 by burst of two bullets and mode 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.129
 semiautomatic burst mode and mode 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.079
 semiautomatic are unfortunately 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.299
 pretty useless since with this 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.669
 small modification review alarm in 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.099
 this patch of September 2012 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.260
 this weapon has already been treated with a click 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.819
 by bullet they will see that it is a problem 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.070
 huge since they are enough 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.810
 close to the enemy and they will kill you very 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.630
 fast they will not shoot as fast as 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.060
 those 600 bullets per minute and also the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.470
 wars mode or burst is also not very 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.479
 recommended since they would be at a 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.889
 more or less long distance and equal 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.180
 would have the same problem that there are 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.460
 in a very short distance 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.889
 go in automatic we go to what 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.199
 next thing is receding leg 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.880
 of the arme the firing pattern has 1.25 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.110
 up and point 2 to the left and 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.690
 point 2 on the right pretty 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.570
 controllable but the first shot has 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.850
 multiplier of 2 points 75 times that 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.830
 kick is to say if you try to 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.479
 shoot click by bullet they will see it 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.520
 they will find with the defense weapon 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.229
 staff with the biggest kick for the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.210
 first bullet then it's better than 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.710
 you shoot at the first time and 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.680
 then try to control the weapon without 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.570
 here without releasing the trigger this 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.699
 what should I say that once they do that 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.650
 and they surpass the first shot is pretty 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.880
 easy to control this weapon is in fact 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.919
 much easier than shooting from the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.449
 hip in this video they will see that to 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.099
 times the firing pattern firing 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.990
 since the hip is a little complicated 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.430
 for me it's some control through 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.860
 putting the look is more than enough 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.960
 the sight of the iron sight is more than 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.130
 enough in that sense said order 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.229
 is speaking more or more of the opening 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.610
 of looks the sight opening looks or more 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.340
 well what could be called the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.169
 precision is the most accurate we shoot 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.690
 of the hip together with the mp 7 by 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.280
 example or the m 5 here is too much 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.080
 precise so you can see that in the 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.330
 video a laser sight is used 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.069
 and have a little more help though 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.300
 I'm still so close to the enemy I'm going to 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.800
 have to aim from the hip and that 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.449
 It will be very easy so if I'm 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.009
 too close to enemy with that look 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.599
 laser I will hit many more shots 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.969
 I 'll put your three shots 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.990
 needed to kill someone the 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.699
 sacraments that I would recommend 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.080
 It is definitely a laser sight 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.210
 suppressor I do not recommend it since I 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.300
 I would agree the minimum distance I say 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.909
 maximum of that maximum damage of 34 of 8 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.009
 meters to 4 meters and sincerely that 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.110
 damage is the best thing about this weapon should 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.699
 take advantage of the most as much as 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.699
 can impose a suppressor are going to limit 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.229
 too much this weapon really the factor 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.449
 to be off the radar is not so 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.159
 important unless you see that it is 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.560
 someone who are when as well as with 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.479
 the map there has maximized throughout the 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.280
 screen an extra screen to and if 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.620
 we put a suppressor but finally with 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.300
 the average player in a game 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.909
 public is not necessary to put a 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.500
 suppressant and really the laser sight is what 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.469
 only one that could be worth it 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.689
 weapon since in that same section 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:38.279
 we have the tactical light that really 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.529
 unless they want to be spotted 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:42.270
 and point to the face and get those from 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:43.500
 life to the enemy is an option but 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.560
 it's usually a lot 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.390
 useful to use the laser sight when the 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.010
 suppressor or silencer as I said 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.420
 both will reduce the shot from the 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.070
 hip which is a skill task 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.720
 pretty good about this weapon so I 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.400
 neither are the recommended 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.320
 Fire suppressor are not the silencer 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.210
 and good that I can tell you this weapon 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.250
 this weapon elevated to a rating of 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.710
 three slices of pizzas on four no 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.870
 it's perfect I must say in a something that does not 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.100
 I like it at all but that many weapons 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.070
 that can be used in other 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.660
 situations there is a there is 931 that 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.120
 work better in some situations 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.460
 there are others like the mp7 that is always 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.870
 better but it is a generality more or 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.700
 less than what I had from this weapon 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.200
 I hope you liked the review if 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.180
