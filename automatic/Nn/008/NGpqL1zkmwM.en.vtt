00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.200 

on<00:01:34.260> tap<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:35.100> yeah<00:01:35.250> oh<00:01:35.310> man<00:01:35.640> we're<00:01:36.000> metal

on tap for yeah oh man we're metal
been<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.440> mean<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.160> like<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
been but I think that I mean I like the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.640 
been but I think that I mean I like the
term<00:01:39.120> crossover<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.840> something<00:01:40.230> I'm<00:01:40.470> gonna

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
term crossover or something I'm gonna

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.490 
term crossover or something I'm gonna
think<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.980> falls

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.510 

metal<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.310> such<00:01:45.550> like<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:46.380> such<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.410> broad<00:01:48.100> term

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
metal is such like a such a broad term

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.890 
metal is such like a such a broad term
really<00:01:48.970> these<00:01:49.150> days<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.570> mean<00:01:49.750> how<00:01:49.840> many

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
really these days I mean how many

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.370 
really these days I mean how many
subgenres<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.830> metal<00:01:51.280> are<00:01:51.430> there<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.810> i<00:01:52.990> would

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
subgenres of metal are there but i would

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.969 
subgenres of metal are there but i would
say<00:01:53.530> we<00:01:53.680> were<00:01:54.720> influenced<00:01:55.720> by<00:01:55.870> metal<00:01:56.740> bands

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
say we were influenced by metal bands

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.800 
say we were influenced by metal bands
and<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.310> lot<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.520> like<00:01:57.760> probably<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.479> early

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
and a lot of like probably the early

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.190 
and a lot of like probably the early
doom<00:01:59.050> like<00:01:59.350> 70<00:01:59.830> stuff<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.330> all<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.720> way<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:02.020> at

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
doom like 70 stuff and all the way up at

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.260 
doom like 70 stuff and all the way up at
and<00:02:02.440> pumpkin<00:02:02.920> thrash<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.610> i<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.150> both

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and pumpkin thrash and i think we both

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.450 
and pumpkin thrash and i think we both
grew<00:02:04.479> up<00:02:04.510> playing<00:02:04.660> more<00:02:04.930> like<00:02:05.080> punk<00:02:05.320> rock<00:02:05.460> but

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
grew up playing more like punk rock but

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.090 
grew up playing more like punk rock but

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
as you become a better guitar player

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.220

few<00:03:37.550> more<00:03:37.670> bells<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.000> whistles

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.809 

it<00:03:43.500> sort<00:03:43.800> of<00:03:43.860> obvious<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:44.489> needs<00:03:44.610> to

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
it sort of obvious that it needs to

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.490 
it sort of obvious that it needs to
happen<00:03:44.940> i<00:03:45.239> think<00:03:45.480> there's<00:03:45.810> usually<00:03:46.050> don't

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
happen i think there's usually don't

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.190 
happen i think there's usually don't
lead<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:47.069> then<00:03:47.220> all<00:03:47.819> all<00:03:48.390> play<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.989> and

figure<00:03:52.950> out<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.130> harmony<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.700> know<00:03:53.880> what<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
figure out the harmony to know what the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.449 
figure out the harmony to know what the
harmony<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.900> he'll<00:03:55.050> do<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.620> if<00:03:55.950> it

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
harmony is and he'll do that and if it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.220 
harmony is and he'll do that and if it
sometimes<00:03:57.000> it's<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.330> little<00:03:57.360> bit<00:03:57.630> overkill<00:03:58.050> and

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
sometimes it's a little bit overkill and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.750 
sometimes it's a little bit overkill and
we<00:03:58.319> don't<00:03:58.440> do<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.800> sometimes<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.430> works<00:03:59.580> out

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
we don't do it sometimes it works out

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.220 
we don't do it sometimes it works out
great

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.670 

it<00:04:02.709> adds<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.250> song<00:04:03.459> I<00:04:04.290> mean<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.319> don't<00:04:05.379> think

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
it adds to the song I mean I don't think

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.289 
it adds to the song I mean I don't think
we're<00:04:05.800> consciously<00:04:06.280> trying<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.670> be<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.790> twin

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
we're consciously trying to be a twin

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.000 
we're consciously trying to be a twin
guitar<00:04:07.659> band<00:04:07.900> but<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.140> think<00:04:08.409> if<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.620> get<00:04:08.830> like

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
guitar band but I think if you get like

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.530 
guitar band but I think if you get like
to<00:04:09.250> these<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.640> want<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.879> shred<00:04:10.120> together

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
to these that want to shred together

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.849 
to these that want to shred together
it's<00:04:11.080> like<00:04:11.170> it's<00:04:11.890> just<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.190> natural<00:04:12.340> conclusion
