00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that but it had me thinking about what

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.430 
that but it had me thinking about what
the<00:00:44.850> single<00:00:45.210> version<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:45.930> would<00:00:46.110> look<00:00:46.289> like

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the single version of me would look like

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.500 
the single version of me would look like
what<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.370> alone<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.969> things

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
what it's like to be alone in things

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.369 
what it's like to be alone in things
along<00:00:48.780> those<00:00:48.989> lines<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.590> am<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.510> all

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
along those lines I am you know it all

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.020 
along those lines I am you know it all
right<00:00:52.500> first<00:00:52.770> off<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> be

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
right first off what it's like to be

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.180 
right first off what it's like to be
alone<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.110> changed<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.739> little<00:00:55.920> bit

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
alone so this has changed a little bit

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.529 
alone so this has changed a little bit
and<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.000> people<00:00:57.120> wouldn't

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and I think a lot of people wouldn't

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.500 
and I think a lot of people wouldn't
admit<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.350> tend<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.510> honest

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
admit this but I tend to be like honest

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
admit this but I tend to be like honest
to<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> flaw<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.829> commentaries<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to a flaw on on these commentaries and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
gone and the formula made a lot of sense

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.260 
gone and the formula made a lot of sense
to<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.939> i

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
to me and what it is is this like when i

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.859 
to me and what it is is this like when i
worked<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.229> cisco<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:45.000> much<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.600> schedule

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
worked at cisco so much of my schedule

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
worked at cisco so much of my schedule
was<00:01:46.200> dominated<00:01:46.860> by<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:47.430> family<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> work

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
was dominated by my family and work

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
was dominated by my family and work
right<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.899> i<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.170> work<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.649> know<00:01:49.770> my

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
right so i would work you know my

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.590 
right so i would work you know my
nine-to-five<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.149> wasn't<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
nine-to-five but it really wasn't that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
nine-to-five but it really wasn't that
it<00:01:51.840> often<00:01:51.990> seemed<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.710> more<00:01:52.950> than<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it often seemed like it was more than a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
it often seemed like it was more than a
nine-to-five<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.509> I'd<00:01:54.869> roll<00:01:55.170> home

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
nine-to-five so you know I'd roll home

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.530 
nine-to-five so you know I'd roll home
it<00:01:55.649> would<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.040> 630<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.090> I'd<00:01:57.240> spend

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it would be like 630 and then I'd spend

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.620 
it would be like 630 and then I'd spend
some<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> night<00:01:58.320> time<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> helping<00:02:00.450> hope

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
some of that night time the helping hope

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.149 
some of that night time the helping hope
with<00:02:00.810> homework<00:02:01.259> spending<00:02:01.649> time<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:01.979> family

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
with homework spending time with family

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.980 
with homework spending time with family
eating<00:02:02.549> dinner<00:02:02.700> stuff<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.869> when

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
eating dinner stuff like that then when

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
eating dinner stuff like that then when
everybody<00:02:04.350> went<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.740> bed<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.189> would<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.579> YouTube

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
is almost like a I don't know it was a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.309 
is almost like a I don't know it was a
passion<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.420> guess<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.020> passion

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
passion and I guess it is a passion

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.270 
passion and I guess it is a passion
anyway<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> would<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.190> YouTube<00:02:11.550> and
