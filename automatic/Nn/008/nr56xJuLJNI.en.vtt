00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
some practice for this but it'll be

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
some practice for this but it'll be
pretty<00:01:47.759> easy<00:01:47.880> once<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.420> get<00:01:48.570> used<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.930> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
pretty easy once you get used to it so

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.120 
pretty easy once you get used to it so
it<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:50.040> look<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> yeah<00:01:52.890> you're

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it will look like this so yeah you're

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.679 
it will look like this so yeah you're
gonna<00:01:53.399> release<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.329> you're<00:01:54.479> falling

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
gonna release it just as you're falling

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.690 
gonna release it just as you're falling
and<00:01:55.110> they'll<00:01:55.799> give<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.460> perfect

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and they'll give you a really perfect

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.749 
and they'll give you a really perfect
and<00:01:57.090> deep<00:01:57.360> smoke<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.799> also<00:01:58.979> very<00:01:59.340> safe

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and deep smoke and it's also very safe

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.050 
and deep smoke and it's also very safe
suit<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.659> throw<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.409> yeah<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> nice

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
suit to throw so yeah this is a nice

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.959 
suit to throw so yeah this is a nice
smoke<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.540> i<00:02:03.600> found<00:02:04.020> today<00:02:04.790> alright<00:02:05.790> the

smoke that i found today alright the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.399 
smoke that i found today alright the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
guys how I line it up is for upper

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.820 
guys how I line it up is for upper
I<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.480> leave<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> little<00:02:11.810> crack<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:12.260> checkers

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
I just leave a little crack in checkers

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.950 
I just leave a little crack in checkers
and<00:02:12.860> I'll<00:02:13.130> run<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.640> throw<00:02:13.940> my<00:02:14.240> smoke

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and I'll run and throw my smoke

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.720 
and I'll run and throw my smoke
somewhere<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.800> left<00:02:15.830> side<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:16.490> red

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
somewhere to the left side of this red

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.900 
somewhere to the left side of this red
line<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.650> look<00:02:18.860> like<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:22.100> it'll<00:02:22.340> be<00:02:22.520> a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
line so it look like that and it'll be a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.880 
line so it look like that and it'll be a
good<00:02:23.360> upper<00:02:23.720> smoke<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.230> like<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.710> very

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
good upper smoke just like that is very

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.630 
good upper smoke just like that is very
easy<00:02:25.100> i'll<00:02:25.460> show<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.670> guys<00:02:25.790> like<00:02:26.240> another<00:02:26.510> one

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
easy i'll show you guys like another one

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.180 
easy i'll show you guys like another one
so<00:02:28.640> yeah<00:02:28.850> like<00:02:29.840> very<00:02:30.200> rarely<00:02:30.530> you'll<00:02:30.980> mess

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
so yeah like very rarely you'll mess

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.470 
so yeah like very rarely you'll mess
this<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.580> once<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.180> good<00:02:32.330> enough

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
this up once you get good enough

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.900 
this up once you get good enough
practice<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.380> as<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.980> can<00:02:34.130> see<00:02:34.160> they<00:02:34.460> can<00:02:34.730> see

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
practice and as you can see they can see

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.590 
practice and as you can see they can see
through<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.600> smoke<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:36.080> all<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:38.240> last

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
through the smoke at all so I this last

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.560 
through the smoke at all so I this last
mode<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.110> also<00:02:39.530> something<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.950> came<00:02:40.010> up<00:02:40.190> with

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
mode is also something I came up with

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.110 
mode is also something I came up with
and<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.200> smoke<00:02:42.440> platform<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.970> guys

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
and it's to smoke platform and you guys

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.510 
and it's to smoke platform and you guys
will<00:02:44.270> see<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.750> how<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.530> works<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.130> think

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
will see that how it works it I think

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.750 
will see that how it works it I think
it's<00:02:46.850> actually<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.420> pretty<00:02:47.660> effective<00:02:47.810> smoke

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
it's actually a pretty effective smoke

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.890 
it's actually a pretty effective smoke
now<00:02:49.760> what<00:02:50.030> you're<00:02:50.120> going<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.420> do<00:02:50.540> is<00:02:50.660> come<00:02:50.810> to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
now what you're going to do is come to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.140 
now what you're going to do is come to
the<00:02:51.020> corner<00:02:51.440> right<00:02:51.710> here<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.160> then<00:02:52.970> you're

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
the corner right here and then you're

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.170 
the corner right here and then you're
going<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.710> aim<00:02:54.710> right<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.430> between<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.880> third

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
going to aim right in between the third

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.960 
going to aim right in between the third
and<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.570> fourth<00:02:57.230> line<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.010> got<00:02:58.280> one<00:02:58.520> two

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
and the fourth line so we got one two

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.480 
and the fourth line so we got one two
three<00:02:59.450> four<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.590> right<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> middle<00:03:01.340> of

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
three four so right in the middle of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.570 
three four so right in the middle of
them<00:03:02.380> when<00:03:03.380> you're<00:03:03.530> going<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.800> run<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:04.340> two

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
them when you're going to run like two

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.220 
them when you're going to run like two
steps<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.060> throw<00:03:05.210> your<00:03:05.330> smoke<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:05.960> it<00:03:06.050> looks

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
steps and throw your smoke so it looks

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.520 
steps and throw your smoke so it looks
like<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:08.510> should<00:03:08.690> bounce<00:03:08.840> twice<00:03:09.110> and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
like this it should bounce twice and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.180 
like this it should bounce twice and
fall<00:03:10.160> off<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.670> then<00:03:11.050> you<00:03:12.050> guys<00:03:12.200> can<00:03:12.410> see<00:03:12.680> it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
fall off and then you guys can see it

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.820 
fall off and then you guys can see it
pops<00:03:13.490> just<00:03:13.880> before<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.480> enter<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.020> site<00:03:15.260> so

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
pops just before I enter the site so

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.250 
pops just before I enter the site so
it's<00:03:16.100> very<00:03:16.250> perfect<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.660> covers<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
it's very perfect and it covers the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.620 
it's very perfect and it covers the
whole<00:03:18.290> middle<00:03:18.800> of<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.980> platform<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:20.510> only

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
whole middle of the platform you only

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.090 
whole middle of the platform you only
got<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.959> worry<00:03:21.080> about<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.410> right<00:03:21.590> side<00:03:21.830> on<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
got to worry about the right side on the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.010 
got to worry about the right side on the
left<00:03:22.130> side<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:23.240> can<00:03:23.390> actually<00:03:23.570> do<00:03:23.840> your

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
left side and you can actually do your

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.590 
left side and you can actually do your
entry<00:03:24.470> from<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.800> left<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.280> wrap<00:03:26.120> around<00:03:26.150> the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
entry from the left and wrap around the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.740 
entry from the left and wrap around the
site<00:03:27.040> around<00:03:28.040> platform<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.030> then<00:03:29.270> take<00:03:29.600> it

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
site around platform and then take it

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.020 
site around platform and then take it
from<00:03:29.780> there<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.440> if<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.459> want<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.850> can

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
from there and if you want you can

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.240 
from there and if you want you can
actually<00:03:32.420> have<00:03:32.780> teammates<00:03:33.470> rapping<00:03:34.070> from

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
actually have teammates rapping from

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.040 
actually have teammates rapping from
both<00:03:34.459> sides<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.810> yeah<00:03:37.209> once<00:03:38.209> again<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.780> smoke

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
both sides so yeah once again the smoke

second line right

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.270 
second line right
here<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:21.139> then<00:04:22.139> you<00:04:22.380> just<00:04:22.560> aim<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.800> between

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
here and then you just aim it between

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.279 
here and then you just aim it between
these<00:04:23.550> two<00:04:23.789> lines<00:04:24.090> right<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:24.780> top<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.259> this

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
these two lines right on top like this

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.110 
these two lines right on top like this
and<00:04:26.190> throw<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:29.430> looks<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:29.699> that<00:04:29.970> it

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
and throw it and it looks like that it

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.089 
and throw it and it looks like that it
will<00:04:30.360> basically<00:04:30.509> burn<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.289> lower<00:04:31.470> part<00:04:31.860> and

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
will basically burn the lower part and

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.360 
will basically burn the lower part and
the<00:04:32.550> platform<00:04:33.060> part<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:34.380> force<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.009> CT

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
the platform part and the force the CT

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.270 
the platform part and the force the CT
is<00:04:35.430> out<00:04:35.669> of<00:04:35.699> position<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:37.380> that's<00:04:37.770> one<00:04:38.039> month

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
is out of position so that's one month

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.499 
is out of position so that's one month
of<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:39.080> then<00:04:40.080> another<00:04:40.319> one<00:04:40.560> you<00:04:40.650> can<00:04:40.680> use<00:04:41.509> you
