00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
paper this is how I normally would make

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.580 
paper this is how I normally would make
a<00:00:59.000> V<00:00:59.270> our<00:00:59.390> little<00:00:59.690> track<00:00:59.930> here<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.440> I

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
a V our little track here and then I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.300 
a V our little track here and then I
would<00:01:03.739> lay<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> track<00:01:05.020> here<00:01:06.070> that's<00:01:07.070> how<00:01:07.280> I

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
would lay a track here that's how I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.760 
would lay a track here that's how I
normally<00:01:07.610> make<00:01:08.000> Navi<00:01:08.360> at<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.260> top<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.680> the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
normally make Navi at the top of the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.060 
normally make Navi at the top of the
head<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:10.400> got<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.700> little<00:01:10.940> track<00:01:11.180> here<00:01:12.070> and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
head you got a little track here and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.590 
head you got a little track here and
then<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.760> want<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:13.940> let<00:01:14.120> it<00:01:14.210> rip<00:01:15.130> here<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:17.390> see

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
then you want to let it rip here you see

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.940 
then you want to let it rip here you see
how<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.810> V<00:01:18.320> does<00:01:18.560> not<00:01:18.770> connect<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.119> then<00:01:21.049> at

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
how the V does not connect and then at

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.740 
how the V does not connect and then at
the<00:01:22.190> base<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.760> start<00:01:23.119> laying<00:01:23.299> tracks

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
the base I start laying tracks

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.030 
the base I start laying tracks
horizontally<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:25.010> one<00:01:25.280> track<00:01:27.400> second<00:01:28.400> track

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
horizontally it's one track second track

horizontally it's one track second track
dirt<00:01:31.040> track<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.760> I<00:01:32.090> lay<00:01:32.299> them<00:01:32.540> right<00:01:32.570> on<00:01:33.170> top

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
dirt track and I lay them right on top

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.550 
dirt track and I lay them right on top
of<00:01:33.530> each<00:01:33.799> other<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:35.720> hair<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.020> going<00:01:36.470> to

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
of each other and the hair is going to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.000 
of each other and the hair is going to
be<00:01:36.680> going<00:01:36.860> in<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.939> direction<00:01:41.650> so<00:01:42.650> you<00:01:42.710> got

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
here going this way here falling that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.030 
here going this way here falling that
way<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:49.159> here<00:01:49.970> going<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.570> way<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.110> that

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
way and here going this way and that
