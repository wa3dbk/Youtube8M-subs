cup vanilla yogurt let me just go back
here<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.749> the<00:01:43.079> familiar<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> recipe<00:01:44.249> and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.679 

it<00:01:48.659> used<00:01:49.139> two<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> half<00:01:50.459> cups<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.030> fat-free

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it used two and a half cups of fat-free

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.989 
it used two and a half cups of fat-free
or<00:01:51.899> low-fat<00:01:51.990> vanilla<00:01:52.560> yogurt<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.369> teaspoon

or low-fat vanilla yogurt and a teaspoon

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.629 
or low-fat vanilla yogurt and a teaspoon
of<00:01:54.149> vanilla<00:01:54.209> extract<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.719> can

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
of vanilla extract so I think that I can

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:04.190 
of vanilla extract so I think that I can
increase<00:01:59.639> it<00:01:59.999> to<00:02:00.329> 1/2<00:02:00.899> teaspoon<00:02:02.569> vanilla<00:02:03.569> then

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
increase it to 1/2 teaspoon vanilla then

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.270 
increase it to 1/2 teaspoon vanilla then
and<00:02:05.240> we'll<00:02:06.240> try<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.509> if<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.709> still<00:02:08.009> a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and we'll try this if this is still a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.309 
and we'll try this if this is still a
little<00:02:08.640> heavy<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.119> fat<00:02:09.300> next<00:02:09.720> time<00:02:09.959> we

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
little heavy on the fat next time we

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.780 
little heavy on the fat next time we
will<00:02:10.849> adjust<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.170> type<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.200> milk<00:02:13.590> maybe<00:02:14.129> going

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
will adjust the type of milk maybe going

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.890 
will adjust the type of milk maybe going
from<00:02:15.000> whole<00:02:15.180> milk

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
from whole milk

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.880 
from whole milk
to<00:02:16.500> UM<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:20.120> 2%<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.360> then<00:02:21.629> going<00:02:22.230> down<00:02:22.470> or

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
to UM to 2% and then going down or

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.830 
to UM to 2% and then going down or
increasing<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.549> amount<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.849> yogurt<00:02:24.239> let's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
increasing the amount of yogurt let's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.250 
increasing the amount of yogurt let's
see<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.799> we'll<00:02:25.920> try<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.540> okay<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.810> here<00:02:28.230> we

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
see so we'll try that okay so here we

our recipe I'm going to use these 2 cups
and<00:02:52.799> we<00:02:53.400> always<00:02:53.700> use<00:02:53.879> this<00:02:54.090> Bullet<00:02:54.629> Blender<00:02:54.799> we

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
and we always use this Bullet Blender we

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.069 
and we always use this Bullet Blender we
we<00:02:56.489> do<00:02:56.639> have<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.849> regular<00:02:57.329> blender<00:02:57.450> which<00:02:57.870> would

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
we do have a regular blender which would

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.289 
we do have a regular blender which would
be<00:02:58.620> easier<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.519> with<00:02:59.790> all<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.060> that

be easier to do this with all of that

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.629 
be easier to do this with all of that

but to be honest I prefer washing the
small<00:03:02.909> cups<00:03:03.239> 2<00:03:03.540> small<00:03:03.780> cups<00:03:04.049> than<00:03:04.319> washing<00:03:04.769> the

small cups 2 small cups than washing the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.580 
small cups 2 small cups than washing the
big<00:03:05.220> blender<00:03:05.609> it's<00:03:05.879> just<00:03:06.120> easier<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.659> me<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.560> I

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
big blender it's just easier for me so I

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.009 
big blender it's just easier for me so I
do<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.950> one<00:03:08.159> at<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.400> time<00:03:08.639> and<00:03:08.970> then<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.659> have<00:03:09.780> 2

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
do it one at a time and then I have 2

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.520 
do it one at a time and then I have 2
cups<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.590> stuff<00:03:11.159> that<00:03:11.909> I'm<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.389> to<00:03:12.689> put<00:03:13.109> into

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
cups of stuff that I'm going to put into

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.160 
cups of stuff that I'm going to put into
my<00:03:13.709> ice<00:03:13.889> cream<00:03:14.189> maker<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:15.180> freezer<00:03:15.599> bowl<00:03:15.810> has

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
my ice cream maker the freezer bowl has

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.470 
my ice cream maker the freezer bowl has
been<00:03:16.349> in<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.560> freezer<00:03:16.819> since<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.030> last<00:03:18.209> time

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
been in the freezer since the last time

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.979 
been in the freezer since the last time
I<00:03:18.510> made<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.810> about<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> week<00:03:19.439> ago<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.419> so<00:03:21.419> that's

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
I made it about a week ago and so that's

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.610 
I made it about a week ago and so that's
what<00:03:22.079> we'll<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:27.510> we'll<00:03:27.690> take<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:27.930> cup<00:03:28.440> out

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
what we'll do so we'll take that cup out

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.280 
what we'll do so we'll take that cup out
and<00:03:28.949> we'll<00:03:29.069> get<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.400> other<00:03:29.519> cup<00:03:29.849> into<00:03:30.449> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
and we'll get the other cup into the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.140 
and we'll get the other cup into the
blender<00:03:31.680> ok<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.730> one<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
blender ok this is the one with the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.360 
blender ok this is the one with the
sugar<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.930> see<00:03:34.799> it's<00:03:34.949> kind<00:03:35.129> of<00:03:35.220> goopy<00:03:35.519> there

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:04:06.840 

Oh

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.449 

I<00:04:06.910> think<00:04:07.660> that's<00:04:07.840> pretty<00:04:08.110> good

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.479 

that's<00:04:13.090> pretty<00:04:13.359> good<00:04:13.780> okay<00:04:14.109> so<00:04:14.920> now<00:04:15.069> we<00:04:15.129> have

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
that's pretty good okay so now we have

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:22.560 
that's pretty good okay so now we have
two<00:04:16.449> containers<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:20.400> mix<00:04:21.400> there<00:04:22.360> are

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
two containers of mix there are

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.420 
two containers of mix there are
different<00:04:23.110> consistencies<00:04:23.800> because<00:04:24.220> I

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
different consistencies because I

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.300 
different consistencies because I
actually<00:04:24.639> didn't<00:04:25.030> put<00:04:25.210> all<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.479> I<00:04:26.100> didn't<00:04:27.100> mix

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
actually didn't put all of I didn't mix

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.400 
actually didn't put all of I didn't mix
them<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:27.910> they<00:04:28.150> were<00:04:28.210> even<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.139> doesn't

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
them so they were even but it doesn't

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.779 
them so they were even but it doesn't
matter<00:04:29.530> it's<00:04:29.680> going<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.220> mixer<00:04:30.490> anyway

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
matter it's going in the mixer anyway

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.120 
matter it's going in the mixer anyway
they<00:04:31.030> just<00:04:31.240> needed<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.630> be<00:04:31.720> blended<00:04:32.199> okay<00:04:32.919> this

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
they just needed to be blended okay this

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.700 
they just needed to be blended okay this
is<00:04:33.310> my<00:04:33.490> freezer<00:04:33.820> bowl<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.509> I<00:04:34.840> keep<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.229> cutted

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
is my freezer bowl and I keep it cutted

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.879 
is my freezer bowl and I keep it cutted
when<00:04:35.889> it's<00:04:36.039> in<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.340> freezer<00:04:37.620> basically<00:04:38.620> once

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
when it's in the freezer basically once

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.550 
when it's in the freezer basically once
we<00:04:39.130> wash<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.570> once<00:04:40.570> we<00:04:40.780> are<00:04:40.810> done<00:04:40.930> making<00:04:41.289> ice

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
we wash it once we are done making ice

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.499 
we wash it once we are done making ice
cream<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:42.009> wash<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.729> put<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.120> back<00:04:43.240> in

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
cream I wash it and put it back in

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.050 
cream I wash it and put it back in
