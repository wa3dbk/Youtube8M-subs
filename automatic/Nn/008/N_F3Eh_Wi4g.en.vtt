00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it was this particular rep where she I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.980 
it was this particular rep where she I
don't<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:23.070> she<00:01:23.220> extended<00:01:23.700> fully<00:01:23.990> let's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
don't think she extended fully let's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.359 
don't think she extended fully let's
take<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> look<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:27.890> yeah<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.159> an

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
take a look right here yeah just an

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030 
take a look right here yeah just an
adequate<00:01:30.000> extension<00:01:30.630> she<00:01:30.869> tried<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.680> pull<00:01:31.860> on

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

adequate extension she tried to pull on
herself<00:01:32.549> under<00:01:32.880> too<00:01:33.090> soon<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.850> here

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
herself under too soon this right here

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.359 
herself under too soon this right here
what<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:38.329> 45<00:01:39.329> 30<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.189> about

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.970 
what was it 45 30 I think this is about
100<00:01:41.579> kilos<00:01:42.649> knocking<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> double

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
big characteristic of my pole what

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.990 
big characteristic of my pole what
you'll<00:01:47.680> notice<00:01:47.860> as<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.160> way<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.340> get<00:01:48.550> heavier<00:01:48.850> as

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
you'll notice as a way to get heavier as

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.070 
you'll notice as a way to get heavier as
I<00:01:49.150> do<00:01:49.870> jump<00:01:50.200> back<00:01:50.380> slightly<00:01:51.690> as<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.930> gets

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
I do jump back slightly as it gets

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.720 
I do jump back slightly as it gets
heavier<00:01:53.440> I<00:01:53.560> jump<00:01:53.800> back<00:01:53.830> more<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.250> more<00:01:54.550> and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
heavier I jump back more and more and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.430 
heavier I jump back more and more and
lean<00:01:54.910> back<00:01:55.120> at<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.360> top<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.570> my<00:01:55.750> pole<00:01:55.990> more<00:01:56.290> and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
lean back at the top of my pole more and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.220 
lean back at the top of my pole more and
more<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:56.860> do<00:01:57.490> not<00:01:57.940> intentionally<00:01:58.300> do<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.990> and

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
more I do not intentionally do this and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.150 
more I do not intentionally do this and
neither<00:01:59.320> should<00:01:59.470> you<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:04.330> was<00:02:04.450> better<00:02:05.160> it's

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
neither should you that was better it's

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.440 
neither should you that was better it's
that<00:02:06.400> first<00:02:06.640> rep<00:02:06.910> 60<00:02:07.660> kilos<00:02:07.990> nicely<00:02:12.060> let's<00:02:13.060> see

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
that first rep 60 kilos nicely let's see

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.590 
that first rep 60 kilos nicely let's see
if<00:02:13.630> she<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.050> finish<00:02:14.320> her<00:02:14.440> pole<00:02:15.120> she<00:02:16.120> extends
