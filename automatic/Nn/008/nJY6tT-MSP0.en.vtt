place<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.100> me<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.000> comparing<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
place for me just kind of comparing the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.990 
place for me just kind of comparing the
two<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.960> seeing<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:07.469> how<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.459> was<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.819> in

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
Scotland and how it was here playing for

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.860 
Scotland and how it was here playing for
Anderlecht<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.120> feel<00:02:12.300> there's<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> lot<00:02:12.750> of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
Anderlecht you can feel there's a lot of

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.589 
Anderlecht you can feel there's a lot of
pressure<00:02:13.080> from

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
pressure from

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.619 
pressure from
supporters<00:02:14.109> because<00:02:14.409> they<00:02:14.799> expect<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:16.510> know

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
supporters because they expect you know

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.330 
supporters because they expect you know
what<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:16.930> call<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:17.409> champagne<00:02:17.920> football

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
what they call here champagne football

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.309 
what they call here champagne football
which<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.849> beautiful<00:02:19.569> football<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.139> they

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
which is beautiful football and they

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.229 
which is beautiful football and they
expect<00:02:20.680> us<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.829> win<00:02:21.129> all<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:22.030> time

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
expect us to win all the time

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.080 
expect us to win all the time
so<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.530> it's<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.430> little<00:02:24.639> bit<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.879> pressure

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
so it's it's a little bit of pressure

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.119 
so it's it's a little bit of pressure
and<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.629> feel<00:02:25.930> it<00:02:26.079> sometimes<00:02:26.530> but<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:26.799> think

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
and you feel it sometimes but I think

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.399 
and you feel it sometimes but I think
overall<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:28.120> play<00:02:28.359> for<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.629> club<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:28.930> has<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
overall you play for a club that has the

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.050 
overall you play for a club that has the
most<00:02:29.620> support<00:02:29.829> in<00:02:30.189> all<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.459> Belgium<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:30.969> you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
most support in all of Belgium and you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.000

see<00:02:31.269> fans<00:02:31.629> from<00:02:31.870> everywhere<00:02:32.019> it's<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.769> small

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
see fans from everywhere it's a small

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.979 
see fans from everywhere it's a small
country<00:02:33.250> but<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.700> think<00:02:33.879> we<00:02:34.239> have<00:02:34.420> support<00:02:34.840> from

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
country but I think we have support from

country but I think we have support from
everywhere<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> country<00:02:35.980> not<00:02:36.129> just<00:02:36.189> in

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
everywhere in the country not just in

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.179

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
team I don't know if they think it's a

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.709 
team I don't know if they think it's a
good<00:03:56.500> competition<00:03:56.889> or<00:03:57.370> if<00:03:57.519> they<00:03:58.120> look<00:03:58.359> down<00:03:58.540> on

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:58.719 
good competition or if they look down on

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.819

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
the national team for the US because you

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.319

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
kind of get that sense in Europe that

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.219 
kind of get that sense in Europe that
they<00:04:05.229> don't<00:04:05.409> think<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.889> Americans<00:04:06.340> are<00:04:06.489> great

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
they don't think the Americans are great

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.420
