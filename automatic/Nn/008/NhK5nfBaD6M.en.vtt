00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
pan it here and click a keyframe again

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:37.850 
pan it here and click a keyframe again
and<00:02:30.890> we'll<00:02:31.890> go<00:02:32.160> back<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:32.940> again<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:36.860> keeping

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and then what it will do is if I could a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.540 
and then what it will do is if I could a
third<00:02:41.330> person<00:02:42.330> again<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.280> see<00:02:44.400> the

third person again as you can see the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.450 
third person again as you can see the
camera<00:02:44.820> does<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.930> movement<00:02:46.320> for<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> said<00:02:47.340> it

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
camera does this movement for I said it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.820 
camera does this movement for I said it
too<00:02:47.640> now<00:02:48.300> all<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.320> adjust

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
too now all you can do is you can adjust

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.190 
too now all you can do is you can adjust
these<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.880> think<00:02:50.910> I'll<00:02:51.630> you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
these it's like you think I'll you

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.690 
these it's like you think I'll you
know<00:02:52.320> that's<00:02:52.530> too<00:02:52.770> steep<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.520> actually

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
know that's too steep you can actually

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.420 
know that's too steep you can actually
grab<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.390> points<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.020> move<00:02:55.290> them<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:56.250> this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
grab the points and move them but this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.820 
grab the points and move them but this
will<00:02:56.670> obviously<00:02:57.000> change<00:02:57.300> your<00:02:58.020> camera<00:02:58.170> and<00:03:00.830> so

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
will obviously change your camera and so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.590 
will obviously change your camera and so
if<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.130> leave<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.340> there<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> first

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
if I just leave it there and get a first

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.200 
if I just leave it there and get a first
person<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.560> what<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.770> will<00:03:04.830> look<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:08.210> so

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
person this is what it will look like so

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.200 
person this is what it will look like so
go<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:09.840> two<00:03:11.270> um<00:03:12.440> where'd<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.590> oh<00:03:14.130> it's<00:03:15.090> only

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
go one two um where'd it oh it's only

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.730 
go one two um where'd it oh it's only
two<00:03:15.480> one<00:03:16.200> two<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.160> that's<00:03:17.430> basically<00:03:17.670> how<00:03:17.970> you

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
two one two and that's basically how you

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.130 
two one two and that's basically how you
animate<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.980> camera<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.570> hard<00:03:21.870> tool

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
animate a camera it's not a hard tool

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.040 
animate a camera it's not a hard tool
you<00:03:22.440> don't<00:03:22.590> need<00:03:22.710> to<00:03:22.830> set<00:03:23.130> all<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.490> stuff<00:03:24.050> all

gonna actually open up one of my recent

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.360 
gonna actually open up one of my recent
projects<00:03:32.840> actually<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.340> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
projects actually because this is a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.550 
projects actually because this is a
perfect<00:03:35.940> way<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.090> show<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.480> if<00:03:36.690> you're<00:03:37.320> doing

perfect way to show it if you're doing
first-person<00:03:38.310> animations<00:03:38.910> for<00:03:39.120> example<00:03:40.100> this

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
first-person animations for example this

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.250 
first-person animations for example this

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
is where this will come in handy this is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.170 
is where this will come in handy this is
actually<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.710> self<00:03:43.980> animation<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:45.090> I'm

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
actually the self animation that I'm

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.090 
actually the self animation that I'm
actually<00:03:45.360> doing<00:03:45.630> one<00:03:46.560> party<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:46.920> you

if i zoom all the way out you can see
everything<00:04:23.010> stretches

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
everything stretches

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.160 
everything stretches
so<00:04:24.650> say<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:25.520> was<00:04:25.700> standard<00:04:26.210> which<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.660> pretty

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
so say this was standard which it pretty

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.200 
so say this was standard which it pretty
much<00:04:27.290> looks<00:04:27.440> standard<00:04:27.800> if<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.310> grabbed<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:28.970> by

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
much looks standard if you grabbed it by

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.390 
much looks standard if you grabbed it by
the<00:04:29.240> point<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:29.720> move<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.320> right<00:04:30.400> you

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
the point and move it to the right you

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.490 
the point and move it to the right you
can<00:04:31.610> sort<00:04:31.970> of<00:04:32.120> zoom<00:04:32.300> out<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.570> bit<00:04:32.690> not<00:04:33.020> making<00:04:33.380> it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
can sort of zoom out a bit not making it

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500 
can sort of zoom out a bit not making it
too<00:04:33.740> stretchy<00:04:34.160> but<00:04:34.640> you<00:04:34.760> can<00:04:34.910> see<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.150> hands

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
too stretchy but you can see the hands

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.300 
too stretchy but you can see the hands
because<00:04:36.500> if<00:04:36.620> you're<00:04:36.770> going<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:36.980> do<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.160> normal

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
because if you're going to do a normal

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.490 
because if you're going to do a normal
first-person<00:04:37.940> animation<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:39.200> hands<00:04:39.380> are

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
first-person animation the hands are

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.780 
first-person animation the hands are
going<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.710> be<00:04:39.770> all<00:04:39.920> big<00:04:40.160> because<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.580> get<00:04:40.670> have

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
going to be all big because you get have

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.400 
going to be all big because you get have
to<00:04:40.910> drag<00:04:41.120> them<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.330> his<00:04:41.480> face<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.110> can<00:04:42.230> look

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
to drag them to his face and it can look

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.680 
to drag them to his face and it can look
a<00:04:42.530> bit<00:04:43.070> so<00:04:43.340> if<00:04:43.640> you<00:04:43.730> just<00:04:43.850> zoom<00:04:44.090> out<00:04:44.360> you

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
a bit so if you just zoom out you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.110 
a bit so if you just zoom out you
know<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:45.680> can<00:04:45.890> see<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.100> bit<00:04:46.160> more<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:50.030> know

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
know you can see a bit more and you know

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.370 
know you can see a bit more and you know

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
things a little bit better but that's

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.750 
things a little bit better but that's
just<00:04:51.500> what<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.770> can<00:04:51.890> do<00:04:52.010> with<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.220> camera<00:04:52.490> and

by<00:06:29.240> hand<00:06:29.450> that's<00:06:29.750> what<00:06:29.840> I'm<00:06:29.930> get<00:06:30.110> into<00:06:30.410> the
