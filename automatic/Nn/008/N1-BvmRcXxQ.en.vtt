00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
first step is to kind of start out at a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.889 
first step is to kind of start out at a
moderate<00:00:36.030> speed<00:00:36.359> you<00:00:36.480> don't<00:00:36.629> want<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> be

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it's a little easier to get kind of a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.959 
it's a little easier to get kind of a
medium<00:00:45.659> speed<00:00:45.839> going<00:00:46.579> first<00:00:47.579> thing<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.819> want
