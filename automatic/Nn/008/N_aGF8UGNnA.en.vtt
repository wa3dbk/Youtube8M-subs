chords<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:24.190> the<00:00:25.190> chords<00:00:25.490> I'm<00:00:25.610> going<00:00:25.760> to

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
chords and the chords I'm going to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.790 
chords and the chords I'm going to
really<00:00:26.060> talk<00:00:26.240> about<00:00:26.300> are<00:00:26.630> sustain<00:00:27.110> chords<00:00:27.590> and

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
really talk about are sustain chords and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.109 
really talk about are sustain chords and
there's<00:00:27.920> two<00:00:28.070> different<00:00:28.369> types<00:00:28.550> or<00:00:28.730> sustains

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
there's two different types or sustains

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.950 
there's two different types or sustains
second<00:00:29.630> sustain<00:00:30.460> fourth<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.730> in<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.629> second

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
second sustain fourth and in the second

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.290 
second sustain fourth and in the second
you<00:00:33.050> add<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:33.199> nine<00:00:33.530> because<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:34.520> second<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.150> the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
you add a nine because the second is the

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.990 
you add a nine because the second is the
same<00:00:35.450> as<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.720> nine<00:00:35.900> basically<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:37.610> fourth

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
same as a nine basically and a fourth

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.050 
same as a nine basically and a fourth
which<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.450> same<00:00:38.660> as<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:38.960> 11th<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.370> sustain

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
which is the same as the 11th so sustain

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.479 
which is the same as the 11th so sustain
four<00:00:41.420> chords<00:00:41.930> in<00:00:42.350> sustain<00:00:42.800> second<00:00:43.220> chords

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489
