00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.829
 we know jub 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:13.609
 Scott know Tel are now here at the rally the noble manufacturer Pavatex 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.289
 at Daniel Bacher 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.619
 he about them are also from the Â«Internet of the founders of this 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:19.820
 company 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.499
 Here you can tell us something about PowerTech. We are here to get it 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.759
 the owners are included as Bavaria bring Alzenau 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.329
 Active Bavarian company 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.460
 and for 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.360
 The brand was founded just 20 years ago, the club exists 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.300
 20th anniversary 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.530
 if you say 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.360
 the maligned, of course 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.580
 that is today 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.290
 Lehmann represented over 44 countries worldwide 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.830
 only in Bavaria will Robin Weber Germany but throughout Europe and 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.010
 then from Korea Apple's Wine Counter 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.330
 in over 44 countries 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.260
 we are facing two each 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.930
 call them noble if they say something to their portfolio what 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.930
 draw them opposite other house 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.640
 this just always means to say we have better here but better 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.060
 Sennhenn swept it is so that we are active they go part very much for that 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.560
 demanded a lot of buoyancy the couple and with fashion and St 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.630
 for the bike 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.020
 and I believe that bricklayer 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.860
 Cottbus continued to be very successful in international competition 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.480
 Nowitzki look ahead in her top model she cites Euro 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.659
 then we see an integrated antiquated advertised for that 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.850
 Exclusively design or if you say that I have to use the fictional 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.480
 it does not have any side benefit otherwise it is natural that a Christian or Muslim 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.520
 With 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.070
 now shared with Image to Gates 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.320
 Norbert Nelles are called the Heller with the integrated semitrailer 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.250
 Works also require keyhole front Zanger so it is very nice 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.430
 it is mostly 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.490
 to recognize the Krad here nicely 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.690
 the electronic citizen is 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.180
 how do you see that development will establish that or is it true? 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.860
 because an exotic 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.540
 And one thing is not great 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 APA NCS is very functional or simply super executes 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 likes a shift feeling that's it in the market right now 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
 not at all familiar with other functional model 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.559
 do you see that so that you can integrate that nicely or will that be 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.219
 continue to be as visible on the frame 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.809
 For the first time the race occurred I think there are still many many 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.439
 possibilities 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.369
 nice professional fine 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.369
 maybe she thought but she is no longer visible 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:32.199
 Ferber will be mounted off the ailing shifter floor and how 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.209
 you turn on or knock on pitbull's head is attached and so on 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.379
 many many details back 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.979
 Chrome or too small a future to think about 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.579
 Everyone is talking about the global economic crisis if you look at it today 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.689
 Dealer orders you save sometimes 6 or 8 weeks that's the same with them 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.059
 and if so why is that? 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.680
 So it does not take us 6 or 8 weeks to get a normal hit 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:54.539
 ten days 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.039
 even in the configuration but there are also 6 to 8 week weather 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.049
 waiting for me to make Mars as well 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.299
 Percent on the physique the finished ruler at the end 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.109
 and there you actually wait 6 to 8 weeks 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.499
 that is, they do not feel the economy current economic crisis or only 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.439
 conditioned 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.439
 so that everyone somehow feels the economic crisis 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.949
 but of course Sam Cooper is on the stage with bypasses 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.319
 how do you see the market development in the next few years where will that be 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.039
 lead 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:27.189
 our whole global question as testimonies with so many countries represented 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.519
 If now one talks about Germany, it always works if relatively 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.169
 Maybe the marketplace market might be something in the whole thing 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.549
 going back but the future will be it then the market council likes absolute 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.759
 Super Train 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.979
 an absolute success 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:43.959
 From September onwards
