things first is this the clutch has got

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.519 
things first is this the clutch has got
to<00:00:15.960> come<00:00:16.109> off<00:00:17.690> so<00:00:18.690> really<00:00:19.020> easy<00:00:19.140> there's<00:00:19.410> gonna

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
to come off so really easy there's gonna

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.070 
to come off so really easy there's gonna
be<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.830> bolt<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:02:05.940 

usually<00:00:25.080> lock<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.590> brake

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:32.770 

so<00:02:06.950> how<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:08.000> works<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.570> screw<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.930> in<00:02:31.780> if

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
so how this works is you screw it in if

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:44.290 
so how this works is you screw it in if
you<00:02:32.930> have<00:02:33.110> this<00:02:41.950> down<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.280> then<00:02:43.940> take<00:02:44.150> this

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
you have this down and then take this

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.699 
you have this down and then take this
out<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:44.959> make<00:02:45.110> sure<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.290> bring<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.560> all<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
out but make sure you bring it all the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.350 
out but make sure you bring it all the
way<00:02:45.830> out<00:02:45.890> actually<00:02:46.520> it's<00:02:46.640> not<00:02:46.790> tightening<00:02:47.240> up

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
way out actually it's not tightening up

00:02:47.360 --> 00:03:18.430 
way out actually it's not tightening up
on<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.630> spring

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
into the secondary just check it out you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:04:09.610 
into the secondary just check it out you
can<00:03:33.180> see<00:03:33.390> it's<00:03:34.489> opening<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.610> up<00:03:36.739> nicely

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.960 
couple ways you can look at this is at
one<00:04:22.470> time<00:04:22.740> when<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.040> first<00:04:23.310> have<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.700> sled<00:04:23.940> I

side take this plate off at that point
investigate<00:04:58.380> everything<00:04:58.770> here<00:04:59.010> look<00:04:59.790> at<00:04:59.910> all

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
investigate everything here look at all

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.670 
investigate everything here look at all
the<00:05:00.150> gears<00:05:00.450> make<00:05:00.720> sure<00:05:00.870> nothing<00:05:01.229> what's<00:05:01.410> going

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
the gears make sure nothing what's going

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.000 
the gears make sure nothing what's going
on<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.850> biggest<00:05:03.180> thing<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.500> you<00:05:04.500> got<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.680> keep

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
on the biggest thing is you got to keep

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.540 
on the biggest thing is you got to keep
an<00:05:05.160> eye<00:05:05.250> on<00:05:05.280> your<00:05:05.520> oil<00:05:06.169> this<00:05:07.169> diamond<00:05:08.160> drive

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
an eye on your oil this diamond drive

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.280 
an eye on your oil this diamond drive
only<00:05:09.000> takes<00:05:10.970> it's<00:05:11.970> it's<00:05:12.330> got<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.169> the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
only takes it's it's got the this is the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.680 
only takes it's it's got the this is the
non<00:05:13.530> reverse<00:05:13.950> does<00:05:14.340> not<00:05:14.550> have<00:05:14.760> reverse<00:05:15.060> so<00:05:15.270> it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
non reverse does not have reverse so it

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.570 
non reverse does not have reverse so it
actually<00:05:16.260> only<00:05:16.380> takes<00:05:16.680> three<00:05:17.010> ounces<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.400> oil

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
actually only takes three ounces of oil

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.490 
actually only takes three ounces of oil
which<00:05:17.880> is

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.590 

so<00:05:21.130> when<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.550> drain<00:05:21.760> your<00:05:21.820> oil<00:05:22.000> you<00:05:22.360> want<00:05:22.480> to

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
so when you drain your oil you want to

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.580 
so when you drain your oil you want to
really<00:05:22.810> make<00:05:23.020> sure<00:05:23.610> one<00:05:25.320> just<00:05:26.320> takes<00:05:26.470> this

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
really make sure one just takes this

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.080 
really make sure one just takes this
little<00:05:26.860> bottle<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:31.270> want<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.450> make<00:05:31.600> sure<00:05:31.780> that

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
little bottle you want to make sure that

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.080 
little bottle you want to make sure that
one<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.630> drain<00:05:34.900> your<00:05:35.020> oil<00:05:35.790> you're<00:05:36.790> gonna<00:05:36.880> look

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
one you drain your oil you're gonna look

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.850 
one you drain your oil you're gonna look
at<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.360> oil<00:05:37.510> investigate<00:05:38.170> the<00:05:38.290> oil<00:05:38.440> look<00:05:38.620> for

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
at the oil investigate the oil look for

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.240 
at the oil investigate the oil look for
any<00:05:39.400> kind<00:05:39.670> of<00:05:39.730> particles<00:05:40.270> metal<00:05:40.960> flakes<00:05:41.260> even

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
any kind of particles metal flakes even

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.370 
any kind of particles metal flakes even
if<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.490> oil<00:05:42.640> is<00:05:42.880> grayish<00:05:43.240> that's<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.110> sign<00:05:44.350> that

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
if the oil is grayish that's a sign that

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.500 
if the oil is grayish that's a sign that
you<00:05:45.250> could<00:05:45.430> have<00:05:45.610> something<00:05:45.850> going<00:05:46.270> in<00:05:46.360> your

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
you could have something going in your

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.500 
you could have something going in your
diamond<00:05:46.840> drive<00:05:47.020> like<00:05:47.230> a<00:05:47.260> bearing<00:05:47.620> or<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.800> gear

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
diamond drive like a bearing or a gear

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.440 
diamond drive like a bearing or a gear
what's<00:05:49.510> planetary<00:05:50.020> gears<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:51.160> the<00:05:51.490> other

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
what's planetary gears to the other

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.650 
what's planetary gears to the other
thing<00:05:52.660> I<00:05:52.750> do<00:05:52.810> is<00:05:53.050> when<00:05:53.200> I<00:05:53.260> drain<00:05:53.920> the<00:05:54.040> oil<00:05:54.070> I
