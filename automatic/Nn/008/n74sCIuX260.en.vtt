00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
on that it should be working it should

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.610 
on that it should be working it should
be<00:02:49.700> nope<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.910> got<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.239> say<00:02:51.480> again<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.900> off<00:02:52.140> without

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620

be nope I got we say again I off without
their<00:02:55.550> down<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:58.380> that

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.110 

I<00:03:04.050> thought<00:03:04.710> split<00:03:05.190> again<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.700> very<00:03:05.910> likely

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
I thought split again and very likely

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.780 
I thought split again and very likely
put<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.540> down<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.020> did<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.070> use

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.990 

that<00:03:12.659> it<00:03:12.930> should<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.200> working<00:03:15.739> as<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:17.010> we're

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that it should be working as I we're

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.330 
that it should be working as I we're
working<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.359> second<00:03:18.719> home<00:03:18.870> I'll<00:03:19.409> get<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.650> going

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
working a second home I'll get it going

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:42.820 
working a second home I'll get it going
in<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> minute

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.090 

so<00:03:43.830> obviously<00:03:44.340> there's<00:03:44.550> some<00:03:44.670> feedback<00:03:45.150> there

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
so obviously there's some feedback there

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.160 
so obviously there's some feedback there
then<00:03:47.100> that's<00:03:48.090> only<00:03:48.270> because<00:03:48.420> I'm<00:03:48.750> in<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.020> same

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
then that's only because I'm in the same

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.990 
then that's only because I'm in the same
room<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.190> guarantee<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.670> works

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
room but I can guarantee it works

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.600 
room but I can guarantee it works
absolutely<00:03:51.810> fine<00:03:51.990> it's<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.680> amazing<00:03:53.400> little

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
absolutely fine it's a amazing little

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.880 
absolutely fine it's a amazing little
thing<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.240> only<00:03:54.360> took<00:03:54.870> was<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.410> little<00:03:55.530> bit

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
thing and it only took was a little bit

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.770 
thing and it only took was a little bit
of<00:03:56.010> code<00:03:56.220> written<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.670> C++<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.310> it

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
of code written in C++ and that was it
