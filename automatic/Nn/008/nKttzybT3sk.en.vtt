00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.300
 Welcome to SBOBET.com's Asian (flat half) betting tutorial 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.871
 In the Asian (flat half), your bet amount will be automatically divided into two equal parts. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 This means that both bets are placed on the same single bet. 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.000
 Take the allowance of 0.25 as an example, sometimes called a quarter-ball to make the ball, for example 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 If you bet 100 euros on a popular team, the odds are 1.80 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.800
 Half of the bet amount will be held in the handicap -0.50 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 The other half of the bet is placed at 0.00 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.500
 Suppose the German team wins with a score of 1:0. This Asian match is 0.50:0. Your first bet is a win. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.900
 Your second bet is also a win, this Asian match is 1:0 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.661
 In other words, you win all the bets, ie 80 euros 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.542
 Suppose the event ends with 0:0, this Asian match is -0.50:0 and you will lose the first bet. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And your second bet is a draw, this Asian match is 0:0 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.750
 In other words, you will lose half of the bet amount, ie 50 Euro 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.610
 Finally, suppose the Portuguese team wins with a score of 0:1. This Asian match is -0.50:1 and you will lose the first bet. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 At the same time, you will also lose the second bet. This Asian match is 0:1 and you will lose all the bets. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.700
 Next, let's see what kind of betting results will be available for the selection of the unpopular team. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:10.600
 If you bet 100 Euro at 2.11 odds and 0.25 your bet will be bet at 0.00 and 0.50 respectively 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.600
 Suppose Germany wins 1:0. This Asian match is 1:0. You will lose the first bet. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 You will also lose the second bet this Asian match is 1:0.50 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.500
 In other words, you will lose all the bet amount, ie 100 Euro 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:45.200
 Suppose the event ends with 0:0, including the handicap, this Asian match is 0:0. Your first bet is a draw. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Your second bet is Win, this Asian match is 0:0.50 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.000
 In other words, you will win half of the winnings, which is 55.50 euros. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 Finally, suppose the event ends with a score of 0:1 and the Portuguese team wins all your bets to win. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 The Asian win of one bet is 0:1, and the Asian bet of another bet is 0:0.50, which finally gets a prize of 110 euros. 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.970
