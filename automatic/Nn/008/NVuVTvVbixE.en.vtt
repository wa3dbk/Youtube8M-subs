how<00:00:12.059> much<00:00:12.179> veining<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.809> put<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.259> would<00:00:13.349> go

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
how much veining you put in it would go

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.279 
how much veining you put in it would go
either<00:00:14.340> direction<00:00:14.630> wetting<00:00:15.630> down<00:00:15.780> our<00:00:15.929> panel

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
either direction wetting down our panel

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.050 
either direction wetting down our panel
which<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.800> an<00:00:16.920> MDF<00:00:17.369> panel<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.820> could<00:00:17.970> be

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
which is just an MDF panel it could be

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.029 
which is just an MDF panel it could be
any<00:00:18.150> kind<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.449> panel<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> latex<00:00:19.650> eggshell

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
any kind of panel with a latex eggshell

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
any kind of panel with a latex eggshell
backing<00:00:20.789> we've<00:00:21.180> spread<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.660> water<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:22.080> it

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
backing we've spread some water on it

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.820 
backing we've spread some water on it
and<00:00:22.350> now<00:00:23.189> Dean<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.060> putting<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> first<00:00:24.830> color

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and now Dean is putting the first color

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.679 
and now Dean is putting the first color
on<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.430> we're<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.670> drizzling<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.240> these

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
on and we're just drizzling it these

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.589 
on and we're just drizzling it these
paints<00:00:28.019> are<00:00:28.109> thinned<00:00:28.349> down<00:00:28.470> 80%<00:00:29.300> with<00:00:30.300> water

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
paints are thinned down 80% with water

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.440 
paints are thinned down 80% with water
and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.590> rest<00:00:31.710> paint<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> whole<00:00:33.270> lot<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and the rest paint so not a whole lot of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.760 
and the rest paint so not a whole lot of
paint<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> water<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.000> paint

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
paint there so the water and this paint

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.010 
paint there so the water and this paint
spritzed<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.730> we'll<00:00:39.360> move<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.840> together

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
spritzed on and we'll move them together

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.530 
spritzed on and we'll move them together
a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.320> bit<00:00:40.879> soften<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> edges<00:00:42.090> these<00:00:42.480> are

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
a little bit soften the edges these are

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.479 
a little bit soften the edges these are
whiz<00:00:42.870> rollers<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.739> we're<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.129> letting<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
whiz rollers and we're just letting the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
whiz rollers and we're just letting the
weight<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> roller<00:00:45.059> basically<00:00:45.719> move<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
weight of the roller basically move the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.830 
weight of the roller basically move the
finger<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> our<00:00:52.949> background

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
finger and this will be our background

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.799 
finger and this will be our background
for<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> further<00:00:55.739> finishes<00:00:56.600> we're<00:00:57.600> coming

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
for the further finishes we're coming

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.630 
for the further finishes we're coming
back<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.140> another<00:00:58.379> gray<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.399> case

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
back with another gray and in this case

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.920 
back with another gray and in this case
we're<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> add<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
we're going to add a little bit of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.119 
we're going to add a little bit of
shaping<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.469> we're<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> make<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> look

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
shaping here we're going to make it look

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.520 
shaping here we're going to make it look
like<00:01:02.280> there's<00:01:02.489> some<00:01:02.640> veins<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
like there's some veins in this kind of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.450 
like there's some veins in this kind of
stone<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.670> Dean<00:01:06.210> has<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.950> gray<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> not

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
stone so Dean has a gray which is not

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.920 
stone so Dean has a gray which is not
unlike<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.939> first<00:01:09.119> grade<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.570> slightly

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
unlike the first grade just slightly

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.420 
unlike the first grade just slightly
different<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.710> use<00:01:10.830> any<00:01:11.010> colors<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
different you can use any colors you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.359 
different you can use any colors you
want<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.720> putting<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.799> slightly

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
want and I'm putting on a slightly

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.240 
want and I'm putting on a slightly
darker<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.900> less<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.799> there's<00:01:16.950> more<00:01:17.100> of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
darker and less of it so there's more of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
darker and less of it so there's more of
his<00:01:17.430> gray<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.000> little<00:01:18.450> less<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.750> mine<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.200> think

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
his gray a little less of mine I think

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.080 
his gray a little less of mine I think
you<00:01:19.860> usually<00:01:20.040> want<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> have

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you usually want to do that if you have

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
you usually want to do that if you have
50/50<00:01:21.540> everything<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> doesn't<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:23.070> quite

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
50/50 everything it doesn't look quite

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
50/50 everything it doesn't look quite
like<00:01:23.400> nature<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.180> done<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.780> again

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
like nature would have done it again

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.840 
like nature would have done it again
we're<00:01:25.799> softening<00:01:26.250> these<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:28.080> idea<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
we're softening these the idea here is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.399 
we're softening these the idea here is
through<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.000> process<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.689> start<00:01:30.960> getting

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
through this process you start getting

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.810 
through this process you start getting
some<00:01:31.590> puddles<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.579> we're<00:01:32.700> just

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
some puddles on there and we're just

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.730 
some puddles on there and we're just
going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> try<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> soften<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:34.170> puddles<00:01:34.470> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
going to try to soften those puddles of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.190 
going to try to soften those puddles of
paint<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.130> bit<00:01:35.479> as<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.689> move<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
paint a little bit as we move on to the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.970 
paint a little bit as we move on to the
next<00:01:37.320> step<00:01:38.030> that's<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.240> him

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.530 

all<00:01:46.980> right<00:01:47.190> now<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.000> next<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.300> we're<00:01:48.450> going

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
all right now the next thing we're going

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.200 
all right now the next thing we're going
to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.810> we're<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.080> add<00:01:49.320> some<00:01:49.740> yellow

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
to do is we're going to add some yellow

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.700 
to do is we're going to add some yellow
just<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.360> nice<00:01:51.540> warm<00:01:51.870> yellow<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.380> we've<00:01:52.500> put

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
just a nice warm yellow that we've put

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.120 
just a nice warm yellow that we've put
in<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.890> spritzer<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.260> just<00:01:55.260> sort<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.620> put<00:01:56.010> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
in a spritzer and just sort of put that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.220 
in a spritzer and just sort of put that
in<00:01:56.190> some<00:01:56.370> of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> areas<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.420> again

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
in some of the areas there again

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.100 
in some of the areas there again
following<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> idea<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.250> veining<00:01:59.580> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
following the idea of the veining and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.390 
following the idea of the veining and
following<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.290> we're<00:02:01.770> taking<00:02:01.920> methyl

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
following that we're taking methyl

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.610 
following that we're taking methyl
hydrate<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.570> we're<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> let<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
hydrate and we're just going to let it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.440 
hydrate and we're just going to let it
drizzle<00:02:04.830> out<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.250> brush<00:02:05.460> onto<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.030> surface

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
drizzle out of a brush onto the surface

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.730 
drizzle out of a brush onto the surface
and<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.840> see<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.260> impacts<00:02:07.590> a

and you can see what it impacts a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.430 
and you can see what it impacts a
surface<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.760> disperses<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.840> painting<00:02:10.290> gives

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
surface it disperses the painting gives

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.460 
surface it disperses the painting gives
you<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> very<00:02:11.010> organic<00:02:11.550> look<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> feel<00:02:12.570> it's<00:02:13.380> a

spritzer<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> white<00:02:33.180> almost<00:02:33.540> like

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
spritzer and this is a white almost like

spritzer and this is a white almost like
the<00:02:33.900> background<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.910> won't<00:02:36.090> use<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
the background and this we won't use the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.390 
the background and this we won't use the
rollers<00:02:37.170> on<00:02:37.350> we'll<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.709> Fritz<00:02:37.920> us<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
rollers on we'll just Fritz us on and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.530 
rollers on we'll just Fritz us on and
this<00:02:38.459> just<00:02:38.700> gives<00:02:38.820> just<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.180> little<00:02:39.390> more

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
this just gives just a little more

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.960 
this just gives just a little more
detail<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.950> spattering<00:02:41.610> here<00:02:41.850> and

detail a little spattering here and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.870 
detail a little spattering here and
there<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:44.100> brings<00:02:44.340> up<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.580> light<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> little
