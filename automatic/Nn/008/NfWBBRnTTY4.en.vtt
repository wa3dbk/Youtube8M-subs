00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.620 
progresses it's pretty much the mechanic
in<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.440> game<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:29.489> real<00:03:29.639> fun<00:03:29.880> part<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.359> the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
in the game the real fun part is the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.449 
in the game the real fun part is the
different<00:03:30.930> cases<00:03:31.139> but<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.590> guess<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.220> kind<00:03:32.430> of

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
different cases but I guess it's kind of

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.400 
different cases but I guess it's kind of
cool<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:33.060> deck<00:03:33.419> out<00:03:33.540> your<00:03:33.599> apartment<00:03:34.290> and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
cool to to deck out your apartment and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.960 
cool to to deck out your apartment and
all<00:03:34.739> these<00:03:34.889> different<00:03:35.160> little<00:03:35.519> things<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
all these different little things and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.610 
all these different little things and
kind<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.599> customize<00:03:36.989> your<00:03:37.169> character<00:03:37.470> as<00:03:37.590> you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
kind of customize your character as you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.589 
kind of customize your character as you
go<00:03:37.919> so<00:03:38.430> might<00:03:38.579> take<00:03:38.760> overall<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.359> game

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
go so might take overall on the game

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.420 
go so might take overall on the game
thus<00:03:39.840> far<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.349> it's<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.889> little<00:03:41.010> bit<00:03:41.250> easy

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
thus far is that it's a little bit easy

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.770 
thus far is that it's a little bit easy
there<00:03:41.760> are<00:03:41.880> three<00:03:42.239> different<00:03:42.510> levels<00:03:42.720> of

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
there are three different levels of

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.539 
there are three different levels of
difficulty<00:03:43.139> easy<00:03:43.530> normal<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.069> hard<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
difficulty easy normal and hard the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.059 
difficulty easy normal and hard the
games<00:03:44.819> on<00:03:45.180> normal<00:03:45.750> by<00:03:45.930> default<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.709> found

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
games on normal by default I found

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.470 
games on normal by default I found
normal<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.459> be<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> little<00:03:47.819> bit<00:03:47.970> easy<00:03:48.150> though<00:03:48.450> I

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
normal to be a little bit easy though I

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.729 
normal to be a little bit easy though I
have<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> say<00:03:48.959> there<00:03:49.109> was<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> case<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.500> I

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
have to say there was a case that I

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.949 
have to say there was a case that I
played<00:03:50.099> earlier<00:03:50.519> today<00:03:50.849> that<00:03:51.150> was<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> little

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
played earlier today that was a little

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.569 
played earlier today that was a little
more<00:03:52.139> difficult<00:03:52.349> so<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.829> like<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> little

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
more difficult so I like that a little

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.670 
more difficult so I like that a little
bit<00:03:53.730> more<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.239> pretty<00:03:54.540> fun<00:03:54.810> though<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.200> like

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
bit more it's pretty fun though I like

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.050 
bit more it's pretty fun though I like
the<00:03:55.829> little<00:03:55.950> banter<00:03:56.340> between<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.669> lawyers

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
the little banter between the lawyers

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.000 
the little banter between the lawyers
the<00:03:57.750> case<00:03:57.959> notes<00:03:58.260> are<00:03:58.440> always<00:03:58.620> really<00:03:58.799> funny

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
the case notes are always really funny

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.569 
the case notes are always really funny
to<00:03:59.190> read<00:03:59.400> I'm<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:00.569> sure<00:04:00.989> if<00:04:01.319> it's<00:04:01.709> worth<00:04:01.829> its

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
to read I'm not sure if it's worth its

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.330 
to read I'm not sure if it's worth its
