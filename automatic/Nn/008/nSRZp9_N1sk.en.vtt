you

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:01.329 
you

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.679 
you
because<00:00:02.080> I<00:00:02.110> have<00:00:02.260> real<00:00:02.710> numbers<00:00:03.270> okay<00:00:04.300> out<00:00:04.510> of

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:04.689 
because I have real numbers okay out of

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.919 
because I have real numbers okay out of
those<00:00:04.840> real<00:00:05.080> numbers<00:00:05.559> I<00:00:05.889> have<00:00:06.929> irrational

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:07.929 
those real numbers I have irrational

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.180 
those real numbers I have irrational
numbers<00:00:08.320> and<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.880> have<00:00:10.830> rational<00:00:11.830> numbers

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
numbers and I have rational numbers

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.850 
numbers and I have rational numbers
rational<00:00:12.430> numbers<00:00:13.330> are<00:00:13.690> real<00:00:14.200> numbers

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
rational numbers are real numbers

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.939 
rational numbers are real numbers
and<00:00:15.070> irrational<00:00:15.820> numbers<00:00:16.209> are<00:00:16.449> real<00:00:17.349> numbers

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
and irrational numbers are real numbers

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.649 
and irrational numbers are real numbers
what<00:00:18.579> are<00:00:18.849> the<00:00:18.939> difference<00:00:19.329> in<00:00:19.480> these<00:00:19.599> two

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:19.659 
what are the difference in these two

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.880 
what are the difference in these two
well<00:00:20.909> irrational<00:00:21.909> numbers<00:00:22.359> are<00:00:22.890> decimals

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
well irrational numbers are decimals

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
well irrational numbers are decimals
that<00:00:24.759> are<00:00:24.939> non<00:00:25.710> terminating<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.220> non

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that are non terminating and non

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.719 
that are non terminating and non
repeating<00:00:29.470> okay<00:00:30.130> I<00:00:30.159> bet<00:00:30.550> you're<00:00:30.699> wondering

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:30.729 
repeating okay I bet you're wondering

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.339 
repeating okay I bet you're wondering
what<00:00:31.119> does<00:00:31.449> that<00:00:31.479> mean

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
what does that mean

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.029 
what does that mean
a<00:00:32.879> repeating<00:00:33.879> decimal<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:35.469> let's<00:00:35.649> say<00:00:35.800> if<00:00:35.920> I

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
a repeating decimal but let's say if I

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.680 
a repeating decimal but let's say if I
have<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.430> number<00:00:36.699> one<00:00:36.969> third

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
have the number one third

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.590 
have the number one third
well<00:00:38.079> one-third<00:00:38.949> that's<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:40.120> rational<00:00:40.570> number

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
well one-third that's a rational number

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.410 
well one-third that's a rational number
we'll<00:00:41.019> talk<00:00:41.289> about<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.710> a<00:00:41.739> little<00:00:41.920> bit<00:00:42.129> later

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
we'll talk about that a little bit later

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.860 
we'll talk about that a little bit later
but<00:00:43.420> if<00:00:43.719> I<00:00:44.079> put<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.469> in<00:00:44.590> my<00:00:44.679> calculator<00:00:45.570> 1/3<00:00:46.570> I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
but if I put that in my calculator 1/3 I

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.840 
but if I put that in my calculator 1/3 I
will<00:00:47.379> get<00:00:47.620> point<00:00:48.039> three<00:00:48.699> three<00:00:49.359> three<00:00:49.870> three

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
will get point three three three three

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.720 
will get point three three three three
three<00:00:51.850> it's<00:00:52.920> repeating<00:00:53.920> we<00:00:54.489> see<00:00:54.550> an

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
three it's repeating we see an

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.869 
three it's repeating we see an
irrational<00:00:55.269> number<00:00:55.570> it's<00:00:56.140> non<00:00:56.859> repeating<00:00:57.460> it

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
irrational number it's non repeating it

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.660 
irrational number it's non repeating it
wouldn't<00:00:58.269> do<00:00:58.359> that<00:00:58.589> another<00:00:59.589> rational<00:01:00.280> number

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
wouldn't do that another rational number

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.079 
wouldn't do that another rational number
and<00:01:01.149> we<00:01:01.480> will<00:01:01.659> talk<00:01:01.899> about<00:01:01.929> this<00:01:02.409> in<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.800> minute

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
and we will talk about this in a minute

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.830 
and we will talk about this in a minute
it's<00:01:04.089> like<00:01:04.269> five<00:01:04.830> divided<00:01:05.830> by<00:01:06.040> two<00:01:06.190> that<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.810> a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
it's like five divided by two that is a

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.550 
it's like five divided by two that is a
rational<00:01:08.560> number<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.610> fraction

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
rational number it is a fraction

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920 
rational number it is a fraction
rational<00:01:11.560> ratio<00:01:12.130> is<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.550> fraction<00:01:13.090> well<00:01:13.420> 5<00:01:13.630> over

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
rational ratio is a fraction well 5 over

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.220 
rational ratio is a fraction well 5 over
2<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.160> same<00:01:15.280> thing<00:01:15.340> as<00:01:15.610> 2<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:16.060> 1/2<00:01:16.230> which

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
2 is the same thing as 2 and 1/2 which

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.520 
2 is the same thing as 2 and 1/2 which
is<00:01:17.560> as<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.950> decimal<00:01:18.730> it<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:20.190> 2.5<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.930> terminates

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
is as a decimal it is 2.5 it terminates

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.150 
is as a decimal it is 2.5 it terminates
it<00:01:23.800> stops<00:01:24.220> it's<00:01:24.850> 2.5<00:01:25.300> okay<00:01:26.140> so<00:01:26.200> real<00:01:26.680> numbers

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
it stops it's 2.5 okay so real numbers

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.790 
it stops it's 2.5 okay so real numbers
are<00:01:28.000> divided<00:01:28.420> into<00:01:28.540> rational<00:01:29.200> numbers<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
are divided into rational numbers and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.400 
are divided into rational numbers and
irrational<00:01:30.520> numbers<00:01:31.050> irrational<00:01:32.050> numbers

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
irrational numbers irrational numbers

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.670 
irrational numbers irrational numbers
non<00:01:33.220> terminating<00:01:34.060> whereas<00:01:34.930> rational<00:01:35.350> numbers

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
non terminating whereas rational numbers

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.760 
non terminating whereas rational numbers
if<00:01:35.920> it's<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.730> decimal<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.300> will<00:01:37.480> terminate<00:01:37.770> non

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
if it's a decimal it will terminate non

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.040 
if it's a decimal it will terminate non
repeating<00:01:39.460> well<00:01:40.270> rational<00:01:40.660> numbers<00:01:40.930> that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
repeating well rational numbers that

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.700 
repeating well rational numbers that
could<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.230> 0.33<00:01:41.770> 53<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:43.570> irrational<00:01:44.410> numbers

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
could be 0.33 53 but irrational numbers

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.160 
could be 0.33 53 but irrational numbers
are<00:01:44.830> non<00:01:45.010> repeating<00:01:45.550> what<00:01:46.300> I<00:01:46.540> need<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:46.990> talk

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
are non repeating what I need to talk

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.860 
are non repeating what I need to talk
about<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.880> rational<00:01:48.880> numbers<00:01:49.240> have<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.450> lot<00:01:49.840> of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
about is rational numbers have a lot of

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.070 
about is rational numbers have a lot of
little<00:01:50.290> groups<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:51.070> there<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:52.120> that<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.840> what

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
little groups in there so that is what

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.980 
little groups in there so that is what
we're<00:01:53.230> gonna<00:01:53.290> focus<00:01:53.710> on<00:01:54.100> now<00:01:54.990> rational

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
we're gonna focus on now rational

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.710 
we're gonna focus on now rational
numbers<00:01:56.730> okay<00:01:57.730> let's<00:01:58.060> start<00:01:58.270> with<00:01:58.360> our<00:01:58.540> most

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
numbers okay let's start with our most

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.920 
numbers okay let's start with our most
elite<00:01:59.170> group<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.280> natural<00:02:00.970> numbers<00:02:01.390> or<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
elite group the natural numbers or the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.250 
elite group the natural numbers or the
counting<00:02:02.650> numbers<00:02:03.450> natural<00:02:04.450> numbers<00:02:04.780> or<00:02:04.960> how

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
counting numbers natural numbers or how

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.609 
counting numbers natural numbers or how
would<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.590> count<00:02:05.830> one<00:02:06.490> two<00:02:06.790> three<00:02:07.600> four<00:02:08.140> five

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
would you count one two three four five

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.730 
would you count one two three four five
six<00:02:09.190> seven<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:10.060> could<00:02:10.450> go<00:02:10.539> on<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.410> on

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
six seven I could go on and on and on

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.240 
six seven I could go on and on and on
then<00:02:12.490> I<00:02:12.520> expand<00:02:13.450> my<00:02:13.750> group<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.380> am

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
then I expand my group I am

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.990 
then I expand my group I am
like<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.940> more<00:02:16.270> person<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.080> my<00:02:17.200> party<00:02:17.680> I

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
like one more person to my party I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.060 
like one more person to my party I
invite<00:02:19.000> zero<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:20.260> my<00:02:20.380> party

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
invite zero to my party

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.660 
invite zero to my party
c0<00:02:22.060> there<00:02:22.240> these<00:02:22.990> are<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> whole<00:02:23.500> numbers<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
c0 there these are the whole numbers the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.910 
c0 there these are the whole numbers the
natural<00:02:25.180> numbers<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:26.410> when<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.590> get<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.770> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
natural numbers but when I get to the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.490 
natural numbers but when I get to the
whole<00:02:27.100> numbers<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.550> put<00:02:27.970> zero<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.080> zero<00:02:29.410> is

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
whole numbers I put zero in so zero is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.520 
whole numbers I put zero in so zero is
invited<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.220> my<00:02:30.460> party<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.900> we<00:02:32.080> want<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> have<00:02:32.470> a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
invited to my party if we want to have a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.430 
invited to my party if we want to have a
little<00:02:32.890> bigger<00:02:33.310> party<00:02:33.850> not<00:02:34.630> only<00:02:35.080> do<00:02:35.320> we

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
little bigger party not only do we

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.970 
little bigger party not only do we
invite<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.950> natural<00:02:36.459> numbers<00:02:36.810> one<00:02:37.810> two<00:02:38.230> three

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
invite the natural numbers one two three

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.730 
invite the natural numbers one two three
not<00:02:39.550> only<00:02:39.850> do<00:02:40.690> we<00:02:40.720> let<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.110> whole<00:02:41.290> numbers

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
not only do we let the whole numbers

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.880 
not only do we let the whole numbers
come<00:02:42.010> which<00:02:42.400> are<00:02:42.610> zero<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.500> natural

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
come which are zero and the natural

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.850 
come which are zero and the natural
numbers<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:46.420> even<00:02:46.690> let<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.170> integers

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
numbers but we even let the integers

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.220 
numbers but we even let the integers
come<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.730> notice<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.450> integers<00:02:49.959> you

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
come so notice that the integers you

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.800 
come so notice that the integers you
have<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.980> counting<00:02:51.430> numbers<00:02:51.550> one<00:02:52.030> two<00:02:52.360> three

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
have the counting numbers one two three

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.550 
have the counting numbers one two three
you<00:02:53.440> also<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:53.920> zero<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.820> that's<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:56.350> whole

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you also have zero so that's the whole

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.430 
you also have zero so that's the whole
number<00:02:56.860> group<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.970> also<00:02:58.209> let<00:02:58.780> negative

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
number group but we also let negative

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380 
number group but we also let negative
one<00:02:59.650> negative<00:03:00.010> two<00:03:00.340> negative<00:03:00.520> three<00:03:01.180> negative

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
one negative two negative three negative

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.229 
one negative two negative three negative

dot<00:03:04.540> dot<00:03:04.570> dot<00:03:04.890> all<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.950> way<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.190> negative

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
dot dot dot all the way to negative

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.030 
dot dot dot all the way to negative
infinity<00:03:07.180> we<00:03:07.750> let<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.050> integers<00:03:08.500> come<00:03:08.770> to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
infinity we let the integers come to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.610 
infinity we let the integers come to
okay<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.030> y'all<00:03:10.270> got<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.570> so<00:03:10.660> far<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.170> natural

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
okay so y'all got it so far the natural

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.540 
okay so y'all got it so far the natural
numbers<00:03:12.300> one<00:03:13.300> two<00:03:13.570> three<00:03:13.870> four<00:03:14.170> five<00:03:14.550> whole

numbers one two three four five whole

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.930 
numbers one two three four five whole
numbers<00:03:16.000> we<00:03:16.660> let<00:03:16.840> zero<00:03:17.200> come<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.310> integers

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
numbers we let zero come to the integers

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.600 
numbers we let zero come to the integers
not<00:03:19.810> only<00:03:20.170> do<00:03:20.320> we<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.890> natural<00:03:21.280> numbers

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
not only do we have the natural numbers

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.740 
not only do we have the natural numbers
and<00:03:21.820> zero<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.590> we<00:03:23.680> also<00:03:23.860> have<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:25.120> negatives

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
and zero but we also have the negatives

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.410 
and zero but we also have the negatives
those<00:03:26.080> are<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.410> integers<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.250> we<00:03:27.730> will<00:03:28.150> be

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
those are the integers and we will be

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.840 
those are the integers and we will be
working<00:03:28.690> with<00:03:28.840> those<00:03:29.080> a<00:03:29.140> lot<00:03:29.410> in<00:03:29.650> algebra<00:03:29.860> well

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
working with those a lot in algebra well

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.270 
working with those a lot in algebra well
if<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.180> are<00:03:31.360> quite<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.989> party<00:03:32.380> animal<00:03:32.410> you

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
if you are quite the party animal you

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.880 
if you are quite the party animal you
may<00:03:33.580> just<00:03:33.910> think<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.360> more<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.930> merrier<00:03:35.170> and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
may just think the more the merrier and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.340 
may just think the more the merrier and
you<00:03:36.549> want<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.850> rational<00:03:37.510> numbers<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.140> come

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
you want the rational numbers to come

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.240 
you want the rational numbers to come
well<00:03:39.340> let<00:03:39.640> me<00:03:39.820> make<00:03:40.150> room<00:03:40.480> on<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.870> screen<00:03:41.250> okay

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
well let me make room on the screen okay

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.030 
well let me make room on the screen okay
so<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:42.730> we<00:03:42.790> are<00:03:43.540> inviting<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.230> rational

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
so now we are inviting the rational

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.300 
so now we are inviting the rational
numbers<00:03:45.600> now<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:46.630> can't<00:03:47.079> even<00:03:47.230> tell<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.980> how

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
numbers now I can't even tell you how

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.830 
numbers now I can't even tell you how
many<00:03:48.489> rational<00:03:49.030> numbers<00:03:49.329> there<00:03:49.480> are

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
many rational numbers there are

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.979 
many rational numbers there are
but<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.829> rational<00:03:51.280> numbers<00:03:51.700> are<00:03:51.940> also<00:03:52.510> known

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
but the rational numbers are also known

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.810 
but the rational numbers are also known
as<00:03:53.910> fractions<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:56.019> one<00:03:56.500> over<00:03:56.530> two<00:03:56.980> three<00:03:57.670> over

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
as fractions so one over two three over

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.620 
as fractions so one over two three over
five<00:03:58.000> negative<00:03:58.930> 12<00:03:59.230> over<00:03:59.530> 3<00:04:00.060> now<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.120> rational

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
five negative 12 over 3 now the rational

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.660 
five negative 12 over 3 now the rational
numbers<00:04:01.900> don't<00:04:02.350> get<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.590> come<00:04:02.769> unless<00:04:03.220> it's<00:04:03.579> a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
numbers don't get to come unless it's a

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.259 
numbers don't get to come unless it's a
a<00:04:03.850> really<00:04:04.510> big<00:04:05.410> party<00:04:05.860> but<00:04:06.700> do<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.090> notice

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
a really big party but do you notice

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.150 
a really big party but do you notice
that<00:04:07.829> 5<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.910> same<00:04:10.090> thing<00:04:10.150> as<00:04:10.360> 10<00:04:10.660> over<00:04:10.810> 2<00:04:11.170> 10

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
that 5 is the same thing as 10 over 2 10

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.819 
that 5 is the same thing as 10 over 2 10
divided<00:04:12.519> by<00:04:12.549> 2<00:04:12.730> is<00:04:12.880> 5<00:04:13.000> right<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.140> number<00:04:14.470> 5

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
divided by 2 is 5 right so the number 5

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.539 
divided by 2 is 5 right so the number 5
5<00:04:16.229> gets<00:04:17.229> invited<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.829> party<00:04:18.040> every<00:04:18.340> time

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
5 gets invited to the party every time

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.670 
5 gets invited to the party every time
because<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.329> natural<00:04:19.840> number<00:04:19.959> now<00:04:20.620> the

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
because it's a natural number now the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.339 
because it's a natural number now the
whole<00:04:20.950> numbers<00:04:21.370> also<00:04:21.640> include<00:04:22.150> 5<00:04:22.360> so<00:04:23.050> do<00:04:23.229> the

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
whole numbers also include 5 so do the

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.350 
whole numbers also include 5 so do the
integers<00:04:23.890> even<00:04:24.370> though<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.849> can't<00:04:25.060> see<00:04:25.120> it

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
integers even though you can't see it

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.900 
integers even though you can't see it
here<00:04:25.720> because<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:26.050> put<00:04:26.200> dot<00:04:26.410> dot<00:04:26.650> dot<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:27.160> it's

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
here because I put dot dot dot and it's

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.180 
here because I put dot dot dot and it's
a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
a

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.980 
a
rational<00:04:28.820> number<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:30.770> if<00:04:30.980> you<00:04:31.310> are<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:31.990> natural

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
rational number so if you are a natural

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.440 
rational number so if you are a natural
number<00:04:33.110> accounting<00:04:33.650> number<00:04:34.090> then<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.270> are<00:04:35.420> a

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
number accounting number then you are a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.330 
number accounting number then you are a
whole<00:04:35.690> number<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:36.170> an<00:04:36.440> integer<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:37.010> a

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
whole number in an integer and a

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.230 
whole number in an integer and a
rational<00:04:37.580> number

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
rational number

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.490 
rational number
aka<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:39.440> fraction<00:04:40.130> if<00:04:40.460> you're<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.910> whole<00:04:41.150> number

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
aka a fraction if you're a whole number

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.930 
aka a fraction if you're a whole number
most<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.740> them<00:04:42.890> are<00:04:43.010> natural<00:04:43.340> numbers<00:04:43.610> except

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
most of them are natural numbers except

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.760 
most of them are natural numbers except
for<00:04:44.090> zero<00:04:44.450> but<00:04:45.050> if<00:04:45.140> you're<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.350> whole<00:04:45.530> number

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
for zero but if you're a whole number

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.920 
for zero but if you're a whole number
then<00:04:46.040> you're<00:04:46.190> also<00:04:46.340> an<00:04:46.550> integer<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.240> also<00:04:47.900> a

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
then you're also an integer and also a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.430 
then you're also an integer and also a
rational<00:04:48.380> number<00:04:48.820> if<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:50.120> are<00:04:50.270> integer<00:04:50.840> well

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
rational number if you are integer well

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.190 
rational number if you are integer well
look<00:04:51.680> here<00:04:51.890> look<00:04:52.250> at<00:04:52.370> negative<00:04:52.580> 12<00:04:53.000> over<00:04:53.090> 3<00:04:53.480> is

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
look here look at negative 12 over 3 is

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.560 
look here look at negative 12 over 3 is
it<00:04:54.470> negative<00:04:54.920> 12<00:04:55.160> divided<00:04:55.550> by<00:04:55.580> 3<00:04:55.730> see<00:04:56.390> that

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
it negative 12 divided by 3 see that

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.440 
it negative 12 divided by 3 see that
that<00:04:57.410> is<00:04:57.590> just<00:04:57.620> negative<00:04:58.310> 4<00:04:58.610> right

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
that is just negative 4 right

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.230 
that is just negative 4 right
so<00:05:00.020> if<00:05:00.140> you're<00:05:00.290> an<00:05:00.410> integer<00:05:00.860> now<00:05:01.640> some<00:05:02.000> of<00:05:02.030> the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
so if you're an integer now some of the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240 
so if you're an integer now some of the
integers<00:05:02.750> are<00:05:03.020> natural<00:05:03.740> numbers<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.130> whole

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
integers are natural numbers and whole

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.190 
integers are natural numbers and whole
numbers<00:05:04.280> but<00:05:04.970> some<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.300> them<00:05:05.390> like<00:05:05.420> negative<00:05:05.990> 1

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
numbers but some of them like negative 1

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.040 
numbers but some of them like negative 1
negative<00:05:06.440> 2<00:05:06.680> negative<00:05:06.830> 3

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
negative 2 negative 3

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.570 
negative 2 negative 3
they're<00:05:09.050> in<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.290> integer<00:05:09.710> group<00:05:09.980> but<00:05:10.430> then

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
they're in the integer group but then

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.150 
they're in the integer group but then
they're<00:05:10.730> also<00:05:11.000> in<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.950> rational<00:05:12.950> group

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
they're also in the rational group

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.040 
they're also in the rational group
starting<00:05:14.030> with<00:05:14.150> 1<00:05:14.450> 1<00:05:14.930> 2<00:05:15.350> 3<00:05:15.380> 4<00:05:16.070> these<00:05:16.340> are<00:05:16.400> the

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
starting with 1 1 2 3 4 these are the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.750 
starting with 1 1 2 3 4 these are the
counting<00:05:18.050> numbers<00:05:18.380> or<00:05:18.530> natural<00:05:18.890> numbers<00:05:19.220> if<00:05:19.550> I

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
counting numbers or natural numbers if I

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.180 
counting numbers or natural numbers if I
add<00:05:19.940> 0<00:05:19.970> to<00:05:20.600> it<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.230> am<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.580> whole<00:05:23.120> numbers

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
add 0 to it I am to the whole numbers

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.770 
add 0 to it I am to the whole numbers
then<00:05:25.190> if<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.460> add<00:05:25.640> negative<00:05:25.970> 1<00:05:26.360> negative<00:05:26.540> 2

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
then if I add negative 1 negative 2

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.060 
then if I add negative 1 negative 2
negative<00:05:26.900> 3<00:05:27.350> I<00:05:27.740> am<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.700> integers<00:05:29.830> but<00:05:30.830> then

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
negative 3 I am to the integers but then

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.120 
negative 3 I am to the integers but then
if<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:31.340> even<00:05:31.580> add<00:05:31.880> fractions

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
if I even add fractions

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.010 
if I even add fractions
well<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.280> 10<00:05:34.550> over<00:05:34.790> 2<00:05:35.030> is<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.330> same<00:05:35.540> thing<00:05:35.600> as

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
well that 10 over 2 is the same thing as

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.630 
well that 10 over 2 is the same thing as
5<00:05:37.510> negative<00:05:38.510> 12<00:05:38.840> over<00:05:39.200> 3<00:05:39.560> that's<00:05:40.340> the<00:05:40.430> same

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
5 negative 12 over 3 that's the same

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.110 
5 negative 12 over 3 that's the same
thing<00:05:40.880> as<00:05:41.090> negative<00:05:42.020> 4<00:05:42.790> even<00:05:43.790> if<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:43.970> think

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
thing as negative 4 even if you think

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.120 
thing as negative 4 even if you think
about<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.360> number<00:05:44.600> 2<00:05:44.900> 2<00:05:45.470> is<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> rational

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
about the number 2 2 is a rational

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.700 
about the number 2 2 is a rational
number<00:05:46.820> because<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.480> can<00:05:47.690> be<00:05:47.870> expressed<00:05:48.410> in

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
number because it can be expressed in

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.890 
number because it can be expressed in
the<00:05:48.800> form<00:05:49.030> 2<00:05:50.030> over<00:05:51.020> 1<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:52.240> rational<00:05:53.240> number<00:05:53.270> can

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
the form 2 over 1 a rational number can

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.800 
the form 2 over 1 a rational number can
be<00:05:53.930> expressed<00:05:54.200> as<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.800> fraction<00:05:54.980> and<00:05:55.580> 2<00:05:56.450> is<00:05:56.720> the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
be expressed as a fraction and 2 is the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.420 
be expressed as a fraction and 2 is the
same<00:05:57.050> thing<00:05:57.290> as<00:05:57.850> 2<00:05:58.850> over<00:05:58.880> 1<00:05:59.260> but<00:06:00.260> also<00:06:00.530> included

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
same thing as 2 over 1 but also included

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.190 
same thing as 2 over 1 but also included
in<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:02.090> rational<00:06:02.510> numbers<00:06:02.840> are<00:06:03.020> those

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
in the rational numbers are those

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.870 
in the rational numbers are those
numbers<00:06:03.410> like<00:06:04.160> 1/2<00:06:05.150> or<00:06:05.840> there's<00:06:06.230> 4/3<00:06:07.190> what<00:06:07.760> is

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
numbers like 1/2 or there's 4/3 what is

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.970 
numbers like 1/2 or there's 4/3 what is
4/3<00:06:08.390> 4/3<00:06:09.080> is<00:06:10.030> 1<00:06:11.030> and<00:06:11.800> 1/3<00:06:12.800> so<00:06:13.550> yes<00:06:13.850> 4/3<00:06:14.750> it<00:06:15.740> will

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
4/3 4/3 is 1 and 1/3 so yes 4/3 it will

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.850 
4/3 4/3 is 1 and 1/3 so yes 4/3 it will
go<00:06:16.070> a<00:06:16.100> little<00:06:16.490> bit<00:06:16.760> past<00:06:16.790> the<00:06:17.450> 1<00:06:17.930> but<00:06:18.620> not

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
go a little bit past the 1 but not

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.000 
go a little bit past the 1 but not
before<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.460> to<00:06:19.669> the<00:06:20.419> 2<00:06:20.690> if<00:06:21.320> I<00:06:21.500> want<00:06:21.680> to<00:06:21.770> express

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
before the to the 2 if I want to express

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.610 
before the to the 2 if I want to express
that<00:06:22.400> as<00:06:23.330> a<00:06:23.450> fraction<00:06:23.660> it<00:06:24.110> can<00:06:24.230> also<00:06:24.380> be

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
that as a fraction it can also be

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.530 
that as a fraction it can also be
expressed<00:06:24.919> as<00:06:25.280> 6<00:06:25.700> over<00:06:25.970> 3<00:06:26.980> that<00:06:27.980> is<00:06:28.160> 2<00:06:28.490> oh<00:06:28.790> this

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
expressed as 6 over 3 that is 2 oh this

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.409 
expressed as 6 over 3 that is 2 oh this
is<00:06:29.720> getting<00:06:29.870> messy<00:06:30.580> you<00:06:31.580> know<00:06:31.610> I<00:06:31.730> majored<00:06:32.330> in

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
is getting messy you know I majored in

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.740 
is getting messy you know I majored in
math<00:06:32.660> not<00:06:33.050> an<00:06:33.230> art<00:06:33.610> okay<00:06:34.610> maybe<00:06:35.390> this<00:06:35.570> is<00:06:35.720> a

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
math not an art okay maybe this is a

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.500 
math not an art okay maybe this is a
little<00:06:35.900> bit<00:06:35.990> better<00:06:36.140> now<00:06:36.260> so<00:06:36.650> if<00:06:36.800> 1<00:06:37.130> is<00:06:37.610> 3<00:06:38.390> over

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
little bit better now so if 1 is 3 over

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.999 
little bit better now so if 1 is 3 over
3

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.450 

and<00:06:41.129> two<00:06:41.939> is<00:06:42.389> six<00:06:42.749> over<00:06:42.900> three<00:06:43.050> then<00:06:43.889> four<00:06:44.159> over

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
and two is six over three then four over

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.100 
and two is six over three then four over
three<00:06:44.490> goes<00:06:44.969> somewhere<00:06:45.389> between<00:06:45.569> the<00:06:45.869> one<00:06:46.080> and

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
three goes somewhere between the one and

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.469 
three goes somewhere between the one and
the<00:06:46.439> two<00:06:46.469> right<00:06:47.069> where<00:06:47.699> would<00:06:47.819> three<00:06:48.029> FISC<00:06:48.270> oh

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
the two right where would three FISC oh

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.869 
the two right where would three FISC oh
well<00:06:48.839> that's<00:06:49.169> still<00:06:49.349> less<00:06:49.559> than<00:06:49.589> one<00:06:49.949> so<00:06:50.339> that

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
well that's still less than one so that

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.579 
well that's still less than one so that
goes<00:06:51.029> over<00:06:51.210> here<00:06:51.449> okay

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:52.589 
goes over here okay

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.670 
goes over here okay
so<00:06:52.740> let's<00:06:53.099> finish<00:06:53.849> this<00:06:54.210> video<00:06:54.599> we<00:06:55.439> have<00:06:55.649> the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
so let's finish this video we have the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.489 
so let's finish this video we have the
real<00:06:56.099> numbers<00:06:56.580> in<00:06:56.960> the<00:06:57.960> real<00:06:58.110> numbers<00:06:58.469> you

00:06:58.489 --> 00:06:58.499 
real numbers in the real numbers you

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:01.730 
real numbers in the real numbers you
have<00:06:58.740> some<00:06:58.979> irrational<00:06:59.789> numbers<00:07:00.180> and<00:07:00.740> then

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
have some irrational numbers and then

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.219 
have some irrational numbers and then
you<00:07:01.830> have<00:07:01.949> some<00:07:02.129> rational<00:07:02.309> numbers<00:07:02.879> and<00:07:03.479> the

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
you have some rational numbers and the

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.279 
you have some rational numbers and the
rational<00:07:04.740> numbers<00:07:05.749> those<00:07:06.749> are<00:07:06.779> the<00:07:06.990> numbers

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:07.289 
rational numbers those are the numbers

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:10.189 
rational numbers those are the numbers
that<00:07:07.649> are<00:07:08.279> fractions<00:07:08.939> rational<00:07:09.839> numbers<00:07:10.110> are

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 
that are fractions rational numbers are

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.119 
that are fractions rational numbers are
also<00:07:10.409> known<00:07:10.559> as<00:07:10.740> fractions<00:07:11.659> but<00:07:12.659> in<00:07:12.869> there<00:07:13.229> you

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:14.129 
also known as fractions but in there you

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:18.799 
also known as fractions but in there you
also<00:07:14.370> have<00:07:15.379> integers<00:07:16.379> and<00:07:16.999> the<00:07:17.999> integers<00:07:18.509> are

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:18.809 
also have integers and the integers are

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.829 
also have integers and the integers are
all<00:07:19.499> the<00:07:19.740> counting<00:07:20.099> numbers<00:07:20.249> zero<00:07:21.210> and

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:21.839 
all the counting numbers zero and

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:25.549 
all the counting numbers zero and
negative<00:07:22.830> numbers<00:07:23.479> but<00:07:24.479> then<00:07:24.749> our<00:07:24.990> group<00:07:25.199> gets

00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:25.559 
negative numbers but then our group gets

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:28.129 
negative numbers but then our group gets
even<00:07:25.830> more<00:07:25.860> elite<00:07:26.610> and<00:07:26.909> it<00:07:27.330> said<00:07:27.479> the<00:07:27.569> integers

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
even more elite and it said the integers

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.579 
even more elite and it said the integers
then<00:07:28.740> we<00:07:29.339> get<00:07:29.550> to<00:07:29.729> include<00:07:30.180> the<00:07:30.960> whole<00:07:31.169> numbers

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:31.589 
then we get to include the whole numbers

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:33.439 
then we get to include the whole numbers
so<00:07:31.800> if<00:07:32.189> you're<00:07:32.399> a<00:07:32.430> whole<00:07:32.759> number

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:33.449 
so if you're a whole number

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:35.480 
so if you're a whole number
you're<00:07:33.839> an<00:07:33.990> integer<00:07:34.379> and<00:07:34.709> you're<00:07:35.069> also<00:07:35.249> a

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490 
you're an integer and you're also a

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.309 
you're an integer and you're also a
rational<00:07:35.969> number<00:07:36.029> and<00:07:36.599> you're<00:07:36.719> also<00:07:36.870> part<00:07:37.229> of

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 
rational number and you're also part of

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:39.679 
rational number and you're also part of
the<00:07:37.529> real<00:07:38.099> numbers<00:07:38.550> okay<00:07:39.330> and<00:07:39.419> then<00:07:39.569> we<00:07:39.659> have

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:39.689 
the real numbers okay and then we have

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:42.439 
the real numbers okay and then we have
the<00:07:40.080> most<00:07:40.289> elite<00:07:40.889> group<00:07:41.339> those<00:07:42.180> are<00:07:42.389> the

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:42.449 
the most elite group those are the

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:45.409 
the most elite group those are the
natural<00:07:42.629> numbers<00:07:43.259> so<00:07:44.189> zeros<00:07:44.580> not<00:07:44.789> invited<00:07:45.330> to

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 
natural numbers so zeros not invited to

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:49.879 
natural numbers so zeros not invited to
this<00:07:45.539> party<00:07:46.550> that<00:07:47.550> is<00:07:47.819> the<00:07:48.029> natural<00:07:48.990> numbers

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:49.889 
this party that is the natural numbers

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:53.329 
this party that is the natural numbers
there<00:07:50.659> okay<00:07:51.659> so<00:07:51.719> once<00:07:52.080> again<00:07:52.259> if<00:07:52.830> you're<00:07:53.309> a

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:53.339 
there okay so once again if you're a

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.179 
there okay so once again if you're a
natural<00:07:54.089> number<00:07:54.509> you<00:07:54.809> are<00:07:54.990> a<00:07:55.020> real<00:07:55.589> number<00:07:55.830> you

00:07:56.179 --> 00:07:56.189 
natural number you are a real number you

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:59.239 
natural number you are a real number you
are<00:07:56.639> a<00:07:56.669> rational<00:07:57.180> number<00:07:57.569> you<00:07:58.559> are<00:07:58.709> an<00:07:58.889> integer

00:07:59.239 --> 00:07:59.249 
are a rational number you are an integer

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:02.839 
are a rational number you are an integer
you<00:07:59.610> are<00:07:59.849> a<00:07:59.879> whole<00:08:00.180> number<00:08:00.559> you<00:08:01.559> are<00:08:01.889> a<00:08:01.949> natural

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:02.849 
you are a whole number you are a natural

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.779 
you are a whole number you are a natural
number<00:08:03.449> good<00:08:04.259> luck<00:08:04.709> with<00:08:04.949> your<00:08:05.099> definitions
