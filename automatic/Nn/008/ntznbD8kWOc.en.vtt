Welcome on Aquascaping Lab channel

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.380
in this video tutorial we are talking about Symphysodon discus, Heckel Discus

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.160
Red Discus Fish or commonly called Pompadour Discus

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.040
It 'a freshwater bony fish belonging to the Cichlidae family

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.800
comes from Brazil, along the basin of the Amazon

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.200
Rio Negro and Lives calm waters

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.980
Has a very compressed body at the sides

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.100
have a disc-shaped by profile

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.040
the ventral fins are long and thin

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.160
anal and dorsal are also rounded, but rather large

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.640
the tail fin is delta sheep

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.120
The livery is extremely variable are always present maculature or vertical stripes

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.160
of various colors, white yellow orange

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.660
red green blue brown and white

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.000
Symphysodon discus are among the most popular in the aquarium

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:17.601
but is not easy to maintain because they require very precise values ​​of water values

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:22.561
(PH acids and low GH) and are very delicate

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:27.421
surely we must be attentive to the presence of nitrites and nitrates

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.941
because suffering presence of polluted water

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.140
It 'a herd fish so we suggest to have a group of 5 specimens

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.680
and coexists well with other cichlids or catfishes and characins

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.360
Grow enough so even if they are peaceful require large spaces

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.360
must be placed in tanks not less than 200 liters

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:05.420
for swimming and hiding formed by rich vegetation and woods

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.180
There is no difference between males and females

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.660
female have the genital papilla may be bigger

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.060
are oviparus fish and reproduction in the aquarium is very difficult or impossible

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.240
the temperature will be 30-31 degrees and water nitrites and nitrates free

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.520
the eggs are monitored by the male and the female, to defend them from predators

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:04.720
after hatching the fry are fed with a special liquid secreted by the parents for a short period

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.286
They are omnivorous, so we suggest granules

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.760
flakes, brine shrimp, mosquito larvae and insects

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.240
Usually the cost of a specimen of one Discus is around 20/30 €

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.480
therefore is not very economical

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.000
for the proper management of the water values as PH GH and Temperature

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.200
for increase alimentation and fish care acquaintances

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.320
from fry breeding to disease prevention

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.520
