00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.920
 Hello dear spectator, my name is 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.870
 Michael zieger and I have hempel 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.040
 from bramsche today again something to 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:20.390
 noticed test 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:21.950
 the mini quadrocopter 816 in the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.960
 scope of delivery included 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.390
 this great aircraft with extra 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.130
 Propeller a charger at the same time 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.829
 the you also included for two batteries 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.059
 who is ever a peach 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.399
 the only thing I would have liked 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.989
 that for remote control extra 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.399
 battery would have been there but so 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.359
 one must again extra large course 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.920
 run for four small AA batteries, the 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.050
 whole device has a diameter of 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.730
 only twelve centimeters and here I am 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.960
 equal curious as the whole the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.960
 wind from it and can defy 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.940
 the whole way including battery after in 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.440
 the air 350 grams is not much but 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.080
 Let's see how the whole thing 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.720
 behaves the charging time of the batteries is enclosed 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.490
 about 75 minutes and so I would 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.350
 say that two batteries can be gift 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.119
 but a must because the whole flight time 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.190
 is only eight minutes 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.899
 So now we pack the cameras 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.909
 and see if he has the thing out there 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.350
 get to fly 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.640
 so we come now to the practical test of 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.140
 november also has a nice day 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.770
 and that 's just right 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.710
 for this little sparkling machine as 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.460
 First turn on the remote control 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.270
 lever must be down and battery is already 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.600
 fully charged 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.369
 Now we're putting everything in my pocket 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.720
 hate those little plugs with mine 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.050
 fat grabbe fumble me every time 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:57.429
 but that will not change 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:02:00.780
 So now the regulator works 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.800
 push up and down again 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.950
 Now he has received his reception 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.250
 Now I'm curious 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.250
 first flight 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.550
 wetzel a fence then it's like at 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.550
 the formula 1 ever really gaudi 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.880
 My opinion is a great device to buy
