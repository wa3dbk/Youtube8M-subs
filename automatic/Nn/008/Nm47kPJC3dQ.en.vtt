to<00:00:10.920> be<00:00:11.099> showing<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.639> how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.910> manage

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
to be showing you how to manage

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.079 
to be showing you how to manage
different<00:00:12.630> iPhoto<00:00:13.349> libraries<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.790> what<00:00:14.940> this

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
different iPhoto libraries so what this

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.359 
different iPhoto libraries so what this
essentially<00:00:15.540> means<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.220> I'm

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
essentially means is first of all I'm

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.070 
essentially means is first of all I'm
going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> show<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> move<00:00:18.480> an<00:00:18.690> iPhoto

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
going to show you how to move an iPhoto

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.560 
going to show you how to move an iPhoto
library<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.430> want<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.730> save<00:00:21.000> space<00:00:21.330> on

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
library so if you want to save space on

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.090 
library so if you want to save space on
your<00:00:21.779> Mac's<00:00:22.020> hard<00:00:22.350> drive<00:00:22.650> because<00:00:22.859> you're

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
your Mac's hard drive because you're

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.009 
your Mac's hard drive because you're
running<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> storage<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.900> an

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
running out of storage and you have an

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
running out of storage and you have an
external<00:00:25.410> drive<00:00:25.890> maybe<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> backup<00:00:26.939> drive

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
external drive maybe a backup drive

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
external drive maybe a backup drive
which<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.810> use<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> put<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> photos<00:00:28.859> on

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
which you can use to put the photos on

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.830 
which you can use to put the photos on
then<00:00:29.699> I'll<00:00:29.789> show<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> drag<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
then I'll show you how to drag the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.870 
then I'll show you how to drag the
photos<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.679> Mac<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.369> hard<00:00:32.610> drive

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
photos from your Mac to that hard drive

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
photos from your Mac to that hard drive
and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.540> delete<00:00:33.899> them<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.530> Mac<00:00:34.770> so

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and then delete them off of your Mac so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.819 
and then delete them off of your Mac so
that<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.219> save<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> hard<00:00:36.180> drive<00:00:36.420> space

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
that you save a lot of hard drive space

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.380 
that you save a lot of hard drive space
because<00:00:37.829> photos<00:00:38.219> use<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.820> lot<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> storage

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
because photos use up a lot of storage

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
because photos use up a lot of storage
and<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.440> secondly<00:00:40.829> I'm<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.309> be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and then secondly I'm going to be

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.840 
and then secondly I'm going to be
showing<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.149> within<00:00:42.540> iPhoto<00:00:43.670> stro<00:00:44.670> at

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
showing me how to within iPhoto stro at

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.610 
showing me how to within iPhoto stro at
which<00:00:45.059> library<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> open<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
which library you want to open and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.229 
which library you want to open and
create<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> new<00:00:47.190> library<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.730> well<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
create a new library as well if you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
create a new library as well if you
wanted<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.739> let's<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.160> started<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.760> I'm

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
wanted to so let's get started what I'm

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.790 
wanted to so let's get started what I'm
going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> show<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> first<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.930> said<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.530> how

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
going to show you first as I said is how

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100 
going to show you first as I said is how
to<00:00:52.860> move<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.280> iPhoto<00:00:53.699> library<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:54.930> just

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to move an iPhoto library so I'm just

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.040 
to move an iPhoto library so I'm just
going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> come<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.920> finder<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> way

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
going to come into finder and the way

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.770 
going to come into finder and the way
that<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.500> find<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:59.010> iPhoto<00:00:59.879> library<00:00:59.910> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that you can find your iPhoto library is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
that you can find your iPhoto library is
if<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> pictures<00:01:02.280> folder<00:01:02.579> then

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
if you go into the pictures folder then

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
if you go into the pictures folder then
you<00:01:03.600> should<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.229> iPhoto<00:01:04.650> library<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you should see your iPhoto library in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.490 
you should see your iPhoto library in
here<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.810> it'll<00:01:07.020> look<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.200> this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
here in there so it'll look like this

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
here in there so it'll look like this
the<00:01:07.710> name<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.220> iPhoto<00:01:08.760> library<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.659> size

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the name will be iPhoto library the size

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
the name will be iPhoto library the size
will<00:01:10.229> depend<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.650> how<00:01:10.830> many<00:01:10.890> photos<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.580> have

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
will depend on how many photos you have

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.090 
will depend on how many photos you have
in<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.710> I've<00:01:13.830> got<00:01:14.070> my

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
in it and you can see here I've got my

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.359 
in it and you can see here I've got my
storage<00:01:14.700> device<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> WD<00:01:16.470> drive<00:01:16.770> which

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
storage device I have a WD drive which

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
storage device I have a WD drive which
is<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.880> brand<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.420> hard<00:01:18.630> drive<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.950> we

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
is just a brand of hard drive so if we

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
is just a brand of hard drive so if we
want<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> move<00:01:20.549> these<00:01:20.820> photos<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
want to move these photos what we do is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.270 
want to move these photos what we do is
we<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.560> click<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> drag<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.950> then<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.040> just

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
we just click and drag and then we just

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640 
we just click and drag and then we just
drop<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.090> drive<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.439> let

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
drop it on your drive and then just let

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
drop it on your drive and then just let
go<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.540> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
go and then what it's going to do is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.590 
go and then what it's going to do is
it's<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> copy<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> drive<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it's going to copy it to that drive it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749 
it's going to copy it to that drive it
won't<00:01:33.840> move<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.500> it'll<00:01:34.710> copy<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.610> then

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
won't move it but it'll copy it so then

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.310 
won't move it but it'll copy it so then
you<00:01:35.790> need<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.270> back<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.110> still

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you need to go back because it's still

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.469 
you need to go back because it's still
on<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.770> iMac<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.430> well<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:39.000> hard<00:01:39.180> drive

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
on your iMac as well as your hard drive

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
on your iMac as well as your hard drive
and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.560> delete<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:41.400> your

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and then you can delete it up from your

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.030 
and then you can delete it up from your

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
iMac by clicking on its name then right

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.929 
iMac by clicking on its name then right
clicking<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.180> pressing<00:01:46.140> move<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.799> trash<00:01:47.040> then

clicking and pressing move to trash then
you<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> it'll<00:01:48.630> disappear<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.649> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you see that it'll disappear then you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.859 
you see that it'll disappear then you
can<00:01:49.920> right<00:01:50.130> click<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.520> trash<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> press<00:01:51.390> empty

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
can right click on trash and press empty

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.230 
can right click on trash and press empty
trash<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.610> move<00:01:53.790> photos

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
trash so that's how you can move photos

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
trash so that's how you can move photos
from<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.600> Mac<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.380> hard<00:01:55.590> drive<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:56.130> lot

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
from your Mac to your hard drive a lot

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
from your Mac to your hard drive a lot
of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> time<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.210> might<00:01:57.390> take<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> long<00:01:57.930> time<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
of the time it might take a long time to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.889 
of the time it might take a long time to
copy<00:01:58.850> depending<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.969> how<00:02:00.149> many<00:02:00.390> photos<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
copy depending on how many photos you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.840 
copy depending on how many photos you
have

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
have

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.270 
have
could<00:02:02.090> take<00:02:02.270> anywhere<00:02:02.750> from<00:02:03.049> 30<00:02:03.380> seconds<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.100> a

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
could take anywhere from 30 seconds to a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.760 
could take anywhere from 30 seconds to a
few<00:02:04.610> hours<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.299> as<00:02:05.930> I<00:02:05.960> said<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.409> depends

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
few hours and as I said it depends

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.830 
few hours and as I said it depends
largely<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.430> how<00:02:07.729> many<00:02:07.909> photos<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:08.539> have<00:02:08.569> in

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
largely on how many photos you have in

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.930 
largely on how many photos you have in
your<00:02:08.959> library<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:10.369> I'm<00:02:10.459> going<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.789> show

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
your library so now I'm going to show

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.540 
your library so now I'm going to show
you<00:02:10.970> within<00:02:11.330> iPhoto<00:02:11.930> how<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.319> figure<00:02:12.800> out<00:02:12.950> how

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
you within iPhoto how to figure out how

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.490 
you within iPhoto how to figure out how
to<00:02:13.610> show<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.180> where<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.660> new<00:02:14.840> location<00:02:15.410> is

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
to show it where the new location is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.320 
to show it where the new location is
because<00:02:15.770> iPhoto<00:02:16.250> won't<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.760> able<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.090> find

because iPhoto won't be able to find

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.479 
because iPhoto won't be able to find
your<00:02:17.510> photos<00:02:17.930> anymore<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:19.040> what<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.250> need<00:02:19.370> to

do I'll just close this up make sure

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.830
