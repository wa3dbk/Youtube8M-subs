actually I I thought this is one of the
like<00:01:50.970> some<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> levels<00:01:51.810> tend<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> drag<00:01:52.320> on

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
like some of the levels tend to drag on

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
like some of the levels tend to drag on
kind<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> long<00:01:53.340> throughout<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> game<00:01:54.090> with

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
kind of long throughout the game with

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.380 
kind of long throughout the game with
this<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:56.670> level<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> next<00:01:57.270> level

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
this one this level and the next level

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.780 
this one this level and the next level
we're<00:01:57.750> shorter<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.070> enjoyed<00:01:59.399> them<00:01:59.579> quite<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
