00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.600
 as the month of April approaches 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.129
 the news will rain around 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.089
 the windows phone ecosystem waiting 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.890
 a major update 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.230
 we talk about it today hello to all 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 it is Wednesday, March 5, 2014 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.780
 and it's the fresh blood the days when 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:22.920
 we will also talk about google that's 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:24.270
 party of these sportsmen joe belfiore us 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.010
 had announced it in person this Sunday 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.180
 February 23 in barcelona where we were sitting 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.789
 right in front of him at that moment 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.800
 facebook messenger has arrived for 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.690
 windows phone and if microsoft has little 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.890
 communicated on this output it is also 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.720
 because the app is not entirely 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 identical to the ios and android versions 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.649
 simessenger offers the possibility of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.149
 chat with his facebook friends including 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.620
 in group conversations 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.329
 and if you can share photos and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 sent stickers he is however 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.780
 can not do voice chat 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.430
 other difference the cat bubbles that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.719
 allow as well on ios as on 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.219
 android to bring up 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.270
 notifications and conversations at 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.010
 above all other windows 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.110
 applications are not part of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.430
 there, either, it's still a 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.350
 once again a great step forward for 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.670
 windows phone so do not sulk our 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.889
 pleasure the mobile platform of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.090
 microsoft is catching up to speed 

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:07.049
 big v 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.639
 a few more weeks to wait 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.079
 before the official presentation of 

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:12.119
 windows phone 8 points has again 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.100
 but we now know cortana 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.630
 the voice assistant of windows phone is 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.639
 a clone of syria but which also draws 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.979
 his inspiration in the character of 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:21.990
 cortana a virtual entity the game halo 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 in a video not very official we 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.109
 let's get to know cortana after 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.060
 the presentations for the assistant and 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.859
 the user cortana is at his service 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.109
 through a discrete presence a 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.429
 simple animated and punctuated blue circle 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.469
 sound effects straight out of 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.119
 halo cortana works exactly like 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.679
 syria with a conversation system 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.939
 based on questions answers rather 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.009
 than on maps like google does 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.240
 now for microsoft the goal is to bring 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.950
 a touch of intelligence to your 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.719
 windows phone and answer only 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.829
 when you query it where google 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.569
 is not going to take initiatives 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.700
 according to your location or your 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.919

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.509
 your entire smartphone contact 

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:55.919
 historical email navigation and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.329
 search to bring you 

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:59.159
 more precise answers more info 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.939
 official this month 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.399
 next at the presentation 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.389
 windows phone official 8 points there 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.799
 a few days ago talking to you about 

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:07.169
 google tango project that helps 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.759
 model a real space in 3d thanks to 

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:10.410
 a smartphone with special sensors 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.520
 the first consumer application 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.230
 using tango comes from 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.600
 go out and surprise it works with 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.010
 a classic smartphone flybuy messenger 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.090
 is an app that allows you to scan 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.560
 everyday objects 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 you add these objects in your 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.950
 collection and you can then their 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.810
 attach messages when a 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.250
 person misses this object is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.020
 warned that a message awaits him and when 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.910
 she scans the object in turn with 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.500
 the application the message appears them 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.610
 tango project skills are here 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.680
 used to recognize and identify 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.240
 objects because photos and videos 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.040
 are not always framed by the same 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.750
 way if the uses of this app 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.400
 seeming little limited we can imagine 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.750
 others for example add 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.460
 contextual elements of the objects of the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.140
 daily have museums on the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.520
 monuments or why not let 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.990
 reviews on products in stores 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.180
 we will see well use but a priori 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.490
 investors believe in it since flybuy 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.530
 messenger has already raised 10 million 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.790
 dollars of funding is not nothing 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.770
 the question of the day comes from wash 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.330
 who has a budget of around 250 euros for 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.250
 change his smartphone he 's asking for the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.690
 advise then hi wesh for the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.370
 budget you have available we are not going there 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.960
 to go four ways better 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.670
 models across all categories that 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.950
 we know at this rate there and the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.660
 nokia lumia 620 level report quality 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.130
 price there's no better nokia are 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.870
 excellent and the library is improving 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.620
 from day to day but if you prefer 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.060
 the android universe 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.400
 one of the best products of the moment and 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.080
 the acer liquid e 2 duo at 2 100 euros 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.520
 and if you want to stay on android you have 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.140
 two other possible ways we are 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.640
 advises on the one hand to take a look 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.260
 side of previous generations you can 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.240
 do very good business with the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.740
 nexus google cap or the galaxy s iii 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.360
 of samsung that are sold off and are 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.530
 now in his budget another 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.209
 solution is to aim for new 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.120
 entry-level smartphones like those 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.320
 casam yasuhiko brands before you 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.430
 decide still checks if 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.690
 the device you have chosen is 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.220
 regularly updated with the 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.050
 latest versions of android and the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.180
 processor is important qualcomm is 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.290
 better than media library for example if 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.670
 you are looking for a smartphone top of 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.170
 range that is used in one hand this 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.270
 this time he does not miss our take in 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 hand precisely sony xperia z in 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.940
 compact that we shot in 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.040
 outside you'll see it's pretty cool 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.270
