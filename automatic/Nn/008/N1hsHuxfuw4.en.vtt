00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.380
 we all love games as they are 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
 but I judge the game to shower it by shit 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.020
 the discrepancy is complete delusional we too 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.510
 love 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.140
 about this we made the top 7 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.970
 idiot gaming caches 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.010
 the seventh sense opens on to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.109
 exploding barrels as it is commonplace 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 style in the barrel to at once the number 2 crowd 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.850
 mind let's not be so naive 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.130
 why would barrels of fuel explode 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 from our power because even the ravan highway 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 and bullets practically incapable 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 perform this difficult task but not 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.440
 we will forget that we will just play 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.789
 into the game so seriously claim to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.559
 We do not have 6 mods in games for this stamp . 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.539
 This is generally a separate conversation wild 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.030
 outfit some female characters of games 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.800
 causes frank not that were able to 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.570
 the wardrobe of many gaming women 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.670
 must be present less 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.770
 skirt or tight shorts in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.870
 exceptions this is armor stockings armor bra 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.820
 we are certainly not sure but waving 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 huge ax and don't shoot out 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 rocket launchers on huge heels not very 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.229
 it’s convenient but once you know how to target 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.760
 huge elastic plus dancing game 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.009
 dress code immediately forget 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.280
 probably only because gaming fashion 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.960
 only in the sixth place of our top 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.520
 overload jump above your height this 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 of course an interesting conversation 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.880
 but I would like to remember about the other not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.579
 less interesting moment 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 strong legs of our main character 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.329
 yes from 10-meter height after which to go 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
 further as if nothing had happened 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.770
 it is of course normal if you cry 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.689
 the portal explains why the main 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 the heroine didn't crash into a tortilla after 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.250
 falling from a great height then a phenomenon 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.009
 same problem in other games to us 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.350
 totally incomprehensible 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.450
 The fourth news is of course one of the most 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.880
 The main game only this salvation 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.929
 humanity of the whole world and of course 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.579
 whole universe 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.310
 after all, to complete this global task 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.840
 maybe only one of us chosen but 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.090
 agree to be nice almost in 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.429
 alone save the universe from the unknown 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.890
 shit and get thanks from everything 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.899
 mankind however the data only was 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.250
 clearly borrowed from the cinema 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.470
 therefore, only 4 greatness places and three 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.569
 leaders opens mysterious pills and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.579
 syringes capable in seconds 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.250
 cure cancer broken legs and arms 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.040
 of course darn and heal 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.920
 broken bodies and holes will allocate either 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.910
 but for some reason the same magic pill 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.200
 inability to graze from a knife wound 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.359
 during the caste 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.400
 Well, in third place yes on the cliché only 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.530
 because pockets are hospital with full 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.440
 the course of treatment is the form of the mysterious 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.590
 Tablets also not changed for a simple 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.420
 these prophecies just a little bit 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.600
 enough to lead this top 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860
 motivations the main characters of our children 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.810
 game scenarios usually tells us about 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.620
 the fact that our hero had a wife killed 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.440
 parents 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.870
 favorite parrot and even neighbors from home 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.300
 opposite and your best killed them all 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.310
 friend at the same time destroying all life to 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.530
 become the supreme leader of the mafia bugs 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.600
 overgrown and the main character himself is nothing 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.330
 he does not remember this because he has 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.190
 amnesia and now throughout the game 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.440
 the character will have to find out what he is 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.840
 any dragon in the human body or 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.670
 another creature who ideally knows 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.170
 all martial arts and can get there 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.110
 flies in the eye a distance of several 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.080
 kilometers and with a gun 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.310
 there are scenes and confusing and number 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.820
 one gets behind him weighs 10 pieces 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.040
 screws 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.320
 each pocket is a pistol on 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.900
 knee beating bag with all sorts of mines 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.790
 rockets and all kinds of grenades in the left 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.310
 hand machine gun in his right hand and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.100
 grenades for our main characters 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.260
 this is garbage because we still manage with such 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.220
 arsenal jump above your head run 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.410
 faster cars 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.730
 in parallel we move multi-ton 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.550
 boxes and bags 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.190
 not just advertising for a lack of sports 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.890
 it's good if everything is in a coin and more 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.500
 and seen 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.630
 After all, there are such heroes who manage 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.819
 put the whole arsenal in your pocket 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.340
 mouse in general our winner 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.080
 today's top desktop characters games with 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.569
 a whole arsenal in your pocket 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.040
 you watched this all diverse game 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.010
 that's just the absurd and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.989
 idiocy and while people make similar 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.850
 only about their games we can only 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.980
 rejoice and be touched 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.290
 by the way we would be pleased if you 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.160
 wrote in the comments under the video about 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.220
 what are the cliches 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.650
 idiocy we could forget or what if you 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.380
 do not agree with what gaming cliche 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.240
 It had to win and that's all, and 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.240
 see you all soon
