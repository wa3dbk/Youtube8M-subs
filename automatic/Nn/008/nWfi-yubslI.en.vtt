rotate<00:06:34.950> this<00:06:36.050> like<00:06:37.050> that<00:06:37.260> so<00:06:37.470> you<00:06:37.560> can<00:06:37.710> see<00:06:37.980> how

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
rotate this like that so you can see how

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.550 
rotate this like that so you can see how
it<00:06:38.520> looks<00:06:38.670> and<00:06:39.540> that's<00:06:39.720> about<00:06:39.870> as<00:06:40.140> well<00:06:40.320> too

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560

user but i don't think it's the easiest
visa<00:07:20.580> I<00:07:20.700> don't<00:07:20.910> think<00:07:21.030> the<00:07:21.120> Kindle<00:07:21.780> Fire<00:07:22.350> has<00:07:22.590> a

visa I don't think the Kindle Fire has a

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.740 
visa I don't think the Kindle Fire has a

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
little bit easier interface with it but

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.230 
little bit easier interface with it but
overall<00:07:25.410> it's<00:07:26.250> nice<00:07:26.490> it<00:07:26.850> can<00:07:26.970> be<00:07:27.060> a<00:07:27.090> little

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240
