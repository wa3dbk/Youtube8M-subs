 reforestation in architecture and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.120
 construction 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.899

 in total are 62 environments all 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.969
 prepared by architects of the state where 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.580
 trends such as reuse 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.950
 materials and presented new 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.100
 like this application of something unheard of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.760
 of drumond a casacor this year by 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.820
 adopted a theme that was the first 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.189
 the 2009 theme and because it is a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.140
 theme so important it will continue 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.299
 for next year also 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.189
 that sustainability 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.100
 nowadays there is a very 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.470
 the world over the future. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.390
 of our planet, then the companies 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 are all worried about using material 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.119
 reused water and reused tulle 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.479
 the reforestation wood and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.950
 natural lighting and natural ventilation 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:54.270
 also to do everything to use the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.180
 little as possible so that no forces 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 natural of the sustainability of this 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.340
 care depends on the future of our 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340
 planet 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.430
 wood has always been present in 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.770
 architecture and civil construction 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.600
 the scarcity of native forests requires 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.730
 a reforestation and an activity 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.590
 sustainable logging to ensure the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.490
 raw material and preserve forests 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.450
 native floors and furniture coverings 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.030
 Details 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.210
 eucalyptus and pinus are present 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.800
 both in internal and external use 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.740
 demonstrating the union of concepts such as 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.740
 utility resistance beauty and comfort 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.600
 here in this ludic and colorful environment 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.550
 concept of sustainability was also 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.220
 widely used 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.690
 Ariane talks to people you thought 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.320
 to the concept was used those 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.140
 environment is first is we begin 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.300
 with the right foot that was very low and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.800
 started working already leaving in the 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.240
 children's step that was our 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.920
 people's first concern 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.170
 Second comes the lighting 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.019
 colorful music we can work 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.390
 all part of is primary 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.820
 the child is very fond of leather but 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.519
 really liven up the environment 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.250
 another thing is important is that people 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.260
 have to put is that the whole wood was 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.360
 of reforestation 100% reforestation 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 so why did the color house come right? 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.650
 with this theme this year talking about 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.769
 sustainability that is economically 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.690
 is it feasible you have to have socially 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.880
 a social concern that has the support 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.709
 on ecologically sound approval 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.570
 so then there are three important things 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.330
 of the sustainability that we try 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.900
 to disclose with our supplier that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.000
 a great collaborator that our fans 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.560
 which gave us all the wood that was 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.019
 super important is that everything done in 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.730
 Australian fine that is the average x that 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.620
 has wood that both for external 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.080
 internal purchase showed that it is 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.260
 possible to get a pine 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.570
 face plus nine in the lacquer in the race not only 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.209
 want rustic feathers that everyone 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.940
 external user treatment 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.430
 autoclave we do not have 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.290
 for which you can use in the part 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.030
 more chic interior more 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.320
 beautiful you did too 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.520
 toys with the wood of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.530
 reforestation 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.690
 yes we showed that the pilot of the 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.670
 wood for reforestation 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.450
 can use it in various ways with 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.190
 painting is and also one can leave also 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.830
 in the natural form of wood as you 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.830
 can see on the floor and the toys also 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:39.370
 In addition to the wood, other material was 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.680
 used in an innovative way 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.840
 away from its main function the coal 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.479
 plant to receive a prominent place in the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.139
 winter garden among orchid vases 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.139
 and spouts 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.610
 in practice the house color shows that several 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.169
 possibilities can be adopted on the 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.780
 the day and that sustainable architecture 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.409
 can contribute to the quality of life 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.409
 of people
