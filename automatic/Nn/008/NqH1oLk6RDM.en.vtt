00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.140
 today you are going to want to eat at home we are going to 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.370
 use the term water 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.639
 3 crab sticks an onion strips 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.680
 of bacon 6 prawns and half a kilo of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.109
 macaroni in this case are spirals 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.490
 but may be any other 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.130
 any other way 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.760
 and a cream brick so I have to 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.810
 to do is to start twisting everything 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.519
 and right away 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.519
 the one who has a life 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.290
 and we already have the poached onion 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.770
 and what we are going to do is with the onion 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.210
 cut and I can make it listen 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.660
 it will take us about 10 minutes 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.660
 approximately and when poached 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.059
 we will observe for arranged 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.059
 so I'll be back in a little while 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.740
 we will watch and walk now if the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.909
 I leave and while I'm getting to know 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.909
 macaroni 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.969
 to make the macaroni we will put 2 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.229
 diego liters in the pot with salt and 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.750
 when it starts to boil, we have the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.030
 macaroni and a drop of oil but 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.469
 that's about the march that teaches already 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.550
 we have the water and now I 'm going to throw 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.710
 tino good salt 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.510
 with this what we have is that it boils 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.570
 faster and then the macaroni 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.850
 have a salty flavor 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.420
 until it boils well then while 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530
 I was doing this, I've been 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 cutting the bacon because this strip is 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.300
 very fat but with me but nothing I have 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.890
 done here and so with all the flavor of me 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.980
 you can also use bacon that much 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.040
 more squishy and eats everything and when 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.910
 the onion must be golden 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.910
 we will add in my with trophy 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.159
 well we have the boiling water and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.040
 we will be macaroni half kilos of 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.040
 pressure as more hands 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.900
 I move a little 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.900
 let's add a little oil 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.160
 and in which it boils 14 minutes 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.670
 boiling 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:34.340
 and we'll take it out to the colander so 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.860
 meanwhile the onion and the onion 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.110
 it takes two minutes listening to each other so 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.110
 It's time to throw another addict's shake 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.610
 in the laps 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.610
 and in five minutes we have 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.940
 so far I do not know if you can appreciate 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.040
 how is the onion is the time 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.240
 remove the strips of bacon and the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.240
 prawns to catch color 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.540
 and we are going back 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.300
 we are also adding the sticks of 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.460
 crab 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:21.360
 this nothing a minute and we booked it 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.160
 good reason, 16 minutes have passed 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.860
 we have tried the macaroni is in that 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.920
 point so I 'm going to strain them and come back 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.310
 the recipe is ok we have the casserole 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.810
 free let's throw the cream that first 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.520
 we had what 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.310
 and shake 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.010
 we will be a little salt 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.010
 and we'll have 3 minutes at medium heat 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.030
 the mornings 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.730
 we'll wait three minutes on low heat 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.380
 Well we have the warm cream 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.950
 then let's throw on them 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.950
 all 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.959
 that mixture 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.310
 and now it's my turn done they killed her sometimes 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:19.329
 I have to cut you because at the time of 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.750
 position for to put will put everything 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.750
 the product 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.070
 what's wrong with it 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.550
 we will take advantage of the final point 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.240
 what is a little bit of basil that is going 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.240
 very good to the pasta 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.469
 we'll leave it another minute 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:54.050
 and delicacy of the gods 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.050
