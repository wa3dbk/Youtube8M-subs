very good very good on that set okay

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.270 
very good very good on that set okay
let's<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.470> what<00:03:28.620> else<00:03:28.709> we<00:03:28.860> got

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280

let's see what else we got
single<00:03:29.700> jointed<00:03:30.209> knee<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.470> does<00:03:31.620> kind<00:03:31.860> of

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
single jointed knee and it does kind of

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.980 
single jointed knee and it does kind of
do<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> little<00:03:32.280> swivel<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:33.959> of

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
do a little swivel and this is one of

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.900 
do a little swivel and this is one of
the<00:03:34.140> things<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.590> looks<00:03:35.070> like<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:35.730> got

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the things is looks like it you got

the things is looks like it you got
these<00:03:36.030> big<00:03:36.360> huge<00:03:36.980> not<00:03:37.980> clown<00:03:38.250> feet<00:03:38.520> but<00:03:38.820> his

these big huge not clown feet but his

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.680 
these big huge not clown feet but his
like<00:03:39.390> lower<00:03:39.840> portion<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.920> thighs<00:03:41.190> are<00:03:42.120> skinny

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
like lower portion the thighs are skinny

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.020 
like lower portion the thighs are skinny
in<00:03:42.870> comparison<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.709> his<00:03:43.860> calves<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.520> whatnot

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
in comparison to his calves and whatnot

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.820 
in comparison to his calves and whatnot
you<00:03:45.570> got<00:03:46.640> toe<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:48.500> articulation<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.680> that's

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
you got toe to articulation and that's

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.300 
you got toe to articulation and that's
about<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
about it

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.840 
about it
and<00:03:50.760> no<00:03:50.880> real<00:03:51.510> heel<00:03:51.870> spur<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.590> that's<00:03:52.800> kind<00:03:53.730> of

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
and no real heel spur so that's kind of

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.400 
and no real heel spur so that's kind of
primitive<00:03:54.090> not<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.540> think<00:03:54.900> about<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> thought

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
primitive not I think about it I thought

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.320 
primitive not I think about it I thought
it<00:03:55.500> was<00:03:55.620> awesome<00:03:55.770> back<00:03:56.160> then<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.580> hey<00:03:56.700> in

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
it was awesome back then but hey in

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.940 
it was awesome back then but hey in
three<00:03:57.570> years<00:03:57.780> time<00:03:58.020> you<00:03:58.380> get<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.739> see

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
three years time you get to see

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.280 
three years time you get to see
especially<00:03:59.360> since<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.450> evolution<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:01.110> this

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
especially since the evolution of this

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.580 
especially since the evolution of this
line<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:03.450> let's<00:04:03.600> go<00:04:03.720> ahead<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.110> take<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> look

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
line so let's go ahead and take a look

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.410 
line so let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.860> like<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.580> said<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.790> like<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.150> bright

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
at that like I said I like the bright

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.479 
at that like I said I like the bright
red<00:04:06.720> finish<00:04:07.290> metallic<00:04:07.680> finish<00:04:08.070> rather<00:04:08.250> than

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
red finish metallic finish rather than

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.400 
red finish metallic finish rather than
the<00:04:08.580> matte<00:04:08.760> finish<00:04:09.140> transformations<00:04:10.140> really

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the matte finish transformations really

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.770 
the matte finish transformations really
easy<00:04:10.620> there's<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.040> sole<00:04:11.390> clip<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.630> back

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
easy there's this sole clip in the back

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.420 
easy there's this sole clip in the back
over<00:04:13.110> here<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.530> slower<00:04:13.800> that<00:04:14.040> down<00:04:14.250> we're

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
over here just slower that down we're

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.560 
over here just slower that down we're
going<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.640> start<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:14.970> this<00:04:15.120> head<00:04:15.300> basically

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
going to start with this head basically

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.070 
going to start with this head basically
rotate<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.350> 360<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:17.160> put<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.000> down<00:04:18.359> there<00:04:18.930> we

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
rotate it 360 and put it down there we

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.800 
rotate it 360 and put it down there we
go<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.980> just<00:04:20.340> clip<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.700> back<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.180> top<00:04:21.539> and

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
go and just clip that back on top and

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.420 
go and just clip that back on top and
there's<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> little<00:04:22.500> notch<00:04:22.710> over<00:04:22.950> here<00:04:23.250> with

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
there's a little notch over here with

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.860 
there's a little notch over here with
that<00:04:23.460> tabs<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.210> there's<00:04:24.360> tab<00:04:24.600> right<00:04:24.840> here

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that tabs in and there's tab right here

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.260 
that tabs in and there's tab right here
and<00:04:25.289> then<00:04:25.950> just<00:04:26.130> push<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:26.520> down<00:04:26.580> real

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
and then just push that down real

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.659 
and then just push that down real
easy<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:28.199> weak<00:04:28.410> little<00:04:28.680> shoulders<00:04:29.039> go<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
easy the weak little shoulders go in the

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.520 
easy the weak little shoulders go in the
back<00:04:29.849> right<00:04:30.150> here<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.599> of<00:04:30.990> course<00:04:31.020> there's<00:04:31.470> a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
back right here and of course there's a

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.719 
back right here and of course there's a
little<00:04:31.740> hinge<00:04:31.919> right<00:04:32.129> here<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.699> just

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
little hinge right here so it just

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.390 
little hinge right here so it just
changes<00:04:33.660> right<00:04:33.870> straight<00:04:34.229> down<00:04:34.259> here<00:04:34.710> then

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
changes right straight down here then

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.700 
changes right straight down here then
you<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.729> rotate<00:04:35.909> this<00:04:36.389> and<00:04:36.720> we're<00:04:37.530> going<00:04:37.680> to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
you can rotate this and we're going to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.800 
you can rotate this and we're going to
go<00:04:37.860> ahead<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.280> put<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:38.639> little<00:04:38.909> fist<00:04:39.180> down

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
go ahead and put this little fist down

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.960 
go ahead and put this little fist down
in<00:04:40.080> here<00:04:40.409> and<00:04:40.560> see<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.370> little<00:04:41.550> gauntlet

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
in here and see this little gauntlet

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.029 
in here and see this little gauntlet
here<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.419> actually<00:04:42.720> acts<00:04:43.169> like<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.409> cover<00:04:43.740> so

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
here it actually acts like a cover so

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.249 
here it actually acts like a cover so
just<00:04:44.460> rotate<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:45.000> 90<00:04:45.180> degrees<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.479> there's

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
just rotate it 90 degrees and there's

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.960 
just rotate it 90 degrees and there's
little<00:04:46.470> tabs<00:04:46.680> right<00:04:46.889> here<00:04:46.949> and<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.430> tap<00:04:47.819> it

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
little tabs right here and just tap it
