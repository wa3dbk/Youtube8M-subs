immortal and there used to be two

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.410 
immortal and there used to be two
archons<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.759> only<00:01:38.909> looks<00:01:39.180> like

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
archons but now that only looks like

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.550 
archons but now that only looks like
there's<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> archons<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.560> didn't

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
there's one and for the archons I didn't

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.630 
there's one and for the archons I didn't
know<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> make<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.840> blue<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.229> didn't<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
know how to make a blue I didn't want to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
know how to make a blue I didn't want to
make<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> blue<00:01:48.299> crumpled<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:48.960> ball<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.290> decided

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
make a blue crumpled up ball so decided

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
make a blue crumpled up ball so decided
to<00:01:52.409> make<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:53.640> looked<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> inside

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
to make one that looked like the inside

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.319 
to make one that looked like the inside
of<00:01:55.049> an<00:01:55.170> Archon<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.860> ever<00:01:56.040> saw<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:59.329> yeah

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
of an Archon if you ever saw it and yeah

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.230 
of an Archon if you ever saw it and yeah
so<00:02:01.079> I'm<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:02.250> blue<00:02:02.520> plastic<00:02:02.850> wrap

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
so I'm going to get blue plastic wrap

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.270 
so I'm going to get blue plastic wrap
and<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.450> wrap<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.140> wrap<00:02:05.630> around<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and just wrap the wrap around that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
and just wrap the wrap around that
archons<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> looks<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> real

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
archons so that it looks like a real

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.440 
archons so that it looks like a real
Archon<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.370> yeah

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
Archon so yeah

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.420 
Archon so yeah
I<00:02:13.489> think<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.670> got<00:02:14.879> inspiration<00:02:15.500> for<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.800> from
