afternoon and so far kind of so good I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.320 
afternoon and so far kind of so good I
have<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.800> admit<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.400> had<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.820> harder<00:00:21.150> time

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
have to admit that I had a harder time

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
have to admit that I had a harder time
at<00:00:21.869> home<00:00:22.050> than<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.289> did<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> hospital<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
at home than I did in the hospital and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
at home than I did in the hospital and
part<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.539> think<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> meds<00:00:25.230> that

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
part of that I think was the meds that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.410 
part of that I think was the meds that
they<00:00:25.529> were<00:00:25.590> giving<00:00:26.099> me<00:00:26.279> when<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
they were giving me when I was in the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.560 
they were giving me when I was in the
hospital<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.230> also<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> bed<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.939> far

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
hospital and also the bed there is far

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.269 
hospital and also the bed there is far
easier<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.990> get<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.800> than<00:00:32.040> my<00:00:32.070> own

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
easier to get in and out of than my own

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.819 
easier to get in and out of than my own
bed<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.850> home<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> challenge<00:00:34.739> I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
bed at home so that was a challenge I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.350 
bed at home so that was a challenge I
woke<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.100> several<00:00:35.309> times<00:00:35.460> last<00:00:35.880> night<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.239> I

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
woke up several times last night which I

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
woke up several times last night which I
almost<00:00:36.540> never<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.410> needing<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> use<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
almost never do just needing to use the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.479 
almost never do just needing to use the
restroom<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.410> getting<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> down<00:00:41.190> was

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
restroom so so getting up and down was

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.060 
restroom so so getting up and down was
really<00:00:41.940> kind<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.379> tough<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
really kind of that was really tough so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.600 
really kind of that was really tough so
I<00:00:44.100> think<00:00:44.219> tonight<00:00:45.000> I'll<00:00:45.180> probably<00:00:46.460> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.520> be

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I think tonight I'll probably kind of be

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.139 
I think tonight I'll probably kind of be
a<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.789> upright<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> couch<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:50.149> sleep

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.249 
excess water weight that I had to keep
on<00:01:53.549> getting<00:01:53.790> up<00:01:54.060> last<00:01:54.270> night<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> pee<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
on getting up last night to pee out I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
on getting up last night to pee out I
guess<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.130> kind<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.520> leaving<00:01:56.670> my<00:01:56.850> system<00:01:57.270> but

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
guess it's kind of leaving my system but

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630 
guess it's kind of leaving my system but
that<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:58.320> means<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.979> need<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> make

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that just means I think I need to make

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
that just means I think I need to make
sure<00:01:59.790> I'm<00:01:59.880> cognizant<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.540> I'm<00:02:00.810> having

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
sure I'm cognizant that I'm having

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.039 
sure I'm cognizant that I'm having
having<00:02:02.340> enough<00:02:02.670> water<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.780> don't<00:02:03.930> get

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
having enough water so I don't get

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.479 
having enough water so I don't get
dehydrated<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:06.110> overall<00:02:07.110> okay<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.860> coughing

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
dehydrated so overall okay I'm coughing

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
dehydrated so overall okay I'm coughing
up<00:02:08.819> these<00:02:09.060> little<00:02:09.209> phlegm<00:02:09.599> balls<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.050> don't

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
up these little phlegm balls I don't

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.960 
up these little phlegm balls I don't
know<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.379> already<00:02:10.590> talked<00:02:10.770> about<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.009> but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
know if I already talked about that but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.059 
know if I already talked about that but
I'm<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.420> kind<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> feel

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
I'm I kind of feel

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.890 
I'm I kind of feel
like<00:02:13.159> I've<00:02:13.280> got<00:02:13.310> something<00:02:13.879> about<00:02:14.269> right<00:02:14.450> here

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
like I've got something about right here

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.869 
like I've got something about right here
it<00:02:15.590> kind<00:02:15.799> of<00:02:15.829> Flemmi<00:02:16.719> gross<00:02:17.719> yellow<00:02:18.200> greenish

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
it kind of Flemmi gross yellow greenish

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.520 
it kind of Flemmi gross yellow greenish
stuff<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:20.090> I'm<00:02:20.180> coughing<00:02:20.599> up<00:02:20.749> I<00:02:21.049> think

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
stuff that I'm coughing up I think

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.770 
stuff that I'm coughing up I think
that's<00:02:21.889> from<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.219> general<00:02:22.579> anesthesia<00:02:23.060> but

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
that's from the general anesthesia but

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.489 
that's from the general anesthesia but
not<00:02:24.019> sure

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:24.499 
not sure

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.429 
not sure
and<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:25.189> I'm<00:02:25.489> not<00:02:25.760> nearly<00:02:26.689> where<00:02:27.139> I<00:02:27.170> should

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
and then I'm not nearly where I should

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.459 
and then I'm not nearly where I should
be<00:02:27.590> with<00:02:27.769> my<00:02:28.670> little<00:02:28.819> breath<00:02:29.180> machine<00:02:29.900> thing

where you blow you suck and then the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.330 
where you blow you suck and then the
