six<00:00:29.289> dollars<00:00:29.679> or<00:00:29.859> more<00:00:30.099> so<00:00:30.999> this<00:00:31.689> is<00:00:31.749> a<00:00:31.810> great

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
six dollars or more so this is a great

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.940 
six dollars or more so this is a great
game<00:00:32.349> for<00:00:33.040> that<00:00:33.280> price<00:00:34.590> we'll<00:00:35.590> just<00:00:35.770> go<00:00:35.890> ahead

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
game for that price we'll just go ahead

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.070 
game for that price we'll just go ahead
and<00:00:36.070> jump<00:00:36.370> into<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.700> settings<00:00:37.090> and<00:00:37.420> very

and jump into the settings and very

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.080

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
basically you have I cloud syncing which

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.570 
basically you have I cloud syncing which
is<00:00:40.240> great<00:00:40.540> so<00:00:40.840> it'll<00:00:41.080> go<00:00:41.230> between<00:00:41.650> iPhone<00:00:42.280> and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
the iphone is multi-party which means

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.169 
the iphone is multi-party which means
it's<00:01:31.569> not<00:01:31.719> fully<00:01:32.380> multiplayer<00:01:33.219> yet<00:01:33.609> you<00:01:33.999> get

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
island with it never messing up

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.500 
island with it never messing up
basically<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.170> one's<00:02:50.320> pretty<00:02:50.500> tricky

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
basically so that one's pretty tricky

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.030 
basically so that one's pretty tricky
you<00:02:52.510> know<00:02:52.540> they<00:02:52.810> start<00:02:53.110> out<00:02:53.200> relatively<00:02:53.740> easy

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
you know they start out relatively easy

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.920 
you know they start out relatively easy
and<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.610> objectives<00:02:55.120> get<00:02:55.360> harder<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.870> harder

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
and the objectives get harder and harder

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.950 
and the objectives get harder and harder
and<00:02:56.320> harder<00:02:56.700> am<00:02:57.700> i<00:02:57.910> doing<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.390> 20<00:02:58.720> cloud

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
and harder am i doing the 20 cloud

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.390 
and harder am i doing the 20 cloud
