00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
almost sticks to good nice so it works

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.500 
almost sticks to good nice so it works
just<00:02:33.250> gotta<00:02:33.430> find<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.820> right<00:02:33.970> ways<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.360> better

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
just gotta find the right ways it better

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.610 
just gotta find the right ways it better
in<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.690> goombario<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:36.730> better<00:02:37.620> probably

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
in the goombario that's better probably

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.220 
in the goombario that's better probably
because<00:02:38.710> there's<00:02:38.890> less<00:02:39.160> magnetism<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.570> this

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
because there's less magnetism in this

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.850 
because there's less magnetism in this
area<00:02:42.210> because<00:02:43.210> it's<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.600> as<00:02:43.870> flat<00:02:44.440> let's<00:02:44.740> see

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
area because it's not as flat let's see

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.520 
area because it's not as flat let's see
trying<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.220> get<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.430> here<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:46.140> might<00:02:47.140> stick

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
trying to get in here that might stick

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.400 
trying to get in here that might stick
too<00:02:47.739> much<00:02:49.440> one<00:02:50.440> more<00:02:50.620> time<00:02:50.860> one<00:02:51.250> more<00:02:51.280> time

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.020 

let's<00:02:55.410> see<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.830> zoom<00:02:56.490> in<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> little<00:02:56.820> bit

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
let's see if we can zoom in a little bit

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:10.850 
let's see if we can zoom in a little bit
more<00:03:01.670> okay<00:03:02.670> here<00:03:02.790> he<00:03:02.880> goes<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:09.710> still<00:03:10.710> got<00:03:10.830> some

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
more okay here he goes I still got some

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.820 
more okay here he goes I still got some
of<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.130> sticky<00:03:12.090> glue<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.570> there<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:12.960> does<00:03:13.650> get

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
of that sticky glue on there so does get

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.590 
of that sticky glue on there so does get
hung<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.220> there<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.790> little<00:03:14.820> bit<00:03:17.480> what<00:03:18.480> it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
hung up there just a little bit what it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:30.890 
hung up there just a little bit what it
works<00:03:18.840> yeah<00:03:22.790> what<00:03:23.790> do<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.940> think<00:03:29.750> that<00:03:30.750> was
