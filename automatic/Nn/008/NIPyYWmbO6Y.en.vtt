our<00:04:50.690> ancestors<00:04:51.550> could<00:04:52.550> play<00:04:52.789> with<00:04:53.000> him<00:04:53.150> like

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
our ancestors could play with him like

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.629 
our ancestors could play with him like

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
he was nothing we have become so weak we

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.600 
he was nothing we have become so weak we

genetic potential so far away now if you

of<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:13.940> modern<00:05:14.120> stressors<00:05:14.719> man<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:14.960> can't<00:05:15.319> even

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
of the modern stressors man I can't even

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.879 
of the modern stressors man I can't even
imagine<00:05:15.590> what<00:05:16.250> he<00:05:16.340> could<00:05:16.490> do<00:05:17.560> then<00:05:18.560> he<00:05:18.710> might

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
imagine what he could do then he might

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.820 
imagine what he could do then he might
actually<00:05:19.069> be<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.550> fastest<00:05:19.969> man<00:05:20.000> in<00:05:20.180> history

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
actually be the fastest man in history

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.459 
actually be the fastest man in history
but<00:05:21.830> he's<00:05:22.009> not<00:05:22.159> there<00:05:22.400> yet<00:05:22.639> and<00:05:23.409> they<00:05:24.409> were

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
but he's not there yet and they were

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:29.200 
but he's not there yet and they were
running<00:05:24.680> in<00:05:24.889> mud<00:05:27.610> imagine<00:05:28.610> if<00:05:28.699> they<00:05:28.819> had<00:05:28.849> his

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
running in mud imagine if they had his

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.140 
running in mud imagine if they had his
shoes<00:05:29.479> with<00:05:29.870> spikes<00:05:30.110> in<00:05:30.469> the<00:05:30.560> tracks<00:05:30.969> 40<00:05:31.969> miles

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150

an<00:05:32.360> hour<00:05:32.479> possibly<00:05:33.319> he<00:05:34.099> runs<00:05:34.340> at<00:05:34.460> 27<00:05:35.680> we<00:05:36.680> are

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
an hour possibly he runs at 27 we are

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.499 
an hour possibly he runs at 27 we are
not<00:05:37.039> in<00:05:37.279> a<00:05:37.430> state<00:05:37.639> of<00:05:37.759> peak<00:05:37.909> performance<00:05:38.419> but

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
not in a state of peak performance but

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.600 
not in a state of peak performance but
we<00:05:38.659> love<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:39.169> think<00:05:39.319> we<00:05:39.500> are<00:05:39.529> because<00:05:40.340> look<00:05:40.520> at

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
we love to think we are because look at

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.689 
we love to think we are because look at
this<00:05:40.729> I've<00:05:40.969> got<00:05:41.029> a<00:05:41.180> laptop<00:05:41.479> it's<00:05:41.960> wireless

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
this I've got a laptop it's wireless

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.159 
this I've got a laptop it's wireless
I've<00:05:43.699> got<00:05:43.880> a<00:05:43.909> camera<00:05:44.360> I've<00:05:44.539> got<00:05:44.659> a<00:05:44.690> microphone

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
I've got a camera I've got a microphone

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.700 
I've got a camera I've got a microphone
this<00:05:45.949> is<00:05:46.099> Star<00:05:46.430> Trek<00:05:46.789> technology<00:05:47.539> we<00:05:48.409> are<00:05:48.529> so

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
this is Star Trek technology we are so

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.469 
this is Star Trek technology we are so
arrogant<00:05:48.919> we<00:05:49.340> think<00:05:49.610> that<00:05:49.639> we<00:05:49.789> have<00:05:49.940> all<00:05:50.150> the

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
arrogant we think that we have all the

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.649 
arrogant we think that we have all the
answers<00:05:50.719> and<00:05:51.340> look<00:05:52.340> at<00:05:52.460> us<00:05:52.580> this<00:05:52.849> superhuman

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
answers and look at us this superhuman

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.610 
answers and look at us this superhuman
wrong<00:05:55.240> man<00:05:56.240> our<00:05:56.389> bodies<00:05:56.779> are<00:05:56.960> falling<00:05:57.469> apart

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
wrong man our bodies are falling apart

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.450 
wrong man our bodies are falling apart
and<00:05:58.840> our<00:05:59.840> science<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.469> our<00:06:00.590> medicine<00:06:01.099> can't

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
and our science and our medicine can't

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.749 
and our science and our medicine can't
keep<00:06:01.789> up<00:06:02.710> no<00:06:03.710> matter<00:06:03.889> what<00:06:04.069> advances<00:06:04.639> they

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
keep up no matter what advances they

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.219 
keep up no matter what advances they
create<00:06:05.029> a<00:06:05.090> medicine<00:06:05.539> the<00:06:05.629> disease<00:06:05.960> rates

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
create a medicine the disease rates

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.810 
create a medicine the disease rates
continue<00:06:06.469> to<00:06:07.009> increase

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:20.110 

so<00:06:13.820> what's<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:14.180> answer<00:06:17.560> obey<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:19.250> laws<00:06:19.580> of

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
so what's the answer obey the laws of

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.100 
so what's the answer obey the laws of
nature<00:06:24.880> you<00:06:25.880> could<00:06:26.120> look<00:06:26.270> at<00:06:26.450> it<00:06:26.480> that<00:06:26.600> way<00:06:26.720> I'm

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
nature you could look at it that way I'm

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.860 
nature you could look at it that way I'm
not<00:06:27.290> really<00:06:27.470> a<00:06:27.560> fan<00:06:27.740> of<00:06:27.800> obeying<00:06:28.160> anything<00:06:28.870> but

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
not really a fan of obeying anything but

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.700 
not really a fan of obeying anything but
uh<00:06:30.070> I'm<00:06:31.070> a<00:06:31.100> rebel<00:06:32.830> what<00:06:33.830> did<00:06:33.950> we<00:06:34.070> evolve<00:06:34.220> to<00:06:34.700> eat

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
uh I'm a rebel what did we evolve to eat

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:43.570 
uh I'm a rebel what did we evolve to eat
whole<00:06:36.710> foods<00:06:38.110> fresh<00:06:39.110> foods<00:06:40.150> plant<00:06:41.150> foods
