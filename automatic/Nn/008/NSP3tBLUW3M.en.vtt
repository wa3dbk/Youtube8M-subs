00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
bottom left of the image we can see the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
bottom left of the image we can see the
XP<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.500> generator<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.670> in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
XP kind of generator that we do get in

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
XP kind of generator that we do get in
the<00:01:30.000> game<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.110> look<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the game now if you do look at it it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
the game now if you do look at it it
says<00:01:32.159> XP<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.299> underneath<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.720> there

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
says XP and then underneath that there

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
says XP and then underneath that there
is<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> yellow<00:01:34.650> bar<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.579> says<00:01:35.729> level<00:01:36.210> 1<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
is a yellow bar and it says level 1 and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
is a yellow bar and it says level 1 and
what<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> will<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.040> more<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.400> kill

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
what you will do is the more you kill

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
what you will do is the more you kill
things<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.299> XP<00:01:39.869> bar<00:01:40.049> will<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.619> fill<00:01:40.920> up<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
things this XP bar will then fill up so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.190 
things this XP bar will then fill up so
you<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.430> how<00:01:41.820> close<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> leveling

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you know how close you are to leveling

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.109 
you know how close you are to leveling
up<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.590> character<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> does<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
up this character and we're it does so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
up this character and we're it does so
next<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> XP<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> says<00:01:46.200> x<00:01:46.500> 1<00:01:46.860> i'm<00:01:47.100> thinking

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
next to the XP it says x 1 i'm thinking

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
next to the XP it says x 1 i'm thinking
this<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.329> multiplier<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this will be your multiplier so if you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
this will be your multiplier so if you
are<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> beginning<00:01:50.820> double<00:01:51.360> XP<00:01:51.689> because

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
are going to beginning double XP because

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.749 
are going to beginning double XP because
you've<00:01:52.110> got<00:01:52.290> two<00:01:52.560> times<00:01:52.979> multiplier<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you've got two times multiplier that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.240 
you've got two times multiplier that
will<00:01:54.090> say<00:01:54.329> x<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.710> course<00:01:55.860> if<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
will say x to the so of course if that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.280 
will say x to the so of course if that
is<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.180> then<00:01:57.299> earn<00:01:57.479> more<00:01:57.869> XP

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
is there you will then earn more XP

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
is there you will then earn more XP
quicker<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.159> yellow<00:01:59.430> bar<00:01:59.759> will<00:02:00.180> fill<00:02:00.509> up

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
quicker so that yellow bar will fill up

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
quicker so that yellow bar will fill up
faster<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> few<00:02:02.310> other<00:02:02.490> things

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
faster now there is a few other things

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
faster now there is a few other things
that<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.060> seen<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.570> image<00:02:03.780> now

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
that we have seen it in this image now

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.510 
that we have seen it in this image now
the<00:02:04.229> first<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> look<00:02:05.369> at

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the first one is if we have a look at

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
the first one is if we have a look at
this<00:02:05.610> builder<00:02:05.969> bots<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.329> front<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.659> us<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.200> is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
this builder bots in front of us this is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.199 
this builder bots in front of us this is
one<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.710> don't<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.310> recognize<00:02:08.789> who<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
one that I don't really recognize who is

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.999 
one that I don't really recognize who is
this<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> new<00:02:10.229> builder<00:02:10.619> BOTS<00:02:10.800> as

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
this going to be a new builder BOTS as

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.410 
this going to be a new builder BOTS as
well<00:02:11.190> bought<00:02:11.370> from<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> image<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.209> can't

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
well bought from this image we can't

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.550 
well bought from this image we can't
really<00:02:12.569> tell<00:02:12.870> exact

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
really tell exact

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830

what<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.860> does<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:15.150> got<00:02:15.330> kind<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.599> some

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
what it does do it's got kind of some

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.050 
what it does do it's got kind of some
kind<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.170> stare<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.040> maybe<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.700> stairs

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
kind of stare on it so maybe the stairs

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.820 
kind of stare on it so maybe the stairs
that<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.569> get<00:02:18.720> from<00:02:18.870> challenges<00:02:19.380> maybe

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that you do get from challenges maybe

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.470 
that you do get from challenges maybe
comes<00:02:20.099> into<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.610> build<00:02:20.849> about<00:02:21.150> maybe<00:02:21.330> you

can purchase bots or things from stars
who<00:02:25.020> knows<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.739> just<00:02:25.770> some<00:02:26.069> kind<00:02:26.220> of

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
who knows but that is just some kind of

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.190 
who knows but that is just some kind of
theories<00:02:26.730> probably<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.239> right<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.900> I'm<00:02:28.020> just

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
theories probably not right but I'm just

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.930 
theories probably not right but I'm just
curious<00:02:28.349> why<00:02:28.650> he<00:02:28.830> does<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> stir<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.790> him

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
curious why he does have a stir with him

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.400 
curious why he does have a stir with him
maybe<00:02:30.090> that's<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.569> design<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.230> bots

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
maybe that's just the design of the bots

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.080 
maybe that's just the design of the bots
but<00:02:31.560> I'm<00:02:31.650> really<00:02:31.769> curious<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.220> see<00:02:32.489> what<00:02:32.970> this

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
but I'm really curious to see what this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
but I'm really curious to see what this
bot<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:33.750> about<00:02:34.080> sand<00:02:34.319> one<00:02:34.470> other<00:02:34.680> thing

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
bot is all about sand one other thing

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.040 
bot is all about sand one other thing
that<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.430> see<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.880> her<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.630> make<00:02:36.870> it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
that we can just see it's her to make it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.900 
that we can just see it's her to make it
out<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:37.440> next<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.250> bots<00:02:38.459> there's<00:02:38.730> like<00:02:38.880> a

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
out but next to the bots there's like a

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.390 
out but next to the bots there's like a
blue<00:02:39.209> kind<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.599> wavy<00:02:40.110> line<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.190> follow

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that wavy line you can see right

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.460 
that wavy line you can see right
highlighted<00:02:43.590> now<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.220> says<00:02:44.519> base<00:02:44.970> HP<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.110> then

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to be able to see how much health base

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.830 
to be able to see how much health base

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
actually has in a value rather than just

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.259 
actually has in a value rather than just
a<00:02:54.989> bar<00:02:55.319> at<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.560> top<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.549> all<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
a bar at the top so we know like all the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.910 
a bar at the top so we know like all the
vet<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.690> base<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.110> take<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.470> many<00:02:58.709> more

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920

vet the base can take this many more
hits<00:02:59.099> before<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.580> gone<00:02:59.730> rather<00:03:00.269> than<00:03:00.480> just

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
hits before it's gone rather than just

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.690
