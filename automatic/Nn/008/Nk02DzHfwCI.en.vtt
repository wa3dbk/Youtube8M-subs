our security and I talked about it quite
a<00:00:07.649> lot<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:08.760> an<00:00:08.910> argument<00:00:09.179> for<00:00:09.750> vision<00:00:10.380> is

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
a lot like an argument for vision is

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:50.510 
a lot like an argument for vision is
more<00:00:11.370> important<00:00:11.940> than<00:00:12.120> experience<00:00:49.520> that's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
more important than experience that's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279 
more important than experience that's
the<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:50.910> vision<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> question<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the right vision then the question is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.610 
the right vision then the question is
what<00:00:53.039> are<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.219> policies<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> who's<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.500> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
will do so by 2012 at the deadline so we

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.670 
will do so by 2012 at the deadline so we
what<00:02:24.680> does<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.920> mean<00:02:25.099> were<00:02:25.970> these<00:02:26.120> people

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
what does that mean were these people

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.130 
what does that mean were these people
dishonest<00:02:27.680> when<00:02:27.800> they<00:02:27.920> signed<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.340> no<00:02:29.140> were

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
dishonest when they signed it no were

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.339 
dishonest when they signed it no were
they<00:02:30.380> lazy<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.099> confident<00:02:31.519> by<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.819> large<00:02:31.940> no

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
they lazy and confident by and large no

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.720 
they lazy and confident by and large no
but<00:02:33.349> they<00:02:33.500> couldn't<00:02:33.830> turn<00:02:33.950> good<00:02:34.160> intentions

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
but they couldn't turn good intentions

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.309 
but they couldn't turn good intentions
into<00:02:34.970> positive<00:02:35.390> change<00:02:35.630> in<00:02:35.780> people's<00:02:36.080> lives

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
into positive change in people's lives

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.770 
into positive change in people's lives
so<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.590> think<00:02:36.769> my<00:02:37.760> view<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.300> maybe<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.660> just

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
so I think my view and maybe it's just

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.509 
so I think my view and maybe it's just
because<00:02:39.050> I've<00:02:39.500> always<00:02:39.709> been<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.040> scorekeeper

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
because I've always been a scorekeeper

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.390 
because I've always been a scorekeeper
and<00:02:40.910> maybe<00:02:41.120> it's<00:02:41.300> because<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.890> work<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.340> do

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
and maybe it's because of the work I do

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
and maybe it's because of the work I do
now<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.470> think<00:02:46.160> vision<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.850> important<00:02:47.299> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
now but I think vision is important and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.600 
now but I think vision is important and
I<00:02:47.540> think<00:02:47.569> programs<00:02:48.049> are<00:02:48.410> important<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.580> I

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
I think programs are important but I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.400 
I think programs are important but I
think<00:02:49.730> symbol<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.569> as<00:02:50.870> important<00:02:51.350> as

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
think symbol is not as important as

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.559 
think symbol is not as important as
substance<00:02:51.830> now<00:02:51.980> we<00:02:52.160> got<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.489> suggestion<00:02:53.239> by
