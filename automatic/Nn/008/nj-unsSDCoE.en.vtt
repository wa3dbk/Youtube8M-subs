00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.269 

and<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.150> also<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:16.279> Reverse

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
and you can also do that in Reverse

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.290 
and you can also do that in Reverse
going<00:00:17.550> forwards<00:00:18.180> was<00:00:18.810> doing<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.230> rivers<00:00:20.270> vs<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
going forwards was doing in rivers vs a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.730 
going forwards was doing in rivers vs a
little<00:00:21.660> bit<00:00:21.779> harder<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:22.289> me<00:00:23.840> but<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.529> might<00:00:25.710> be

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
little bit harder for me but it might be

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.160 
little bit harder for me but it might be
easier<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:27.590> maybe<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.869> either<00:00:30.869> way

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
easier for you maybe not like either way

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
probably want to know thread the needles

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.729 
probably want to know thread the needles
the<00:00:39.090> amount<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.809> want<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.260> butterfly

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
body like that in each direction so

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.670 
body like that in each direction so
you<00:01:11.540> come<00:01:11.840> forward<00:01:12.170> doing<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:13.750> oops<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:15.530> get

I'm<00:01:31.620> gonna<00:01:31.680> teach<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.130> Reverse

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
I'm gonna teach you this in Reverse

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.490 
I'm gonna teach you this in Reverse
first<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.870> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.290> little<00:01:34.380> bit

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
first because I think it's a little bit

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.130 
first because I think it's a little bit
easier<00:01:35.540> first<00:01:36.540> thing<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
easier first thing you're going to do is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.480 
easier first thing you're going to do is
take<00:01:40.140> either<00:01:40.500> hand<00:01:40.980> that<00:01:41.190> you're<00:01:41.310> comfortable

with<00:01:41.730> whether<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.570> being<00:01:42.780> your<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.560> left

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
with whether it being your right or left

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.490 
with whether it being your right or left
and<00:01:44.160> I<00:01:44.700> am<00:01:45.570> most<00:01:45.720> comfortable<00:01:45.930> doing<00:01:46.320> these

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and I am most comfortable doing these

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
and I am most comfortable doing these
moves<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:47.040> lips<00:01:47.280> I'm<00:01:47.400> gonna<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.610> with<00:01:47.730> my<00:01:47.760> left

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
moves my lips I'm gonna do with my left

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.710 
moves my lips I'm gonna do with my left
my<00:01:48.330> left<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:49.260> going<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.590> behind<00:01:49.770> me<00:01:50.720> just

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
my left is going to go behind me just

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
my left is going to go behind me just
like<00:01:51.870> I'm<00:01:51.990> doing<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.230> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:53.100> waist<00:01:53.250> wrap

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
like I'm doing on a little waist wrap

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.480 
like I'm doing on a little waist wrap
move<00:01:54.170> it's<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> go<00:01:55.500> behind<00:01:55.650> me<00:01:56.010> in<00:01:56.220> waist

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
move it's going to go behind me in waist

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.320 
move it's going to go behind me in waist
wrap<00:01:56.700> once<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.950> as<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.370> point<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.060> doing

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
wrap once and as that point is doing

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.250 
wrap once and as that point is doing
that<00:02:00.510> this<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.350> kind<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.800> coming<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:03.260> right

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
that this one is kind of coming up right

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.910 
that this one is kind of coming up right
here<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.880> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.180> doing<00:02:06.510> I<00:02:06.780> guess<00:02:07.650> it's<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
here it's kind of doing I guess it's a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.990 
here it's kind of doing I guess it's a
waste<00:02:08.100> rep<00:02:08.310> tube<00:02:08.520> from<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.940> front<00:02:09.410> but<00:02:10.410> your

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
waste rep tube from the front but your

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.430 
waste rep tube from the front but your
right<00:02:12.000> hand<00:02:12.620> forward<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.950> finding<00:02:15.440> actually

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
right hand forward and finding actually

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.330 
right hand forward and finding actually
in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> other<00:02:16.950> direction<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.520> that

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.009 

so<00:02:20.879> they're<00:02:21.030> both<00:02:21.150> doing<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.629> at<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> same

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
so they're both doing that at the same

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.390 
so they're both doing that at the same
time<00:02:24.349> you<00:02:25.349> might<00:02:25.500> want<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
time you might want to do that for a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.900 
time you might want to do that for a
little<00:02:26.550> bit<00:02:26.959> just<00:02:27.959> get<00:02:28.140> used<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.910> how

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
little bit just get used to that how

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.869 
little bit just get used to that how
that<00:02:29.940> feels<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:32.310> once<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.580> get<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> little

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
that feels and once you get a little

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.839 
that feels and once you get a little
comfortable<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.569> as<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:35.220> left<00:02:35.580> one

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
comfortable with that as your left one

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.339 
comfortable with that as your left one
comes<00:02:36.090> behind<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.599> instead<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.900> coming<00:02:37.230> back

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
comes behind you instead of coming back

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.160 
comes behind you instead of coming back
to<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.680> little<00:02:37.890> butterfly<00:02:38.640> position<00:02:39.170> but

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
to this little butterfly position but

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
to this little butterfly position but
you're<00:02:40.349> right<00:02:40.379> behind<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.549> didn't<00:02:44.549> just

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
you're right behind you and didn't just

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
you're right behind you and didn't just
continue<00:02:46.069> like<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.720> little<00:02:52.319> tip<00:02:52.530> for

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
continue like so and a little tip for
