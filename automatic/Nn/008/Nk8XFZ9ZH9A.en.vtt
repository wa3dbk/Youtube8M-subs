a I'm gonna set up a set of heroes for
my<00:00:07.770> sister's<00:00:08.220> arena<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:09.510> just<00:00:09.750> dissed<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.200> last

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
my sister's arena we just dissed it last

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.129 
my sister's arena we just dissed it last
night<00:00:10.650> but<00:00:11.540> doesn't<00:00:12.540> get<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:12.870> nice<00:00:13.110> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
night but doesn't get it all nice and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.169 
night but doesn't get it all nice and
smooth<00:00:13.710> around<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> barrels<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.940> poles

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
smooth around the barrels and the poles

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.800 
smooth around the barrels and the poles
so<00:00:15.859> I'm<00:00:16.859> gonna<00:00:17.070> set<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:18.150> set<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.570> drags

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
so I'm gonna set up this set of drags

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.660 
so I'm gonna set up this set of drags
here<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.830> got<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> most<00:00:20.340> teeth

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
here because it's got the most teeth

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.630 
here because it's got the most teeth
left<00:00:20.970> both<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.420> these<00:00:21.689> are<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.340> two<00:00:23.340> drags

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
left both of these are just two drags

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.279 
left both of these are just two drags
that<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.910> had<00:00:24.029> laying<00:00:24.269> around<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that we had laying around you know and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.920 
that we had laying around you know and
so<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> figure<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> might<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.609> well<00:00:26.760> make<00:00:27.449> use<00:00:27.660> out

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
so I figure I might as well make use out

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.259 
so I figure I might as well make use out
of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> best<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.820> one's<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
of the best one so this one's got the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.910 
of the best one so this one's got the
most<00:00:30.539> teeth<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.590> we're<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
most teeth so that's what we're going to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
most teeth so that's what we're going to
use<00:00:32.030> so<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> got<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> torch<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
use so I got to get the torch out and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.979 
use so I got to get the torch out and
cut<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.820> cut<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> hitch<00:00:36.090> mounts<00:00:36.120> off<00:00:36.719> this

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
cut the cut the hitch mounts off this

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.440 
cut the cut the hitch mounts off this
one<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.969> get<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.030> put<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:42.239> we'll

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
like it'd make a nice freedom for my

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.530 
like it'd make a nice freedom for my
sisters<00:06:25.630> to<00:06:25.780> practice<00:06:26.320> in
