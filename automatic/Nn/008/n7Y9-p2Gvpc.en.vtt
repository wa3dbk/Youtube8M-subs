Roche nerfs could even this out a little

Roche nerfs could even this out a little
bit<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.040> we'll<00:02:45.130> just<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.489> wait<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.760> see

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
bit so we'll just have to wait and see

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.330 
bit so we'll just have to wait and see
this<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.570> going<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.959> extreme<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:48.190> is<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
this is going to be extreme that is a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.979 
this is going to be extreme that is a
good<00:02:48.550> point<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.850> make<00:02:49.030> Mike<00:02:49.300> because<00:02:49.690> of

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
good point to make Mike because of

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.620 
good point to make Mike because of
course<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.590> new<00:02:50.800> Roche<00:02:51.130> nerf<00:02:51.430> now<00:02:51.760> making<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
course the new Roche nerf now making the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.020 
course the new Roche nerf now making the
roaches<00:02:52.930> only<00:02:53.230> ones<00:02:53.530> or<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:54.040> supply<00:02:54.400> over<00:02:54.760> one

roaches only ones or to supply over one

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.780 
roaches only ones or to supply over one
and<00:02:55.390> that's<00:02:55.959> huge<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.860> player<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.550> drew

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
and that's huge for a player like I drew

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.880 
and that's huge for a player like I drew
who<00:02:57.940> depends<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.540> lot<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:58.930> his<00:02:59.170> roaches<00:02:59.560> out<00:02:59.739> of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
who depends a lot on his roaches out of

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.680 
who depends a lot on his roaches out of
almost<00:03:00.040> every<00:03:00.700> xored<00:03:00.970> game<00:03:01.180> I've<00:03:01.360> seen<00:03:01.540> in

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
almost every xored game I've seen in

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.920 
almost every xored game I've seen in
play<00:03:01.900> he<00:03:02.440> almost<00:03:02.620> always<00:03:02.860> uses<00:03:03.489> roaches<00:03:03.930> you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
play he almost always uses roaches you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.509 
play he almost always uses roaches you
could<00:03:05.080> not<00:03:05.200> be<00:03:05.380> more<00:03:05.530> correct<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.010> think<00:03:06.220> him

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
could not be more correct I think him

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.670 
could not be more correct I think him
and<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.820> jar<00:03:07.209> him<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.660> our<00:03:07.720> ptosis<00:03:08.140> rather<00:03:08.350> both

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
and I jar him and our ptosis rather both

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
and I jar him and our ptosis rather both
do<00:03:08.950> use<00:03:09.190> those<00:03:09.400> roaches<00:03:09.610> very<00:03:09.970> heavily<00:03:10.239> so

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
do use those roaches very heavily so

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.050 
do use those roaches very heavily so

overcome<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.519> nerf<00:03:24.760> we<00:03:24.940> were<00:03:25.030> talking<00:03:25.360> about

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
overcome that nerf we were talking about

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.090 
overcome that nerf we were talking about
i<00:03:25.540> think<00:03:25.630> that's<00:03:25.900> going<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.170> be<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.320> major<00:03:26.650> part

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
i think that's going to be a major part

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.220 
i think that's going to be a major part
of<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:27.430> whole<00:03:27.610> series<00:03:27.880> right<00:03:28.720> i<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.900> agree

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
of this whole series right i do agree

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.229 
of this whole series right i do agree
with<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.530> now<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.769> map<00:03:30.070> because<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.639> is<00:03:30.760> culos

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
with you now the map because it is culos

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.300 
with you now the map because it is culos
ravine<00:03:31.570> very<00:03:32.049> large<00:03:32.470> map<00:03:32.739> with<00:03:33.010> four

different spawn points

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.920 
different spawn points
and<00:03:34.950> one<00:03:35.250> thing<00:03:35.490> to<00:03:35.610> note<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.360> difficult

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and one thing to note is it's difficult

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.780 
and one thing to note is it's difficult
for<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.170> Protoss<00:03:37.560> player<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.100> hold<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.670> their

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
for a Protoss player to hold on to their

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.090 
for a Protoss player to hold on to their
natural<00:03:38.970> expansion<00:03:39.480> because<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.920> fact

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
natural expansion because of the fact

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100 
natural expansion because of the fact
that<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.520> ramps<00:03:42.060> or<00:03:42.180> excuse<00:03:42.540> me<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.720> two

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
that the ramps or excuse me the two

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.870 
that the ramps or excuse me the two
edges<00:03:43.590> here<00:03:44.010> where<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.220> can<00:03:44.340> actually<00:03:44.460> attack

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
edges here where you can actually attack

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.330 
edges here where you can actually attack
it's<00:03:45.180> difficult<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.410> choke<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.890> off<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.220> your

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
it's difficult to choke that off of your

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.130 
it's difficult to choke that off of your
Protoss<00:03:47.730> player<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.630> that's<00:03:48.810> something<00:03:49.020> that

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
Protoss player so that's something that

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.560

the Zerg i trow can actually exploit and

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.980 
the Zerg i trow can actually exploit and

you're yet exactly now usually Zerg

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.550 
you're yet exactly now usually Zerg
players<00:03:57.420> will<00:03:57.780> have<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> hard<00:03:58.140> time<00:03:58.320> securing

players will have a hard time securing
that<00:03:58.890> expansion<00:03:59.280> but<00:03:59.550> that's<00:03:59.730> against<00:04:00.060> terran

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
that expansion but that's against terran

running all over the place but it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.460 
running all over the place but it
definitely<00:04:03.060> could<00:04:03.420> be<00:04:03.480> if<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.870> drew<00:04:04.080> changes

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
definitely could be if I drew changes

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.050 
definitely could be if I drew changes
his<00:04:04.620> game<00:04:04.830> up<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> little<00:04:05.400> more<00:04:05.550> zergling

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.320 
heavy which he's not a zergling fan that
definitely<00:04:08.490> could<00:04:08.640> play<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.910> role<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.180> this

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330

moving and so that's going to be a bit

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.550 
moving and so that's going to be a bit
extreme<00:05:15.300> here<00:05:15.479> now<00:05:15.630> do<00:05:15.690> note<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.200> tried

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
extreme here now do note that I tried

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.230 
extreme here now do note that I tried
not<00:05:16.710> grabbing<00:05:17.010> an<00:05:17.280> extremely<00:05:18.120> early

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
not grabbing an extremely early

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.090 
not grabbing an extremely early
expansion<00:05:18.600> he<00:05:18.930> did<00:05:19.110> get<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.380> way<00:05:19.650> after<00:05:19.860> his

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
expansion he did get that way after his

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.350 
expansion he did get that way after his
funny<00:05:20.370> pool<00:05:20.610> getting<00:05:20.790> it<00:05:20.910> right<00:05:21.030> around<00:05:21.240> the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
funny pool getting it right around the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.450 
funny pool getting it right around the
15<00:05:21.750> mark<00:05:21.900> a<00:05:22.110> little<00:05:22.440> drone<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:23.070> at<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.280> position

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
15 mark a little drone is at a position

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.670 
15 mark a little drone is at a position
not<00:05:23.880> sure<00:05:24.180> what<00:05:24.390> happened<00:05:24.570> there<00:05:24.930> gotta<00:05:25.500> hurt

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
not sure what happened there gotta hurt

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.050 
not sure what happened there gotta hurt
his<00:05:25.800> economy<00:05:26.010> here<00:05:26.340> just<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.640> little<00:05:26.669> bit<00:05:26.940> but

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
his economy here just a little bit but

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.730 
his economy here just a little bit but
yeah<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.390> would<00:05:27.810> not<00:05:27.960> be<00:05:28.110> surprised<00:05:28.500> to<00:05:28.710> see

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
yeah I would not be surprised to see

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.350 
yeah I would not be surprised to see
Nonie<00:05:29.100> go<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.550> mass<00:05:29.790> Phoenix<00:05:30.210> bill

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
Nonie go that mass Phoenix bill

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.909 
Nonie go that mass Phoenix bill
especially<00:05:30.570> since<00:05:30.990> they<00:05:31.140> made<00:05:31.290> them<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:31.770> much

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
especially since they made them so much

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.310 
especially since they made them so much
easier<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.370> micro<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:33.750> is<00:05:33.930> right<00:05:34.169> the

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
easier to micro that is right the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.550 
easier to micro that is right the
Phoenix's<00:05:34.800> are<00:05:34.979> so<00:05:35.490> easy<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.150> micro<00:05:36.570> now<00:05:36.720> even

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
Phoenix's are so easy to micro now even

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.860 
Phoenix's are so easy to micro now even
being<00:05:38.100> able<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.610> basically<00:05:38.880> move<00:05:39.479> and<00:05:39.780> attack

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
being able to basically move and attack

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.890 
being able to basically move and attack
at<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.919> same<00:05:41.130> time<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.760> huge<00:05:42.270> for<00:05:42.630> a

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
at the same time that is huge for a

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.990 
at the same time that is huge for a
Protoss<00:05:43.260> players<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:43.800> we<00:05:43.919> might<00:05:44.190> see<00:05:44.430> noni<00:05:44.669> try

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
Protoss players so we might see noni try

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.580 
Protoss players so we might see noni try
that<00:05:45.180> against<00:05:45.390> i<00:05:45.570> trow<00:05:45.750> now<00:05:45.930> it's<00:05:46.140> important

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
that against i trow now it's important

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.330 
that against i trow now it's important
to<00:05:46.620> note<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:47.160> cho<00:05:47.580> has<00:05:47.760> gone<00:05:47.910> for

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
to note a cho has gone for

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.070 
to note a cho has gone for
standard<00:05:48.850> macro<00:05:49.150> build<00:05:49.389> throwing<00:05:49.780> down<00:05:49.900> that

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
standard macro build throwing down that

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.650 
standard macro build throwing down that
15<00:05:50.620> pool<00:05:50.889> also<00:05:51.310> known<00:05:51.460> as<00:05:51.699> the<00:05:51.730> I<00:05:51.970> drew<00:05:52.449> and

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
15 pool also known as the I drew and

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.840 
15 pool also known as the I drew and
then<00:05:53.169> going<00:05:53.380> into<00:05:53.590> a<00:05:53.680> 16<00:05:54.100> hatch<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:54.580> now<00:05:54.669> he's

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
then going into a 16 hatch and now he's

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.760 
then going into a 16 hatch and now he's
just<00:05:54.880> thrown<00:05:55.360> up<00:05:55.480> his<00:05:55.600> first<00:05:55.840> gas<00:05:56.080> this<00:05:56.590> is

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
just thrown up his first gas this is

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.070 
just thrown up his first gas this is
actually<00:05:57.100> a<00:05:57.130> very<00:05:57.490> dominant<00:05:58.030> macro<00:05:58.449> build<00:05:58.690> and

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
actually a very dominant macro build and

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.500 
actually a very dominant macro build and
unchecked<00:05:59.949> it<00:06:00.130> can<00:06:00.280> really<00:06:00.460> allow<00:06:00.610> I<00:06:01.000> drew

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
unchecked it can really allow I drew

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.960 
unchecked it can really allow I drew
just<00:06:01.960> completely<00:06:02.680> out<00:06:03.070> macro<00:06:03.550> the<00:06:03.639> Protoss

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
just completely out macro the Protoss

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.719 
just completely out macro the Protoss
player<00:06:04.240> that<00:06:05.110> is<00:06:05.290> really<00:06:05.650> true<00:06:05.800> i<00:06:06.100> mean<00:06:06.220> it's

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
player that is really true i mean it's

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.879 
player that is really true i mean it's
it's<00:06:07.180> I<00:06:07.600> think<00:06:07.900> it's<00:06:08.080> Hydra<00:06:08.440> doing<00:06:08.680> a<00:06:08.740> little

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
it's I think it's Hydra doing a little

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.020 
it's I think it's Hydra doing a little
gamble<00:06:09.310> here<00:06:09.460> because<00:06:09.639> like<00:06:09.790> we've<00:06:09.910> been

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
gamble here because like we've been

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.820 
gamble here because like we've been
saying<00:06:10.300> he<00:06:10.479> really<00:06:10.810> does<00:06:11.050> like<00:06:11.320> that<00:06:11.560> heavy

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
saying he really does like that heavy

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.800 
saying he really does like that heavy
macro<00:06:12.340> play<00:06:12.610> I<00:06:12.850> mean<00:06:13.270> just<00:06:13.300> looking<00:06:13.660> at<00:06:13.720> the

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
macro play I mean just looking at the

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.510 
macro play I mean just looking at the
units<00:06:14.169> counting<00:06:14.530> station<00:06:14.860> right<00:06:15.010> now<00:06:15.160> he<00:06:15.220> only

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
units counting station right now he only

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.030 
units counting station right now he only
has<00:06:15.790> two<00:06:16.150> zerglings<00:06:16.660> very<00:06:17.290> minimal<00:06:17.710> units

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
has two zerglings very minimal units

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.710 
has two zerglings very minimal units
right<00:06:18.220> now<00:06:18.400> but<00:06:18.910> really<00:06:19.210> no<00:06:19.389> knee<00:06:19.449> isn't

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
right now but really no knee isn't

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.570 
right now but really no knee isn't
looking<00:06:20.139> to<00:06:20.229> be<00:06:20.350> super<00:06:20.770> aggressive<00:06:20.889> I<00:06:21.430> mean

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
looking to be super aggressive I mean

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.080 
looking to be super aggressive I mean
he's<00:06:21.820> just<00:06:21.850> now<00:06:22.330> getting<00:06:22.600> his<00:06:22.720> second
