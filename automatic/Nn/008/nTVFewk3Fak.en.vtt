00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.940 
good and if anything a little bit too
good<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.760> got<00:02:22.090> me<00:02:22.209> watching<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.569> but<00:02:23.079> it's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
good so got me watching that but it's

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.899 
good so got me watching that but it's
going<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.129> be<00:02:24.219> a<00:02:24.250> bit<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.489> an<00:02:24.549> early<00:02:24.730> night<00:02:24.879> for

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
going to be a bit of an early night for

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.640 
going to be a bit of an early night for
us<00:02:25.180> tonight<00:02:25.420> don't<00:02:26.109> think<00:02:26.290> we're<00:02:26.379> going<00:02:26.469> to<00:02:26.560> be

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
us tonight don't think we're going to be

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.490 
us tonight don't think we're going to be
doing<00:02:26.769> anything<00:02:27.780> too<00:02:28.780> interesting<00:02:28.870> because

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
doing anything too interesting because

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.220 
doing anything too interesting because
you<00:02:30.489> know<00:02:30.519> it's<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.239> seven-hour<00:02:31.959> time

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
you know it's a seven-hour time

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.140 
you know it's a seven-hour time
difference<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.799> probably<00:02:33.670> she<00:02:33.819> trying<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
difference so probably she trying to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.429 
difference so probably she trying to
sleep<00:02:34.329> was<00:02:34.540> about<00:02:34.719> the<00:02:34.840> upper<00:02:35.019> training<00:02:35.349> in
