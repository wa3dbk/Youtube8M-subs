00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.550
 hello my name is ivan days of the rock 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 cultural injury is one of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.100
 complications in surgery 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.530
 column 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.520
 this video is about the treatment of 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.740
 injuries 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.619
 we can see in the video a small 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 lesion of the cultural area indicated by arrow 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.650
 the cultural landscape is a membrane that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.490
 covers all neurological structures 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.260
 inside the spine in your 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.040
 interior beyond the structures 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.430
 neurological is the liquor 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.800
 The book is a pure saline solution that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.859
 acts as a buffer for the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.930
 neurological structures besides taking 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.170
 your nutrient supply 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.469
 the highest risk related to the injury to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 is the output of the book and its 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.309
 consequent contamination may lead to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.320
 a picture of meningitis 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.320
 so that this does not happen when 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 to recognize the lesion is necessary suture 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.380
 there we can observe in the video the structure 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.480
 two cultural 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.180
 two points are given first . 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.920
 repair and then a suture can be made 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.170
 continuous type to seal the remainder 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.390
 during the future of the cultural 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.790
 necessary to recognize the structures 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.660
 neurological disorders that pass within the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.190
 even avoiding that the needle between 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.850
 in contact with these structures 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.850
 neurological 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 when the injury is not recognized 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.970
 immediately or occurs after the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.510
 end of procedure 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.050
 the liquor may reach 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.960
 surgical incision being the so-called 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.840
 The fistula of the dural sac is often 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.900
 necessary to carry out a new procedure 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.780
 what is the lesion of the cultural 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.080
 to perform its repair when 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.319
 carried out properly the structure of the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.290
 the cultural must not let there be 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.930
 leaking liquor after its end 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.659
 one of the ways to check for 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.360
 leak or is not performing the maneuver 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.640
 of valsalva in the operator 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.040
 with this maneuver an increase in pressure 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.950
 inside the dural sac which makes it 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.580
 the easier the leak recognition 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.890
 liquor from other holes 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.890
 it is still necessary to use glue 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.970
 to seal the structure after the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.630
 your term 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.630
 thank you
