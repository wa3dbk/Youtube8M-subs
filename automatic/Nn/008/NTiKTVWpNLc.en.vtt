00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.430 

end<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.899> second<00:00:04.230> game

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.690 

okay<00:00:08.440> have<00:00:08.620> a<00:00:08.650> good<00:00:08.860> look<00:00:08.980> to<00:00:09.160> your<00:00:09.280> right<00:00:09.309> hand

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
okay have a good look to your right hand

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.869 
okay have a good look to your right hand
side<00:00:09.760> just<00:00:09.940> to<00:00:10.240> make<00:00:10.450> sure<00:00:11.490> everything's<00:00:12.490> okay

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
side just to make sure everything's okay

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.760 
side just to make sure everything's okay
we<00:00:13.270> put<00:00:13.480> yourself<00:00:13.809> out<00:00:13.959> onto<00:00:14.290> the<00:00:14.379> circuit

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.710 

good<00:00:18.160> to<00:00:18.280> go<00:00:18.430> it<00:00:18.880> ought<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.180> accelerate<00:00:19.630> the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
good to go it ought to accelerate the

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.500 
good to go it ought to accelerate the
car<00:00:19.930> up<00:00:20.080> a<00:00:20.170> little<00:00:20.200> bit

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
car up a little bit

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.170 

up<00:00:22.750> again

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
up again

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.370 

okay<00:00:25.780> then<00:00:25.990> we<00:00:26.080> can<00:00:26.260> go<00:00:26.530> up<00:00:26.800> another<00:00:27.040> gear<00:00:27.310> 15

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
okay then we can go up another gear 15

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.660 
okay then we can go up another gear 15
these<00:00:29.380> you<00:00:29.530> break<00:00:29.770> boards<00:00:30.100> on<00:00:30.190> the<00:00:30.220> left<00:00:30.490> hand

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
these you break boards on the left hand

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.240 
these you break boards on the left hand
side<00:00:30.790> so<00:00:31.360> when<00:00:32.200> we<00:00:32.320> start<00:00:32.560> to<00:00:32.650> get<00:00:32.770> on<00:00:32.890> it<00:00:33.040> we

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
side so when we start to get on it we

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.460 
side so when we start to get on it we
use<00:00:33.400> the<00:00:33.550> brakes<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:35.110> I'm<00:00:35.170> going<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.410> just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
use the brakes so I'm going to just

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.200 
use the brakes so I'm going to just
touch<00:00:35.920> on<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.190> breaks<00:00:36.400> down<00:00:36.700> long<00:00:37.000> you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
touch on the breaks down long you

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.910 
touch on the breaks down long you
keeping<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.750> car<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.170> left<00:00:38.350> hand<00:00:38.560> side<00:00:38.650> of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
keeping the car to the left hand side of

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.369 
keeping the car to the left hand side of
the<00:00:39.010> circuit<00:00:39.430> that's<00:00:39.610> looking<00:00:40.030> good<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:41.230> the

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
the circuit that's looking good for the

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.049 
the circuit that's looking good for the
term<00:00:41.590> board<00:00:41.920> you're<00:00:42.340> going<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.520> turn<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.850> car

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
term board you're going to turn the car

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.729 
term board you're going to turn the car
into<00:00:43.270> your<00:00:43.420> eight<00:00:43.540> banks<00:00:43.780> touch<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.559> white

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
into your eight banks touch the white

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.580 
into your eight banks touch the white
line<00:00:45.040> start<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.120> feed<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.450> throttling<00:00:46.930> and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
line start to feed the throttling and

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.470 
line start to feed the throttling and
away<00:00:47.830> we<00:00:47.980> go

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.430 

up<00:00:50.899> again
