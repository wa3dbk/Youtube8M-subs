00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 the low availability of fresh water in 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.760
 baja california is a challenge for 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.010
 meet the demand of the population 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.619
 especially for the city of tecate 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.230
 until a few years ago when the 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.910
 aqueduct river colorado-tijuana stopped 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.860
 operate during the time in which it is

 maintenance or events 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.570
 extraordinary was achieved to cover the 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.720
 liquid demand of the city with 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.240
 extractions of the aquifer however the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 constant increase in population 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.510
 the demand for water also increased 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.859
 being insufficient to sustain 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.379
 Supply with underground blankets 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.749
 of the region and with the measures of 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.640
 mitigation adopted foreseeing these 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:44.039
 situations the construction was projected 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.889
 of a glass to regulate and store the 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.379
 aqueduct water colorado-tijuana river 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:52.019
 the dam the auras located at the height 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.989
 kilometer 2.5 of the highway

 federal number 2 of kt mexicalli la 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.940
 dam the auras has a curtain 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.879
 320 meters in length and a height 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.210
 maximum of 32 meters has a capacity 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.600
 to store up to 5.06 million 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.500
 cubic meters 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.590
 and benefits 64 1760 inhabitants of the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.750
 city ​​of tecate, it should be noted that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.119
 the auras the water flows by gravity 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.280
 up to the nopalera through various 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.070
 works of making so it is not required 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.409
 additional electrical energy with water 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.330
 stored will have a reservation 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.640
 to guarantee the public service to the

 city ​​of tecate at least for a 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.600
 period of three months in case 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.159
 some natural sinister prevented the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.530
 operation of the river aqueduct 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.020
 colorado-tijuana as it happened 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.390
 during the earthquake of April 4, 2010 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.520
 the work was designed so that in its 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.619
 filling water is used of the own 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.929
 colorado-tijuana aqueduct and 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.610
 occasionally from rainwater and 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.190
 runoff in the stream basin 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.830
 the auras that would naturally affect 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.140
 a greater volume of water in the dam 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.100
 auras an infrastructure work that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.100
 move to mexico
