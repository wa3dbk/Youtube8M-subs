your air and try to blow the paper off
the<00:02:51.590> stand<00:02:51.860> once<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.000> do<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.150> easily

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
the stand once you can do that easily

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.570 
the stand once you can do that easily
take<00:02:54.050> another<00:02:54.319> small<00:02:54.590> step<00:02:54.740> back<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.280> try<00:02:55.460> it

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
take another small step back and try it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.580 
take another small step back and try it
again<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.090> will<00:02:56.720> need<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.110> move<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.380> good

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
again you will need to move a good

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.540 
again you will need to move a good
volume<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:58.040> air

great<00:03:18.920> way<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.130> practice<00:03:19.460> moving<00:03:20.030> lots<00:03:20.270> of<00:03:20.480> air

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
great way to practice moving lots of air

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.320 
great way to practice moving lots of air
is<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.290> use<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.440> plastic<00:03:21.620> tube<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.460> tube<00:03:22.910> with<00:03:23.300> a

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.280 
due to tension and the sound of a hiss
which<00:04:48.000> means<00:04:48.270> your<00:04:48.419> throat<00:04:48.720> has<00:04:48.930> become
