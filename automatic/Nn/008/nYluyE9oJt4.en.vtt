00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.690 
in the process also know that underneath
here<00:01:59.350> is<00:02:00.350> another<00:02:00.740> gangs<00:02:03.310> so<00:02:04.310> we'll<00:02:04.520> go<00:02:04.670> ahead

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
here is another gangs so we'll go ahead

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.940 
here is another gangs so we'll go ahead
and<00:02:06.939> sharpen<00:02:07.939> that<00:02:08.300> one<00:02:08.539> moment<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:12.650> kind<00:02:12.890> of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and sharpen that one moment it's kind of

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.180 
and sharpen that one moment it's kind of
hard<00:02:13.130> again<00:02:13.340> feel<00:02:13.670> for<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:15.800> looking

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
where it would sharpen for and go ahead

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.420 
where it would sharpen for and go ahead
and<00:02:32.840> resources<00:02:33.799> I<00:02:34.630> know<00:02:35.630> it's<00:02:36.019> foul<00:02:36.430> you're
