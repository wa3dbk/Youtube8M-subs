here<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.420> black<00:00:42.660> fire<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.410> wanted<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> give<00:00:44.070> her

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190

here is black fire I wanted to give her
this<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.489> hairpiece<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.480> honestly<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> thought

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
this in hairpiece but honestly I thought

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.229 
this in hairpiece but honestly I thought
black<00:00:46.620> fire<00:00:46.950> would<00:00:47.370> look<00:00:47.520> better<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:48.000> just

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
black fire would look better with just

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.299 
black fire would look better with just
longer<00:00:48.450> hair<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.100> hard

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
longer hair so it was kind of a hard

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.770 
longer hair so it was kind of a hard
choice<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.149> didn't<00:00:51.300> want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> give<00:00:51.629> her

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
choice I really didn't want to give her

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.060 
choice I really didn't want to give her
the<00:00:51.899> long<00:00:52.079> hair<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> braid<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:52.980> back

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070

realizing<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.320> fuse<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:10.740> away<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:13.080> what

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
realizing of a fuse right away so what

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.780 
realizing of a fuse right away so what
you<00:03:13.560> need<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.740> do<00:03:13.950> though<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.160> supposed<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.670> use

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
you need to do though is supposed to use

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.160 
you need to do though is supposed to use
a<00:03:14.820> little<00:03:15.030> bit<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.270> foil<00:03:15.510> under<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> clay<00:03:16.110> so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
a little bit of foil under the clay so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930 
a little bit of foil under the clay so
then<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.710> can<00:03:16.890> take<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.130> hair<00:03:17.280> pieces<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.820> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
then you can take the hair pieces on and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.820 
then you can take the hair pieces on and
off<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.870> eventually<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.380> might<00:03:19.500> get<00:03:19.590> into

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830
