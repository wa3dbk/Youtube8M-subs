00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.850
 this year it's the type coat of 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.039
 doune we'll say or light can its 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.229
 particularity really know that we can 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.239
 all the fold in fact then put it back 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.879
 in a small bag it's super convenient 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.440
 we will be able to wear it also a type of 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.659
 lining under a coat but 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.510
 still warm enough this liar for 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.390
 approach for example martin the winter where 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.430
 everything if it is not waterproof by 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.050
 against it is really particular of the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.420
 couch inside then it's really a 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.850
 good incompetence coat of runners 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.990
 for example at the ski for a lining or 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.180
 go for a walk 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.070
 or just go to the car and everything 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.450
 that's really the very very nice coat 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.530
 trendy and glossy black 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.470
 we can find it in several 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.940
 colors also the purple the blue the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.040
 even yellow but really glossy black 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.910
 ch'ti which is very trendy but 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.620
 what I find the world knows it's 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.150
 a coat three seasons ci exact account 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.380
 and watson or spring when it's a 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.360
 little bit more cool thank you very much 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.670
 johan and we will avoid now ariane 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.180
 exactly so ariane will carry too 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.730
 a coat of home entertaining me 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.640
 I put it in the category a little 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.160
 little of the park to why because there is 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.660
 really characteristic for this coat 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.280
 blue so it is a feature at the waist 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.170
 with a hood really knows who this 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.990
 who distinguishes it and I make you 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.000
 also notice the ariane coat 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.920
 orange red hair and I wanted 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.229
 emphasize because often needs to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 really match here I can say those 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.830
 whose hair with the coat 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.810
 will choose it's super important 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.430
 it is for example oriente would carry a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.799
 coat of 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.510
 of the color beige or people it's because 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.920
 that they want the most benefit 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.170
 but look with a white coat 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.939
 it's really the ideal we see that it 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.310
 pay out come out his eyes too 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.980
 we see invited join to return with the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.519
 color which you have exactly so 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.829
 will he come from the shop jia robert 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.540
 drill mantot one can really see 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.849
 with the pockets that it can do 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.620
 really a beautiful look so the coat of 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.750
 titles the camel color that is said 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.480
 in jargon so at the Belgian level 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 for all ages for any age yes for the 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.970
 in my style 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.230
 as much for the embarrassment I find that it 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.879
 really brings a new look and that's 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.189
 so it's really very long 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.590
 sees the most lenient to the highest towards 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.019
 16 or xxl it's the coat that makes more 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.790
 great if we can see two sides the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.799
 coat is going to be a little bit a little bit more 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.269
 big in the back so tied done like this 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.489
 really it is to wear it more loose 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.909
 and it really brings down due 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.200
 louette 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.719
 we can find it also longer 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.769
 so we'll see it too with Ariane 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.530
 nearby 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.359
 if we can indeed nothing and that is 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.280
 denim of a coat that thinks time 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.409
 they think the years the times that's 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.329
 becomes a timeless of our guardian 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.069
 yes really then it's really adopted 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.750
 this type of coats the super trend 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.819
 see very long there are even some who 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.709
 arrive longer so this really 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.239
 up to the ankle and then what was 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.870
 fun with his mentor is that a 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.459
 cap 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.290
 it's very big for these types of 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.590
 coat we go in a little bit of 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.180
 European social trench coat and I you 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.569
 brings to see also all the subjects 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.099
 how is the lino 6 kills pages 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.930
 which mix is ​​also with cashmere 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.250
 is it's really super important 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.349
 because cashmere is really going 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.329
 to give a sweetness or mentally it's not 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.519
 like the wool that once were going 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.560
 to be a little rough does it really 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.519
 the new feature of these 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.859
 coats is today 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.259
 then woolen and still you have and 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.720
 its relays so that the coat us 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:09.240
 keep warm during 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.070
 the ags the month of the glass the wind is going 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.160
 pass - at work or mental thanks 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.620
 ariane and the next jouanny yes so 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.100
 joannie will also wear a cape 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.959
 we can also say pancho by jr robert 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.820
 in fact I wanted to show you good 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.720
 it's not the winter coat but we do not 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.060
 can really in the trends 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.570
 current so in the mid season 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.040
 it's really a beautiful fashion items that I 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.020
 finds that they accentuate all 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.750
 wear to wear with a belt 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.700
 as by joanie and even without belt 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.710
 but it's really it's really very 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.930
 very trendy for the current season soul 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.570
 so it's also very talented we speak 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.190
 also cashmere so that's it 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.230
 what I wanted to show you about the 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.700
 cap then we can wear it with 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.500
 maybe the down jacket as you had 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.790
 shown sometimes michael kors underneath 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.620
 to keep us maybe a little bit more 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.570
 warm it also makes us very beautiful 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.400
 lot than when to wear alone 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.070
 also just to make a look a little 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.740
 more fashion so here I'm going to you 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.450
 present my favorite in fact that 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.090
 I found in various mental is 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.160
 really a coat to the rough rest 5 and 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.990
 what is new in the rita coat 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.720
 that it's really the composite hood 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.580
 and up to the top so the fur the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.919
 way it's going to be it's really 1 a 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.540
 very nice collar is usually what 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.820
 I advise you in his coats place 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.070
 when you have a pass that comes close 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.510
 at the stage before absolutely the hair 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.460
 shorter than it's going to be the best 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.200
 when we have long hair because 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.150
 shoots and is currently aiming and I'm reading 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.910
 exactly so I want to really 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.470
 the daring ideal for a big collar like that c 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.110
 is really missed my favorite
