00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.970
 I think turning music into a game is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.449
 naturally you understand you are playing a game 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 listening to music is so hard to give 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.560
 the answer to this question is this 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.390
 it is natural that even difficult to answer 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.680
 he tries to say that the children who 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.910
 listen to hip hop buy this game 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.910
 so the audience will be too 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.090
 the game will give the opportunity to plunge into the children 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.410
 DJ creativity will give some experience 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.150
 Of course this is just a game and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.250
 playing it you will not become real 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.690
 DJ 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 but still this experience he will remain 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.420
 I think that what was made view the hero for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.650
 rock music will make this game but now 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.080
 for hip hop music 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.830
 the game has a lot of rock 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 composition 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.290
 but there is still a big rnb hip-hop 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.220
 all a lot of different music mixed all because 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.979
 this is hip hop 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.590
 all these sounds start randi msi and 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.310
 Dr. Albina I would say that DJs 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.860
 booths 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.000
 god of his place he controls 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.149
 environment 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 if he has a mix of 45 records in one 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.240
 called mastery professionalism he 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.819
 there is a hero if this game came out in my 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.179
 childhood number one goal would be 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:47.720
 to steal it i would steal it my favorite 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.720
 pink t-shirt 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.830
 I think guitar hero gave children 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.430
 feel like a rocker and go to 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.760
 their environment 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.420
 and in this game you become a DJ and 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.420
 that's cool
