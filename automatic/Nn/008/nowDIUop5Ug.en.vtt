00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
the gate the gate is there always where

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.530 
the gate the gate is there always where
the<00:02:25.660> thumb<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.300> now<00:02:28.300> when<00:02:28.510> I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
the thumb is it's like that now when I

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.790 
the thumb is it's like that now when I
when<00:02:28.989> we<00:02:29.050> were<00:02:29.080> doing<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.350> with<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.500> technique

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
when we were doing it with the technique

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.590 
when we were doing it with the technique
his<00:02:30.220> wrist<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.580> bent<00:02:30.850> like<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.420> even

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
his wrist is bent like this it's even

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.490 
his wrist is bent like this it's even
easier<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:32.050> do<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.320> now<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:33.550> can<00:02:33.700> also<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:35.440> it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
easier to do it now we can also do it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.070 
easier to do it now we can also do it
like<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.760> blade<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.150> reversed<00:02:37.540> you

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
like this if the blade is reversed you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.770 
like this if the blade is reversed you
can<00:02:38.230> still<00:02:38.590> grab<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:40.180> won't<00:02:40.360> cut<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.570> if

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
can still grab this it won't cut you if

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.380 
can still grab this it won't cut you if
you<00:02:40.900> do<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.080> flat<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:42.670> move<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.300> around

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
you do a flat like this move it around

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.170 
you do a flat like this move it around
the<00:02:43.600> cut<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.410> not<00:02:44.470> going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> do<00:02:44.830> anything

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
the cut it's not going to do anything

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.690 
the cut it's not going to do anything
and<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:46.750> peel<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> same<00:02:47.739> way<00:02:47.890> we<00:02:48.610> have
