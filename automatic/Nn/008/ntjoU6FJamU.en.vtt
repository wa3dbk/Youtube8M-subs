00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.610
 to washington 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.250
 hello very good kids here we are 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.780
 with a new tekken tag video 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.280
 tournament 2 as you see if we are in the 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.160
 practical way why because good 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.529
 found a little duckling is more than 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.050
 a flaw itself is something funny more than 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.360
 nothing and good that has this failure that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.510
 we can comment then as you see we have 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.820
 to that the normal mode the freestyle 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.080
 first of actions stand a fit of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.150
 becoming on guard of weights to the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.090
 defense after a movement that is not 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.790
 combo and after falling recovery action 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.610
 quick forgiveness 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.300
 and well, this is very simple, let's go 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 to see here when we have to do for 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.160
 example 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.740
 if we go here there are some movements 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.020
 what 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.500
 always they look with shades that pass 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.500
 above the rival and we do not get 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 hit 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.000
 There are as you see I have tried to do it 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.670
 and as it is if he did not get it and goes through 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.909
 In front of him 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.520
 with paul for example we have this 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.710
 says that the fit another young and good 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.340
 well the dummy people directly in 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 get up 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 what is the alpha here, well, yes, 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.299
 we put raven let's put some 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.299
 moment 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.340
 change 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.670
 let it go to raven and then let's put 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.840
 in 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.840
 in guard of the day 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.619
 or good let's see what happens when 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.619
 we do that backwards 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.520
 today he gets up and starts walking 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.240
 towards the opposite side where it is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.650
 eternally do not get tired of walking around 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.479
 the funny army with punching sales 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.220
 around here and the one that I respond with a 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.220
 dash stops 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.500
 sometimes as you are going to see it stops 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.720
 If it yourself and you say good 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.000
 Well, you just failed with you do not approach 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.380
 you give 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.450
 So again I restart to walk 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.120
 then I did not know if it was a fault it was 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.590
 smooth or a failure of reid in a failure of 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.580
 the product screen in various things and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.170
 it's not just raven 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.170
 let's see with pau too 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.209
 now we do not wait with this 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.910
 in English to the video 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.170
 here we have it 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.459
 so nothing kids like you see this is 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.409
 the video practically image failure is 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.150
 a little funny thing the training 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.599
 mode does not really affect anything either 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.340
 because this does not affect us in the combos 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.090
 not at all but good is one thing 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.090
 Curious that I've seen 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.920
 and 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.739
 and I hope you have liked to subscribe
