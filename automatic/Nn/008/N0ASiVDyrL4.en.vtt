really far what am I gonna do but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
really far what am I gonna do but
looking<00:01:12.030> back<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.810> couldn't<00:01:13.200> imagine<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
looking back I couldn't imagine going to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.390 
looking back I couldn't imagine going to
any<00:01:14.040> other<00:01:14.190> team<00:01:15.590> they<00:01:16.590> may<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.979> sit<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
any other team they may can sit in the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
any other team they may can sit in the
chair<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.030> doesn't<00:01:18.299> look<00:01:18.450> completely

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
chair so it doesn't look completely

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
chair so it doesn't look completely
ridiculous<00:01:19.590> who<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.460> standing<00:01:20.610> next<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> each

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
ridiculous who was standing next to each

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
ridiculous who was standing next to each
other<00:01:21.180> obviously<00:01:21.869> that's<00:01:22.229> coach<00:01:22.409> Donovan<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
other obviously that's coach Donovan and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
other obviously that's coach Donovan and
I<00:01:23.670> believe<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.119> was<00:01:24.420> her<00:01:24.720> first<00:01:24.930> year<00:01:25.080> in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.649 
I believe that was her first year in
Seattle<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.950> my<00:01:26.490> second<00:01:26.880> year<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.090> Seattle<00:01:27.240> she

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
Seattle so my second year in Seattle she

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
Seattle so my second year in Seattle she
really<00:01:28.170> understood<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.090> be

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
really understood what it was like to be

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.750 
really understood what it was like to be
a<00:01:30.240> player<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.830> there<00:01:32.040> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> marks

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
a player that right there kind of marks

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.090 
a player that right there kind of marks
the<00:01:33.479> start<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.530> great<00:01:34.770> five<00:01:34.979> years

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.620 

Seattle<00:01:39.100> you've<00:01:39.250> got<00:01:39.490> yourself<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.210> champion

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
Seattle you've got yourself the champion

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.819 
Seattle you've got yourself the champion
that's<00:01:43.630> obviously<00:01:44.020> when<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.259> want<00:01:44.439> in<00:01:44.560> 2004

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.260 

you<00:01:51.250> know<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.430> first<00:01:51.610> two<00:01:51.729> games<00:01:51.909> were<00:01:52.000> really

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
you know the first two games were really

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.060 
you know the first two games were really
tough<00:01:52.479> Connecticut<00:01:52.960> was<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.140> great<00:01:53.829> opponent

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
tough Connecticut was a great opponent

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.190 
tough Connecticut was a great opponent
but<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:55.060> just<00:01:55.270> seemed<00:01:55.420> like<00:01:55.450> we<00:01:55.600> had<00:01:55.719> control

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
but it just seemed like we had control

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.130 
but it just seemed like we had control
of<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.350> game<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.680> was<00:01:56.770> almost<00:01:56.920> destiny<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
of the game it was almost destiny the

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.289 
of the game it was almost destiny the
perfect<00:01:59.590> storm<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.429> was<00:02:00.579> probably<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:01.060> best

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
perfect storm this was probably the best

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.630 
perfect storm this was probably the best
