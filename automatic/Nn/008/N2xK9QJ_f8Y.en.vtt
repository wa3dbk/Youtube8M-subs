00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:15.719
 i shagged album debate on this second parent 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.750
 denies brand new guys have seen a man 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400
 goal and it's even the questions near 17 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.100
 can also be made there in the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.619
 facebook in its respective size and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.240
 tomorrow begins the second egg mission the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.010
 what is a tale with the participation of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 the whole galley visit the description of this 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 by the video with the alliances there but ura and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 q for you to enjoy inflammation in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.050
 hip language do not want you to have been 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.000
 I'm counting on everyone's reading but one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 kind of galera that the narrative 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.640
 current of an old floor some people is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.020
 interesting to note the various points of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 view of people 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.870
 many people think that the organ is 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.910
 rolling 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.440
 many people are also thinking that the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 another is running too far on some 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.370
 things I think dunga is running 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.160
 too much in some things is not 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.730
 wrapping people I think for one 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.979
 character level entered sub 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.659
 plots in history and how he divided the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.180
 characters of one's own 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.950
 protagonists nando of the flock of a place 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.229
 in history and I think he's telling the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.070
 story in a way is not 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.710
 haste but the agile and very 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.180
 efficient but I think he sins in 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 A few moments I would like the opinion 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.979
 about you for example I think 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.930
 yes he can treat her well the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.950
 groups for example we saw that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.720
 UOL's group of op hobby and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 gray that when they went to water in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.490
 beach when I was in the coliseum group 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.390
 the dance group he managed to share well 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.189
 the groups 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.729
 I think until the year did it very well. 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.630
 putting it will be a vital senator is more 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.369
 like this 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.680
 I do not know this style either. 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.409
 Where does he want to tell us something else? 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.119
 saw the abrupt cuts on the scene that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.210
 people were crazy to see old 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.189
 really fights the world's most serious air 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.630
 on the screen humiliation of a rite that what 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.229
 they gave the men fish on the island of 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.149
 yoshi on but so for example now it goes 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.569
 have spores there for those who only 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.300
 bus galera is the funk of cadu there by 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.480
 Mr Pickens in the pink must say is 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 What are you going to and enough? 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 he is the vice admiral of the navy galera 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.239
 It's toulouse he was lying in it. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.540
 is not that what matters is what matters 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.159
 fucking and a half chair the frank fight 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.500
 no one saw many people who see the 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.739
 frank fight many people who see the fight 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.650
 I knew when the 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.459
 example this happened before for example 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.379
 are different khalifa when not 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.920
 found sandton soaboadela that a 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.390
 ass here a cookie and shrek are the people 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.220
 We did not see what happened we saw 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.079
 khalifa still reducing them there 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.910
 taking him when I was already there 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.680
 way 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.709
 Maybe he walks when he wants to. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.109
 show some bar defeated it already jumped 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.879
 the scene for example or maybe not 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.950
 been some fight he wants to show 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.099
 how important but the impression that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.810
 stay is that wheel chain fights beauty it 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.310
 has such a fucking story that he 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.190
 fuck I want to tell my story 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.920
 old fight like you're a fan service 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.260
 I think to him today I do not know but I 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.389
 I think the flock of flamingo 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.579
 important in history, I think the 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.859
 People deserve to see more old fuck fights 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.440
 for example you can not is also 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.519
 complaining completely because the agreement 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.019
 It's not over 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.910
 we miss some of these 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.010
 things but of course we still have 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.290
 a resolution for work or for the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.269
 diamond for the pica that are the faces 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.910
 explains most of the Flemish band so 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.169
 like the old man there but there guys 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.470
 I would like to know how you are doing. 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:47.950
 Finding a rhythm you are thinking of 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.290
 rhythm of the narrative of a pici is taking 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.079
 have also gone through the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.150
 and the realize we had a style of 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.879
 story well continued without much cut 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.060
 with patience nowadays one for me 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.129
 how much is serious about bar and rob is a saga 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.560
 out of this saga of cip online as was 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.910

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.579

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.790

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.010
