can create your own bass lines using

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.830 
can create your own bass lines using
just<00:00:24.330> two<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:24.930> three<00:00:24.960> notes<00:00:26.330> using<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.630> major

create<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> walking<00:00:34.140> bass<00:00:34.579> let's<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.360> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
create a walking bass let's see how this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
create a walking bass let's see how this
would<00:00:37.170> look<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.920> diagram<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.829> see

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
would look on a diagram as you can see

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.569 
would look on a diagram as you can see
for<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.059> major<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.690> C<00:00:43.260> minor<00:00:43.500> chord<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
for a three major or C minor chord you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.510 
for a three major or C minor chord you
can<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.360> notes<00:00:45.600> C<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> G<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> walking

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
can use the notes C and G for a walking

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.869 
can use the notes C and G for a walking
bass<00:00:48.200> we'll<00:00:49.200> practice<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:50.129> using<00:00:50.730> an

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
bass we'll practice this using an

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.360 
bass we'll practice this using an
exercise<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> common<00:00:52.739> major<00:00:52.920> chord

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
exercise with a common major chord

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:04.140 
exercise with a common major chord
progression

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.250 

as<00:01:06.190> soon<00:01:07.190> as<00:01:07.400> we<00:01:07.700> are<00:01:07.729> able<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.360> use<00:01:08.659> two<00:01:08.990> notes

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
as soon as we are able to use two notes

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.340 
as soon as we are able to use two notes
from<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.920> Triad<00:01:10.190> for<00:01:10.520> walking<00:01:10.940> pace<00:01:11.150> we<00:01:12.110> can

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
from the Triad for walking pace we can

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.370 
from the Triad for walking pace we can
start<00:01:12.650> using<00:01:12.920> all<00:01:13.340> three<00:01:13.670> notes<00:01:14.050> let's<00:01:15.050> look

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
start using all three notes let's look

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:24.580 
start using all three notes let's look
at<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.619> diagram<00:01:15.860> for<00:01:16.670> this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.029 

in<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:25.369> second<00:01:25.789> exercise<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:27.170> play<00:01:27.409> all<00:01:27.679> three

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
in the second exercise we play all three

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:44.020 
in the second exercise we play all three
notes<00:01:28.340> from<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.090> Triads

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.110 

the<00:01:44.630> first<00:01:44.930> two<00:01:45.170> exercises<00:01:45.800> we<00:01:46.430> used<00:01:46.700> chord

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
the first two exercises we used chord

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.170 
the first two exercises we used chord
progressions<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.930> a<00:01:48.050> major<00:01:48.230> key<00:01:48.700> now<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:49.760> want

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
progressions in a major key now we want

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.570 
progressions in a major key now we want
to<00:01:50.300> practice<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.780> walking<00:01:51.170> bass<00:01:51.350> using<00:01:52.280> all

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
to practice a walking bass using all

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.060 
to practice a walking bass using all
three<00:01:52.880> nodes<00:01:53.240> from<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.840> triads<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.830> minor

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
three nodes from the triads in a minor

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:08.540 
three nodes from the triads in a minor
key

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550

in<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.789> next<00:02:10.000> step<00:02:10.270> we<00:02:10.600> will<00:02:10.750> learn<00:02:10.990> how<00:02:11.319> to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
in the next step we will learn how to

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.699 
in the next step we will learn how to
use<00:02:11.740> four<00:02:12.130> nodes<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.700> working<00:02:13.030> base<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:14.500> can

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
use four nodes in a working base we can

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.010 
use four nodes in a working base we can
add<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.190> second<00:02:15.640> tone<00:02:15.850> from<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.510> major<00:02:16.720> or

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
add the second tone from the major or

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.350 
add the second tone from the major or
minor<00:02:17.470> scale<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.580> get<00:02:18.790> our<00:02:19.030> fourth<00:02:19.540> node

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.210 

we'll<00:02:24.510> practice<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.440> new<00:02:25.590> four<00:02:25.950> note

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
we'll practice the new four note

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:42.460 
we'll practice the new four note
sequence<00:02:26.460> in<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.180> major<00:02:27.360> key

for the last part of this tutorial I'll

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.500 
for the last part of this tutorial I'll
use<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> short<00:02:46.650> improvisation<00:02:47.580> with<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.240> four

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
use a short improvisation with the four

00:02:48.510 --> 00:03:05.960 
use a short improvisation with the four
node<00:02:48.840> sequences<00:02:49.710> in<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.130> minor<00:02:50.340> key<00:02:50.580> I<00:03:04.970> would

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
node sequences in a minor key I would

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
node sequences in a minor key I would
recommend<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.930> practice<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
recommend that you practice the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.390 
recommend that you practice the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
sequences in different combinations

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.430 
sequences in different combinations
there<00:03:11.400> are<00:03:11.580> many<00:03:11.790> different<00:03:12.300> sequences<00:03:13.050> that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
there are many different sequences that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.800 
there are many different sequences that
you<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.830> use<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.310> create<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.730> walking<00:03:15.300> bass<00:03:15.480> in
