so<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:54.950> sounds<00:01:55.220> something<00:01:55.549> like<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.240> if

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.640 

you<00:02:11.299> want<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.569> switch<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:12.080> or<00:02:12.290> practice

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650

that<00:02:12.680> way<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.100> nice<00:02:13.250> if<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.580> want<00:02:13.730> to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
that way it's a nice if you want to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.990 
that way it's a nice if you want to
change<00:02:14.060> from<00:02:14.180> doing<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.160> really<00:02:16.370> nice<00:02:16.519> I

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
change from doing is it really nice I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.729

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
actual song you can pick up the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.809 
actual song you can pick up the
strumming<00:03:00.290> as<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.069> practice<00:03:01.400> over<00:03:01.519> longer
