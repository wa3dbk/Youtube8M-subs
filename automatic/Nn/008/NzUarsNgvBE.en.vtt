00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
imagine we went across a whole field and

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.869 
imagine we went across a whole field and
jumped<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.440> train<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.190> time<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:30.579> saw

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
finally you know this is five hours of

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.119 
finally you know this is five hours of
travel<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.400> know<00:03:49.650> multiple<00:03:50.650> hundreds<00:03:51.010> of

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
travel you know multiple hundreds of

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.909 
travel you know multiple hundreds of
miles<00:03:51.660> we<00:03:52.660> finally<00:03:53.079> look<00:03:53.230> at<00:03:53.319> each<00:03:53.440> other<00:03:53.650> ago

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
miles we finally look at each other ago
