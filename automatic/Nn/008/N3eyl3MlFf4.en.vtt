00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 two 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.870
 to look for a product that was different 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.740
 and innovative and to try 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.740
 market it 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.260
 and began to go little by little with work 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.119
 of the boots of the sole of the boots of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.909
 came from sherry our main our 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.060
 principal 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.979
 of us working glasses with the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.890
 sherry raw material that is the stave 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.780
 even so we have opened up a bit because 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.939
 we are also Andalusians evidently 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.950
 Spaniards we try to work with 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.270
 Spanish materials with products 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.430
 Andalusian as it can be olive 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.860
 arango which is a version that we have 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.580
 taken a little different to use 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.100
 a national wood too 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.240
 the oak of the grandmother of the boot 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.740
 our main problem 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.790
 It has been a little coincidence because the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 project was born before 2014 but good 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.500
 let's take advantage of the commercial pull that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.950
 is having him right now 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.960
 as the international city of wine 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.450
 what better than to offer people 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.820
 part of our quality wines some 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.750
 glasses made with staves that have 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.750
 saved their wines
