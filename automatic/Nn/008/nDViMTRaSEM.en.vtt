00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.540
 good afternoon colleagues today i will tell 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.920
 opportunities that is still available 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.109
 for developers only 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.069
 and today I will do it what was 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:15.189
 Announced the day before yesterday this oxygen 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.650
 it seems what it is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.439
 prototype tax which allows 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.619
 store your dad's resource this 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.960
 for example pictures on many many many 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.989
 servers around the world 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.189
 and during page load 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.099
 and here these pictures load rub 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310
 parallel flow 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.100
 close 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.550
 t distributed network 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850
 This allows you to significantly speed up 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.810
 page loading process 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.850
 I will try to show it on projects 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.310
 so the first hike we declare soon the site 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.880
 Anything better is a camera 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.640
 without 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 it seems and without flaw 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410
 on the second half 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.890
 outstanding gene but included auto 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 caching 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.220
 and we will not 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 and sent to drops by launch 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 Kashin truth 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.659
 of the following park which affects 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.140
 performance of which 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 much today we don't want to show 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.820
 these are cloud service settings 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.120
 speeding up the site yourself veins 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.010
 there is such a tick 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.350
 do not give before saving 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 we will make sure that the pictures 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.030
 now take their own in sp then 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.429
 new Year 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.429
 Pictures 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.969
 earlier change 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.969
 doctors address stronghold album 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 and so on in the hunt 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.049
 accidentally 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.639
 but testimony 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.639
 whit front site 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.319
 Yes, now the pictures are taken in the cloud 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.069
 so to the most interesting 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.559
 this is when we have the keys have an idea and of course 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.259
 such a conclusion 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.259
 do not forget the author of masking notes 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.779
 nor neat truth if possible in 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.069
 In this case, the sites will work 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.769
 much faster 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.069
 and most importantly a new opportunity which 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.299
 while there are only bitrix and including 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:05.510
 you
