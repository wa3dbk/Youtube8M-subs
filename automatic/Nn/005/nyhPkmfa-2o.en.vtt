a pet now and I'll admit that if I found
a<00:01:23.100> rattlesnake<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.790> Cobra<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.659> porch<00:01:24.960> I'd

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
a rattlesnake or Cobra on my porch I'd

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.899 
a rattlesnake or Cobra on my porch I'd
be<00:01:25.320> much<00:01:25.500> likely<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> scream<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.549> scare<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
be much likely to scream and scare it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.640 
be much likely to scream and scare it
away<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.330> opposed<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.840> trying<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> catch<00:01:28.470> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
away as opposed to trying to catch it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
away as opposed to trying to catch it
like<00:01:28.860> baby<00:01:29.070> Jackson<00:01:29.549> would<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.270> not

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like baby Jackson would have I'm not

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
like baby Jackson would have I'm not
sure<00:01:30.630> exactly<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> switch<00:01:32.009> came<00:01:32.310> about

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
sure exactly when this switch came about

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
sure exactly when this switch came about
and<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.939> goes<00:01:33.119> far<00:01:33.479> beyond<00:01:33.900> snakes<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.530> were

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and it goes far beyond snakes there were

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
and it goes far beyond snakes there were
all<00:01:34.770> these<00:01:34.920> adventurous<00:01:35.520> cool<00:01:35.970> things<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.540> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
all these adventurous cool things that I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
all these adventurous cool things that I
did<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> kid<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> look<00:01:38.340> back<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
did as a kid that now I look back at and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
did as a kid that now I look back at and
I'm<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.090> oh<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.240> god<00:01:39.630> how<00:01:39.930> am<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.320> dead

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
I'm like oh my god how am I not dead

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140
