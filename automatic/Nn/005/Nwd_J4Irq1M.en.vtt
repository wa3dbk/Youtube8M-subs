00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
this but I love it and I had a feeling

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.920 
this but I love it and I had a feeling
that<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:36.040> was<00:02:36.250> gonna<00:02:36.510> when<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> ordered<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
that this was gonna when I ordered the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.080 
that this was gonna when I ordered the
blue<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.470> gonna<00:02:38.620> be<00:02:38.830> this<00:02:39.010> color<00:02:39.310> because<00:02:39.910> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
blue is gonna be this color because I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.850 
blue is gonna be this color because I
think<00:02:40.330> before<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.720> had<00:02:40.870> ordered<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.290> pale<00:02:41.560> blue

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
think before I had ordered a pale blue

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.680 
think before I had ordered a pale blue
and<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:44.250> lighter<00:02:45.250> version<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.270> estimate

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
and it was a lighter version of estimate

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.050 
and it was a lighter version of estimate
in<00:02:46.780> fact<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.110> think<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.410> was<00:02:47.500> one<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.770> pearls

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
in fact I think it was one of the pearls

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.320 
in fact I think it was one of the pearls
but<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.120> ordered<00:02:49.330> pale<00:02:49.720> blue<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.380> anyway<00:02:51.330> so

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
but I ordered pale blue so anyway so

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.560 
but I ordered pale blue so anyway so
these<00:02:52.480> are<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.870> twelve<00:02:53.200> millimeter<00:02:54.570> I'm

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.370 
millimeter and the 10 millimeter
appeared<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.190> be<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:07.209> slightly<00:03:07.480> lighter

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
appeared to be just slightly lighter
