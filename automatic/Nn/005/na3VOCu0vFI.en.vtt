could<00:03:23.810> change<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.049> call<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.319> absolutely

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709

anything you guys want and it's all be
moving<00:03:27.169> so<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.349> kind<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.650> thought<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.829> was<00:03:27.980> a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
moving so I kind of thought it was a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.800 
moving so I kind of thought it was a
little<00:03:28.160> more<00:03:28.310> different<00:03:28.790> than<00:03:28.970> most<00:03:29.450> people

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
little more different than most people

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.509 
little more different than most people
who<00:03:29.900> do<00:03:30.079> gravity<00:03:30.500> or<00:03:30.620> themes<00:03:30.919> that<00:03:31.220> just

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
who do gravity or themes that just

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.490 
who do gravity or themes that just
basically<00:03:31.669> have<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.180> big<00:03:32.510> picture<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.840> I'm<00:03:33.169> cat

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
basically have a big picture of I'm cat

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.740 
basically have a big picture of I'm cat
you<00:03:34.130> know<00:03:34.280> showing<00:03:34.579> off<00:03:34.760> for<00:03:34.790> prettiness<00:03:35.359> but

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
you know showing off for prettiness but

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.970 
you know showing off for prettiness but
I<00:03:35.989> want<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.380> do<00:03:36.470> something<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.769> little<00:03:36.799> more

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
