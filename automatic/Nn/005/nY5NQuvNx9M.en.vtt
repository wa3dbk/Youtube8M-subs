00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.850
 and expensive 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.519
 for more 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.770
 hello youtube friends i hope and i'll 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.220
 like this tutorial today we will see how 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.220
 activate the DVD drive again 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.190
 chances windows 8 is formatted with 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.640
 a DVD drive from another pc because the 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.830
 our does not work or for my reason 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.470
 this happened to me and when he cendi my pc 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.900
 I noticed that my velez unit is not or not 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.900
 he recognizes it, I'll show you 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.200
 as you can see the DVD drive is not 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.200
 it got lost 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.050
 for more 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.129
 I will mount one made for you to see 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.450
 If this is your case you just have to open 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.450
 the cmd in administrator mode 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.560
 and they only have to write or paste it on 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.560
 command that I will show you next 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.630
 once the command is pasted, we only give 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.930
 enter we leave the cmd and verify if 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.930
 is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.680
 it's not just rebooting the pc and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.680
 will show the dvd drive 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.760
 good and restart the pc the only thing 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.659
 we must do is go see if it works or 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.659
 it did not work 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.010
 good as you can see the dvd drive 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.620
 if you are if you liked the tuto they give 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.620
 little hand up or with a rough comment 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.050
 this was done in windows 8 I do not know if 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.050
 work in another operating system 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.819
