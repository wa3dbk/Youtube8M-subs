00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Oh, come on! Where are all people ?! 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.700
 Oh no. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 I dressed officially. Not fair. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 We're late! 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 Obviously! And they left without us! Ah these-- 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Stay here. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 -Press up! -K-What ?! 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 Where are all the ho - 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 And-Escape from here! It's not safe for anyone! 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 Wait! Oh ... 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Well? 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.600
 - God! The angels are out! -I'm sorry. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.500
 Velder was attacked! 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Oh ... well. 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.500
 Wait, WHAT ?! 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 -Oh, God ... -Who did it ?! 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.500
 And - ... 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
 Eyes? 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 Jee-shi, I do not know how I could know? Haha! 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.300
 What are you hiding from me? 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.200
 Nothing! 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.600
 -Love with lies! -I am not lying to you! 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.200
 And now we are obliged to save Welder, right? 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.000
 Where did you get that? "We are the only ones in the city. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 But-- 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 We are sorceresses! And you're pretty strong. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Do you want a lot ?! 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.700
 OK! Super strong! Now, we have to go! 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.400
 I will go to Bridge of Hopes. You go to check if there are survivors in the suburbs. 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.000
 OK! See you soon. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 "Fireworks" 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.000
 Echo? Is there anybody? 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.000
 There is nobody. They must have hidden. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Damn it! 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 There must be at least somebody there. I need to check! 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.100
 Hia-aa !! 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.000
 Eheeoh? Is there anybody? 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.000
 Gad. There is nobody. 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.000
 Look at you. Look who showed up. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.300
 Who's there? 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.000
 Who are you? "This one who will not let you go. -Oh really? How will you stop me? 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 - I will not stop you because you will leave alone! -Great, friend! 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 -Oh, please! You can not touch me! -We will see this work! 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 What strength! I like you. Too bad I need to eliminate you. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.400
 Go! 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 There is nobody here! What am I doing here? 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 -You're looking for trouble, maybe. -Who said that? 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Right here. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Oh, are you okay? Did the monsters attack you? 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 They can not attack me. I am their master. -What? 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 "Oh, you're so slow, Princess Jane. -How do you know-- 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Your father had enough of your pictures in your castle. I may have noticed a few while I was burning. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.500
 "What did you do with my father?" - Now, dear. Do not get mad. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.500
 Where is he?! 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.000
 Quiet, princess. Or you will die sooner than expected. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Dying finally! Oh! 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.000
 I'm not that easy to kill, huh? Haha! 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.000
 Like Vesterilio! 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.000
 Haha! It's just that-- Oh! 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.500
 This is not a normal bat, sugar. Kill him, Angkor! 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500
 H-No! 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.700
 -Who are you? And why do you destroy Welder? -You will never understand! 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 -Tell me! -I prefer to die! 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.500
 You nasty ... 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.000
 I will do EVERYTHING for my masters. Even that! 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.000
 What are you doing? Who are your masters ?! 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Wait! 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.400
 Release my father right away, like the rest of the citizens! 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.800
 I'm late, princess. They are already dead! 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 - No ... - It's time for you to die. 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.500
 -No! -Hahaha! 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.000
 I'm sick! 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.000
 What about ...? 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Oh ... what happened? 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.500
 Oh no.
