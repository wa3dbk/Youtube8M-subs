00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.179
 Hello everyone in this video, I will show you 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.889
 interesting episode where of course 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.279
 there is a certain amount of luck 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.699
 but besides there are thoughts that I think 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 Some players will be useful and so we 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.260
 on the map robin and I climbed under 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.480
 the barn is often quite good 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 flash the enemy if you stand to the right of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.029
 buildings behind this bush and turn on 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.130
 stereo pipe 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 at the same time if you do not yourself 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.710
 shoot something and notice you practically 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.989
 unreal 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.020
 except that the broken fence can 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.629
 leave the blinds this time me too 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.300
 did the primary light but a couple passed 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.969
 minutes of the battle and suddenly someone became me 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 shine I came to the conclusion that this 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.170
 comes from the center of the map from the bushes and and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.890
 judging by the composition of the enemy team 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.570
 it is most likely what this tree does 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.879
 the problem was that with her 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.370
 Positions perfectly see through big 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.450
 part of our base and soon everything 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.280
 who stayed here will be just shot 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.740
 it was necessary to act faster and therefore 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 I decided to narrow the location 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.920
 enemy firefly and became gradually 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.360
 find out what kind of bushes it is worth 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 sticking out a part of the body then with this one 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 the other side of my hideout I spent 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.259
 conditional line with a building angle and custom 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 which opens important with this 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.130
 act carefully and surely 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.579
 wait until you disappear because of the light 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.159
 the enemy 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.650
 I came to the conclusion that the tree is in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.380
 squared g3 and reported it to the chat 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.000
 my team I also asked about 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.610
 those who have the opportunity to shoot 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.229
 along these bushes since as soon as i 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 I leave because of this barn in my 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.229
 the bulb lights up and there is no possibility 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.549
 to come down 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.680
 as it is quite dangerous except in 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.360
 Christmas trees are very low silhouette of enclosures that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.899
 reduces my chances of hitting her 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 blindly to the minimum you can be sure 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.399
 that the tree never shone in the ears 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.649
 teams this is evidenced by white. 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.340
 and there are also no marks on the minimap 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.340
 where she was 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.600
 and I'm so sick of waiting for the help of the allies 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.290
 and I decided to shoot myself in this direction 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.710
 aim to scare her so she slid off 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.700
 homeland and now you will see 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.700
 what came of it 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.780
 honestly was not shocked 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.370
 the result of a shot and by no means 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 I did not expect that I will not get 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.380
 and even more so I hope to kill you the same way 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.760
 liked this moment thanks for 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.760
 attention and see you soon
