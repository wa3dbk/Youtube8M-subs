00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
camera sets can right now I'll see from

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
camera sets can right now I'll see from
this<00:00:52.440> character<00:00:52.770> set<00:00:53.039> perspective<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.360> push

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this character set perspective so push

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
this character set perspective so push
out<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.110> two<00:00:55.890> pair<00:00:56.129> animation<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.730> don't<00:00:56.910> know

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
out a two pair animation if don't know

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.760 
out a two pair animation if don't know
that<00:00:57.210> ready<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.559> mine<00:00:58.739> looks

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
that ready and that's what mine looks

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
that ready and that's what mine looks
like<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.910> so<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.359> way<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.870> is

like right so the way you do this is
with<00:01:01.140> curves<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> here's<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> curve<00:01:02.550> so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
with curves and this here's a curve so

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.820

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
i nigga i'm i learn a little basic

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.920 
i nigga i'm i learn a little basic
before<00:01:20.040> learning<00:01:20.189> any<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:21.450> advanced

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
before learning any of the more advanced

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.980 
before learning any of the more advanced
animation<00:01:22.259> stuff<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> anyways<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.360> we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
animation stuff like that anyways so we

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.390 
animation stuff like that anyways so we
have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> still<00:01:25.530> camera<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.280> it's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
have a still camera right now and it's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
have a still camera right now and it's
looking<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.320> view<00:01:28.320> camera

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
looking right the view camera

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
looking right the view camera
it's<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> grad<00:01:30.150> cube<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.170> doesn't<00:01:31.470> move<00:01:31.560> or

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
it's a grad cube so it doesn't move or

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's a grad cube so it doesn't move or
anything<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> make<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
anything so I'm going to make this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850 
anything so I'm going to make this
camera<00:01:34.799> move<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:35.939> way<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.860> this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
camera move in the same way as this

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.410 
camera move in the same way as this
camera<00:01:38.189> does<00:01:38.369> where<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.119> moves<00:01:39.299> around

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
camera does where it just moves around

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.109 
camera does where it just moves around
the<00:01:39.630> circle<00:01:40.079> using<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.619> curve<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the circle using this curve so all you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.830 
the circle using this curve so all you
do<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.110> proceed<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.829> shift<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.720> get

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
do is you proceed and shift a to get

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.179 
do is you proceed and shift a to get
this<00:01:45.990> menu<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.380> I'm<00:01:46.530> hoping<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.040> know

run it so like I said you don't just

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.630 
run it so like I said you don't just
have<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.880> do<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.000> circle<00:02:53.650> or<00:02:54.650> actually<00:02:55.430> going<00:02:55.519> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
have to do a circle or actually going to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.280 
have to do a circle or actually going to
show<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.819> first<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.660> should<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:56.989> going<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.230> do

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
that in a different video because you

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.430 
that in a different video because you
might<00:02:58.459> not<00:02:58.610> be<00:02:58.730> looking<00:02:58.880> at<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.630> internet<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
might not be looking at to internet to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.410 
might not be looking at to internet to
later<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.610> else<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:02.000> I'm<00:03:02.060> going<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.269> show

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
later so what else so I'm going to show

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.470 
later so what else so I'm going to show
you<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.840> how<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.019> make<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> camera<00:03:03.650> fall<00:03:03.830> away

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
you is how to make a camera fall away

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.910 
you is how to make a camera fall away
we'll<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:05.630> follow<00:03:05.750> anything<00:03:06.110> follow<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.680> path

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
we'll just follow anything follow a path

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.009 
we'll just follow anything follow a path
so<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.970> way<00:03:08.090> I'm<00:03:08.299> going<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.569> do<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.840> I'm

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
so the way I'm going to do this I'm

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.380 
so the way I'm going to do this I'm
going<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.200> make<00:03:09.319> my<00:03:09.470> camera<00:03:09.860> there<00:03:10.640> we<00:03:10.730> go<00:03:10.910> I'm

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
going to make my camera there we go I'm

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.530 
going to make my camera there we go I'm
going<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.599> make<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.750> line<00:03:13.150> there<00:03:14.150> we<00:03:14.239> go

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
going to make a line there we go

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.250 
going to make a line there we go
and<00:03:14.630> I'm<00:03:15.410> going<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.650> pull<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.160> up<00:03:16.310> here<00:03:17.140> got<00:03:18.140> to

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
and I'm going to pull it up here got to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.949 
and I'm going to pull it up here got to
go<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:18.500> that

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
go like that

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.340 
go like that
and<00:03:22.299> let's<00:03:23.299> make<00:03:23.480> sure<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.930> facing<00:03:24.230> right

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
and let's make sure this is facing right

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.930 
and let's make sure this is facing right
way<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.530> if<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.799> go<00:03:24.920> into<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.250> curve<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.760> push

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
way so if you go into the curve and push

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.870 
way so if you go into the curve and push
tab<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.720> will<00:03:26.870> show<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.230> direction<00:03:27.880> it's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
tab it will show you the direction it's

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.509 
tab it will show you the direction it's
heading<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:30.049> you<00:03:30.109> can<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.350> let<00:03:30.500> BAM<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.220> if

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
heading so you can you let BAM and if

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.270 
heading so you can you let BAM and if
you<00:03:31.670> if<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.660> want<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.049> curve<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.620> lines<00:03:33.859> just

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
you if you want to curve the lines just

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.759 
you if you want to curve the lines just
cut<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:35.060> select<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.569> so<00:03:36.140> I'm<00:03:36.350> in<00:03:36.470> edit

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
cut that you select a so I'm in edit

something<00:05:31.260> on<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.470> screen<00:05:31.620> right<00:05:31.919> now<00:05:31.979> that

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
something on the screen right now that

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.820 
something on the screen right now that
will<00:05:32.910> link<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.660> video<00:05:33.810> on<00:05:34.290> some<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:34.740> the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
will link you to a video on some of the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.040 
will link you to a video on some of the
curve<00:05:35.040> options<00:05:35.760> actually<00:05:36.240> mainly<00:05:36.450> how<00:05:36.990> to

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
curve options actually mainly how to

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.940 
curve options actually mainly how to
make<00:05:37.620> your<00:05:37.950> animation<00:05:38.580> start<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.910> later<00:05:39.180> frame

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
make your animation start a later frame

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.710 
make your animation start a later frame
so<00:05:40.950> like<00:05:41.100> as<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.610> can<00:05:41.700> see<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.060> starts<00:05:42.360> at<00:05:42.450> zero

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
so like as you can see it starts at zero

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.050 
so like as you can see it starts at zero
-<00:05:43.500> how<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.680> make<00:05:43.890> it<00:05:43.979> so<00:05:44.130> it'll<00:05:44.430> start<00:05:44.640> going

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
- how to make it so it'll start going

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.940 
- how to make it so it'll start going
around<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.330> circle<00:05:45.510> at<00:05:45.810> like<00:05:45.960> 80<00:05:46.169> all<00:05:46.830> right

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
around the circle at like 80 all right

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.540 
around the circle at like 80 all right
thank<00:05:47.160> you<00:05:47.220> and<00:05:47.550> bye<00:05:48.510> bye
