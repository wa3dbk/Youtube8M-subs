00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
as you can see those would be some

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.520 
as you can see those would be some
pretty<00:01:46.760> massive<00:01:47.090> holes<00:01:47.540> if<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:47.870> wasn't<00:01:48.140> able<00:01:48.350> to

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
pretty massive holes if I wasn't able to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.220 
pretty massive holes if I wasn't able to
fill<00:01:48.770> them<00:01:52.000> there's<00:01:53.000> some<00:01:53.180> good-sized<00:01:53.900> gaps

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
fill them there's some good-sized gaps

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.560

in<00:01:54.530> between<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.920> boards<00:01:58.150> it's<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.210> good<00:01:59.390> number

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
in between the boards it's a good number

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.720 

this<00:02:10.259> was<00:02:10.440> probably<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.039> largest<00:02:11.190> one<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this was probably the largest one the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.100 
this was probably the largest one the
Lighting's<00:02:12.150> pretty<00:02:12.390> bad<00:02:12.570> but<00:02:12.810> they're

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
Lighting's pretty bad but they're

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.730

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.770 
right so here's after I've ran the stain
on<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:11.310> floor<00:03:14.239> some<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.329> them<00:03:15.420> look<00:03:15.569> better

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
on the floor some of them look better

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.809 
on the floor some of them look better
than<00:03:16.049> others<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.859> again<00:03:20.159> I<00:03:20.189> wasn't<00:03:20.459> looking

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
than others but again I wasn't looking

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.629 
than others but again I wasn't looking
for<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> perfect<00:03:23.480> finished<00:03:24.480> wood<00:03:24.989> floor

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
for a perfect finished wood floor

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.319 
for a perfect finished wood floor
looking<00:03:26.639> for<00:03:26.670> something<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.090> little<00:03:27.120> more

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
looking for something a little more

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:34.650 
looking for something a little more
rough

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.040 

probably<00:03:35.500> would<00:03:35.680> suggest<00:03:35.890> using<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:37.050> stain

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
probably would suggest using a stain

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.960 
probably would suggest using a stain
marker<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.680> same<00:03:38.950> color<00:03:39.220> stain<00:03:39.610> you're<00:03:39.850> gonna

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
marker the same color stain you're gonna

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.260 
marker the same color stain you're gonna
use<00:03:40.240> might<00:03:41.230> show<00:03:41.470> up<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.680> little<00:03:41.770> bit<00:03:41.980> better<00:03:42.270> or

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
use might show up a little bit better or

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:57.460 
use might show up a little bit better or
hide<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.930> little<00:03:44.140> bit<00:03:44.350> better<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.620> should<00:03:44.860> say

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.570 

it<00:03:58.040> was<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.220> big<00:03:58.400> crack<00:03:58.730> okay
