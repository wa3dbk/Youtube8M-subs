00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
way you can see the best I guess just a

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.020 
way you can see the best I guess just a
little<00:03:33.440> reflection<00:03:39.220> it's<00:03:40.220> just<00:03:40.459> flashing<00:03:40.880> so

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
little reflection it's just flashing so
