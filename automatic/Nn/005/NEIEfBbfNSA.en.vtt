reasons<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.440> obviously<00:02:11.280> water<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> best

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
reasons one obviously water is the best

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.710 
reasons one obviously water is the best
choice<00:02:12.549> to<00:02:13.549> drink<00:02:13.819> because<00:02:14.209> there's<00:02:14.390> nothing

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
choice to drink because there's nothing

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.690 
choice to drink because there's nothing
in<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:15.140> just<00:02:15.260> water<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.799> what<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.400> good

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
in it it's just water and what is good

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.130 
in it it's just water and what is good
for<00:02:16.909> you<00:02:17.030> um<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.400> also<00:02:19.610> has<00:02:19.879> like

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
for you um but this also has like

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.210 
for you um but this also has like
antioxidants<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.409> that's<00:02:21.560> good<00:02:21.769> for<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.010> too

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
antioxidants so that's good for you too

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.160 
antioxidants so that's good for you too
but<00:02:22.549> what<00:02:22.939> are<00:02:23.090> still<00:02:23.299> probably<00:02:23.689> is<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:23.989> better

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
but what are still probably is a better

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.119 
but what are still probably is a better
choice<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.120> when<00:02:26.269> all<00:02:26.629> on<00:02:27.010> besides<00:02:28.010> of

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
choice and so when all on besides of

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.069 
choice and so when all on besides of
being<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> better<00:02:28.459> choice<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:29.540> isn't<00:02:29.840> cheap

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
being a better choice this isn't cheap

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.619 
being a better choice this isn't cheap
like<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.400> paid<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.879> dollar<00:02:32.030> fifty<00:02:32.269> four

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
like this I paid a dollar fifty four

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.789 
like this I paid a dollar fifty four
which<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.900> little<00:02:32.989> overpriced<00:02:33.409> i<00:02:33.620> think<00:02:33.769> i

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
which is a little overpriced i think i

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.809 
which is a little overpriced i think i
could<00:02:33.860> find<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.220> somewhere<00:02:34.459> for<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.760> a

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
could find it somewhere for like a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.819 
could find it somewhere for like a
dollar<00:02:34.970> I've<00:02:35.900> read<00:02:36.140> online<00:02:36.319> that<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.739> can

six days and today i didn't miss it um I
don't<00:03:25.010> know<00:03:25.160> how<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.430> would<00:03:25.549> feel<00:03:25.669> if<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.120> drank<00:03:26.299> a

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
don't know how I would feel if I drank a

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.150 
don't know how I would feel if I drank a
spray<00:03:26.660> right<00:03:26.870> now<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.049> might<00:03:27.349> I<00:03:27.709> probably<00:03:27.919> would

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
spray right now I might I probably would

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.220 
spray right now I might I probably would
still<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.519> it<00:03:28.760> but<00:03:29.000> but<00:03:29.359> today<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.720> did<00:03:29.989> not

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
still like it but but today I did not

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.599 
still like it but but today I did not
really<00:03:30.560> miss<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.889> and<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.040> think<00:03:31.370> it's<00:03:31.519> because

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
really miss it and I think it's because

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.900 
really miss it and I think it's because
of<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.780> because<00:03:33.049> I<00:03:33.290> got<00:03:33.440> one<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.250> these<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.730> got

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
of this because I got one of these I got

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.400 
of this because I got one of these I got
a<00:03:34.940> few<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.239> them<00:03:35.359> now<00:03:35.449> on<00:03:35.599> average<00:03:35.900> just<00:03:36.019> to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
a few of them now on average just to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.270 
a few of them now on average just to
have<00:03:36.560> over<00:03:36.829> like<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.160> next<00:03:37.430> week<00:03:37.669> and<00:03:39.250> but<00:03:40.250> I

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
have over like the next week and but I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.619 
have over like the next week and but I
think<00:03:40.669> because<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:40.940> found<00:03:41.269> something<00:03:41.419> that's

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
think because I found something that's

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.460 
think because I found something that's
not<00:03:41.810> water<00:03:42.349> to<00:03:43.280> drink<00:03:43.629> I'm<00:03:44.629> not<00:03:44.959> as<00:03:45.230> upset

anymore because I've kind of reached the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.030 
anymore because I've kind of reached the
point<00:03:47.480> where<00:03:47.750> I'm<00:03:47.900> kind<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.470> forgetting<00:03:48.949> about

point where I'm kind of forgetting about

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.710 
point where I'm kind of forgetting about
it<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.280> little<00:03:49.430> bit<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:49.819> still<00:03:50.060> wanted<00:03:50.480> some

to research it and tell me what you

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.159 
to research it and tell me what you
think<00:03:58.609> of<00:03:58.760> my<00:03:58.940> choice<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.180> picking<00:03:59.659> this<00:03:59.810> if

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
think of my choice and picking this if

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.930 
think of my choice and picking this if
you<00:04:00.290> can<00:04:00.409> use<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.620> better<00:04:00.769> choice<00:04:01.099> I<00:04:01.579> really

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
you can use a better choice I really

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.699 
you can use a better choice I really
like<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.239> though<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.870> it's<00:04:03.169> hard<00:04:03.349> for<00:04:03.409> me<00:04:03.620> to

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
like this though and it's hard for me to

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.680 
like this though and it's hard for me to
find<00:04:03.829> something<00:04:04.159> that<00:04:04.579> I<00:04:05.060> like<00:04:05.209> drinking<00:04:07.690> but

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
find something that I like drinking but

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.740 
find something that I like drinking but
yeah<00:04:08.840> aside<00:04:09.530> from<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.799> i'm<00:04:10.340> doing<00:04:10.849> well

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
yeah aside from that i'm doing well

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.460 
yeah aside from that i'm doing well
today<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:13.099> my<00:04:13.970> energy<00:04:14.329> levels<00:04:14.690> seem<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.199> kind<00:04:15.349> of

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
today I my energy levels seem to kind of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.180 
today I my energy levels seem to kind of
normalize<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.370> wasn't<00:04:16.940> very<00:04:16.970> low<00:04:17.299> energy<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:18.799> was

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
normalize I wasn't very low energy I was

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.500 
normalize I wasn't very low energy I was
still<00:04:19.400> kind<00:04:19.430> of<00:04:19.729> low<00:04:19.849> energy<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.269> don't<00:04:20.389> know<00:04:20.450> it

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
still kind of low energy I don't know it

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.459 
still kind of low energy I don't know it
was<00:04:20.599> hard<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.810> tell<00:04:20.959> them<00:04:21.139> because<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.349> wasn't

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:21.469 
was hard to tell them because I wasn't

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.600 
was hard to tell them because I wasn't
really<00:04:21.620> doing<00:04:21.799> anything<00:04:22.070> today<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.370> didn't

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
really doing anything today I didn't

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.070 
really doing anything today I didn't
have<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.789> do

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
have to do

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.929 
have to do
thing<00:04:23.259> I<00:04:23.500> had<00:04:23.949> like<00:04:24.099> a<00:04:24.159> full<00:04:24.370> day<00:04:24.550> off<00:04:24.729> without

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:24.939 
thing I had like a full day off without

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.189 
thing I had like a full day off without
having<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.449> anything<00:04:25.629> so<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.020> hard<00:04:26.169> to

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
having to do anything so it's hard to

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.809 
having to do anything so it's hard to
tell<00:04:26.379> how<00:04:26.590> high<00:04:26.800> my<00:04:26.979> energy<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.460> all<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.639> day

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
tell how high my energy is all a day

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.749 
tell how high my energy is all a day
like<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.030> but<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:28.930> felt<00:04:29.169> okay<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.740> did<00:04:30.400> not<00:04:30.550> lose

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
like that but I felt okay I did not lose

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.790 
like that but I felt okay I did not lose
more<00:04:30.939> weight<00:04:30.970> even<00:04:31.599> though<00:04:31.629> I<00:04:31.780> did<00:04:32.169> exercise

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
more weight even though I did exercise

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.290 
more weight even though I did exercise
yesterday<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.759> first<00:04:33.819> time<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.270> month

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
yesterday for the first time in a month

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.959 
yesterday for the first time in a month
but<00:04:34.569> I<00:04:34.780> guess<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.379> mean<00:04:36.129> I<00:04:36.159> that's<00:04:36.580> one<00:04:36.759> time

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
but I guess I mean I that's one time

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.179 
but I guess I mean I that's one time
it's<00:04:37.180> not<00:04:37.300> like<00:04:37.629> you're<00:04:38.439> exercising<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:39.039> lose

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:39.189 
it's not like you're exercising you lose

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.580 
it's not like you're exercising you lose
a<00:04:39.219> pound<00:04:39.400> but<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:40.150> am<00:04:40.599> back<00:04:40.750> you're<00:04:40.930> exercising

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
a pound but I am back you're exercising

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.450 
a pound but I am back you're exercising
so<00:04:41.800> that's<00:04:41.949> good<00:04:42.219> hopefully<00:04:44.009> things<00:04:45.009> will<00:04:45.250> be

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
so that's good hopefully things will be

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.159 
so that's good hopefully things will be
good<00:04:45.729> I<00:04:46.150> don't<00:04:46.449> know<00:04:46.539> I<00:04:46.569> don't<00:04:46.659> need<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.870> lose<00:04:47.110> a

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
good I don't know I don't need to lose a

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.869 
good I don't know I don't need to lose a
lot<00:04:47.439> of<00:04:47.469> weight<00:04:47.740> but<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.979> do<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.400> want<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:48.729> lose<00:04:48.849> a
