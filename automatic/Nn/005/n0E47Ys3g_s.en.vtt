if you said go squat that log we would

skeletal system and my muscles together
and<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.540> alignment<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.740> reduces

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and that alignment actually reduces

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.630 
and that alignment actually reduces
energy<00:01:32.850> expenditure
