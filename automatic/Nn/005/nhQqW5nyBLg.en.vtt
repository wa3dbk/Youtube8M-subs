00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.780
 not enough data 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 so they started using team cables 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.040
 for the basic work that the drawing was relaxing 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.130
 but it does not matter now 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130

 and thus to know how much tax had been collected 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.260
 and this whole country that is in doubt 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.240

 energy taxes 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.570
 the world 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.240
 the accident did not cease to be subject to the afternoon 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.270
 they did not believe the Muslim captain already noodles 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 every now and then one of them said to all the others he was driving a slight deviation of 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.570
 money 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.109
 It was the good thing about having a contact 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.899
 to be confused 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:22.359

 the Greeks had invented affirmed 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 it is clear that slave women have to stay at home 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.339
 may the leaders have been allowed to vote 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.609
 the creeds celebrated expressively in five states 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.899
 he got back there with the beauty 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.909
 and create a routine 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.909
 we built a 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 where they represented tragedies 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.769
 I took days 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.409
 the ancient creeds silos or talked about the meaning of life 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.579

 he invaded many countries but chicago had the chance to conquer pain 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 he deserves to have a small mosquito bite 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.249
 ended up with a lot of cases of malaria 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.389
 and died 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.389
 32 years old 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.559
 Greek culture was now the last 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.559
 in Italy it practiced democracy in the Romanesque style 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.559
 meaning that he could buy people's votes 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.009
 live there 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.050

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.800
 it's mine too 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.620
 now it's another 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.129
 I'm a fan of the style, only one 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 they concluded that the meaning of life 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.810
 'all to conquer a fifth if they kill to pay taxes to the sea

 two thousand years ago the emperor of rome was whether the cost 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.909
 he wanted to know exactly how many taxpayers he had 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.150
 so everyone had to go to their homelike looks and contacts 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.440

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.080
 this must have you whose imagination of you to function 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.270
 the question is 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.270
 Who could be the father? 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.289
