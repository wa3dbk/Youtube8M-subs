of the new time line interface Facebook
have<00:02:42.710> made<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.890> lot<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.160> changes<00:02:43.610> recently<00:02:43.790> to

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
have made a lot of changes recently to

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.140 
have made a lot of changes recently to
make<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.630> easier<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.350> users<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.100> control<00:02:46.580> who

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
make it easier for users to control who

make it easier for users to control who
sees<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.720> updates<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.350> they've<00:02:48.470> posted

that's<00:02:49.640> probably<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.270> as<00:02:50.510> well<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.020> think

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
that's probably just as well and I think

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.810 
that's probably just as well and I think
it's<00:02:51.380> clear<00:02:51.620> now<00:02:51.740> why<00:02:52.220> they've<00:02:52.400> done<00:02:52.640> that

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
it's clear now why they've done that

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.790 
it's clear now why they've done that
because<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.780> new<00:02:53.930> time<00:02:54.140> line<00:02:54.320> interface

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
because the new time line interface

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.980 
because the new time line interface
makes<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.340> lot<00:02:55.550> easier<00:02:55.610> for<00:02:56.180> people<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.480> look
