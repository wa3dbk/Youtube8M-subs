00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.660 
great three-point shooter he is a decent
shooter<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.770> now<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.009> means<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
shooter and now this means that the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.639 
shooter and now this means that the
Wizards<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.149> definitely<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.840> take<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
Wizards are definitely going to take a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.420 
Wizards are definitely going to take a
shooting<00:02:02.340> guard<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> drive<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> if

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
shooting guard in the drive so if

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.910 
shooting guard in the drive so if
Bradley<00:02:05.850> bills<00:02:06.060> still<00:02:06.329> there<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.320> number<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
Bradley bills still there at number the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.350 
Bradley bills still there at number the
number<00:02:08.069> three<00:02:08.369> pick<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.789> Wizards<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.149> going

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
number three pick the Wizards are going

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.770 
number three pick the Wizards are going
to<00:02:09.450> take<00:02:09.599> him<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.470> not<00:02:11.190> Harrison<00:02:11.879> Barnes<00:02:11.910> he's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
to take him if not Harrison Barnes he's

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.910 
to take him if not Harrison Barnes he's
a<00:02:12.810> small<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
a small for but the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.089 
a small for but the
probably<00:02:14.220> make<00:02:14.670> them<00:02:14.790> play<00:02:14.910> shooting<00:02:15.270> guard

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
probably make them play shooting guard

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.770 
probably make them play shooting guard
so<00:02:17.099> it'd<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.670> unlikely<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.270> them<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.630> get

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
so it'd be unlikely for them to get

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660 
so it'd be unlikely for them to get
Michael<00:02:19.170> kidd-gilchrist<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:20.160> Thomas

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
Michael kidd-gilchrist or Thomas

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.479 
Michael kidd-gilchrist or Thomas
Robinson<00:02:21.770> even<00:02:22.770> though<00:02:22.890> they're<00:02:23.040> expected<00:02:23.459> to

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
Robinson even though they're expected to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.160 
Robinson even though they're expected to
be<00:02:23.730> better<00:02:24.030> players<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.660> we'll<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.810> need<00:02:25.050> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
be better players so we'll just need a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.490 
be better players so we'll just need a
shooter<00:02:25.530> /<00:02:25.800> score<00:02:26.550> right<00:02:26.819> now<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> expect<00:02:28.319> on<00:02:28.470> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
shooter / score right now so expect on a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.660 
shooter / score right now so expect on a
pig<00:02:28.770> Bradley<00:02:29.220> bill<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:29.819> not<00:02:32.630> Harrison<00:02:33.630> Barnes
