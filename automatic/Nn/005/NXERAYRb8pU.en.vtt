going to wait until he slows down a
little<00:03:45.280> bit<00:03:45.580> then<00:03:45.880> see<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.150> he<00:03:46.240> has<00:03:46.390> gastric

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870

sounds all chicken here right now is his

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.690 
sounds all chicken here right now is his
respiration<00:03:49.750> which<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.380> really<00:03:50.620> clear<00:03:50.920> so

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
respiration which is really clear so

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
respiration which is really clear so
he's<00:03:52.300> fine<00:03:52.600> his<00:03:52.900> lungs<00:03:53.140> are<00:03:53.290> fine
