00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.319 

as<00:03:45.999> funny<00:03:46.599> it's<00:03:47.109> like<00:03:47.290> 14<00:03:47.859> books<00:03:48.159> wired<00:03:49.120> up

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
as funny it's like 14 books wired up

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.050 
as funny it's like 14 books wired up
backwards<00:03:49.599> to<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.170> whole<00:03:50.409> reason<00:03:53.700> 13.3<00:03:54.700> wired
