00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
knocking him off the cliff and thus

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.900 
knocking him off the cliff and thus
gaining<00:00:09.179> access<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:10.160> the<00:00:11.160> extra<00:00:11.610> hidden

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
gaining access to the extra hidden

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.730 
gaining access to the extra hidden
chests<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.540> basically<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.259> can<00:00:13.410> get<00:00:13.530> an<00:00:13.620> extra

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
chests so basically you can get an extra

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.880 
chests so basically you can get an extra
hidden<00:00:14.130> chest<00:00:14.460> if<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:15.500> can<00:00:16.500> defeat<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
hidden chest if you can defeat the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.740 
hidden chest if you can defeat the
Templar<00:00:17.279> without<00:00:17.670> him<00:00:17.910> teleporting<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
Templar without him teleporting now the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.980 
Templar without him teleporting now the
legitimate<00:00:19.350> way<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.949> is

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
legitimate way to do this is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.300 
legitimate way to do this is
significantly<00:00:21.990> different<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.100> also

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
significantly different but this is also

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.849 
significantly different but this is also
a<00:00:23.490> way<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> by<00:00:25.050> knocking<00:00:25.470> him<00:00:25.560> off<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
a way to do it by knocking him off the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.870 
a way to do it by knocking him off the
cliff<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.930> early<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> video<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:29.310> end<00:00:29.760> up

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
cliff so early on in the video I end up

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.020 
cliff so early on in the video I end up
jumping<00:00:30.510> down<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.349> where<00:00:31.500> he<00:00:31.619> spawns

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
jumping down right to where he spawns

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.479 
jumping down right to where he spawns
which<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.210> kind<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.510> stupid<00:00:34.280> because<00:00:35.280> he

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
which was kind of stupid because he

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
which was kind of stupid because he
kills<00:00:35.730> me<00:00:35.910> immediately<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.469> gives<00:00:37.620> me<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
kills me immediately but it gives me a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.119 
kills me immediately but it gives me a
good<00:00:38.070> view<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.700> Templar<00:00:39.450> being<00:00:39.780> pushed<00:00:40.260> by<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
good view on Templar being pushed by a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.860 
good view on Templar being pushed by a
grenade<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> way<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.600> by

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
grenade now the way to do this is by

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.160

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.620 
back that the Warlock grenade was there
and<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.610> my<00:01:56.640> Titan<00:01:57.180> grenade<00:01:57.479> was

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and you can see my Titan grenade was

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.550 
and you can see my Titan grenade was
there<00:01:58.820> they've<00:01:59.820> claimed<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.170> shooting

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
there they've claimed that shooting

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.740 
there they've claimed that shooting
rockets<00:02:02.009> will<00:02:02.219> also<00:02:02.700> possibly<00:02:03.329> send<00:02:03.600> them

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
rockets will also possibly send them

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.560 
rockets will also possibly send them
backwards<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.399> not<00:02:05.640> confirmed<00:02:06.119> what

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
backwards but that's not confirmed what

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109 
backwards but that's not confirmed what
is<00:02:06.689> confirmed<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.380> grenades<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:08.970> you'll

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
is confirmed is grenades so what you'll

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
is confirmed is grenades so what you'll
do<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.450> you'll<00:02:09.479> keep<00:02:09.780> throwing<00:02:10.170> grenades<00:02:10.349> at

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
do is you'll keep throwing grenades at

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.100 
do is you'll keep throwing grenades at
them<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.540> here<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.810> when<00:02:13.020> he

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
them and I think right here is when he

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.699 
them and I think right here is when he
gets<00:02:13.200> knocked<00:02:13.470> off<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.860> cliff<00:02:15.530> you'll<00:02:16.530> see

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
gets knocked off the cliff you'll see

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.710
