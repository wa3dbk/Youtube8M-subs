yard<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.869> subdue

it is the lever is on a timer on a
thirty<00:06:48.280> second<00:06:48.850> let's<00:06:49.030> feel<00:06:49.210> it<00:06:49.240> feels<00:06:49.600> like<00:06:49.690> a

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
fairy second time remember it's a bit

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.370 
fairy second time remember it's a bit
shorter<00:06:51.370> maybe<00:06:51.550> like<00:06:51.790> 20<00:06:52.270> or<00:06:52.419> 15<00:06:52.780> seconds<00:06:53.229> so

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
shorter maybe like 20 or 15 seconds so

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.800 
shorter maybe like 20 or 15 seconds so
as<00:06:53.770> soon<00:06:53.889> as<00:06:54.040> he<00:06:54.130> gets<00:06:54.310> that<00:06:54.520> close<00:06:54.850> pull<00:06:55.690> the
