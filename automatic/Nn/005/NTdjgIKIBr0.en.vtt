hi this is Susan Nixon was so quick and
easy<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.270> today<00:00:03.540> we're<00:00:03.689> going<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.870> talk<00:00:04.080> about

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
easy and today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.170 
easy and today we're going to talk about
how<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> balance<00:00:04.890> all<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.580> threads<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.000> your

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
how to balance all the threads on your

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.960 
how to balance all the threads on your
serger<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.350> works<00:00:07.560> like<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> dream<00:00:07.970> every

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
serger so it works like a dream every

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.480 
serger so it works like a dream every
time<00:00:09.469> so<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> first<00:00:10.800> thing<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.309> do

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
time so the first thing you want to do

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.700 
time so the first thing you want to do
when<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.730> get<00:00:11.880> your<00:00:12.090> serger<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.750> tie<00:00:13.500> on

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
when you get your serger is tie on

when you get your serger is tie on
matching<00:00:14.280> colors<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.759> thread<00:00:15.199> come<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
matching colors of thread come up with a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.160 
matching colors of thread come up with a
map<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.369> shows<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.180> where<00:00:18.420> your<00:00:18.570> two<00:00:18.810> needle

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
map that shows you where your two needle

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.650 
map that shows you where your two needle
threads<00:00:19.470> should<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.859> set<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.510> your<00:00:21.510> two

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
threads should be set and your two

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750 
threads should be set and your two
looper<00:00:22.080> thread<00:00:22.109> should<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.830> set<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.279> there

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
looper thread should be set on there

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.060 
looper thread should be set on there
tension<00:00:24.240> dials<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> first<00:00:25.560> two<00:00:25.800> threads

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
tension dials so the first two threads

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.519 
tension dials so the first two threads
you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.849> called<00:00:27.119> looper<00:00:27.810> threads<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
you have are called looper threads and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.230 
you have are called looper threads and
these<00:00:28.769> wrap<00:00:29.099> around<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> edge<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> fabric

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
these wrap around the edge of the fabric

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.330 
these wrap around the edge of the fabric
to<00:00:30.570> keep<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.929> from<00:00:31.140> fraying<00:00:31.410> ones<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to keep it from fraying ones on the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.180 
to keep it from fraying ones on the
bottom<00:00:32.460> ones<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> top<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.950> these<00:00:34.950> are

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
bottom ones on the top and these are

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.459 
bottom ones on the top and these are
your<00:00:35.309> two<00:00:35.520> needle<00:00:35.940> threads<00:00:36.270> which<00:00:36.570> give<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
your two needle threads which give you a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.750 
your two needle threads which give you a
double<00:00:37.980> row<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> stitching<00:00:38.850> along<00:00:39.120> each<00:00:39.870> seam

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
double row of stitching along each seam

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.920 
double row of stitching along each seam
we<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> make<00:00:42.210> sure<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
we want to make sure that you have a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.760 
we want to make sure that you have a
balanced<00:00:43.410> tension<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.420> serger<00:00:45.870> stitch<00:00:46.140> so

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
balanced tension on the serger stitch so

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.319 
balanced tension on the serger stitch so
what<00:00:47.010> we're<00:00:47.129> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> figure<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
what we're going to do is figure out the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.990 
what we're going to do is figure out the
best<00:00:48.600> setting<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> first<00:00:50.219> thread<00:00:50.700> which

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
best setting for the first thread which

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360 
best setting for the first thread which
is<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.420> needle<00:00:51.629> thread<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.710> we'll<00:00:52.949> do

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
is the needle thread and then we'll do

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.850 
is the needle thread and then we'll do
the<00:00:53.579> same<00:00:53.910> process<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.930> each<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.590> threads

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the same process for each of the threads

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.549 
the same process for each of the threads
both<00:00:56.280> needles<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.969> both<00:00:57.210> loopers<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> you'll

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
both needles and both loopers and you'll

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.920 
both needles and both loopers and you'll
see<00:00:58.770> exactly<00:00:59.280> where<00:00:59.879> each<00:01:00.059> setting<00:01:00.510> needs<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
see exactly where each setting needs to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.130 
see exactly where each setting needs to
be<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.190> we'll<00:01:02.340> start<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.910> I've<00:01:03.270> made

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
be so what we'll start with I've made

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
be so what we'll start with I've made
myself<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.650> paper<00:01:04.890> pattern<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.850> five

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and I'm just going to draw those lines

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.039 
and I'm just going to draw those lines
all<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> way<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.420> know<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.659> goes<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
all the way down I know this goes up to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
all the way down I know this goes up to
nine<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.920> I'm<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.250> transfer<00:02:00.030> these

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
nine so I'm going to transfer these

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.730 
nine so I'm going to transfer these
numbers<00:02:01.020> onto<00:02:01.909> my<00:02:02.909> strip<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.360> fabric

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
numbers onto my strip of fabric

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.240 
numbers onto my strip of fabric
eight<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.930> nine<00:02:06.930> now<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.649> want<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> identify

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
eight and nine now I want to identify

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.729 
eight and nine now I want to identify
each<00:02:08.789> strip<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.989> call<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.470> an

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
each strip so I'm going to call this an

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.410 
each strip so I'm going to call this an
upper<00:02:11.250> looper<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.260> look<00:02:13.440> at<00:02:13.560> my<00:02:13.739> serger

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
upper looper and if I look at my serger

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.240 
upper looper and if I look at my serger
the<00:02:15.420> color<00:02:15.720> coding<00:02:16.170> for<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.440> upper<00:02:16.709> looper<00:02:17.069> is

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the color coding for the upper looper is

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.120 
the color coding for the upper looper is
pink<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:19.200> means<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.680> pink<00:02:19.920> thread

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
pink and that means the pink thread

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.360 
pink and that means the pink thread
should<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.760> running<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.500> top<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.680> my<00:02:22.830> fabric

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
should be running on top of my fabric

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.809 
should be running on top of my fabric
when<00:02:23.849> we<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.269> serger<00:02:24.660> chain<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:26.610> we're

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
when we do the serger chain so now we're

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.309 
when we do the serger chain so now we're
going<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.000> use<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.510> strip<00:02:27.900> we're<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
going to use this strip we're going to

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.890 
going to use this strip we're going to
feed<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> through<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:29.069> serger<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.900> change

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
feed it through the serger and change

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.500 
feed it through the serger and change
the<00:02:31.200> dial<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.890> match<00:02:32.069> each<00:02:32.459> number<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.239> find

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the dial to match each number so we find

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.350 
the dial to match each number so we find
the<00:02:33.660> perfect<00:02:34.050> setting<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:36.060> I'm<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.300> to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
the perfect setting so I'm going to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.559 
the perfect setting so I'm going to
surge<00:02:36.569> on

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.660 

and<00:02:39.659> when<00:02:40.260> my<00:02:40.409> needles<00:02:40.769> hit<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.189> blue<00:02:41.400> line

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
and when my needles hit the blue line

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.030 
and when my needles hit the blue line
now<00:02:41.939> I'm<00:02:42.180> going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.450> dial<00:02:42.719> the<00:02:43.469> number<00:02:43.799> one

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
now I'm going to dial the number one

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.140 
now I'm going to dial the number one
just<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:44.819> on<00:02:44.969> my<00:02:45.120> fabric<00:02:46.730> then<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.909> says<00:02:48.120> to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
just like on my fabric then it says to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.350 
just like on my fabric then it says to
go<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> two

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
go to two

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.970 
go to two
so<00:02:50.990> I<00:02:51.290> want<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.650> dial<00:02:51.890> three<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:54.260> tell<00:02:54.830> my

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
so I want to dial three and tell my

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.780 
so I want to dial three and tell my
needles<00:02:55.630> are<00:02:56.630> even<00:02:57.050> with<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.350> line<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:58.040> feel

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
needles are even with that line I feel

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.810 
needles are even with that line I feel
like<00:02:58.940> getting<00:02:59.030> tighter<00:02:59.510> than<00:02:59.900> seven<00:03:06.820> now

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
like getting tighter than seven now

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.820 
like getting tighter than seven now
let's<00:03:08.090> take<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> look<00:03:08.660> remember<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.710> our

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
let's take a look remember this is our

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.120 
let's take a look remember this is our
upper<00:03:10.220> looper<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.030> we<00:03:11.150> want<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.480> see<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.780> pink

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
upper looper so we want to see the pink

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.740 
upper looper so we want to see the pink
but<00:03:13.130> we<00:03:13.280> want<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.760> go<00:03:13.910> right<00:03:14.180> to<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.450> edge

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
but we want it to go right to the edge

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.070 
but we want it to go right to the edge
so<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> little<00:03:15.770> bit<00:03:15.890> too<00:03:16.100> loose<00:03:16.370> so

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
so this is a little bit too loose so

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.540 
so this is a little bit too loose so
let's<00:03:18.080> come<00:03:18.290> back<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:18.800> side<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.310> find

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
let's come back to this side and find

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.600 
let's come back to this side and find
out<00:03:19.700> where<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.000> pink<00:03:20.390> right<00:03:20.990> here<00:03:21.020> is<00:03:21.610> right

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
out where that pink right here is right

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.130 
out where that pink right here is right
on<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.880> very<00:03:23.060> edge<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.580> three<00:03:25.580> is<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.720> perfect

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
on the very edge so three is the perfect

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.220 
on the very edge so three is the perfect
place<00:03:27.380> for<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.860> tension<00:03:28.100> dial<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.730> be<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:33.080> I've

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
place for the tension dial to be so I've

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.070 
place for the tension dial to be so I've
taken<00:03:33.530> all<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:33.950> my<00:03:34.490> tension<00:03:35.000> strips<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:35.780> put

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
taken all of my tension strips and put

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.230 
taken all of my tension strips and put
them<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.380> file<00:03:36.590> folder<00:03:36.890> with<00:03:37.730> my<00:03:37.940> left

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
them in a file folder with my left

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.130 
them in a file folder with my left
needle<00:03:38.770> right<00:03:39.770> needle<00:03:40.630> upper<00:03:41.630> looper<00:03:41.990> which

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
needle right needle upper looper which

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.530 
needle right needle upper looper which
is<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.440> top<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.010> lower<00:03:43.670> looper<00:03:44.180> which<00:03:44.360> is<00:03:44.510> a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
is on top and lower looper which is a

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.900 
is on top and lower looper which is a
thread<00:03:44.870> on<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.110> bottom<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:46.220> way<00:03:46.550> if<00:03:46.700> I'm

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
thread on the bottom that way if I'm

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.780 
thread on the bottom that way if I'm
surging<00:03:47.510> along<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.200> my<00:03:48.800> thread<00:03:49.100> looks<00:03:49.370> great

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
surging along and my thread looks great

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.750 
surging along and my thread looks great
and<00:03:50.150> all<00:03:50.600> of<00:03:50.990> a<00:03:51.080> sudden<00:03:51.620> I've<00:03:51.920> lost<00:03:52.430> that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
and all of a sudden I've lost that

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.960 
and all of a sudden I've lost that
thread<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:53.830> my<00:03:54.830> stitch<00:03:55.160> isn't<00:03:55.519> balanced

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
thread and my stitch isn't balanced

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.750 
thread and my stitch isn't balanced
anymore<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.720> know<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:58.250> if<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.459> looks<00:03:58.670> like

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
anymore I know that if it looks like

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.120 
anymore I know that if it looks like
this<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.510> need<00:03:59.840> to<00:03:59.959> look<00:04:00.110> up<00:04:00.230> my<00:04:00.380> upper<00:04:00.709> looper

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
this I need to look up my upper looper

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.490 
this I need to look up my upper looper
and<00:04:01.280> bring<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.269> back<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.959> make<00:04:03.019> sure<00:04:03.230> the

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
and bring it back and make sure the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.600 
and bring it back and make sure the
tension<00:04:03.920> dial<00:04:04.070> is<00:04:04.340> on<00:04:04.489> three<00:04:04.940> if<00:04:06.160> your<00:04:07.160> serger

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
tension dial is on three if your serger

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.880 
tension dial is on three if your serger
