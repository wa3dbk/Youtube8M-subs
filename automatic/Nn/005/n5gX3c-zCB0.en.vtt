but then when you look at the real one
you're<00:01:17.310> gonna<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.790> more<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.590> design

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you're gonna see more of that design

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.910 
you're gonna see more of that design
that<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.180> OEM<00:01:21.780> Samsung<00:01:22.590> back

that you would get on the Galaxy s4 so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.010 
that you would get on the Galaxy s4 so
it's<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.580> different<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it's just a little bit different and the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
it's just a little bit different and the
front<00:01:28.979> large<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.610> looks<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> same<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.240> well

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
front large it looks the same as well

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.289 
front large it looks the same as well
the<00:01:30.570> Samsung<00:01:31.079> logo<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.159> pretty<00:01:32.490> strong<00:01:33.030> even

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the Samsung logo is pretty strong even

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.929 
the Samsung logo is pretty strong even
on<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.110> fake<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.610> looks

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
on the fake one and the back looks

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.020 
on the fake one and the back looks
pretty<00:01:36.750> similar<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> between<00:01:38.729> these<00:01:38.970> two

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
pretty similar to so between these two

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.429 
pretty similar to so between these two
is<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:39.659> hard<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> tell<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> difference

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
is pretty hard to tell the difference

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.810 
is pretty hard to tell the difference
which<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.700> fake<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.369> here<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> fake

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
which one is fake and here is the fake

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.260 
which one is fake and here is the fake
one<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.740> glossy<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> front

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
one here glossy and right on the front

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
one here glossy and right on the front
and<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> works<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> same<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
and it works just the same now the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.429 
and it works just the same now the
interior<00:01:51.270> you're<00:01:51.689> gonna<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:52.049> able<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> notice

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439

the<00:01:52.500> difference<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> real<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.610> that's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the difference the real one there that's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.840 
the difference the real one there that's
on<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> galaxy<00:01:54.810> s4<00:01:55.079> right<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.530> has<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.610> more

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
premium material that goes between the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.530 
premium material that goes between the
glass<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:01.140> Galaxy<00:02:01.860> s4<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:03.090> feels

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
glass of your Galaxy s4 and it feels

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.109 
glass of your Galaxy s4 and it feels
just<00:02:03.920> much<00:02:04.920> better<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.549> one's<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
just much better this one's more like a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.320 
just much better this one's more like a
felt<00:02:06.509> material<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:08.009> cloth<00:02:08.429> II<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.179> you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
felt material and it's cloth II if you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.020 
felt material and it's cloth II if you
want<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> automate<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:12.000> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
want to automate like a like a

want to automate like a like a
microfiber<00:02:12.660> clean

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
microfiber clean

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.330 
microfiber clean
cloth<00:02:13.840> compared<00:02:14.409> to<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.709> one<00:02:14.980> where<00:02:15.220> it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
cloth compared to that one where it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.670 
cloth compared to that one where it
feels<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.849> much<00:02:16.330> better<00:02:16.599> now<00:02:17.290> when<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.590> get

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
feels just much better now when you get

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.199 
feels just much better now when you get
to<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.890> colors<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.519> really<00:02:18.909> start<00:02:19.090> to

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
to the colors you can really start to

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.270 
to the colors you can really start to
see<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.480> fakes<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.799> here<00:02:21.010> where<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
see the fakes and see here where the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.000 
see the fakes and see here where the
galaxy<00:02:21.760> s4<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.720> new<00:02:23.049> Roman<00:02:23.590> numerals

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
galaxy s4 is in new Roman numerals

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.539 
galaxy s4 is in new Roman numerals
definitely<00:02:24.970> fake<00:02:25.299> so<00:02:25.930> that's<00:02:26.440> that's<00:02:27.250> you

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
definitely fake so that's that's you

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.330 
definitely fake so that's that's you
should<00:02:27.790> just<00:02:28.120> spot<00:02:28.629> that<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:29.049> away<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
should just spot that right away and the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.210 
should just spot that right away and the
Samsung<00:02:30.819> logo<00:02:31.000> also<00:02:31.840> looks<00:02:32.290> kind<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:32.920> crappy

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
Samsung logo also looks kind of crappy

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.330 
Samsung logo also looks kind of crappy
on<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.060> right<00:02:34.299> one<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.739> can<00:02:35.830> probably

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
on the right one so you can probably

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.740 
on the right one so you can probably
should<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.610> able<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.790> spot<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.209> but<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
should be able to spot that but the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.660 
should be able to spot that but the
internals<00:02:38.349> are<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.680> course<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.160> same<00:02:39.370> here

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
internals are of course the same here

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.670 
internals are of course the same here
where<00:02:39.879> this<00:02:40.060> one's<00:02:40.299> more<00:02:40.540> fiber<00:02:41.170> II<00:02:41.349> and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
where this one's more fiber II and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.270 
where this one's more fiber II and
microfiber<00:02:42.519> cloth<00:02:43.000> ish<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.829> here<00:02:44.829> is<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.129> S

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
microfiber cloth ish and here is the S

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.360 
microfiber cloth ish and here is the S
view<00:02:45.519> cover<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:46.209> white<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.590> fake<00:02:47.860> but<00:02:48.129> you

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
view cover in white that is fake but you

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.940 
view cover in white that is fake but you
can<00:02:48.489> see<00:02:48.579> there's<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.819> Samsung<00:02:49.360> logo<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.989> top<00:02:50.650> of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
can see there's a Samsung logo on top of

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.849 
can see there's a Samsung logo on top of
the<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:52.019> window<00:02:53.019> part<00:02:53.290> which<00:02:53.470> shouldn't<00:02:53.769> be

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
the the window part which shouldn't be

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.190 
the the window part which shouldn't be
there<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:54.609> fake<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.750> if<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.019> don't

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
there so that's fake but if you don't

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.780 
there so that's fake but if you don't
mind<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.620> then<00:02:56.859> it's<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.430> minor

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
mind that then it's just a minor

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.309 
mind that then it's just a minor
inconvenience<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.540> guess<00:02:58.690> or<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:58.930> would<00:02:59.170> never

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
inconvenience I guess or you would never

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.589 
inconvenience I guess or you would never
even<00:02:59.470> known<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.489> one<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.879> right<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.299> more

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
even known the one on the right is more

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.009 
even known the one on the right is more
off-white<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.470> see<00:03:02.709> looks<00:03:02.950> more<00:03:03.160> dirty<00:03:03.489> than

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
off-white you see looks more dirty than

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.190 
off-white you see looks more dirty than
the<00:03:05.019> original<00:03:05.829> and<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.209> open<00:03:07.629> them<00:03:07.810> up<00:03:07.840> on

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
the original and if you open them up on

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.130 
the original and if you open them up on
the<00:03:08.319> inside<00:03:08.730> once<00:03:09.730> again<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.450> material<00:03:11.019> is

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
the inside once again that material is

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.289 
the inside once again that material is
definitely<00:03:11.620> more<00:03:11.859> microfiber<00:03:12.549> cloth<00:03:12.970> ish

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
definitely more microfiber cloth ish

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.380 
definitely more microfiber cloth ish
maybe<00:03:13.810> more<00:03:14.170> furry<00:03:14.500> than<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.250> one<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.700> where

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
maybe more furry than this one is where

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.030 
maybe more furry than this one is where
it's<00:03:16.510> more<00:03:16.660> flat<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.200> more<00:03:17.349> premium<00:03:17.799> feeling

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
it's more flat and more premium feeling

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.210 
it's more flat and more premium feeling
and<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.750> back<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.440> can<00:03:20.709> see<00:03:20.889> that<00:03:21.069> the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
and the back you can see that the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.990 
and the back you can see that the
Samsung<00:03:21.730> logo<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.359> little<00:03:22.840> bit<00:03:23.669> worse<00:03:24.669> on

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
Samsung logo is a little bit worse on

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.789 
Samsung logo is a little bit worse on
there<00:03:25.239> so<00:03:25.599> if<00:03:25.720> you're<00:03:25.870> kind<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.290> looking<00:03:26.440> for

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
there so if you're kind of looking for

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.670 
there so if you're kind of looking for
you<00:03:26.919> can<00:03:27.040> tell<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.609> fake<00:03:28.139> but<00:03:29.139> really<00:03:29.650> I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
you can tell that it's fake but really I

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.440 
you can tell that it's fake but really I
mean<00:03:30.010> they're<00:03:30.790> really<00:03:31.030> not<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.299> different

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
mean they're really not that different

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.440 
mean they're really not that different
now<00:03:31.959> they<00:03:32.169> function<00:03:32.739> exactly<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.609> same<00:03:33.849> so

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
now they function exactly the same so

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.000 
now they function exactly the same so
that's<00:03:34.750> where<00:03:35.019> it's<00:03:35.169> different<00:03:35.410> where<00:03:35.769> some

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
that's where it's different where some

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.379 
that's where it's different where some
of<00:03:36.040> these<00:03:36.250> other<00:03:36.310> cases<00:03:36.760> they<00:03:37.090> might<00:03:37.269> not

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
of these other cases they might not

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.319 
of these other cases they might not
function<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.870> same<00:03:38.169> maybe<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.519> fit<00:03:40.000> might

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
function the same maybe the fit might

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.960 
function the same maybe the fit might
not<00:03:40.569> be<00:03:40.810> as<00:03:40.930> tight<00:03:41.319> on<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:42.010> back<00:03:42.190> I've<00:03:42.489> had<00:03:42.940> a

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
not be as tight on the back I've had a

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.280 
not be as tight on the back I've had a
little<00:03:43.180> bit<00:03:43.419> of<00:03:43.510> trouble<00:03:43.720> with<00:03:43.870> some<00:03:44.079> of<00:03:44.200> these

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
little bit of trouble with some of these

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.680 
little bit of trouble with some of these
putting<00:03:44.859> it<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.459> back<00:03:45.669> cover<00:03:45.910> but<00:03:46.540> that's

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
putting it on the back cover but that's

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.670 
putting it on the back cover but that's
you<00:03:46.840> just<00:03:46.959> have<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.169> push<00:03:47.349> them<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> little

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
you just have to push them a little

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.620 
you just have to push them a little
harder<00:03:48.069> but<00:03:48.310> really<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.970> functionality

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
harder but really the functionality

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.199 
harder but really the functionality
exactly<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.109> same<00:03:50.349> so<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.250> say<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:51.970> it's

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.030 
exactly the same so I say that if it's
thirty<00:03:52.599> or<00:03:52.780> forty<00:03:53.079> dollars<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.620> original

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040
