00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.196
HI! I’m Mathie from PinturaFacilParaTi.com (Esay Painting for You) 

00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:14.186
and today we are going to paint a cover notebook

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:17.416
It is very easy project

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.936
that is inspired

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.596
on many of the teachers who see us

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:26.547
and ask me some project to do with children

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:28.396
quickly

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:31.197
and also for those

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.047
that have a craft business

00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:42.237
Firstly I have separate the different parts of the notebook 

00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:45.767
and prepared the cover as we have shown in our web

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.087
if you have not seen it

00:00:48.087 --> 00:00:49.677
you can find a link at this video description 

00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:52.717
remember our web is translatable

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:56.947
Then we paint a layer of white paint

00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.296
to start working on it

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:05.277
I have not even given a base pair

00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:07.897
because I just want to cover the bottom

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:09.097
that will be cover

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:11.947
painting the background with all the colors

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:13.397
As the idea is to paint 

00:01:13.397 --> 00:01:15.107
some geometric figures

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.457
I will transfer them

00:01:17.457 --> 00:01:21.227
with a ruler

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:24.377
transfer first

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:27.787
all lines horizontal lines

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.817
to do it quicker

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:34.717
then the vertical ones

00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:42.377
So you’ll finish quicker and easier

00:01:42.377 --> 00:01:49.377
and all the design still geometric

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.107
to paint this project

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:01.237
I have prepared a

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:02.076
purple or “lilac love”

00:02:05.286 --> 00:02:07.416
then a lavender

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:08.866
a chewing gum pink

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.696
and a light chewing gum pink

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:14.816
just by adding 

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:16.076
some white

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:20.286
You can find all these color painting recipes in our web

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:24.916
where you can download them

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.786
So now 

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:30.726
just start applying the colors 

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:33.876
in the spaces

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:37.046
with the paintings we already prepared

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:41.316
I already have my sketch for applying each color

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:48.316
that you can find in our web

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:06.056
Continue applying the colors

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:12.456
trying that the same don’t  touch each other 

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:15.426
Don’t worry if you get some stripes in a first time

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.606
in the first layer of paint

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:21.916
they will disappear in the second or third layer

00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:38.606
You can also paint firstly with a liner and then fill with a bigger brush

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:42.736
Now that we have all the cover painted with one layer

00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:53.236
let’s paint as much layers of paint we need to to have a nice cover

00:03:54.236 --> 00:03:58.826
The cover base is ready and I have transferred this design 

00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:02.216
of a little flower (find the mold in our web)

00:04:06.816 --> 00:04:08.356
Now

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:10.716
with silver glitter

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:13.576
I’ll pass over the design

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:15.247
of the flower

00:04:44.087 --> 00:04:48.507
Now will draw over the lines of all the geometric design

00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:52.527
with the silver glitter 

00:05:22.736 --> 00:05:25.406
this is the finished project

00:05:25.406 --> 00:05:30.106
I just finished applying the glitter so it has to dry

00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:33.717
over one or two hours depending of manufacturer's instructions

00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:38.347
to obtain best results

00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:45.916
Then apply some barnish 

00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:48.326
and assembles

00:05:48.326 --> 00:05:49.447
the notebook

00:05:49.447 --> 00:05:51.007
as it was before

00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:55.497
I hope you liked this painting project and

00:05:55.497 --> 00:05:57.257
see you soon in Pintura Facil Para Ti (Easy Painting For You)
