 torpedoed 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.090
 through this transfer hl 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.089
 he probably talks about that, too 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.059
 the director has the crew 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.429
 This also affects the position of captain in Leverkusen 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.640
 presents 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.160
 the Geopark Ries because I think that I have the question so schonmal 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.509
 answer 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.270
 4 for Michael Ballack that's not for sure 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.940
 absurdly important 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.560
 because here at Bayer 04 Leverkusen live the new captain because MÃ¼ller 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.900
 Hermann Simon Rolfes 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.160
 a national player Dr 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.080
 Patti Smith Zell Michelle qualifying for the Weitmars 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.550
 Team has played and percent 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.210
 Simon's processions that our captain and I think it's just in 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.080
 the time castle 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.110
 Although he is back in the build-up training, a reha-training knew relatively well 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.770
 But probably it will take a while 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.390
 are you back on the pitch that is psychologically whole 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.180
 important is that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.740
 our captain stays and say the word 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.870
 the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.400
 it leads for Michael Ballack approx 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.829
 "In no way the 12 while a disadvantage that Bayern 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.860
 He can also introduce himself as a leader 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.859
 especially to wear the captain's armband 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.390
 Michelle is percent against a problem in quotes in 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.830
 Euro starts to play 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.830
 a summer school 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.450
 which is no problem 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.810
 I was lucky about approx 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 f or twelve years each year to play Champions League 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.420
 Percent that was always for me, of course 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.110
 just incredible on preservation and this year, of course, in the West ImmoFlex 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.670
 Level heat 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.330
 In spite of that, the u VOA misplaced shit in the minority competition where 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.760
 many attractive teams Lemmer Lohmar 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.230
 Mainz SID their Liverpool was that the English songs I think 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.409
 for many also to be attractive games again and around 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.510
 that of course for me challenge that has nothing to do with it 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.749
 do that now 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.090
 thanks to a screen lying so the goal is natural 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.690
 then again I also believe for the club and the ZDF of this research 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.489
 folded 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.699
 to come to the Champions League 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.969
 but as we said we offer in the aid and try 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.499
 then, of course, to cut off a feared one optimally 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.279
 ptecs cannabis 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.349
 a passage in Whistler Simon Rolfes returns but is Cheval APA 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.880
 see 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.979
 the captain of the 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.069
 but nothing is decided yet, the last game was Simon 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.989
 Rolfes is the captain and percent and then that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.569
 "The deputy" that is unique in Germany the captain of his I 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.519
 think that 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.999
 Maybe you see something different than active here 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.200
 that is not the case 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.499
 Of course, there was no relevance to lend 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:04.949
 The Michel must first recover well now if he must have made mistakes 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.949
 must integrate into a functioning team 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.449
 regardless of who a world-class player is or not 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.349
 There are the same with the other big clubs 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.469
 and percent I think 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.279
 Percent that this is so weighting and percent 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.259
 Bring surveys 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:28.309
 May not much as before only these are persons with Simon Rolfes 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.129
 my show through the so far the office of the end 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.129
 Captain also filled out perfectly 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.889
 one question to Mr. Ballack she had was speaker hype about her person 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.849
 over it emerged last weeks 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.229
 pm 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.439
 Pinar might be more surprised there, at least, than me, of course 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.599
 and percent 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.599
 he is always nice when you have the process 9 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.679
 St comes to the new club 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:00.529
 the fire show here so that I'm not that new 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.159
 m what you have left behind, believe me and believe in yourself 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.159
 but many close to it because more went out of it 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.449
 I've simply taken the next step may call three 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.029
 excellent years around here 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:15.399
 we have 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.159
 really bad luck in the three years percent 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.430
 That had never been enough for a title 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.319
 m but footballer me 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.090
 when what as I said there on the front via all around 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.979
 before that 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.169
 has his game one time is also possible I think that is still 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.889
 so if I played with one or the other 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.029
 and so you get percent 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:36.809
 as I said with percent 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.489
 Bird right can say that one comes with so many Topcu among the Friends 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.669
 As I said, of course, I'm a big part one 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.889
 Percent was welcome Rome 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.050
 ml makes you feel like a player then fetch 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.610
 But in order to perform well, then do it with authorities 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.810
 It's always very important for you to play football that way 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.949
 been 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.279
 for the players for me clearly under that, of course, I am pleased 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.180
 that 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.420
 the response was so positive 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.960
 the race 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.660
 so the press conference with Michael Ballack on his legs Bayer 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.430
 Leverkusen but had said he will lead on the first match then it's time 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.169
 Orchestra bus against Borussia Dortmund 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.229
 under his crew he said I'm the captain but ultimately 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.930
 decides that the coach and think so everything is said on the subject
