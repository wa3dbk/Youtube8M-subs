00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
stretch to say that there is really

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.609

women that inspired Picasso's works so

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.930 
women that inspired Picasso's works so

Maar<00:02:22.239> from<00:02:22.530> 1937<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:24.040> what<00:02:24.250> makes<00:02:24.459> portrait

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
Maar from 1937 and what makes portrait

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.559 
Maar from 1937 and what makes portrait
of<00:02:25.360> her<00:02:25.510> by<00:02:25.720> Picasso<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.500> masterpiece<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.569> the

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
of her by Picasso a masterpiece is the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.050 
of her by Picasso a masterpiece is the
the<00:02:28.900> painting<00:02:29.349> really<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.160> think<00:02:30.430> represents

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the painting really I think represents

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.770 
the painting really I think represents
her<00:02:31.209> inner<00:02:31.420> energy<00:02:32.019> so<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.560> color<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.220> shape

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
her inner energy so the color the shape

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.599 
her inner energy so the color the shape
it's<00:02:34.780> not<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.470> representation<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.459> what

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
it's not just a representation of what

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.879 
it's not just a representation of what
Picasso<00:02:36.940> was<00:02:37.209> seeing<00:02:37.630> but<00:02:38.139> it's<00:02:38.200> also<00:02:38.470> what<00:02:38.769> he

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
Picasso was seeing but it's also what he

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.610 
Picasso was seeing but it's also what he
was<00:02:39.010> feeling<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.970> her<00:02:40.239> personality<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
was feeling and and her personality and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.140 
was feeling and and her personality and
I<00:02:41.739> think<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.040> one<00:02:42.220> reason<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.609> these

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
I think that's one reason that these

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.599 
I think that's one reason that these
Picasso<00:02:43.720> works<00:02:43.959> many<00:02:44.799> of<00:02:45.010> them<00:02:45.130> still<00:02:45.400> seem

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
Picasso works many of them still seem

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.400 
Picasso works many of them still seem
like<00:02:46.090> they<00:02:46.239> were<00:02:46.329> painted<00:02:46.690> yesterday<00:02:46.930> they're

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410
