00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.539
 this time we are going to show you a house 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:20.380
 spectacular beach where 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.769
 for the staging of the house by 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.929
 the by the topographic issue is 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.179
 located on a rocky hill and good and 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.429
 It is for this reason that the circulation of 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.550
 houses has had to do from a 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.320
 very high part of the hill and it is lowered in 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.979
 elevator did not have logically also 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.920
 stairs a little for him to sit on 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:45.969
 the house because this house is from camila ruiz 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.239
 and Gary Pierce Architects Partner 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:53.140
 I studied and where we go 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.930
 find with a view and ones 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.170
 materials in one way is amazing as well 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.170
 what we give 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.380
 the house is a sequence of terraces if 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.780
 is that we are really in a field 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.990
 where you have a view that is very pretty 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.370
 and almost to the sea and you also have a double 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.680
 view that is also towards the cut of the 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.780
 hill from behind not then it was clear 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 that the whole house had to take advantage of is 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.050
 then really clear if it's a series 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.810
 of a three-volume association 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.190
 staggered where everything pretended to have 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.740
 all environments pretend to have 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.430
 sight towards something either towards the sea or 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.430
 towards the rock 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.080
 one of the advantages I had just 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.940
 this low ground is that it's fine 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.030
 raised with respect to sea â€‹â€‹level 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.630
 we were not at the level of the rock here 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.120
 down then the infinity edge pool 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.220
 the color is dark because the smell here 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.930
 from the sea this is dark then the idea 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.580
 is that from the living room this pool 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.070
 keep open with the sea this is stone 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.870
 slate is slate stone planter is 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.360
 black then the pool has a color 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.310
 dark green and is very much like 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.920
 ardor of teachers when you are in the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.460
 social area of the house this here is 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.460
 start to deviate 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.989
 how to distribute the house the first floor 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.160
 only social second and third floor 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.310
 private 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:43.569
 and in this particular area try to 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:46.870
 do not interrupt the view by then 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.670
 at the time of distributing the room we achieved 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.220
 make all the glasses can be 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.989
 answer there even be here also 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.160
 you can run back on the plate 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.160
 concrete in sight 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.560
 a little bit that the terrace happens to be 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.280
 totally part of this whole area is not 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.870
 the ideal 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.760
 you can take refuge in the room and not 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.760
 feel that you are between a closed room 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:17.010
 to feel inside the activities to 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.010
 continue following in April 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.840
 and we have tried to use rock as a 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.840
 picture in many moments of the house 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.370
 then in that part of here to the bottom 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.320
 of the dining room in know brand by this 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.880
 great picture that in the rock they have 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.690
 elimination from above if you realize 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.690
 in the shadow 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.950
 and me
