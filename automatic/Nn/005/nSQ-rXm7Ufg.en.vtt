gigabytes<00:01:12.180> per<00:01:13.110> second<00:01:13.560> cables<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.520> them

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
gigabytes per second cables one of them

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120 
gigabytes per second cables one of them
is<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> 90<00:01:15.330> degree<00:01:15.420> i<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.920> one

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
is a 90 degree i think it's this one

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.450 
is a 90 degree i think it's this one
right<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.750> right<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.159> stage<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.280> six

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
right here right there stage of six

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
right here right there stage of six
gigabytes<00:01:21.770> two<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> them<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.369> then<00:01:23.460> two<00:01:24.140> three

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
gigabytes two of them and then two three

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
gigabytes two of them and then two three
gigabytes<00:01:25.409> data<00:01:25.830> connect<00:01:26.729> sure<00:01:26.880> there's<00:01:27.150> also

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
gigabytes data connect sure there's also

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.359 
gigabytes data connect sure there's also
one<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.229> 90<00:01:28.650> degree<00:01:30.170> ide<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:32.280> know

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
one with a 90 degree ide I don't know

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
one with a 90 degree ide I don't know
why<00:01:32.490> anybody<00:01:32.729> would<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.299> use<00:01:33.509> ID<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.140> if

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
why anybody would want to use ID but if

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.950 
why anybody would want to use ID but if
you<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.250> comes<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> spot<00:01:36.900> on

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
you are it comes with there is a spot on

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
you are it comes with there is a spot on
the<00:01:37.290> motherboard<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:41.790> do

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the motherboard for it and then you do

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
the motherboard for it and then you do
have<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.350> motherboard<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.329> very<00:01:45.479> careful

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have the motherboard and be very careful

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.270 
have the motherboard and be very careful
because<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.970> am<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.119> carpet<00:01:48.479> right<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:48.810> so

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
because I am on carpet right now so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.800 
because I am on carpet right now so
I'm<00:01:49.400> going<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.880> be<00:01:49.970> very<00:01:50.090> cautious<00:01:50.360> when<00:01:50.750> I

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810

okay so here you guys can see it's where
the<00:02:13.810> m3<00:02:14.810> chips<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.230> goes<00:02:15.470> in<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
the m3 chips that goes in the the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.809 
the m3 chips that goes in the the
processor<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.700> got<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:19.879> little<00:02:21.489> lever<00:02:22.489> thing

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
processor you got a little lever thing

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.729 
processor you got a little lever thing
that<00:02:23.209> unlocks<00:02:23.629> I've<00:02:23.840> been<00:02:23.930> locked<00:02:24.110> him<00:02:26.739> yeah

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.470 

you<00:03:46.910> got<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.510> these<00:03:48.230> two<00:03:48.500> right<00:03:48.739> here<00:03:49.299> this<00:03:50.299> one

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
you got to these two right here this one

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.120 
you got to these two right here this one
runs<00:03:50.660> at<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.319> is<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.970> PCIe<00:03:52.970> x16<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.889> point

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
runs at it this is the PCIe x16 to point

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.210 
runs at it this is the PCIe x16 to point
out<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.090> got<00:03:56.290> one<00:03:57.290> here<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.650> then<00:03:57.829> if<00:03:58.069> you

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
out so you got one here and then if you

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.059 
out so you got one here and then if you
run<00:03:58.430> both<00:03:58.700> in<00:03:58.910> crossfire<00:03:59.389> this<00:04:00.230> comes<00:04:00.650> with<00:04:00.919> a

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
run both in crossfire this comes with a

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.050 
run both in crossfire this comes with a
this<00:04:04.069> comes<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:04.730> at<00:04:05.239> times<00:04:05.989> for<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.910> got<00:04:08.030> a

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
this comes in at times for you got a

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.990 
this comes in at times for you got a
PCIe<00:04:08.810> express-times<00:04:09.650> for<00:04:10.220> as<00:04:10.310> well<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:10.849> then

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
PCIe express-times for as well and then

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.509
