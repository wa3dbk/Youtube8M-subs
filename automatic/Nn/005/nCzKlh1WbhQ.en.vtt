00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and I know him a few days late on this

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.709 
and I know him a few days late on this
video<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.430> um<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.480> came

video and that is because um this came

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.720 
video and that is because um this came
so<00:00:36.989> quick<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.559> wanted<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> give<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> some<00:00:38.520> time

but I figured I'd still put out the
video<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> let<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.710> guys<00:00:40.800> know<00:00:41.300> anyways<00:00:42.300> this

why it came out so quick because there

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.229
