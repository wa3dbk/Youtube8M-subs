 learn in difficult we live time 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.630
 wherever you spit and in games alone givat her 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.300
 shepard and silent killers cordons 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.760
 freeman and alcoholics self-destruct max 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.730
 payne and and other eastern european 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.570
 Gopnik like Niko Belich and they all 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.820
 solid pancake assassins everywhere blood violence 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.769
 and cruelty lawlessness and other 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.840
 indecency 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.480
 that's all I thought to 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.030
 recently here be my potential 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.460
 child in order for him to really 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.470
 It was worth playing before the market for children's games 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.690
 now it's not that empty but everyone 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.619
 quests about faechek and other low 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:10.990
 horrors too 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:13.210
 but rather of the seas was one of gloom has 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.040
 one small desk that can 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.500
 do quite a kid's games 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.020
 so cool so competent 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.750
 amazing stylize what's with this 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.119
 even adults like to play with pleasure 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.750
 guessed already many are talking about media 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.060
 molecule 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.100
 and their little big planet series which 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 was by the way one of the reasons to choose 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.509
 it is playstation among consoles 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.640
 current generation so now decently 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.170
 long ago the announcement of their new game 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.539
 worms called 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.850
 and on this occasion I hurry to you with 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.009
 preview materialchik am telling about 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.320
 this is already very promising 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.380
 thing to compare degrees 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.909
 expectations i will even give an example that's how i 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.829
 waiting on playstation 3 and zombies you 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.799
 chewing on a flipper from you and a movie 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.780
 customer- like sauce the same way i don't 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.219
 can wait for tearaway for 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.799
 playstation vita 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.079
 why on the one hand this question 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.679
 You can answer shortly but this is media 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.770
 molecule 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.080
 that is, you know what the chip for the last 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.480
 you are not the least waiting for everyone 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.330
 the reason is that the guys from the dogi are already 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.550
 They have developed their own in the new master's handwriting and 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.459
 now work in a clear direction 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.180
 which many like the same story with 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.870
 quantic dream 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.870
 and this situation is washing and you are not an exception 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.870
 both parts of little big planet and versions 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.300
 Witta games are 1 cool arcade game with 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.390
 which is very difficult to compete 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.760
 they are insanely cute delightfully beautiful 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.940
 wildly stylish with lots of interesting 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.040
 finds and in general here is the same garbage me 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.450
 is now expected and washes in 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.120
 sense what the game will look like 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.220
 wonderful in this i don't doubt and 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.530
 I do not recommend this because 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.450
 that the on-screen video in my ability 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.730
 dispel all the most skeptical and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.100
 moods on that score and play this 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.990
 since we will not have 3 oven man 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.750
 and you can even choose paper 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.820
 boy or girl really rich 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.530
 or at least some customization which 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.660
 so famous little big series games 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.830
 planet is not here at least about 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.170
 nobody stuttered about it 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.660
 actually like about the level editor on 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.570
 question about which developers are answering 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.880
 highly evasive and even plot so far 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.010
 shrouded in mystery at the moment 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.290
 only one thing can be reliably said 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.080
 throughout the game we will deal 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.390
 delivery of a certain address addressed 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.130
 to the player and for each she promises to be 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.860
 unique 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.540
 it only remains to find out how much 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.489
 In general, the whole world is stylized for the first time 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.070
 applications and as if glued from 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.340
 pieces of colored paper correct 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.410
 me if i'm wrong but it looks like 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.510
 delightfully i want to run now 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.610
 local grass gameplay 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.709
 By the way, the platform will remain on the arcade 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.140
 the truth of the pseudo 3d will move 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.489
 finally in full well that is 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.830
 Now you can move not only 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.610
 back forward and right left but also 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.820
 farther closer 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.010
 plus jumping however you wo n't be bored 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.900
 media molecule back in little big planet 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.670
 came up with a thousand and one unusual 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.489
 way to use seemingly 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.770
 banal gamepad and here before us 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.260
 view and which has a front screen 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.590
 sensory and behind hefty sensory 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.230
 panel 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.360
 plus this microphone is two cameras 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.190
 gyroscope and this is me for sure 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.810
 forgot anything in general 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.760
 interact with the world shooting it 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.740
 players happen to a huge amount 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.870
 ways starting to blow in 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.270
 microphone and so poke your finger in 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.700
 gaming reality and finishing selection 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.800
 textures for some local inhabitants 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.780
 soundtrack after watching trailers and 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.550
 gameplay cuts suspicion of callas 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.310
 Nastya’s tour didn’t call 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.510
 on the contrary music is a great choice and 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.480
 emotional to horror 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.520
 already twist-twirl and flame shorter if 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.100
 summarize everything i think stretched to her 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.570
 it turns out that this is one of the main 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.160
 portable exclusives for baby 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.840
 are visible 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.880
 firstly because epic triple 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.670
 switching which many now 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.350
 consider those the most important 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.410
 exclusives for whit on small 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.120
 little screen is not particularly epic and looks 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.460
 anyway and place them on a large 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.320
 home consoles and secondly because 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.660
 currently only media molecule 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.580
 can make every button work 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.220
 and each sensor film benefits the game. 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.650
 so that it does not look pulled over 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.320
 Ears before this could only 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.390
 ancharted golden abyss 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.460
 somewhere in 2013 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.850
 the truth is not quite clear yet when 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.660
 specifically and here on this I probably 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.240
 everything 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:44.200
 play good good games and be 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:46.150
 bowl bowl myth soundtrack after watching 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.710
 trailers and im captive cuts I'm somewhere 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.000
 I hurry in general it is not clear why I like 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.320
 as if the announcer of the damn news 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.850
 which can't shut up and 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.850
 quietly says also demanded
