00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.969
 Hello everyone, everyone is very welcome. 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.850
 plus this tutorial 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:13.099
 My name is jabá silva and this time I go 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.860
 do an aircraft tutorial a lot 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.960
 and for long-haul flights 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.759
 those who like to flights 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.529
 transcontinental aircraft is perfect is 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.169
 You're right, I'm not a real pilot. 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.349
 so any procedure I 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.300
 said or came to do on that aircraft and 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.920
 already advance disc already advances my 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.200
 I'm sorry, beauty. 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.630
 so we were there at level 767 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.130
 300 is an aircraft that you can 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.960
 out of sao paulo to europe always sá 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.620
 fueling demands back until I was 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.400
 doing a 'tour' in the era to get him calls 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.950
 tur Avai and we take the first leg 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:04.159
 flight from guarulhos to lá los angeles 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.960
 were 12 hours of flight duration and 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.920
 I got there, still plenty left. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.979
 fuel 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.380
 So, folks, let's go there as usual. 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.240
 my methodology I will try to pass from 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.929
 a very quiet way 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.280
 For you, my knowledge is not me. 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.880
 real pilot 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.460
 so come on, I'll share this video 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.429
 also in three parts is not the first as 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.979
 always presenting the aircraft itself and 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:37.249
 in the second part of the 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.030
 euronadel defeat schedule and 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:43.969
 third flight and the beauty landing I chose 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.679
 for this tutorial is to make a 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:56.649
 confines savior is and let's go to a f10 né 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:59.779
 In the first f9 we go here to 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.409
 aircraft 3d cockpit apologize to 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:05.810
 it by believers that the 3d cockpit 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.700
 I quite like to have anything here to 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.099
 make long flights right 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.810
 depending on my scale was in 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.360
 aziz pub robbery 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.180
 long great airport also personal 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.040
 You do not want to land on 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.170
 dumont saints with this aircraft that does not 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.480
 It may have to land but I can paste it. 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.130
 I do not think so 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.890
 so you have to stay there 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.640
 airport that includes this type of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.620
 aircraft 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.650
 our main screen that we will 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.450
 to use more that exists by typing in 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.430
 2010 will come to that screen beauty then 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.860
 the staff here she is 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.110
 totally off we will 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:52.970
 do to leave it that way we 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:58.099
 let's come here in add ons level of homs 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.410
 and here we go cost is preference 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.840
 Let's leave it that way, here I go. 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.690
 leave a little bit for you to see right? 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.370
 You leave as is mine here if you 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.470
 want to make some other changes 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.200
 that I'm going to model what I 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.760
 I let beauty 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:22.510
 Let's go back here in add ons. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.510
 néné instructor thus leaves also 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:36.500
 beauty returns who is god right? 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.720
 and 767 specific and personal care is 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.709
 to let him go before he left 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.739
 We will define some of these 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.750
 things that will define default 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.940
 right panel 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.930
 and you're going to choose to pull out the mold 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.780
 flight park to seaton né for her always 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.700
 that you started with this aircraft 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.640
 get totally off you 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.190
 select here or select as 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.599
 the fall is coke 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.870
 and now you see here it matters to import 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:16.549
 the panel is also of flight mold 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:21.799
 package act and import leaves marked here 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:26.870
 as is pay attention and let's ok 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:29.060
 here the staff that defines the failures that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.760
 may occur on the aircraft and I do not 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.870
 I left nothing because in this tutorial too 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.810
 shows or is the transient egg fs of the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.070
 simulates passengers on the aircraft and he 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.970
 if it only sometimes occurs from failure in the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.400
 aircraft 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.750
 then beauty aircraft set here 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.900
 Do not schedule us here, folks. 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.800
 we will access practically the whole of 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.300
 aircraft 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.700
 in this first one here it is over head nettheim 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.190
 the electrical and hydraulic parts of 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.820
 Lights these things I'll explain more 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:12.169
 notary request in class 2 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.020
 ps this is just the right levers to rise in 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:19.639
 fuel control is nun 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:23.450
 dynamic flacso radio system and here 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.490
 our heel of achilles the fmc 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:30.080
 but who watched the previous videos 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:33.830
 mine and especially the 737 300 and I did 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:38.780
 is very similar with some changes 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.810
 some different things beauty is that 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.920
 we will use some of the here 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.180
 highlights 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.820
 here are those from landing to kilos of the cabin 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.010
 strobo this here we'll explain more 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.310
 in part 2 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.100
 I also like to present the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.210
 programs I 'm using in simulator 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:05.090
 rex fs commander will thus command is 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.520
 that we will see our routes is the 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.680
 cantazini this is a personal one 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.480
 program that you can download in the 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.030
 internet that he does 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.170
 Who I do not use them, I already downloaded it 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.350
 you can see that they can be calculated 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.620
 fuel for example will make a goal 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.500
 from guarulhos to los angeles if you do not know 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.910
 how much fuel will use just 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.530
 you go throw the team information 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:36.710
 shows and in the future but the flash command 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.810
 has this function and the passengers fs 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.970
 also have this option when you 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.000
 buys this aircraft it comes with a 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.620
 configurator né 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.810
 You leave her here the way you do. 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.690
 I wish I left it that way here 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.420
 It's because there in the one I showed 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.930
 just now at the core matter 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.730
 panel has dark and you can do 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.590
 some settings this here too 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:05.480
 basically in the fss jerel I modify there 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:09.340
 beauty, this is it, people first 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:14.540
 This is the video lesson. 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:18.350
 outside the aircraft only from the confines of the gate 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.600
 have 2010 I'm not mistaken, this is the 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:24.710
 haiti scenery with beautiful confines 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.110
 horizon and let's go to the savior remembering 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.200
 that the use also for the better 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:34.880
 scenarios there beyond rex the use of fsb 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.830
 global 2010 best the earth 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.740
 textures of the mountains so that're 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.110
 a cool chart not only needs 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.980
 reacquire 11 a computer a little 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.800
 more powerful to take this 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.470
 frames I realize that when I go no 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.820
 I want it so much if I did not love it. 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.900
 very different I think it's because 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:08:00.470
 cause of cantá zi the personal beauty 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:05.169
 You there in Part 2 I hope you have 

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.169
 I like it, and that's it
