00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
any further let's bring it crashhopper

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.160 
any further let's bring it crashhopper
the<00:01:04.589> sound<00:01:05.039> alien<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.719> can<00:01:06.869> see

can<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.189> how<00:01:14.729> scaled-down<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:16.109> newer

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
can see how how scaled-down this newer

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.649 
can see how how scaled-down this newer
figure<00:01:16.829> is<00:01:17.130> compared<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.969> one<00:01:18.149> we'll

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
figure is compared to that one we'll

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
figure is compared to that one we'll
take<00:01:18.960> these<00:01:19.109> sound<00:01:19.500> alien<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.130> white<00:01:20.340> and

take these sound alien or white and
let's<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.630> firstly<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.649> the

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
let's have a look firstly at the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
can see this one does flex a lot it's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.039 
can see this one does flex a lot it's
very<00:01:27.990> flexible<00:01:28.609> so<00:01:29.609> it's<00:01:30.060> quite<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> robbery<00:01:30.840> in
