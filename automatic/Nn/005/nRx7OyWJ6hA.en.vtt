00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello my friends and sincerely 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.170
 Welcome back last 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 Farming simulator 2013 something like that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 already beautiful is part and we have 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.150
 the daf xf 105 I think so exactly the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.039
 daf xf 105 in the class 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.080
 that's exactly why 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 namely you before 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 These daf xf are only there 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.020
 like sand on the sea meanwhile as 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.090
 But I have to stop this skin 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 absolutely ingenious I have to tell you all 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.480
 I like it very well, too 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.610
 really cool animals with purely fit 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.250
 so join in agriculture 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.199
 yes that just looks right 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.809
 really sensational you have to 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.340
 just say so beautiful 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.890
 chromed rims had built on it 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.559
 By the way, the mottos of the jakob 89 rod 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.649
 for this first time for this great skin 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.460
 and yes, what else to say you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.549
 Look at the moment you have to scratch in now 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.549
 neck 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.299
 I'm sorry, I have a cold 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.860
 yes, of course, towards the end of the holiday 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.530
 the cold comes is very clear 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 but better as in the middle of the holiday so 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.070
 what has the motto nice gift for us 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.850
 and a lot of chrome what's up 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.920
 gaza cool find such trucks then yes 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 even the detail is the texture that is 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.520
 all so that definitely fits the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 mature that all looks great here 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.290
 behind the loading area and here too 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.540
 zugseil or what does that mean to me 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.040
 the trailer just this this bowl 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 no idea how it works out yes 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.409
 really cool you the chemical that is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.509
 yes for the air pressure brakes and yes 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.250
 everything looks very nice you have to 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.689
 really both say so in front 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.340
 I also like receivers very well 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.110
 even with these lamps still in it 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 also the front headlights that look like that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.280
 a little bit clear glass also very much 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.780
 nice up here right now I still have to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.259
 I'll just take a quick look 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.259
 noticed 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.470
 so yes the headlights just everything 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.630
 in the beautiful green as glass 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.360
 is also and here is one right 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.410
 beautiful combine on it well the bid 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.390
 the texture is a bit now 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.450
 pixelated by the combine but watt 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.530
 rms tell me some as a rule is the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.000
 from the far and that looks right 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.490
 good looking so we look at the good 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.690
 piece again from the 1 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.640
 you simply alight even a here comes 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.190
 a small soot cloud jander is from it 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.930
 always very beautiful so yes that 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.750
 cockpit is rather clear rather 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.820
 Spartan is not held now 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.140
 quite my taste if I'm honest 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.780
 because i do not know what the texture 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.490
 to represent over there because here is 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.170
 the amazon principle a bit 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.600
 as with leather and then here 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.880
 over there no idea how to stop 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.680
 had five children in the truck and they have 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.600
 Have a break for a while so that 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.160
 Definitely not from the decks gate 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.540
 so beautiful 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.720
 also all these curtains and curtains 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.780
 So here that looks good here 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.090
 at grandma's on the kitchen table who cares 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.950
 like the parking brake up here 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.010
 to the left of the radio this does not last 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.800
 so beautiful and also generally that too 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.780
 mobile and so is a bit 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.430
 You just have to be spartan 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.620
 the doors just say over here as well 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.330
 well prefer motto now still a 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.459
 should also take a little longer time 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.920
 not too strong up here 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.180
 Relatively lived out mirror has unfortunately 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.790
 Unfortunately, unfortunately nothing in it 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.500
 that's a pity, and we're shooting 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.269
 now just a round with the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.430
 good piece can continue namely 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.280
 Also, in my opinion, it was a good idea 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.880
 Already driving a steering wheel turns 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.440
 of course with 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.410
 Let's see how fast the good 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.230
 piece contract up to 80 or just 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.850
 80 Now it's down to 60 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.670
 So it's me at the time 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.519
 test drive noticed that the good 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.040
 piece very beautiful very beautiful whole 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:03.860
 nice km / h fluctuations in it thus has 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.730
 always drive back 60 70 he comes too 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.250
 Not 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.440
 again on 65 now and again 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.489
 at 80 now we were too found 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.450
 It fits almost 85 experiences very much 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.709
 supple 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.959
 I personally always think so 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.030
 advantage if it does not go immediately full throttle 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.860
 is that between when you look at the 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.630
 brake or go very well from the gas 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.250
 beautiful just belongs to such a 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.360
 truck 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.220
 so and now you just hang in the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.300
 rear saddle and loaded the paint 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.199
 But then we'll still look 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.650
 is so strong 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.069
 but that's what I forgot 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.229
 is 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:42.690
 We'll take a quick look at the 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:45.300
 lined dealer and indeed in our 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.880
 property 185000 costs namely the good 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.389
 Unfortunately, no further information 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.590
 195 cost and day that is plentiful 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.039
 but also perfectly adequate people 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.669
 part 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:05:01.530
 yes and 185000 is not like that either 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.389
 too expensive to have to say 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.979
 So a manageable price actually 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.570
 I know where the parts are 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.940
 I mean that's not the biggest one right now 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:16.770
 By the way, it is the best truck of all 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:22.199
 may use super space cab classic edition with 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.550
 a scarf sala yes you should not 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.840
 mod show but I hope 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.460
 you forgive so we have of course 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.590
 down the operating from there we see 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.460
 Already 945 hours is the good 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.469
 already gone 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.270
 that may explain the price for it 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:40.710
 was not in there and have and again 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.719
 By the way, the distance 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.860
 the normal dimming light right there 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.380
 but also here the beautiful lighting 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.840
 with it on the side that is also 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:57.229
 very nice and on the key five and 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.229
 Six if you then turn on the truck 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:03.630
 we have of actually 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.949
 work light oh yes if you do it normally 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.840
 I can do it then we can quasi 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.070
 from above the additional work light 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.479
 to divorce and we also have one 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:15.150
 work light in the back I think so synonymous 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:17.820
 very nice so ok super course 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.120
 wall left stock and normal turn signals 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.349
 everything with so beautiful in it uses 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.180
 if we want a little something 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.560
 with the trailer here with this saddle 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.020
 that can sometimes make that up 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.289
 all clutter here is that grad 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.289
 Not 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.210
 OK 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.140
 it looks cool that is the part or 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:46.580
 so if so rolled contract already 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:51.080
 her number plate blr 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.820
 Something like that but you sit the km / h 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.050
 Fluctuations are relatively enormous 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:58.460
 I do not even think you can do it 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:01.180
 50 Now it's back up to 65 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.920
 Let's go around the corner 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.920
 there is round again on track 40 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:17.810
 yes it is something 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.460
 getting used to color we look 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.580
 times downhill then again a bit 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.350
 thus comes at a time demand 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.830
 have over 80 speeds knows that too 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.830
 no one really 

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:38.580
 I can not do that 60 I do not know 

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:42.929
 what's going on there is weird funny 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.819
 electronically well no matter what should s what 

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:47.399
 ever so we put the good times 

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:48.089
 From these and please have a look super 

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.919
 scanners 

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:51.179
 yes and then I would say if you 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.319
 We just liked it 

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.909
 the video descriptions will find the 

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:56.099
 namely let the downloadlink otherwise 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:58.589
 me first a nice positive 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:00.569
 valuation because here for Sunday have the 

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:01.949
 I always like to see yes and write 

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:03.269
 again nice comments of the programs 

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:04.979
 and see you in the next one 

00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:07.789
 presentation or let's play until then 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.789
 strongly
