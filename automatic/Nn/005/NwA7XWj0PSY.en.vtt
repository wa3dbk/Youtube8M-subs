hey guys some of you may have guessed

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.409 
hey guys some of you may have guessed
from<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.040> earlier<00:00:02.580> pictures<00:00:02.909> that<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.090> posted

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
from the earlier pictures that I posted

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.150 
from the earlier pictures that I posted
this<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.780> gear<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.230> heart<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:04.980> it's

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
this is a gear a heart now it's

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.950 
this is a gear a heart now it's
something<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.640> has<00:00:05.790> always<00:00:06.120> just<00:00:06.299> intrigued

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
something that has always just intrigued

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.200 
something that has always just intrigued
me<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.290> see<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:08.099> gears<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:08.820> they<00:00:08.940> mesh

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
me to see the gears and how they mesh

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.790 
me to see the gears and how they mesh
and<00:00:09.450> how<00:00:09.510> they<00:00:09.660> go<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.380> out<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> shape

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and how they go in and out of the shape

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.440 
and how they go in and out of the shape
of<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> heart<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> decided<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.179> go<00:00:12.360> ahead

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
of the heart so I decided to go ahead

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.300 
of the heart so I decided to go ahead
and<00:00:12.630> get<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.870> print<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> try<00:00:16.130> this<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and get this print a try this is a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.439 
and get this print a try this is a
close-up<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.820> when<00:00:17.970> they're<00:00:18.090> about<00:00:18.240> halfway

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
close-up of when they're about halfway

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.689 
close-up of when they're about halfway
done<00:00:18.840> cast<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.529> infill<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.039> pretty<00:00:20.430> thick<00:00:20.609> I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
done cast the infill it's pretty thick I

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.939 
done cast the infill it's pretty thick I
think<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:21.060> 60%<00:00:21.600> here<00:00:22.289> they're<00:00:22.529> fully

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
think is about 60% here they're fully

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.800 
think is about 60% here they're fully
printed<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.240> contours<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
printed you can see all the contours and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
printed you can see all the contours and
outsides<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> them<00:00:25.590> pretty<00:00:25.920> cool<00:00:26.099> stuff<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
outsides of them pretty cool stuff so

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.490 
outsides of them pretty cool stuff so
here<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> pulled<00:00:27.960> everything<00:00:28.140> off<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> print

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
here I pulled everything off the print

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
here I pulled everything off the print
bed<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> put<00:00:28.980> all<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> pins<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.119> except<00:00:30.359> for

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
bed and I put all the pins in except for

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.120 
bed and I put all the pins in except for
one<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.410> how<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> pin

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
one so you can see kind of how the pin

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.740 
one so you can see kind of how the pin
fits<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
fits in there and then I'm just going to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
fits in there and then I'm just going to
start<00:00:33.899> clicking<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.710> each<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> gear<00:00:35.460> into

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
start clicking in each of the gear into

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.930 
start clicking in each of the gear into
that<00:00:36.210> main<00:00:36.510> body<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.230> has<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> pins<00:00:37.940> I've

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that main body that has the pins I've

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.760 
that main body that has the pins I've
done<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.660> before<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:40.110> couple<00:00:40.260> times<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
done this before a couple times so I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.619 
done this before a couple times so I
kind<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.250> practice<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> orientation

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
kind of practice to know the orientation

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.529 
kind of practice to know the orientation
of<00:00:42.719> everything<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.980> big<00:00:44.100> thing<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.539> helps

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
of everything the big thing that helps

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.729 
of everything the big thing that helps
you<00:00:45.660> put<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:45.960> together<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.559> kind

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you put all this together just to kind

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.410 
you put all this together just to kind
of<00:00:46.800> keep<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.250> mind<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> shape<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> heart<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
of keep in mind the shape of a heart and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
of keep in mind the shape of a heart and
looking<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> contours<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
looking at all the contours on the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
looking at all the contours on the
outside<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> gears<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.480> kind<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
outside of the gears and just kind of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
outside of the gears and just kind of
patching<00:00:52.230> them<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.770> end<00:00:53.219> up

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
patching them up so that they do end up

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.760 
patching them up so that they do end up
looking<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> heart<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> yeah<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
looking like a heart but yeah this is a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.029 
looking like a heart but yeah this is a
really<00:00:56.309> crazy<00:00:57.149> thing<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.199> put<00:00:58.410> together<00:00:58.559> after

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
really crazy thing to put together after

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.770 
really crazy thing to put together after
you've<00:00:59.160> turned<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> pieces<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.600> just

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
you've turned all the pieces and it just

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
you've turned all the pieces and it just
kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> snaps<00:01:01.500> together<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> slowly

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
kind of snaps together and you slowly

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.700 
kind of snaps together and you slowly
build<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.270> crazy<00:01:03.719> gear<00:01:04.140> contraption<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
build this crazy gear contraption that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.760 
build this crazy gear contraption that
looks<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> heart<00:01:06.140> alright<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.680> I'm

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
looks like a heart alright so here I'm

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.140 
looks like a heart alright so here I'm
kind<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> struggling<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.610> figure<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:08.970> which

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
kind of struggling to figure out which

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.609 
kind of struggling to figure out which
one<00:01:09.330> goes<00:01:09.510> where<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.049> even<00:01:10.290> though<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> had

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
one goes where so even though I had

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550 
one goes where so even though I had
practice<00:01:11.070> couple<00:01:11.310> times<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.900> super

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
practice couple times it's not super

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170 
practice couple times it's not super
easy<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.040> kind<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.549> which<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.030> goes<00:01:15.119> where

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
easy to kind of see which one goes where

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
easy to kind of see which one goes where
a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> gears<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.950> pretty<00:01:17.250> similar

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
a lot of the gears are pretty similar

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.800 
a lot of the gears are pretty similar
but<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> contours<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.630> bit

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but the contours are just a little bit

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
but the contours are just a little bit
different<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.380> depending<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> facet<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
different so depending on the facet of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.480 
different so depending on the facet of
the<00:01:21.060> main<00:01:21.180> body<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> put<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.740> doesn't

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the main body to put it on it doesn't

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
the main body to put it on it doesn't
really<00:01:23.610> line<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> counts<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.560> some

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
really line up so here it counts do some

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.649 
really line up so here it counts do some
trial<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:25.950> error<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.549> click<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> gears

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
trial and error and click in the gears

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.789 
trial and error and click in the gears
until<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.200> all<00:01:28.890> wind<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:30.439> alright<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.500> skipped

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
until they all wind up alright I skipped

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.140 
until they all wind up alright I skipped
ahead<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.310> I'd<00:01:32.430> put<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:32.820> gears<00:01:33.030> in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
ahead here because I'd put some gears in

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.340 
ahead here because I'd put some gears in
backwards<00:01:33.509> had<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:33.869> him<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.290> put

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
backwards had to take him out and put

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
backwards had to take him out and put
him<00:01:34.530> back<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> couple<00:01:35.100> times<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:36.119> didn't

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
him back in a couple times and I didn't

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
him back in a couple times and I didn't
want<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> waste<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.470> time<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.890> so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
want to waste your time with that so

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
want to waste your time with that so
here<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:39.000> skipped<00:01:39.299> towards<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.840> last

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
here I just got skipped towards the last

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.630 
here I just got skipped towards the last
couple<00:01:40.350> pieces<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.710> got<00:01:40.979> put<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.310> correctly

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
couple pieces that got put in correctly

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
couple pieces that got put in correctly
so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> could<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> how<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.320> know

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
so you could see kind of how it you know

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
so you could see kind of how it you know
ends<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.070> looking<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.610> heart<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.030> seeing

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
ends up looking like a heart and seeing

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
ends up looking like a heart and seeing
how<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> finally<00:01:46.530> spins<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.759> gears

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
how it finally spins and all the gears

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.859 
how it finally spins and all the gears
rotate<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> mesh<00:01:48.600> which<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.079> cool

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.969 

this<00:01:52.869> is<00:01:52.990> what<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.140> love<00:01:53.320> about<00:01:53.439> this<00:01:53.619> brand<00:01:53.890> is

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
this is what I love about this brand is

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.020 
this is what I love about this brand is
when<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.220> have<00:01:54.369> all<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.579> other<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.909> turn

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
when you have all the other you can turn

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.609 
when you have all the other you can turn
it<00:01:55.149> like<00:01:55.270> half<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.509> rotation<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.290> just<00:01:56.470> like

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
it like half a rotation and it just like

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.310 
it like half a rotation and it just like
goes<00:01:57.490> crazy<00:01:58.060> doesn't<00:01:58.509> look<00:01:58.600> like<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.780> heart<00:01:59.170> at

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
goes crazy doesn't look like a heart at

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.929 
goes crazy doesn't look like a heart at
all<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.860> just<00:01:59.950> rotate<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.310> back<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.729> all

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
all and you just rotate it back and all

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:10.210 
all and you just rotate it back and all
goes<00:02:01.330> back<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.780> heart<00:02:01.960> shape<00:02:02.229> pretty<00:02:02.530> cool

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.110 

so<00:02:11.220> there's<00:02:11.370> several<00:02:11.490> versions<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
so there's several versions of this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.510 
so there's several versions of this
gearheart<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.230> printed<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.310> has

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
gearheart and I printed the one that has

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.130 
gearheart and I printed the one that has
the<00:02:14.730> lowest<00:02:14.910> gear<00:02:15.210> ratio<00:02:15.540> which<00:02:15.690> means<00:02:15.960> you

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the lowest gear ratio which means you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.810 
the lowest gear ratio which means you
have<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.290> turn<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.710> lot<00:02:17.100> for<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:17.790> out

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
have to turn it a lot for it to go out

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.310 
have to turn it a lot for it to go out
of<00:02:18.090> phase<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.270> back<00:02:18.630> into<00:02:18.840> phase<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.230> look

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
of phase and back into phase to look

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.960 
of phase and back into phase to look
like<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.560> hard<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.580> wanted<00:02:20.880> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
like it hard so here I just wanted to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.040 
like it hard so here I just wanted to
show<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.120> how<00:02:21.390> many<00:02:21.450> times<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.810> actually

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
show you how many times you actually

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.840 
show you how many times you actually
have<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> turn<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.700> whole

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
have to turn it and have the whole

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.060 
have to turn it and have the whole
process<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:25.110> out<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.560> getting<00:02:25.920> back

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
process of it going out and getting back

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.060 
process of it going out and getting back
in<00:02:26.300> its<00:02:27.300> takes<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.110> little<00:02:28.350> bit<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.530> time<00:02:28.740> but

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
in its takes a little bit of time but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.590 
in its takes a little bit of time but
it's<00:02:29.250> kind<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.730> cool<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.150> watch<00:02:30.360> all<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
it's kind of cool just to watch all the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.140 
it's kind of cool just to watch all the
gears<00:02:31.040> spin<00:02:32.040> around<00:02:32.280> cuz<00:02:32.460> they're<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.850> really

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
gears spin around cuz they're not really

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.730 
gears spin around cuz they're not really
synchronized<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.020> then<00:02:34.110> ultimately<00:02:34.230> they

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
synchronized and then ultimately they

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.280 
synchronized and then ultimately they
all<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:35.130> kind<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.900> randomly<00:02:36.900> come<00:02:37.140> back

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
all just kind of randomly come back

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.780 
all just kind of randomly come back
together<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.740> mesh<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.130> cart<00:02:38.520> it's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
together and mesh to the cart it's

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880 
together and mesh to the cart it's
pretty<00:02:39.510> cool<00:02:39.780> there's<00:02:40.320> other<00:02:40.470> versions<00:02:40.860> of

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
pretty cool there's other versions of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.380 
pretty cool there's other versions of
this<00:02:41.010> heart<00:02:41.220> or<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.120> turn<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.330> like

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
this heart or you can just turn it like

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.500 
this heart or you can just turn it like
once<00:02:42.600> or<00:02:42.690> twice<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.290> it'll<00:02:44.300> go<00:02:45.300> all<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> way

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
once or twice and it'll go all the way

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.030 
once or twice and it'll go all the way
back<00:02:45.720> around<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.440> one<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.770> said<00:02:46.800> had

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
back around but this one like I said had

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.580 
back around but this one like I said had
the<00:02:47.160> lower<00:02:47.310> gear<00:02:47.700> ratio<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.959> takes<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the lower gear ratio so it takes a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.990 
the lower gear ratio so it takes a
little<00:02:49.709> bit<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.920> work<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.160> get<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.640> go<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
little bit of work to get to go all the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.100 
little bit of work to get to go all the
way<00:02:51.030> back<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.390> heart<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:54.989> my

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
way back to heart and this is my

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.270 
way back to heart and this is my
favorite<00:02:55.350> part<00:02:55.500> after<00:02:55.680> you've<00:02:55.890> worked<00:02:56.130> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
favorite part after you've worked and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.410 
favorite part after you've worked and
turned<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.730> cranked<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.300> while

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
turned it and cranked on it for a while

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.600 
turned it and cranked on it for a while
it<00:02:57.570> finally<00:02:58.200> all<00:02:58.410> rotates<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.489> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
it finally all rotates back in and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.130 
it finally all rotates back in and
meshes<00:02:59.880> into<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> heart<00:03:00.420> shape<00:03:00.450> which<00:03:01.110> is

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
meshes into a heart shape which is
