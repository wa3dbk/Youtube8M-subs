00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.110
 nice all guys with revenues will talk 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.090
 we are back with the second episode 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.190
 of the swarm series of athletes with each 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 weapon today unlike the things I do 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 you asked in the comments I bring you it 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 swarm with the bartender I wasn't looking for 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.680
 to do so as you can see the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.470
 jr tag which is recruiting 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.570
 challenges direction and yes, but now 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.560
 I don't think I do it because I do n't have much 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.630
 time to make clips 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 I'm trying a little nerl sometimes and it is me 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.930
 came this swarm was very 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 glad in that I was n't even 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.300
 therefore looking for guys this swarm 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 I state that he is not left to do here 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 xscope as do the face precisely the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.270
 rocket but rather or fairly played on 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.250
 wallpapers as the first in teams 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.309
 you have to do this and I also have some 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.140
 let's say camper because with the bartender 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.930
 with all the smart cards that pull go 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.960
 around making quick discovers something 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 not possible as it really is 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 all you risk doing is quick vouchers 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.369
 scope then find what you do at it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.110
 marker and die in series so I have 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.799
 preferred to play it more than anything else 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.049
 tactic without risking too much 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.909
 the movie anyway let's talk a little bit about 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.350
 what were the accessories has 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.520
 however as you can see now I have 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.180
 also made two that with the knife 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 because I needed it I needed if not 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.850
 I would have died anyway it is a swarm of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.340
 ballista even if to these two kill of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.540
 knife here said that this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.369
 small parenthesis I can say that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.689
 accessories that were quick charger ed 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.150
 fm j 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.299
 the derks or bonuses as we want to call them 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.490
 they were inflexible splinters 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.840
 magician and engineer in my opinion is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 one of the best combinations for i 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.240
 snipers and I was using a c4 e 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.799
 a tactical infiltration because neither 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.049
 obviously for the fit as you see before 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.790
 in the end I will make duke il col mutare though 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.810
 they will be after the swarm so not 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.509
 can be counted as the for 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 swarm so guys if you want some 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.350
 tips for this express map in the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.790
 team deathmatch mode like 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 you will have seen I recommend you to star 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.990
 behind these pylons how flower beds 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.600
 I don't know how 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.910
 they can call you where they are now 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.710
 anyway because they really provide a 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.300
 good coverage and good control 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.650
 of their spawns so if you want to do 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.750
 a bit of results 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.030
 put yourself behind it I'm not there 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.210
 inciting to camper but I'm giving myself 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.370
 a bit of advice to be able to 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.260
 improve your gaming experience 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.930
 so for now in this map 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.610

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
