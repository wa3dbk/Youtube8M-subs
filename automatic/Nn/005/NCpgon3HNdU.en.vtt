 chef's kitchen caprabo my name is my 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.800
 gimeno idea I will explain how 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.550
 make a curry rice wok 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.550
 with vegetables 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.120
 for this we are going to use rice 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 integral that we have it already cooked 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 remember that brown rice 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.250
 have to cook 45 minutes to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.620
 difference of 20 minutes that the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.870
 white rice but we're going to 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 gain many more vitamins from group b and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.900
 fiber let's put some curry 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.790
 some cashews soy sauce that yes 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.550
 we are gluten intolerant we watch 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.340
 Do not carry wheat 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.760
 fresh chive some carrots that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.100
 we have cut zucchini matches with 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.090
 white we have cut strips and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.090
 olive oil and salt 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.520
 we start by heating the word we add 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.790
 a trickle of olive oil and now 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.770
 we put the tail ncaa and the carrot 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.310
 which are the vegetables that will take the most 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.310
 access 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.950
 we add a pinch of salt and the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 we sautÃ© for 5 minutes 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.400
 Well, this is what we already have. 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.250
 the carrot al dente and now we're going to 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.369
 add the zucchini but let's go 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.210
 to have three minutes then a little 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.979
 more salt a little 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.979
 and we skipped three more minutes 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.520
 three more minutes had passed or 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.340
 less we see that the zucchini is still a 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.050
 little hard are dente and now you 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.260
 we add the rice and the rest of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.350
 ingredients we emptied the brown rice 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.080
 that we have known before 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.070
 we add a little curry to taste 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.070
 soy sauce 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.920
 and the cashews and if they are not cashew 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.490
 they could also be almonds 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.800
 and now we mix it well 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.900
 here and if he wanted to, he could also 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.200
 add coconut milk that is also left 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.200
 very well 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.460
 we mix well 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.360
 because we already have ready turned the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.360
 fire 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.299
 and now we're going to serve him with 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.860
 chive and we 're going to cut it finally 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.090
 If we wanted, we could also 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.090
 add fresh ginger 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.180
 Well, here we have our rice dish 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.730
 integral to curry now we put a 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.600
 little bit of fresh chives that we have 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 chopped 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 Well, as you have seen, it is such a dish 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.170
 very simple to do any day 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.270
 for dinner to eat even you can 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.550

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.700
