00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
out of 25 on youtube because I don't

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.370

minutes<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> time<00:01:56.040> which<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.670> kind<00:01:57.090> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
minutes at a time which is kind of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.069

can see there's a steady stream of
peacekeepers<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.319> well<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.129> couple<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.670> jabs

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
peacekeepers and well a couple of jabs

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.680 
peacekeepers and well a couple of jabs
maybe<00:03:10.459> which<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.610> also<00:03:11.940> pretty<00:03:12.209> typical<00:03:12.480> for

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
maybe which is also pretty typical for

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.059 
maybe which is also pretty typical for
allies<00:03:13.340> peacekeepers<00:03:14.340> are<00:03:14.549> awesome<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
allies peacekeepers are awesome so you

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.330 
allies peacekeepers are awesome so you
can<00:03:17.400> see<00:03:17.579> there's<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.290> naval<00:03:19.290> expansion<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.010> I

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
can see there's a naval expansion so I

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.900 
can see there's a naval expansion so I
guess<00:03:21.859> matey's<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.069> going<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:25.639> tease<00:03:26.639> going

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
guess matey's is going for a tease going

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.000 
guess matey's is going for a tease going
for<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> naval<00:03:27.450> build<00:03:27.950> which<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:30.650> well<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:31.859> not

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
for a naval build which is well it's not

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.809 
for a naval build which is well it's not
that<00:03:32.160> typical<00:03:34.310> stingray<00:03:35.690> okay<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.840> bullfrog<00:03:37.819> he

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
that typical stingray okay a bullfrog he

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.220 
that typical stingray okay a bullfrog he
will<00:03:39.000> need<00:03:39.150> anti<00:03:39.450> air<00:03:39.569> since<00:03:39.810> he's<00:03:39.959> playing

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
will need anti air since he's playing

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.069 
will need anti air since he's playing

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
play against the computer you quickly

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.120 
play against the computer you quickly
realize<00:04:09.630> especially<00:04:10.349> with<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.919> patched

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
realize especially with the patched

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.490 
realize especially with the patched
updates<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:12.239> computer<00:04:12.269> will<00:04:12.780> respond<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.380> how

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
updates the computer will respond to how

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.349 
updates the computer will respond to how
you<00:04:13.560> attack<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.849> if<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.450> play<00:04:16.320> chess<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.669> you

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
you attack so if you play chess and you

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.469 
you attack so if you play chess and you
for<00:04:18.599> example<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:20.910> know<00:04:21.000> I've<00:04:21.090> played<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.419> a

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
for example you know I've played it a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.000 
for example you know I've played it a
couple<00:04:21.659> of<00:04:21.840> times<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.380> are<00:04:22.500> acquainted<00:04:22.890> with

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
couple of times and are acquainted with

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.430 
couple of times and are acquainted with
the<00:04:23.159> moves<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.820> stuff<00:04:23.909> like<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.240> then<00:04:24.750> this

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
the moves and stuff like that then this

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.990 
the moves and stuff like that then this
is<00:04:25.560> like<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.740> game<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:25.979> chess<00:04:26.099> if<00:04:26.820> you

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
is like a game of chess if you

his<00:06:32.090> MCV<00:06:32.720> here<00:06:33.080> so<00:06:33.229> we<00:06:33.289> could<00:06:33.410> build<00:06:33.560> a

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
his MCV here so we could build a
