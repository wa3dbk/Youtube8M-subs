00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.910
 Full of hardness, what do we have there? 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.830
 is grit autosport and has codemasters 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.350
 It glows after the rather mixed 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.869
 with two to satisfy its fans 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.500
 and has been something for over a year 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 delivered directly new part and delivered 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 as you can see a big point of criticism of 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.490
 predecessor has been fixed now is the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.550
 cockpit perspective again third and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 she is also a lot of fun 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.230
 However , she is not very special 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.230
 nice if you see it brings tours 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 Unfortunately, that also runs through it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.850
 play it is fun but it is not so 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.199
 beautiful 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.170
 So I'm a bit shocked 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.969
 but thank goodness see the cars 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.960
 much better from the outside 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.769
 that's right the core of the game is the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.370
 career mode 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.040
 There is no pseudo apple story this time 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.989
 but you just start in one of the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.470
 lower racing classes and should be 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.390
 work up and there are five 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.610
 different racing classes one man 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.039
 all must leave that one 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.330
 get experience points and get one 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.340
 finally on and if you have one 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.319
 then you can reach a certain level 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.140
 you participate in the grid events where 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:25.630
 then race from all races 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.960
 So you have to drive in the reason 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.970
 from the rookie to the profi yes and exactly 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.590
 that must be sufficient as an incentive 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.080
 Here we are watching a race of 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.560
 Street class are the distance 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.509
 action-packed things and really have 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.850
 super nice places in there we 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.880
 here in Paris about the champs 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.799
 élysées or here it is now 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.770
 touring races that are relative 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.409
 classic touring car races too 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.020
 offer a lot of action and make fun what 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.369
 but a bit annoying right now 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.680
 The race class will have a lot of playing time 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.500
 operated 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.450
 because you have to run each twice 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.439
 drive 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.739
 that is a bit 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:13.420
 annoying where the opponents are pretty much got 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.980
 I'm fine so it's the beautiful one is 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620
 Can the difficulty really 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.780
 It's great that we are 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.370
 every beginner has a chance as well 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.260
 racing games professionals are required 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.299
 can all the driving aids for example 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.820
 but still against the 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.000
 drive or difficult level 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.910
 and that's really good 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.790
 By the way, very well driven here too 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.200
 thank you very much not because I am then 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.359
 probably in your profi 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.090
 attitude I am then my test without 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.840
 I went because I have the same time 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.220
 terrible failed that was just 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.190
 such an open wheel race are very 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.650
 nice one drives just in formula classes 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.840
 however, they are not as good as that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.660
 formula 1 racing game by codemasters too 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.650
 You have to say that this is one 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.440
 long distance race 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.220
 they are mostly at night and that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.080
 looks on the ps3 not so good from the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.640
 but are actually pretty nice too 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.269
 drive because you always on the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.760
 must pay attention to tire abrasion and if the 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.200
 Tires were stressed too much then 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.099
 you have no grip afterwards 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.420
 These races go on for eight minutes and 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.760
 make fun 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.130
 what you have to do then she was clocking up 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.680
 that's exactly what still no one 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.349
 fun makes the drift race like that 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.150
 actually in every racing game 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.980
 but they are better, at least 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.890
 control as in the predecessor and 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.760
 make a little bit more fun 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.430
 do 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.700
 Here you can see well the bad 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.260
 Schnitzer with the return function the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.470
 backstage function is still there 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.329
 and then it also allows amateurs 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.329
 like the aachener agency 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.190
 Here you can see the screen mode of running 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.400
 two like the whole game a lot 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.010
 liquid with 30 frames but he also sees 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.519
 really ugly , you have to 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.380
 say 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.139
 has run already in the singleplayer 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.989
 You can often do treppchen education or may 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.340
 lightest ring or so and im 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.329
 splitscreen, there is still much 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.280
 clearer and caught properly 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.680
 in the individual cup you can feel yourself 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.030
 even compile race series here 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.380
 for example, the demonic derby 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.940
 you do not have cars either 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.830
 Unlock it is from 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.539
 starting at everything available who so 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.490
 I did not care for my career 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.470
 wants to make such a few races is here 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.050
 also in the best of hands so extremely 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.000
 comprehensive the history in total 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.310
 very good racing game what the predecessor 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.330
 However, forgetting makes technical 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.330
 no longer at the height of time
