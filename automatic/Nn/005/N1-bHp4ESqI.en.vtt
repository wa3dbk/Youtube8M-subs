00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.079
 so faintly speaking about garbage 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.249
 I am glad for the great depression persistently 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.019
 take care of things but quickly 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.920
 retrained treat promise casually 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.770
 after the second world limitless 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.880
 our capabilities needed to be faster 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.550
 urgently redirect to production 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.960
 products suitable peacetime magazine 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.460
 life has proclaimed the epoch 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.929
 one-time beggar 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.590
 which are easy to throw out they 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.149
 were called to reset housewives 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.559
 grave alas domestic slavery in particular 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.120
 eliminate the need to wash 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.140
 we have the dishes for this at the driver’s wicked 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.829
 forgot to look in the encyclopedia 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.350
 it turns out that disposable 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.100
 plastic dishes take up a lot of space 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.930
 at the dump they no longer decompose us 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.570
 vivo 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.220
 man is the only living thing 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.390
 studied 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.210
 produce garbage which nature does not 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.120
 able to digest plastic sapsana 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.350
 products even recycle 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.930
 not so easy 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020
 the proportion of recycled plastic is 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.750
 less than five percent of the produced 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.540
 if as my friend said nothing 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.830
 nothing period 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.950
 gave the region Kanev temperature 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.270
 melting it melts at a temperature below 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.660
 boiling point wagner people therefore 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.140
 in the top five of it can not be issued harmful 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.110
 weakened the power of money as if for an enemy and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.979
 right above 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.609
 help 45 million tons of products from 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:22.720
 thermoplastic 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 turns into rubbish u instantly and this 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 plastic crap gets into rivers with them 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 in the sea and for example the reservoir 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.750
 plastic trash lapdogs cry 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.550
 that a stone's throw from Aloyan airport 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.670
 and this is not far from the factory 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.900
 the desalination of seawater hulke may though 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.040
 return plastic bottles pay money 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.320
 they make up the bulk 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.200
 plastic trash in the ocean 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.719
 reveal us every five minutes 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.860
 2 million plastic emptied 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.399
 bottles here's a picture of actress jordan on 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.210
 who also spoke here over these he 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.950
 is studying the mass 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.730
 of consumption 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.240
 and this is a whole warehouse of bottles on the island 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.480
 coast of lower california baku in 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.210
 the middle part of the peninsula where people 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.770
 considering that they live this island there is a mass 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.850
 people he is not inhabited there 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.110
 nest birds look almost all 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.810
 these bottles are screwed on the lids i wouldn't these 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.410
 the bottles would never have reached 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.140
 to Jesus people and he is far from civilization 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.350
 bottles made of 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.810
 polyethylene terephthalate and then here at the owner 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.540
 lids opposite sea water do not sink 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.390
 they are made in other factories from another 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.190
 polypropylene material is good 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.750
 and 3 6 and according to the law they are not subject to repeated 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.329
 processing 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.889
 but let's go after 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.449
 millions of caps on a voyage 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:41.729
 those that fell into the waters off the coast of Japan through 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.949
 half year center pacific parade 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.969
 US caps caught during 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.109
 first float away the steam room 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.239
 the latitude of the city of akaba salon judge 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.150
 and after 10 years of the Japanese cap 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.730
 turns in the area we call 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.579
 eastern garbage patch 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.579
 and our caps turns the trash 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.069
 the coast of the philippines in 20 years we see 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.999
 that all areas of a smock she covered 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.199
 the so-called north pacific 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.259
 a circular current turned zone 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.150
 copulation rubbish and the thing is 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.930
 million albatrosses national 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.749
 northwest marine reserve 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.959
 Hawaiian Islands look up to this particular 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.589
 Coverage area of ​​consent is all that 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:16.939
 sees and then belches it 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.059
 pharynx chicks in what we found stomach 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.779
 a four month old chick he died 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:22.269
 After eating this stuff Alla 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.189
 hundreds of thousands of yanzas dying stuffed 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.859
 silver caps plastic measures 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.709
 bottles and other teremok for example 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.139
 lighters life but by volume the lid is not 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.829
 can compete with no 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.659
 other conditions rubbish unfortunately parents 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.469
 chicks takes multicolored 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.919
 caps dancing on the waves forbidden 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.359
 detrimental effect on marine life and 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.519
 plastic rings cap march foundation 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.629
 here redeem this turtle factories in 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.790
 May grew she lived and to this day lives in 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.699
 New Orleans at home at the zoo worker 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.509
 but I wanted to figure out what 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.369
 responsible for what happens 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.009
 my hometown is long beach and September 17th, 2005 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.309
 years of the clean shore bank went to 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.600
 our income beach is really very long 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.720
 pp I gathered a group of kids said what 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.270
 got 5 cents closed buying idea 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.460
 took a bang but not for the money collected 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.620
 fourteen hundred roof four I think that 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.270
 once at the height of being called open at 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.510
 eventually forked almost 60 dollars 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.820
 opera sorted covers by color day 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.900
 Earth's very core 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900
 putting on public display at the pier 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.620
 conveyor 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.080
 Governor Arnold looked in 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.620
 Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.430
 Kim exhibits caught their attention 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.090
 they even shook my hand despite the water 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.830
 will print a hat made of 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 plastic from what make big bags 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.229
 mayor 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.669
 but she also refused me the bank angry 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.520
 plankton was collected in the zone 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.610
 circular course of May north of Hawaii 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.719
 the banks were more small particles 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:45.580
 plastic than the call of plankton 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.699
 Here is the water in the garbage zone to withdraw 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.780
 our body turned into plastic broth 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.250
 May if you pickle and 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.629
 the surface of the water is a circular flow zone 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.330
 get these samples 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.449
 then all this crap is carried to shore 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.139
 hawaiian picture is obtained 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.500
 This is the way this beach 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.169
 Kailua is the same where before you moved 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.430
 the white house rested the family president 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.350
 so what do we do when they come across 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.250
 Here are such samples of seawater and 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.660
 heat stick more than plankton we 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.680
 sorting pieces of plastic by size 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.570
 long and third millimeter to five 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.740
 millimeters small pieces of plastic 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.789
 absorbing not decomposing in water 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.160
 organic pollutant 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.880
 substances 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.790
 and concentrations in plastic are almost 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.470
 a million times the concentration of these 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.270
 substances in the water so we decided 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.450
 check these particles do not eat 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.860
 pills with poison most 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.900
 small fish common in the ocean 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.370
 first we spent a few hundred 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.430
 pages no more than a third of the cases 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.110
 already the dead fish boats we found 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.020
 poisonous plastic record set 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.150
 fisherman with a length of five and a little 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.570
 centimeters her belly splashed 84 pieces 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.440
 plastic avifauna can buy in 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.169
 heart store 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.800
 initiated by environmentally friendly 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.719
 products but there is no fish on earth 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.029
 merchants who can sell 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.050
 certified environmentally friendly and 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.540
 fettered but also in the ocean 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.440
 for them here is how it looks at the means 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.610
 which we leave to future generations 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.919
 tons 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.689
 we ask no more normal 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:05.460
 societies societies that throws out 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.669
 product having started america according 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.229
 conquered the whole world this process is not 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.629
 stop we often technically cannot and 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.419
 warehousing recycle what 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.250
 produce 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.310
 we have everything throwing out demand 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.020
 the market is a great power but he can't 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.180
 fix the world's natural system 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.170
 Ocean and we broke her signature and the royal 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.450
 army will never be able to gather 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.020
 discarded by us in the sea of ​​plastic 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.719
 clean the foul ocean 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.819
 production grows packaging 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.739
 materials of Russia in the very idea that everything is on 

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:34.209
 light, you can throw it 

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:36.099
 gaining an increasing number of supporters 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.679
 the whole world and we see the consequences of influence 

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:40.799
 but silent national team gives us hope and 

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:42.719
 mosques and she plastic is impossible 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.429
 her intentions to the state which 

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:46.429
 budget enough money to pick two 

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:49.039
 third of the globe groin but if it were enough 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.469
 it is not known how many sea animals 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:52.360
 died during the operation 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.020
 the decision according to Moore is only one 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.659
 eliminate the source of plastic 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:57.830
 that is to intercept the plastic on the ground before 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.939
 of how he got into the sea and that's typical 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.009
 catch plastic supermarket bags 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.050
 rub but in a world where everything is packed in plastic 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.159
 Maya says there is no hope for this wedding 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.159
 was bravine rooney long beach california 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:13.619
