00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.440
 hello everyone with you channel mage inadvertently and 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:32.830
 Today we have another package wrapped 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:35.600
 it will be interesting more to fishermen yet 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.040
 I advise everyone to see it so 5 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.040
 refers to my rubric 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.350
 group purchases ie this thing was 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.510
 required for 99 cents 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.460
 dollar can be nonsense yes of course 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.100
 Now products are probably already on 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.730
 you have become ordinary prices without discounts 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.260
 that is, he sells these for a dollar 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:18.399
 things here let's calmly see everything 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:20.780
 let's talk about what we already have 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:25.220
 I will try to explain now packed 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.580
 fully packed we packed 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.580
 unpack 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.790
 most likely it will suit of course all 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:38.990
 for summer fishing in no way in winter 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:45.140
 although who knows maybe in winter you can 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:52.450
 try what is it and how am I not 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:55.220
 catch as described in the description on the site 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.590
 on aliexpress that is here goes 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:05.150
 feeder already included is this hatch 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.130
 for stopping spinning children you are here 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.820
 the fishing line is screwed into the feeder 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.750
 stuffed feed and the whole thing is simple 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:18.310
 throws water will now talk 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.480
 poacher poacher same headscarves 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.060
 screens what else 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.020
 all this is sold all this is 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.640
 I do not know in the windows 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:36.030
 how does everyone else relate but I generally 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.230
 not catching not on screens dina network trying 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.500
 still either spinning either 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.170
 may be new melts you can turn gray with 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.260
 boats on the ring if anyone knows such 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.030
 the names of the network here are certainly not for me 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.510
 that is, there is nothing in the first place 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.500
 I didn't throw anything interesting and just wait 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.200
 time passed pulled eat fish mean 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.989
 you have no fish start tulu that is 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.510
 for me the most important thing in fishing is 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.410
 bite well and fight fish 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.540
 vyvazhivane 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.610
 here but nevertheless decided to order 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.610
 just maybe in the summer and try this one 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.599
 you never know what you 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.090
 catch that is it just 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.660
 being thrown with food falls to the bottom 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.140
 the church is unraveled accordingly 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.680
 simple and simple 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.950
 is at depth let's say fish 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.519
 feeds and there is a possibility that she 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.040
 just then get confused in and pisek a 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.900
 will help pull the line to honestly 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.180
 This time but also got there 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.180
 so as not to get what it means by cell 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.180
 cell 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.790
 treat here 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:08.069
 so size 6 is only written old age 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:11.489
 number six cell well for me so this 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.610
 probably foursome 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:20.049
 the grid is pretty dont know 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.970
 will pass the camera it will not pass but all 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.020
 cells 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:29.400
 all curves times the picture is just a lecturer 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.729
 It looks like a diamond 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:38.860
 real square there is such a 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.900
 package wrapped in summer will look possible 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.889
