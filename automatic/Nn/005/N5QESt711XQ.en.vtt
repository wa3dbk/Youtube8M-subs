00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.210 

the<00:00:03.810> thing<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.319> don't<00:00:04.410> know<00:00:04.950> what<00:00:05.190> that

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
the thing is I don't know what that

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.600 
the thing is I don't know what that
typhoon<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:06.270> all<00:00:06.450> about<00:00:07.400> supposedly<00:00:08.400> it's

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
typhoon is all about supposedly it's

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.350 
typhoon is all about supposedly it's
like<00:00:08.790> some<00:00:09.000> augment<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:10.759> is<00:00:11.759> cool<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
like some augment that is cool and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.940 
like some augment that is cool and
everything<00:00:12.630> but<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:14.099> not<00:00:14.519> seen<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.030> yet

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.029 

mines

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.079 

we<00:00:27.579> will<00:00:27.759> probably<00:00:28.119> have<00:00:28.359> to<00:00:28.570> drop<00:00:29.259> everything

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
we will probably have to drop everything

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.510 
we will probably have to drop everything
when<00:00:31.089> we<00:00:31.119> pick<00:00:31.419> up<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.599> rocket<00:00:31.960> mantra<00:00:32.520> but

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
when we pick up the rocket mantra but

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.110 
when we pick up the rocket mantra but
who<00:00:33.790> cares<00:00:34.059> for<00:00:34.690> now<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:36.010> feels<00:00:36.280> nice<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.910> have

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
who cares for now it feels nice to have

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.530 
who cares for now it feels nice to have
everything<00:00:37.540> in<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.899> inventory

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:54.810 

what<00:00:45.540> is<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.370> ammunition

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.310 

guess<00:00:55.450> that's<00:00:55.690> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.209 

yep

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.330 

so<00:01:03.299> we<00:01:04.299> got<00:01:04.479> two<00:01:04.659> more<00:01:04.689> columns<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:08.340> next

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
so we got two more columns and the next

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.530 
so we got two more columns and the next
two<00:01:09.700> columns<00:01:09.970> are<00:01:11.009> ya<00:01:12.210> 11<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.689> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:15.220> for<00:01:15.729> a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
two columns are ya 11 so I think for a

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.120 
two columns are ya 11 so I think for a
new<00:01:17.140> game<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.320> where<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.799> want<00:01:20.979> to

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
new game this is where you want to

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.450 
new game this is where you want to
invest<00:01:21.460> your<00:01:21.820> your<00:01:22.420> kids<00:01:23.289> first<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:24.210> mean

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
invest your your kids first I mean

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.450 
invest your your kids first I mean
there's<00:01:27.460> obviously<00:01:28.060> huge<00:01:28.689> issue<00:01:28.990> with<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
there's obviously huge issue with the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.499 
there's obviously huge issue with the
space<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.939> you<00:01:31.060> have<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.770> why<00:01:33.520> not<00:01:33.789> fix<00:01:34.240> it

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
space that you have so why not fix it

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.800 
space that you have so why not fix it
right<00:01:34.720> away<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:36.940> also<00:01:37.149> don't<00:01:37.360> like<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
right away what I also don't like is the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.600 
right away what I also don't like is the
fact<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.259> whenever<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:39.009> pick<00:01:39.220> something<00:01:39.369> up

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
fact that whenever you pick something up

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.260 
fact that whenever you pick something up
even<00:01:39.970> if<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.149> have<00:01:40.299> enough<00:01:40.569> slots<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:42.490> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
even if you have enough slots in the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.410 
even if you have enough slots in the
first<00:01:43.509> one<00:01:43.780> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:45.130> didn't<00:01:45.490> have<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.209> right

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
first one if you didn't have the right

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.690 
first one if you didn't have the right
combination<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.289> thoughts<00:01:47.560> let's<00:01:47.920> say<00:01:48.100> two<00:01:48.459> by

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
combination of thoughts let's say two by

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.559 
combination of thoughts let's say two by
three<00:01:49.030> or<00:01:49.330> two<00:01:49.539> by<00:01:49.690> four<00:01:50.190> it<00:01:51.190> just<00:01:51.940> didn't<00:01:52.179> pick

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
three or two by four it just didn't pick

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.850 
three or two by four it just didn't pick
up<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.840> item<00:01:53.140> here<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.100> will<00:01:55.440> screw<00:01:56.440> up<00:01:56.470> your

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
up the item here it will screw up your

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.380 
up the item here it will screw up your
your<00:01:57.270> system<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.420> we'll<00:01:59.289> just<00:01:59.470> try<00:01:59.830> to<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:01.240> get

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390
