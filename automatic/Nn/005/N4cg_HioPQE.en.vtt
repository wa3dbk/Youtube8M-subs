the dark material all around it probably

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.270 
the dark material all around it probably
grades<00:02:00.620> an<00:02:00.800> average<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:02.440> four<00:02:03.440> forty<00:02:04.040> percent

location on property is towards the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.300 
location on property is towards the
southern<00:02:48.790> edge<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.180> property<00:02:49.569> about<00:02:50.310> two

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
southern edge of the property about two

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.229 
southern edge of the property about two
kilometers<00:02:51.790> north<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.590> command<00:02:53.590> japanese<00:02:54.280> and

kilometers north of command japanese and

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.930 
kilometers north of command japanese and
we're<00:02:55.390> about<00:02:55.630> 5.5<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.800> six<00:02:56.850> kilometers<00:02:57.850> away

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
we're about 5.5 to six kilometers away

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.479 
we're about 5.5 to six kilometers away
from<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.930> area<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.680> active<00:02:59.980> production

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
from the the area of active production

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.790 
from the the area of active production
so<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.270> are<00:03:01.420> quite<00:03:01.780> some<00:03:01.989> distance<00:03:02.110> away<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
so we are quite some distance away and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.220 
so we are quite some distance away and
the<00:03:03.610> purpose<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.600> today<00:03:04.870> was

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
the purpose of this of today was

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.830 
the purpose of this of today was
basically<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:06.269> demonstrate<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.570> potential

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
basically to demonstrate the potential

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.979 
basically to demonstrate the potential
of<00:03:08.050> property<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.250> over<00:03:09.430> my<00:03:09.550> left<00:03:09.940> shoulder<00:03:10.030> you

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
of property so over my left shoulder you

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.930 
of property so over my left shoulder you
can<00:03:11.110> see<00:03:11.260> some<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.590> workings<00:03:11.890> at<00:03:12.040> that

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
can see some of the workings at that

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.750 
can see some of the workings at that
we've<00:03:13.090> excavated<00:03:13.570> today<00:03:14.340> excavate<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.370> total

the<00:06:03.060> highest<00:06:03.419> gold<00:06:03.720> so<00:06:04.050> far<00:06:04.289> recovered<00:06:04.500> in<00:06:04.680> the

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
the highest gold so far recovered in the

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.700 
the highest gold so far recovered in the
property<00:06:05.130> which<00:06:05.760> was<00:06:05.910> 12<00:06:06.150> grams<00:06:06.360> per<00:06:06.539> tonne<00:06:06.720> so

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
property which was 12 grams per tonne so

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.500 
property which was 12 grams per tonne so
that's<00:06:08.190> a<00:06:08.340> pretty<00:06:08.550> meaningful<00:06:08.850> gold<00:06:09.180> result

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
that's a pretty meaningful gold result

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.740 
that's a pretty meaningful gold result
as<00:06:10.380> you<00:06:10.590> can<00:06:10.710> see<00:06:10.919> from<00:06:11.160> this<00:06:11.340> trench<00:06:11.669> we<00:06:12.570> have

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
as you can see from this trench we have

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.550 
as you can see from this trench we have
some<00:06:12.960> pretty<00:06:13.080> meaningful<00:06:14.570> vein<00:06:15.570> results<00:06:16.020> we

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
some pretty meaningful vein results we

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.930 
some pretty meaningful vein results we
have<00:06:16.590> yet<00:06:16.830> to<00:06:16.919> return<00:06:17.159> with<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.520> greater<00:06:17.729> this

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
have yet to return with the greater this

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.480 
have yet to return with the greater this
is<00:06:18.120> and<00:06:18.440> finally<00:06:19.440> the<00:06:19.560> potential<00:06:19.919> property<00:06:20.400> is

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
is and finally the potential property is

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.750 
is and finally the potential property is
demonstrated<00:06:21.060> by<00:06:21.090> this<00:06:21.240> trench<00:06:21.630> which<00:06:21.840> is

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
demonstrated by this trench which is

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.070 
demonstrated by this trench which is
point<00:06:23.000> five<00:06:23.150> to<00:06:23.330> six<00:06:23.540> kilometers<00:06:23.900> away<00:06:23.990> from

point five to six kilometers away from

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.640 
point five to six kilometers away from

the act of producing drifts currently on
