for<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> profile<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.739> there's<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.309> safety

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
for the profile on it there's a safety

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
for the profile on it there's a safety
here<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> back<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.660> slide<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.170> down

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
here on the back you just slide it down

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.979 
here on the back you just slide it down
and<00:00:47.030> then<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.329> firing<00:00:48.719> button

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and then you have your firing button

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.430 
and then you have your firing button
here<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:50.340> fun<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.300> thing<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.199> they

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
here the one fun little thing that they

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
here the one fun little thing that they
did<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> sog<00:00:53.420> has<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:55.129> crosshair<00:00:56.449> for<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
did is the sog has the crosshair for the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
did is the sog has the crosshair for the
oh<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> inset<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.309> actually

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
oh and then the inset on it is actually

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.290 
oh and then the inset on it is actually
a<00:00:59.670> glow-in-the-dark

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
a glow-in-the-dark

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
a glow-in-the-dark
inset<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> whole<00:01:02.280> lot<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
inset so not a whole lot of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.690 
inset so not a whole lot of
functionality<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.159> far<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
functionality but on as far as that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.340 
functionality but on as far as that
scale<00:01:05.970> goes<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> scale<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.840> coolness

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
scale goes but on the scale of coolness

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.760 
scale goes but on the scale of coolness
it<00:01:08.100> gets<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.450> opinion<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it gets it up there in my opinion so the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.230 
it gets it up there in my opinion so the
the<00:01:11.220> clip<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.979> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.280> reversible

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the clip on it is going to be reversible

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
the clip on it is going to be reversible
as<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> flip<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> over<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
as well you can flip it over to it to a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.719 
as well you can flip it over to it to a
left-handed<00:01:17.640> carry<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> clip

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
left-handed carry and then on the clip

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.660 
left-handed carry and then on the clip
it<00:01:20.909> says<00:01:21.060> caution<00:01:21.299> full<00:01:21.750> auto<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.430> kind

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it says caution full auto so it's kind

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
it says caution full auto so it's kind
of<00:01:23.759> its<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.840> cool<00:01:25.020> there<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> you
