but one of my biggest problems was that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.700 
but one of my biggest problems was that
when<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.119> do<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.330> nails<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:25.050> would<00:00:25.439> end<00:00:25.619> up

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
when I would do my nails I would end up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.279 
when I would do my nails I would end up
getting<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.160> all<00:00:26.310> around<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.359> cuticle<00:00:27.900> which

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
getting it all around the cuticle which

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.609 
getting it all around the cuticle which
it's<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.949> ugly<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:30.080> it's<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.260> like

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's really ugly and it's really like

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.959 
it's really ugly and it's really like
you<00:00:31.830> don't<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.369> bad<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:32.820> then

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you don't think it's that bad but then

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
you don't think it's that bad but then
if<00:00:33.059> someone<00:00:33.210> else's<00:00:33.510> your<00:00:33.660> nails<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.500> pretty

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
if someone else's your nails it's pretty

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.090 
if someone else's your nails it's pretty
noticeable<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.700> um<00:00:36.170> what<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> found<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
noticeable so um what I found the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.150 
noticeable so um what I found the
easiest<00:00:38.640> solution<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:40.160> Vaseline

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
easiest solution to that is Vaseline

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
easiest solution to that is Vaseline
petroleum<00:00:41.930> jelly<00:00:43.250> Vaseline<00:00:44.250> um<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:45.450> great<00:00:45.840> for

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
petroleum jelly Vaseline um is great for

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959 
petroleum jelly Vaseline um is great for
like<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.410> million<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.890> 15<00:00:47.370> different<00:00:47.579> things

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
like a million in 15 different things

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
like a million in 15 different things
obviously<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.280> I

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
obviously we all know that but what I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.630 
obviously we all know that but what I
find<00:00:50.899> is<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.800> keeping<00:00:53.010> nail

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
find is really good for keeping nail

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.939 
find is really good for keeping nail
polish<00:00:53.910> off<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> cuticles<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:55.800> before

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
polish off the cuticles is right before

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.160 
polish off the cuticles is right before
you<00:00:56.190> paint<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.520> nails<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> little

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
comes right off and it's a whole lot

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.749 
comes right off and it's a whole lot
easier<00:01:34.979> than<00:01:36.229> anything<00:01:37.229> else<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.650> found<00:01:37.920> so

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
easier than anything else I found so

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.560 
easier than anything else I found so
definitely<00:01:39.329> love<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.470> ah<00:01:41.570> yeah

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
definitely love this for that ah yeah

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.840 
definitely love this for that ah yeah
that's<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.670> does

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that's that's all but it really does

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
that's that's all but it really does
make<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.180> huge<00:01:45.210> difference<00:01:45.689> from<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.770> going

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
make a huge difference from just going

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190 
make a huge difference from just going
around<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.399> nail<00:01:48.060> polish<00:01:48.270> remover<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
around with nail polish remover and a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.319 
around with nail polish remover and a
q-tip<00:01:49.439> by<00:01:49.860> itself<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.210> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
q-tip by itself so if you have that

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.260 
q-tip by itself so if you have that
problem<00:01:51.600> try<00:01:52.079> Vaseline<00:01:52.820> definitely<00:01:53.820> think

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
