 to see them and then 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.510
 we go 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.940
 to put those plans here in the blender 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.030
 everything is going to liquefy they can do it for 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.549
 example with bits of flan that remained 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.549
 the truth very rich too but good 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.000
 so that to know more about flan 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.250

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.750
 wonderful this gelatin do not have to 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.920
 try to see here the flan of nothing else 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.740
 what a delicacy of flan we have here 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.980
 we will use all for our 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:10.600
 plan gelatine 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.780
 one more is ready until in the six 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.000
 the six annette plans already ready 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.880
 to put them in the blender and undo 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.370
 the ones a little 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.060
 to be 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.790
 perfect let's take a little stick up 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 here the list to put our plans 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.170
 here in the blender 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.599
 we add a flan more are almost the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.130
 six here in the blender I'm not 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.670
 putting complete others I'll put in 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.310
 little pieces if you want as I said and 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.709
 let's now also put the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.080
 jaralito the candy that have the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.250
 annette fish so delicious everything 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.860
 let's take advantage because all this 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.800
 It gives flavor to flower in our latina well 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.830
 is that we are going here to pour everything 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.170
 ready there we are ready with our 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.360
 product that is what gives flavor and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.489
 consistency to our desserts we are going to 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.950
 put the sugar and let's go and when 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.610
 all this here in the blender 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.040
 perfect 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.069
 nothing else because we are associating 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.950
 and of course we need Argentina 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.079
 so that it gives consistency and that 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.450
 the clan gelatin like this is here we have 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.340
 the three envelopes each envelope of 7 grams 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.709
 about half a cup of water 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.720
 let's moisturize it which is only 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.000
 put the water at room temperature 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.680
 we mix a little and then you have to 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.239
 spread it and this bath marie or the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.519
 microwave if they come here 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.210
 because I work nothing x 25 seconds 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.250
 only for it to be founded 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.410
 you have to follow you see it completely for 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.540
 then add it to our jelly 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.940
 electro while here I already have a 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.470
 mold for gelatin a screw mold 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.640
 the edges of those who look very much 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.100
 because apart in the center we can 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.600
 decorate the for example with red fruits 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.940
 as on this occasion and the truth is that 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.910
 greatly enhances for example that is a 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.520
 that has it chocolate color then 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.800
 we can decorate it with some color 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.420
 yellow that owes a lot of life and this has 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.210
 come out a lot so we have a 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.490
 mold for gelatin in the form of a thread 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.400
 only well well greased with does 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.650
 have the sun or well with a little bit of 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.780
 a little oil and a napkin this 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.560
 it also works well that we have here 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.510
 the grenetina let's move the leave that 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.270
 it has completely dissolved that no longer 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.040
 there are lumps once it is dissolved 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.020
 completely our Argentina as it is 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.670
 here it is already liquid perfectly 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.560
 liquid and no longer vomiting then 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.350
 working in the blender we are going to 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.350
 then add Argentina everything waits for 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.320
 that dissolves well that is mixed 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.450
 perfectly fine in our mix of 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.810
 flan gelatin and let's see this 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.990
 mix in the jelly mold that 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.780
 can be in the form of a thread or if 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.400
 they have some mold that they like good 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.470
 Well, in any jelly mold 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.200
 Well, it works perfectly well 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.270
 I explained here all the mix that 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.670
 we have no waste 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.590
 I'm going to take this list to 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.060
 refrigerator for two hours 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.830
 approximately until set by 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.300
 full for anything else to the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.520
 consistency that it has is that it is 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.620
 awesome and they will see the taste of 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.330
 this delicious jelly about 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.640
 pesitos only to get the air 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.710
 see how the bubbles are coming out 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.660
 a few pieces I take them to 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.980
 refrigerator I take the one that I already have here 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.220
 curd for you to see how you 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.730
 demolded and well then let's go to the 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.730
