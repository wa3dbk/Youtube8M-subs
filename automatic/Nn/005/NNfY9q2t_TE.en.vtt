00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
air around the combustion chamber and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.740 
air around the combustion chamber and
here's<00:01:39.190> your<00:01:39.370> control<00:01:39.820> system<00:01:40.060> it's

you<00:01:53.110> start<00:01:53.500> blowers<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.510> Swift<00:01:55.510> will<00:01:55.690> switch

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
you start blowers and Swift will switch

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.300 
you start blowers and Swift will switch
on<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.940> when<00:01:57.940> it<00:01:58.060> gets<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.710> burner<00:01:59.950> itself

and there you have it this is the betcha
blog<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.379> air<00:02:26.769> blows<00:02:27.129> out<00:02:27.400> through<00:02:27.670> here<00:02:27.940> when

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
blog the air blows out through here when

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.539 
blog the air blows out through here when
the<00:02:28.569> top<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.930> down<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.769> air<00:02:29.920> comes<00:02:30.280> over

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
the top is down so the air comes over

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.880 
the top is down so the air comes over
the<00:02:30.700> round<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.390> out<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.440> moves<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.769> lot

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the round and out and so it moves a lot

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.130 
the round and out and so it moves a lot
of<00:02:32.950> air<00:02:33.099> heats<00:02:34.049> we<00:02:35.049> heated<00:02:36.629> this<00:02:37.629> big<00:02:37.930> cape

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
of air heats we heated this big cape

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.750 
of air heats we heated this big cape
last<00:02:41.140> year<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:43.540> worked<00:02:43.750> very<00:02:43.840> very<00:02:44.019> well

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
last year and it worked very very well

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.050 
last year and it worked very very well
the<00:02:46.319> diffuser<00:02:47.319> is<00:02:47.650> here<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:48.849> got

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
the diffuser is here and that's got

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.430 
the diffuser is here and that's got
dinged<00:02:49.360> up<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.780> I'm<00:02:49.870> going<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.049> replace<00:02:50.319> that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
dinged up and I'm going to replace that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.460 
dinged up and I'm going to replace that
so<00:02:51.280> basically<00:02:52.030> we<00:02:52.480> have<00:02:52.659> a<00:02:52.690> new<00:02:52.900> pump<00:02:53.140> in<00:02:53.349> it

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
so basically we have a new pump in it

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.460 
so basically we have a new pump in it
