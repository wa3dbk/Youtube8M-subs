00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this particular one is in very good

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.750 
this particular one is in very good

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
condition they did use it you tend to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
condition they did use it you tend to
find<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.180> most<00:01:06.510> campers<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.710> get

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

used<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.490> often<00:01:08.909> than<00:01:09.330> pull<00:01:09.960> type<00:01:10.200> trailers

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
used more often than pull type trailers

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.940 
used more often than pull type trailers
