00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.169
 also so 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.480
 the best is the appetite so many times gift for a person cost of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.710

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.220
 Alice in Elibagle bike There is not much wind-resident fashion is a 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.439
 has something that came from the united states where there is a lot of attention for 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.870

 and the concentrations he speaks from and 5% to 38% 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.230
 they can keep 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.120
 good results and predictability pariahs because it depends on the type of 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 nail polish from the starting color 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.530
 it is present the yellow teeth like very well the gray teeth whiten with 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.460
 more work 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.750
 and then what I want to say is not to ask for bleaching and if something to 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 do atac 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.810
 pinto in the sense of so many times 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.450
 it is advisable to assess whether there are darker teeth to try to 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.750
 whitening those that evens out of others rather than bleaching everyone 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.690
 hack is there 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.010
 it's a like saying 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.140
 is one of the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 arrows that we have our bow 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.550
 to improve 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.530
 do not use my opinion in my opinion 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.400
 penis to use like this 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.370
 if one has perfect, untreated teeth, one feels collarless filling 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.740
 discovered there is between you can use party 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.149
 however in the same adult it is necessary to pay attention also to the situation 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.250
 that you see and try to improve with the experiment and it is not the type 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.810
 accentuate present color differences 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.430
 what can I kill and everyone can do this document a 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.660
 any age 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.280
 you can do any age they can do it all there are 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 open contraindications 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.340
 and the presence for example of ceramics of the front teeth because the ceramic 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.910
 material cas casca 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.770
 therefore it must be considered the color of the wax friend should be considered to do it again 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.559
 after 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:19.900
 the presence of fillings that are also those eventually remade 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.709
 after a new color 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.330
 card presence of and abrasions or uncovered collars that are preserved 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.719
 protected talled erase oxygen ie 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.020
 in short, like all things a careful evaluation must be made to have a 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.299
 good results other expenses nd comet 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.609
 so the first approach with the hotel smile beretta card therefore study 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.169
 analyze wedding lists 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.919
 Istat. However 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.129
 if I lose too well 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.959
 buying machinery that is amanda that crap is 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.350
 I did or do not cause ivory coast coral bay by me 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.599
 they 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.139
 a doctor like me who takes great care to reconstruct the aesthetics of the service 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.649
 never met patient you for you and the gods of a little talk m sorry true 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.659
 move to see what the elements are in effect 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.370
 key + viewers jump to the eye of the red fur those that I would correct so much 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.969
 how much a patient comes to whiten me instead 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.189
 maybe I see 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.669
 other things come many times for other things and I say but here it is enough to whiten 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.939
 sit-in a good result that is the experience 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.220
