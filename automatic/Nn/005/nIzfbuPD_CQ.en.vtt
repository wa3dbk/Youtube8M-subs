00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
I just spent the morning making vines

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.419 
I just spent the morning making vines
for<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:05.450> for<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.890> done<00:00:07.890> using<00:00:08.160> dreams

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
for the for the done using dreams

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.720 
for the for the done using dreams
project<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.179> wanted<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.929> capture<00:00:10.370> what<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> did

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
project I wanted to capture what I did

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.930 
project I wanted to capture what I did
to<00:00:12.259> create<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:13.679> good<00:00:13.830> for<00:00:14.070> doing<00:00:14.519> pipes

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
to create that it's good for doing pipes

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.519 
to create that it's good for doing pipes
cables<00:00:16.130> and<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.550> vines<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:19.289> I've<00:00:19.380> done

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
cables and and vines so what I've done

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.400 
cables and and vines so what I've done
is<00:00:19.830> I've<00:00:19.980> created<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.550> curve<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:22.170> now<00:00:22.320> I'm

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
is I've created a curve and now I'm

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.810 
is I've created a curve and now I'm
going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> create<00:00:23.930> an<00:00:24.930> object<00:00:25.340> than<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> mesh

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
going to create an object than a mesh

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.509 
going to create an object than a mesh
that<00:00:27.119> I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.050> attach<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that I'm going to then attach to it to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.659 
that I'm going to then attach to it to
make<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.330> volume<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> start

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
make the volume so I'm going to start

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.229 
make the volume so I'm going to start
with<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> circle<00:00:34.460> what<00:00:35.460> I'll<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.209 

orthographic<00:00:42.239> view<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.960> gonna<00:00:43.290> align<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
orthographic view I'm gonna align to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.790 
orthographic view I'm gonna align to
view<00:00:44.579> I'm<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.570> bring<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.410> just

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
view I'm gonna bring it down to just

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100 
view I'm gonna bring it down to just
three<00:00:47.250> points<00:00:47.879> cuz<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.570> all<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.930> really

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
three points cuz that's all we really

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.700 
three points cuz that's all we really
need

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
need

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.600 
need
and<00:00:50.300> I'll<00:00:51.300> say<00:00:51.780> Oh<00:00:52.020> point<00:00:52.379> zero<00:00:52.800> three<00:00:53.430> which

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and I'll say Oh point zero three which

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
and I'll say Oh point zero three which
is<00:00:53.640> three<00:00:53.969> centimeters<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.960> should

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
is three centimeters and that should

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.389 
is three centimeters and that should
give<00:00:58.829> us<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.789> triangle<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.399> so

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
give us that triangle right there so

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.179 
give us that triangle right there so
what<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.149> now<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:05.570> I'm<00:01:06.570> gonna<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.869> in

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
what I want to do now is I'm gonna go in

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:16.899 
what I want to do now is I'm gonna go in
and<00:01:08.360> extrude<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.590> whoops<00:01:12.920> there<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:15.200> and

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
and extrude that whoops there we go and

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.700 
and extrude that whoops there we go and
just<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.509> vertex<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.409> know<00:01:19.590> I've

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
just go to this vertex so I know I've

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.289 
just go to this vertex so I know I've
got<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:21.450> gonna<00:01:21.659> extrude<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.299> along

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
got it and I'm gonna extrude it along

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.390 
got it and I'm gonna extrude it along
the<00:01:24.750> X<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:25.890> gonna<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> point<00:01:27.229> zero

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
the X and I'm gonna do it point zero

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.569 
the X and I'm gonna do it point zero
three<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:31.909> tap<00:01:32.909> out

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
three and tap out

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.490 
three and tap out
now<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> want<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.600> attach<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
now what I want to do is attach it to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.940 
now what I want to do is attach it to
this<00:01:37.619> curve<00:01:38.299> just<00:01:39.299> defines<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.470> path<00:01:40.710> of

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
this curve just defines the the path of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
this curve just defines the the path of
the<00:01:41.070> vine<00:01:41.310> pipe<00:01:41.820> wire<00:01:42.210> what-have-you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the vine pipe wire what-have-you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.240 
the vine pipe wire what-have-you
so<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.040> under<00:01:44.250> modifiers<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:45.570> our<00:01:46.250> object

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
so we go under modifiers with our object

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.200 
so we go under modifiers with our object
selected<00:01:47.610> I'll<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.880> we'll<00:01:51.030> say

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
selected I'll put that as well we'll say

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.539 
selected I'll put that as well we'll say
vine<00:01:51.920> whips<00:01:55.189> vine<00:01:56.270> cross-section<00:01:58.399> there<00:01:59.399> we

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
vine whips vine cross-section there we

00:01:59.549 --> 00:01:59.899 
vine whips vine cross-section there we
go

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
go

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.300 
go
modify<00:02:00.899> our<00:02:00.960> first<00:02:01.259> modifier<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.920> an<00:02:02.070> array

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
modify our first modifier is an array

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
modify our first modifier is an array
modifier<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.250> down<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> we've

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
modifier you can see down there so we've

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.070 
modifier you can see down there so we've
got<00:02:07.320> two<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.799> there<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.479> good<00:02:09.840> we'll

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
got two in there so that's good we'll

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.650 
got two in there so that's good we'll
start<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.099> then<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:12.239> next<00:02:12.510> thing

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
start with that and then the next thing

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.770 
start with that and then the next thing
I'm<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> do<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.470> I'm

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.730 
I'm going to do is I'm
add<00:02:14.190> curve<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.170> where<00:02:17.440> we<00:02:17.560> select

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
add curve and this is where we select

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.030 
add curve and this is where we select
our<00:02:18.130> wire<00:02:18.640> curve<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.780> zoom<00:02:20.740> out<00:02:21.450> sure<00:02:22.450> enough

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
our wire curve we zoom out sure enough

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.059 
our wire curve we zoom out sure enough
there<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.340> there<00:02:25.319> it's<00:02:26.319> not<00:02:26.500> following<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
there it is there it's not following the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.940 
there it is there it's not following the
path<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.730> yet<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> natural<00:02:28.450> fact<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:29.319> I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
path just yet a natural fact I think I

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.680 
path just yet a natural fact I think I
might<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.430> trouble<00:02:30.760> because<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.390> didn't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
might have trouble because I didn't

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.710 
might have trouble because I didn't
there's<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:32.709> step<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.190> forgot<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.670> do<00:02:33.819> let<00:02:34.600> me

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
there's one step I forgot to do let me

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.410 
there's one step I forgot to do let me
just<00:02:34.900> delete<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.500> go<00:02:35.860> back<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.130> my<00:02:36.520> cross

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
just delete that go back to my cross

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.960 
just delete that go back to my cross

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.030 
and rotation just to make sure that no
weirdness<00:02:48.040> occurs<00:02:48.580> when<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.739> start

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
weirdness occurs when you you start

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.040 
weirdness occurs when you you start
working<00:02:51.610> with<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.180> now<00:02:52.209> we'll<00:02:52.570> go<00:02:52.660> back<00:02:52.690> to

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
working with it so now we'll go back to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.240 
working with it so now we'll go back to
array<00:02:54.060> let's<00:02:55.060> zoom<00:02:55.239> in<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:56.440> can<00:02:56.500> see<00:02:56.890> there's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
array let's zoom in you can see there's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.199 
array let's zoom in you can see there's
two<00:02:58.470> there<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.769> actually<00:03:00.610> it's<00:03:00.880> going<00:03:01.060> along

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
two there and actually it's going along

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.720 
two there and actually it's going along
the<00:03:01.450> right<00:03:01.630> direction<00:03:02.019> as<00:03:02.350> well<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:03.340> now<00:03:03.519> I'm

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
the right direction as well so now I'm

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.600 
the right direction as well so now I'm
going<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.090> then<00:03:04.360> attach<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.230> curve

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
going to then attach it to that curve

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.390 
going to then attach it to that curve
there's<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.790> long<00:03:06.970> curve<00:03:07.590> let's<00:03:08.590> zoom<00:03:09.010> right

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
there's the long curve let's zoom right

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.199 
there's the long curve let's zoom right
out<00:03:09.670> here<00:03:10.180> get<00:03:11.110> home<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.739> there<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.790> on<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
out here get home and there it is on the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.729 
out here get home and there it is on the
end<00:03:13.830> now<00:03:14.830> what<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.100> want<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.580> do<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:17.350> save<00:03:17.530> myself

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
end now what I want to do to save myself

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.009 
end now what I want to do to save myself
some<00:03:18.040> time<00:03:18.430> here<00:03:18.820> is<00:03:19.329> rather<00:03:19.570> than<00:03:19.720> doing

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
some time here is rather than doing

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.229 
some time here is rather than doing
camera<00:03:20.920> I'm<00:03:21.040> gonna<00:03:21.310> actually<00:03:21.489> tell<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.000> fit

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
camera I'm gonna actually tell it to fit

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.300 
camera I'm gonna actually tell it to fit
the<00:03:22.390> curve<00:03:23.010> select<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.489> curve<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.209> voila<00:03:26.310> so

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
the curve select that curve and voila so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.490 
the curve select that curve and voila so
there<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:27.820> that's<00:03:28.500> whoops<00:03:29.500> that's<00:03:30.430> my<00:03:31.500> vine

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
there it is that's whoops that's my vine

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.610 
there it is that's whoops that's my vine
now<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.430> can<00:03:33.549> see<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.820> there's<00:03:34.209> it's<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.410> a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
now you can see is there's it's it's a

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.569 
now you can see is there's it's it's a
bit<00:03:36.070> chunky<00:03:37.200> that's<00:03:38.200> okay<00:03:38.590> because<00:03:39.220> what<00:03:39.549> I

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
bit chunky that's okay because what I

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.280 
bit chunky that's okay because what I
can<00:03:39.820> do<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.329> actually<00:03:40.540> go<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.079> select

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
can do is if I actually go and select

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.750 
can do is if I actually go and select
the<00:03:41.620> curve<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.900> go<00:03:44.109> into<00:03:45.000> object<00:03:46.000> data

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
the curve and I go into object data

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.750 
the curve and I go into object data
there's<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.850> section<00:03:49.120> here<00:03:49.180> called<00:03:49.329> geometry

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
there's a section here called geometry

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.210 
there's a section here called geometry
no<00:03:51.760> I'm<00:03:51.880> sorry<00:03:52.060> it's<00:03:52.299> not<00:03:52.329> there<00:03:53.220> it's

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
no I'm sorry it's not there it's

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.940 
no I'm sorry it's not there it's
resolution<00:03:54.940> under<00:03:55.090> shape<00:03:55.739> I'm<00:03:56.739> gonna

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
resolution under shape I'm gonna

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.800 
resolution under shape I'm gonna
increase<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.579> now<00:03:57.790> watch<00:03:58.000> what<00:03:58.269> happens<00:03:58.690> as

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
increase this now watch what happens as

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.039 
increase this now watch what happens as
I<00:03:58.989> scroll<00:03:59.560> through<00:04:00.299> you'll<00:04:01.299> see<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.720> starts

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
I scroll through you'll see it starts

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.650 
I scroll through you'll see it starts
refining<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.890> shape<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:04.420> geometry

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
refining the shape and the geometry

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.590 
refining the shape and the geometry
follows<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.440> much<00:04:05.739> closer<00:04:06.100> which<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.269> really

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
follows it much closer which is really

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.900 
follows it much closer which is really
nice<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.650> actually<00:04:08.890> end<00:04:09.250> up<00:04:09.340> always<00:04:09.549> always

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
nice so I actually end up always always

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.940 
nice so I actually end up always always
what<00:04:10.420> I've<00:04:10.510> been<00:04:10.690> doing<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:11.079> just<00:04:11.230> hitting<00:04:11.410> 50

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
what I've been doing is just hitting 50

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.190 
what I've been doing is just hitting 50
and<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:12.880> gives<00:04:13.060> me<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.299> best<00:04:13.480> possible

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
and that just gives me the best possible

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.020 
and that just gives me the best possible
resolution<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:15.190> that's<00:04:15.340> how<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:17.079> make<00:04:18.030> cable

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
resolution and that's how you make cable

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.150 
resolution and that's how you make cable
oh<00:04:19.150> we're<00:04:19.450> not<00:04:19.539> done<00:04:19.810> yet<00:04:19.870> though<00:04:20.320> because<00:04:21.010> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
oh we're not done yet though because of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.219 
oh we're not done yet though because of
course<00:04:21.489> what's<00:04:22.180> nice<00:04:22.390> about<00:04:22.419> this<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.200> can

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
course what's nice about this is I can

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.820 
course what's nice about this is I can
now<00:04:23.530> go<00:04:24.010> into<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.370> Bezier<00:04:24.669> curve<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:26.620> can

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
now go into the Bezier curve and I can

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.600 
now go into the Bezier curve and I can
just<00:04:27.010> I<00:04:27.190> can

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
just I can

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.960 
just I can
modifying<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.599> it<00:04:29.259> updates<00:04:29.580> real<00:04:30.580> time

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
modifying it and it updates real time

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.490 
modifying it and it updates real time
which<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.389> great<00:04:31.659> you<00:04:31.840> might<00:04:32.080> want<00:04:32.289> to<00:04:32.319> bring

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
which is great you might want to bring

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.770 
which is great you might want to bring
that<00:04:32.770> resolution<00:04:33.580> back<00:04:34.090> down<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.509> something

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
that resolution back down to something

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.390 
that resolution back down to something
more<00:04:35.050> reasonable<00:04:35.319> than<00:04:35.919> what<00:04:36.069> I<00:04:36.099> was<00:04:36.340> doing

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
more reasonable than what I was doing

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.480 
more reasonable than what I was doing
just<00:04:36.849> to<00:04:37.449> help<00:04:37.629> you<00:04:37.780> speed<00:04:38.050> up<00:04:38.080> things<00:04:38.590> but

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
just to help you speed up things but

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.070 
just to help you speed up things but
anyway<00:04:39.819> a<00:04:39.909> certain<00:04:40.300> point<00:04:40.539> you're<00:04:40.689> gonna<00:04:40.750> say

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
anyway a certain point you're gonna say

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.309 
anyway a certain point you're gonna say
okay<00:04:41.259> that's<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.949> I've<00:04:42.099> got<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.430> shape<00:04:42.639> I<00:04:42.819> want

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
okay that's it I've got the shape I want

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.809 
okay that's it I've got the shape I want
well<00:04:44.319> you<00:04:44.469> go<00:04:44.590> back<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.889> your<00:04:45.009> cross-section

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
well you go back to your cross-section

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.080 
well you go back to your cross-section
we<00:04:46.300> actually<00:04:46.659> tap<00:04:46.900> into<00:04:47.550> sorry<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:48.759> won't<00:04:48.879> work

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
we actually tap into sorry it won't work

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.540 
we actually tap into sorry it won't work
that<00:04:49.120> way<00:04:49.300> if<00:04:49.539> I<00:04:49.629> hit<00:04:49.780> Zed<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.349> we<00:04:51.009> zoom<00:04:51.250> in

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
that way if I hit Zed and we zoom in

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.179 
that way if I hit Zed and we zoom in
there's<00:04:52.479> actually<00:04:52.840> quite<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.139> lot<00:04:53.259> going<00:04:53.800> on<00:04:53.889> in

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
there's actually quite a lot going on in

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.240 
there's actually quite a lot going on in
there<00:04:54.370> but<00:04:55.169> they<00:04:56.169> actually<00:04:56.349> are<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.979> edges

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
there but they actually are the edges

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.830 
there but they actually are the edges
are<00:04:57.370> all<00:04:57.490> lining<00:04:57.729> up<00:04:57.939> and<00:04:58.120> that's<00:04:58.270> good<00:04:58.569> so

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
are all lining up and that's good so

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.909 
are all lining up and that's good so
what<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:58.990> want<00:04:59.289> to<00:04:59.409> do<00:05:00.090> is<00:05:01.090> basically<00:05:01.860> apply<00:05:02.860> the

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
what I want to do is basically apply the

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.170 
what I want to do is basically apply the
bake<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:04.139> so<00:05:05.139> I<00:05:05.169> go<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.770> pack<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:07.000> the

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
bake to this so I go to the pack and the

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.969 
bake to this so I go to the pack and the
first<00:05:07.389> thing<00:05:07.629> I'm<00:05:07.719> gonna<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.229> think<00:05:08.289> I<00:05:08.800> need<00:05:08.949> to

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
first thing I'm gonna I think I need to

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.740 
first thing I'm gonna I think I need to
do<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:09.520> to<00:05:09.759> basically<00:05:10.569> apply<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.259> array<00:05:11.770> and

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
do is to basically apply the array and

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.059 
do is to basically apply the array and
then<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.780> apply<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.229> curve<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:15.490> now<00:05:16.240> if<00:05:16.930> I<00:05:17.229> grab

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
then I apply the curve and now if I grab

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.990 
then I apply the curve and now if I grab
that<00:05:18.099> I<00:05:18.759> now<00:05:19.629> have<00:05:19.930> my<00:05:20.379> volume<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.669> can<00:05:21.849> go

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
that I now have my volume and I can go

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.580 
that I now have my volume and I can go
in<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.240> edit<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.569> now<00:05:22.719> what<00:05:22.960> I'm<00:05:23.080> gonna<00:05:23.199> do<00:05:23.440> is

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
in and edit it now what I'm gonna do is

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.580 
in and edit it now what I'm gonna do is
go<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.860> vertex<00:05:24.129> mode<00:05:25.169> make<00:05:26.169> sure<00:05:26.349> I've<00:05:26.439> got<00:05:26.469> all

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
go to vertex mode make sure I've got all

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.339 
go to vertex mode make sure I've got all
selected<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:27.460> then<00:05:28.150> remove<00:05:28.599> doubles<00:05:29.080> and

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
selected and then remove doubles and

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.219 
selected and then remove doubles and
that<00:05:30.340> basically<00:05:30.849> joins<00:05:31.240> everything<00:05:31.840> up<00:05:31.990> and

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
that basically joins everything up and

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.289 
that basically joins everything up and
now<00:05:32.979> it's<00:05:33.159> just<00:05:33.250> single<00:05:33.699> mesh<00:05:33.879> and<00:05:34.240> that's<00:05:34.990> it
