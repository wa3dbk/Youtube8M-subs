00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.960 
were all him 9.99 bid 10 million by now
like<00:04:57.410> so<00:04:57.740> many<00:04:57.890> people<00:04:58.250> have<00:04:58.340> elite<00:04:58.640> badges

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
like so many people have elite badges

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.160 
like so many people have elite badges
because<00:04:59.150> they<00:04:59.270> were<00:04:59.360> just<00:04:59.510> throwing<00:04:59.870> them

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
because they were just throwing them

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.680 
because they were just throwing them
away<00:05:00.320> basically<00:05:00.860> in<00:05:01.160> packs<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.390> if<00:05:02.540> people

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
away basically in packs and if people

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.780 
away basically in packs and if people
saved<00:05:03.170> them<00:05:03.410> then<00:05:04.070> they're<00:05:04.310> gonna<00:05:04.370> be<00:05:04.580> able<00:05:04.640> to

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
saved them then they're gonna be able to

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.520 
saved them then they're gonna be able to
cash<00:05:04.910> out<00:05:05.090> so<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.300> don't<00:05:05.510> see<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:05.750> rising<00:05:06.080> up<00:05:06.380> to

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
cash out so I don't see it rising up to

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.280 
cash out so I don't see it rising up to
80<00:05:06.800> how<00:05:07.460> we<00:05:07.520> did<00:05:07.790> last<00:05:08.060> time<00:05:08.330> flashback<00:05:08.930> drops

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
80 how we did last time flashback drops

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.740 
80 how we did last time flashback drops
because<00:05:09.620> nobody<00:05:10.130> knew<00:05:10.340> now<00:05:11.030> we<00:05:11.090> kind<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.600> had

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
because nobody knew now we kind of had

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.390 
because nobody knew now we kind of had
hints<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.080> they<00:05:12.470> were<00:05:12.530> gonna<00:05:12.650> be<00:05:12.830> new<00:05:12.980> cards

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
hints that they were gonna be new cards

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.909 
hints that they were gonna be new cards
and<00:05:13.610> they<00:05:14.300> were<00:05:14.360> giving<00:05:14.810> elites<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.410> bundles

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.409 
and they were giving elites and bundles
and<00:05:16.040> also<00:05:16.340> a<00:05:16.400> lot<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.640> people<00:05:16.880> stashed<00:05:17.150> them

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
and also a lot of people stashed them

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.440 
and also a lot of people stashed them
such<00:05:17.630> as<00:05:17.780> I<00:05:17.930> did<00:05:18.140> so<00:05:18.490> um<00:05:19.490> there's<00:05:20.000> way<00:05:20.419> more

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
such as I did so um there's way more

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.870 
such as I did so um there's way more
elite<00:05:21.200> badges<00:05:21.590> in<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.890> circuit<00:05:22.400> now<00:05:22.550> than<00:05:22.760> it

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
elite badges in a circuit now than it

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.210 
elite badges in a circuit now than it

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
probably going to be the big shabang

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.170 
probably going to be the big shabang
shabang<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:27.370> everything<00:05:28.370> coming<00:05:28.610> through<00:05:29.000> is

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
shabang of everything coming through is

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.120 
shabang of everything coming through is
