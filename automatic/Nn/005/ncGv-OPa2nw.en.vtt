 showering goes through and not afterwards 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.059
 the hot water becomes the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.050
 Drying process of the nail polish 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.540
 slows down and also the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.790
 nail polish slip because he actually 24 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.890
 Hours to complete 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.600
 dried 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.190
 if you still have nail polish left on the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.989
 you have to nails then of course you have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.969
 with a merkel remove paint removed 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.489
 and for that you take one best 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.530
 atomic-clear nail polish remover because he 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.739
 does not attack the nails as much as 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.660
 the dismiss containing and if you do 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.100
 The media usually have to be done as 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.510
 be brought back into shape 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 but you should not at all 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 If you use a pair of scissors, you will need the nails 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.350
 dwellers characterized worn very quickly 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.570
 s.besten a sand file or even a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.090
 if you have the nails strong too 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.010
 word then likes to best his gentle with 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 an extra reduction page that are 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.460
 just over it and then it works 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.290
 faster and then you bring 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.540
 your nails still in how much you like 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.369
 on your nails would have like in the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 I would like to bring form in the video 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.409
 then I link only mine 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.940
 nail celebrated made more info box 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.180
 then you take a bowl where 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.729
 her so lukewarm water pure and hold 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.280
 your fingers a few minutes around that 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.680
 Water is about five minutes 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.659
 This will make your cuticle a bit 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.840
 on wide and later easier 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.450
 to setbacks but please do not 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.180
 pure soap because that only topped yours 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.790
 finger off and finally bring it 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.759
 not really what to take afterwards 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.020
 you have such a horse feet or cuticles 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.450
 slider or just roses 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 wooden sticks what you have right there and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.700
 Carefully push the cuticle 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.840
 back that works pretty well 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.179
 claims have submitted 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.340
 but please cut the cuticles 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.340
 not because that can cause bacteria 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.959
 Penetration and inflammation occur 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.330
 and as soon as it it definitely 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.900
 not pleasant so please only 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.239
 push back and do not cut it off 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.220
 and if we did that is us 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.750
 quite a few if we still have the cuticle 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.420
 to nurse a bit because now pretty much 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.670
 was irritated and for that I use am 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.220
 like what coconut oil just 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.830
 Of course, well-being is still good 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.410
 An antibacterial effect has something on 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.430
 winter is practically back 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.049
 have pushed 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.790
 and if it's just a bit 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.140
 what was in the fridge because of it 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.860
 I still have between my fingers 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.900
 a little bit liquid and 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.269
 then I have my nail on my skin 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.980
 applied and so easily one happens 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.270
 and that's what she just leaves for you 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.940
 move in a few minutes 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.590
 the excess oil is removed now 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.530
 easy with a nail polish remover 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.230
 or even with this klenner from the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.420
 genesis rom series of sms i believe 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.340
 that unfortunately you can not buy it 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.510
 even at home you can you the on 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.580
 also use every case 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.600
 and yes, that's what makes the simple AllgÃ¤u 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.370
 lie so that the nail polish keeps better 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.440
 then you take your facebook and 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.480
 put it on all your nails 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.670
 This makes the nail polish easy 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.190
 discolored the grooves will be protected 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.350
 balanced and possibly and even 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.140
 hold and the nail polish can thereby 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.630
 also keep a little longer before the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.790
 manicure you should open your timetable 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.010
 do not shake any case because by doing so 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.750
 Air is trapped and then 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.650
 These ugly bubbles arise 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.240
 the nails 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.520
 if you have the nail but absolutely 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.250
 mission must then take your meanwhile 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.110
 hands and reins so back and forth and 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.200
 This does not create any air inclusions 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.390
 and the nail polish is on all levels 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.410
 later rather moderate and arise 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.390
 can bubbles carry your sheet then 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.209
 as thin layers as possible on celebration 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.490
 then simply dries faster and also 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.620
 better and you should also 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.480
 Also make sure that every layer is fine 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.020
 dry out before you get to the next one 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.370
 it can be lacquered on it 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.470
 Of course, every now and then too 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.940
 Come on, if that happens then 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.860
 leave the nail polish in any case 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.570
 first dry well before he 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.280
 somehow tries to save it 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.880
 because by doing so mostly only 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.920
 even worse 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.660
 So let it dry thoroughly first and 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.520
 then just normal about it 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.440
 At the latest when you paint your top 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.820
 over it makes you see the later 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.280
 not at all 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.600
 by blowing or shaking hands 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.910
 try her mostly in the drying process 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.120
 to accelerate the nail polish yet 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.920
 unfortunately this is counterproductive 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.290
 Support does not bring up at all 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.840
 it is more likely that we are somewhere 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.740
 tease and make it such and beautiful 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.630
 make the father come when yours 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.760
 near us then we finished it and painted 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.530
 dried nail polish is but their walls 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.270
 he still has patches on his side or 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.310
 if you have the edge and down on the 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.960
 nail bed do not like then you can 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.790
 give you a brush next to the iren 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.280
 nail polish remover or even drinks 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.070
 q tip or such nageler correction 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.250
 donor and then just removed 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.530
 the excess nail polish if yours 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.940
 suggested because as I said completely 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.340
 is dried and really 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.770
 dried the expensive top coat and 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.380
 just paint all your nails with it 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.120
 again and this will be the nail 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.220
 ladder underneath protected and the whole 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.370
 just hangs longer and shines too 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.290
 more beautiful and she regular off and yes 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.900
 then you are already finished and me 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.100
 Hope you have the video on one and we 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.100
 See you next after
