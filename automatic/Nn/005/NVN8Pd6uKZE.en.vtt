so that that seat folds up it's
spring-loaded<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.549> way<00:01:56.719> you<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.899> can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
spring-loaded that way you know you can

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.959 
spring-loaded that way you know you can

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
when you open this up but probably been

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.809 
when you open this up but probably been
