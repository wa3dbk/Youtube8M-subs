we<00:00:20.859> really<00:00:21.160> want<00:00:21.369> to<00:00:21.400> make<00:00:21.460> sure<00:00:21.550> that<00:00:21.880> there's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
we really want to make sure that there's

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.089 
we really want to make sure that there's
that<00:00:22.119> contrast<00:00:22.750> between<00:00:22.929> the<00:00:23.470> negative<00:00:23.949> space

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
that contrast between the negative space

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.080 
that contrast between the negative space
and<00:00:25.079> then<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.320> high-tension<00:00:26.829> Speights<00:00:27.340> you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
and then the high-tension Speights you

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.029 
and then the high-tension Speights you
need<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.660> exploration<00:00:29.349> you<00:00:29.619> need<00:00:29.829> the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
need the exploration you need the

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.729 
need the exploration you need the
scavenging<00:00:30.640> you<00:00:30.820> need<00:00:31.059> something<00:00:31.599> to<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:32.529> say

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739

like okay I'm setting a certain tone and
a<00:00:35.620> patina<00:00:35.980> here<00:00:36.699> so<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.300> then<00:00:37.480> we<00:00:37.659> can

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
a patina here so that then we can

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.720 
a patina here so that then we can
contrast<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.559> with<00:00:38.620> some<00:00:38.890> stark<00:00:39.220> like

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
contrast that with some stark like

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
something you can place in the world

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.650 
something you can place in the world
and<00:02:55.000> they're<00:02:55.420> gonna<00:02:55.510> go<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> trigger

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.240 

since<00:03:00.660> resources<00:03:01.110> are<00:03:01.230> limited<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:02.040> still

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
since resources are limited you still

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.070 
since resources are limited you still
pass<00:03:02.430> an<00:03:02.640> encounter<00:03:02.880> you're<00:03:03.660> not<00:03:03.780> getting<00:03:03.990> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
pass an encounter you're not getting the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.210 
pass an encounter you're not getting the
stuff<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.380> was<00:03:04.440> encountered<00:03:04.800> not<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
stuff that was encountered not just the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.530 
stuff that was encountered not just the
stuff<00:03:05.370> off<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.580> guys<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.300> would<00:03:06.330> have

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
stuff off the guys that you would have

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.170 
stuff off the guys that you would have
taken<00:03:06.780> down<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.710> also<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.460> terms<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:09.000> what's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
taken down but also in terms of what's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.400 
taken down but also in terms of what's
in<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.360> environment<00:03:09.570> for<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:09.990> scavenge

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
in the environment for you to scavenge

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.770 
in the environment for you to scavenge
so<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.180> balance<00:03:12.330> out<00:03:12.570> risk

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
so it's a you have to balance out risk

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.780 
so it's a you have to balance out risk
versus<00:03:13.080> reward<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.620> definitely<00:03:13.830> all<00:03:14.730> a

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
versus reward but it's definitely all a

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.760 
versus reward but it's definitely all a
part<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.390> choice<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.930> sometimes<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
part of the choice and sometimes the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
part of the choice and sometimes the
world<00:03:16.920> doesn't<00:03:17.160> give<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.550> choice

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
world doesn't give you a choice

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.150 
world doesn't give you a choice
sometimes<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.870> battle<00:03:19.410> breaks<00:03:19.650> out<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.040> way

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
sometimes the battle breaks out in a way

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.280 
sometimes the battle breaks out in a way
you<00:03:20.220> didn't<00:03:20.670> expect<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.260> make

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
you didn't expect and you have to make

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.860 
you didn't expect and you have to make
decisions<00:03:22.530> like<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.670> moment<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.510> that's

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
decisions like in the moment so that's

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.330 
decisions like in the moment so that's
another<00:03:25.140> reason<00:03:25.380> why<00:03:25.620> we<00:03:25.980> did<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> whole

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
another reason why we did the whole

another reason why we did the whole
crafting<00:03:27.060> system<00:03:27.270> live<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:28.500> didn't<00:03:28.800> want<00:03:28.830> the
