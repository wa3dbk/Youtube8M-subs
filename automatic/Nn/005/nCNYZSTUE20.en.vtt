 how about friends how are you here max and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.109
 emme in a video more for you this time the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.990
 tutorial that I bring you is everything 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.420
 related to how we can assemble the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.179
 pigs what is needed to create a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.310
 stick with a carrot where 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.730
 find that the craft table eo and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.779
 some curious facts about what 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.550
 happens if the pig that happens to it dies 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.279
 the chair and so on some very things 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.880
 important of this update number 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.820
 14 good to start let's see where 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.640
 is the crafter or as kraft already 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.770
 of this article this one is here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.329
 in tools and weapon is here and where 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 is the fishing rod is how short 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 the stick and carrot is called a stick and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.399
 carrot we need we need 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.539
 a fishing rod and a carrot 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.160
 remember that to create the cane 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.079
 fish that is the same here in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 tools and weapons three are needed 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.979
 sticks two strings in fact we already have 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.659
 here our material is rope stick and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 carrots the carrot we can 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.770
 find in the villages there they grow and 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.720
 well, you know where it is located 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.420
 the section to be able to create the stick and the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.840
 carrot regarding what is the the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.200
 saddle that is this one currently 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.110
 can not be created can only be 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.770
 find in the chests of the backs 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.170
 either spider zombie or skeleton 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.270
 those backups are not in 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.729
 there may be some on the surface 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.430
 which are the most difficult to find or 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.960
 they can be very very deep and well 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.479
 good is one of the advantages of 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.700
 disadvantages that the saddle alone 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.829
 we can find it that way 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.600
 I'm going to go up now a little pig that 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.390
 is up here to see if it did not disappear 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.710
 not here, I'm going to take this away 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 let's do the example 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.750
 we're going to better I'll put it here 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.880
 is 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.000
 Many people wonder what happens when 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.340
 I'm riding a pig here very 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.110
 happily and I fall into a vacuum 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 I fall from a very very high place 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.590
 Well now let's see what it is that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.360
 pass 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.019
 I want him to fall if I'm not going to have him 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.260
 that help as you see I just gave the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.120
 chair before the pigs when they died and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.430
 they had what was a chair 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.190
 ride this one disappeared it did not the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.010
 came back and well this is an advantage with 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.099
 the tv 14 so if you fall down den 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.360
 of a very large height because they are going to 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.150
 to be able to recover that chair 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.660
 Like if you're not wanting to get to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.200
 kill a pig with the sword or not 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.000
 with another article every time we kill 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.020
 a little pig this is going to release the chair is 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.020
 a very very good 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.020
 option that we have to mount them another 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.780
 time and good is the advantage is in the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.750
 three chairs and finally many people 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.850
 he said that there was like a klitschko 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.820
 at the time of riding the being says no 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.180
 you could advance a lot, I can not see you 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.670
 a little bit of utility sometimes good each 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.560
 who depends on his imagination but to 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.270
 Sometimes people ride the little hills to 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.670
 play races opt for some 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.700
 minigames but he does think it 's better 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.020
 go running I do not know unless that 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.640
 you do not want me to spend your life 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.310
 you prefer to ride the pig and there you 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.660
 you are walking but they told me that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.660
 It was like a glitch com 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.660
 at the time of getting on the piglet and that 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.120
 as it turned it turned and there was not a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.800
 address but I already verified it and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.069
 once we assemble it, we take out what 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.660
 is our our stick and carrot and 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.700
 as they see at the beginning and dance there goes 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.709
 slow 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.819
 and then like he grabs a little bit of 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.640
 strength although if the violent is like 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.560
 that we do not advance much 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.390
 here the problem maybe the one that 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.190
 they said is that if they leave the lever to 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.130
 one side this like it's going to be spinning 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.049
 foolishly and you say is that because I do not know 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.470
 he says he does not follow in a straight direction 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.410
 you have to move the lever for example there's 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.630
 to the mobile and well then he would serve 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.660
 follow a straight direction to the best 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.540
 they are confusing when placing 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.700
 well the lever and the little pig was turning 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.320
 or I was going around foolish and comes 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.410
 follow his friends 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.030
 but then I agree that is the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.969
 book that maybe they say but not 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.489
 nothing happens 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.439
 but this has been the video I hope 

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:48.649
 that you liked already know the basics 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:51.969
 at the moment you can not graph what 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:54.909
 which is the saddle 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.489
 and others we are going to accommodate our 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.559
 artists and then for the moment I do not know 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:00.999
 can is one of the disadvantages for the 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.889
 people who want to create some 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:05.829
 mini racing games because this is a 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.089
 good option and if you liked this 

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:09.759
 part of the update you can 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:11.919
 comment here in the video and remember 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.559
 I'm maxi renÃ© and we'll be seeing each other 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.360
 a next tutorial take care of us 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:19.449
 we see after 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.080
 bad bad piglet 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.199
 the installation god take care 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.199
 bye
