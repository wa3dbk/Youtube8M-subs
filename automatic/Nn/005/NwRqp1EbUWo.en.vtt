00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.940
 hi girls today i make this video 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.170
 because under the other video and reading i 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.719
 comments 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.550
 someone asked me to do the video 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.219
 of my friend collection and so I have 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.140
 said why not also because the other 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.150
 once I did on a tour I did 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.470
 something a little rushed and and it was 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.180
 then it was a passing thing to 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.039
 see the mirror everything 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.300
 so this video is an opportunity to 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.420
 show you my tricks 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.850
 in detail, you don't mind if 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.469
 I'm still a bit messy but I don't have 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 found dividers since I have now 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.540
 you will see that I have some very annoying 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.370
 type wooden things that prevent a 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.739
 replace the dividers for example 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.079
 those of Ikea who would like very much 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.300
