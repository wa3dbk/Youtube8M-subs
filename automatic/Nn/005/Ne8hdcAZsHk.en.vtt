00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
didn't fit well at all but this shoe I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.070 
didn't fit well at all but this shoe I
got<00:01:05.850> from<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> Karmaloop<00:01:06.479> also<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.990> love

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
got from a Karmaloop also what I love

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.780 
got from a Karmaloop also what I love
about<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.380> shoe<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.159> vulcanized<00:01:08.610> rubber

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
about this shoe is the vulcanized rubber

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.149 
about this shoe is the vulcanized rubber
and<00:01:09.210> its<00:01:09.330> sole<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.900> think<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.979> really

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and its sole I think that just really

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.300 
and its sole I think that just really
adds<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.900> cleanness<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> anything

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
adds a level of cleanness to anything

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
adds a level of cleanness to anything
it's<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> lot<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> Janowski

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it's a lot like the Janowski

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.719 
it's a lot like the Janowski
in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> sense<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.490> similar

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
in the sense that it's similar

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.450 
in the sense that it's similar
silhouette<00:01:18.299> obviously<00:01:18.840> these<00:01:19.049> preceded<00:01:19.890> or

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
silhouette obviously these preceded or

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.359 
silhouette obviously these preceded or
predated<00:01:21.030> those<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.530> very<00:01:22.830> similar<00:01:23.040> look

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
predated those so it's very similar look

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
predated those so it's very similar look
these<00:01:23.490> worth<00:01:23.670> forty<00:01:24.240> dollars<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.960> those

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
these worth forty dollars and those

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.580
