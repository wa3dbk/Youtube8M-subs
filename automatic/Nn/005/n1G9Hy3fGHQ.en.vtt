00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
tell from the lighting that it's it's a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.869 
tell from the lighting that it's it's a
huge<00:01:02.870> output<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.530> mean<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:04.190> an<00:01:04.460> intense

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
huge output I mean it's just an intense

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.850 
huge output I mean it's just an intense
beam<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:05.630> like<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.840> said<00:01:05.990> it's<00:01:06.140> motorized<00:01:06.590> so

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
beam and like you said it's motorized so

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.410 
beam and like you said it's motorized so
the<00:01:07.040> beam<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.400> rotating<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.060> creates<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
the beam is rotating it creates the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.330 
the beam is rotating it creates the
tunnel<00:01:08.690> effect<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.680> just<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.100> high<00:01:10.310> output

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
tunnel effect and just a high output

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.080 
tunnel effect and just a high output
lamp<00:01:11.120> yeah<00:01:11.540> well<00:01:11.870> I<00:01:11.900> mean<00:01:12.200> it<00:01:12.320> has<00:01:12.470> our

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
lamp yeah well I mean it has our

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.320 
lamp yeah well I mean it has our
American<00:01:14.090> DJ<00:01:14.500> tenth<00:01:15.500> watt<00:01:15.880> LEDs<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.180> but

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
American DJ tenth watt LEDs in it but

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.420 
American DJ tenth watt LEDs in it but
they're<00:01:17.480> super<00:01:17.960> efficient<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.950> optical

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
they're super efficient the optical

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.130 
they're super efficient the optical
system<00:01:19.820> on<00:01:19.940> its<00:01:20.120> really<00:01:20.390> killer<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:20.870> you<00:01:20.900> do

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
system on its really killer so you do

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.140 
system on its really killer so you do
get<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.380> really<00:01:21.470> good<00:01:21.980> output<00:01:22.520> out<00:01:22.850> of<00:01:23.090> a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
get a really good output out of a

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.530 
get a really good output out of a
somewhat<00:01:23.810> compact<00:01:24.580> unit<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.790> it's<00:01:26.030> also<00:01:26.210> real

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
somewhat compact unit and it's also real

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.450 
somewhat compact unit and it's also real
lightweight<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.650> course<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.220> have<00:01:28.340> all

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
lightweight and of course you have all

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.520 
lightweight and of course you have all
the<00:01:28.610> advantages<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.180> LEDs<00:01:29.570> these<00:01:30.080> LEDs

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
the advantages of the LEDs these LEDs

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.410 
the advantages of the LEDs these LEDs
happen<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.920> be<00:01:31.010> rated<00:01:31.160> at<00:01:31.400> 100,000<00:01:32.150> hours

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
happen to be rated at 100,000 hours

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.750 
happen to be rated at 100,000 hours
that's<00:01:33.050> around<00:01:33.350> 10<00:01:33.650> or<00:01:33.770> 11<00:01:34.070> years<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.490> straight

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
that's around 10 or 11 years of straight

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.030 
that's around 10 or 11 years of straight
use<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.420> mean<00:01:35.600> my<00:01:35.990> parties<00:01:36.380> can<00:01:36.560> go<00:01:36.680> kind<00:01:36.950> of

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
use and I mean my parties can go kind of

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.460 
use and I mean my parties can go kind of
late<00:01:37.190> but<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:38.120> one<00:01:38.390> will<00:01:38.570> outlast<00:01:38.660> me<00:01:39.260> for
