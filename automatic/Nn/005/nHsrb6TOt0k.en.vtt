00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 Now that the glue has dried, you're going to do it. 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 a wax ball of the who walks 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:14.599
 Labotana spoon will get this ball and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.599
 get the mirror right 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.529
 Good , I can do without the spirit, I'll. 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.380
 making them inspire so you will not go 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 have something so perfect today will 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 to taste but you will put the wax 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.030
 I'm also putting it because not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 is seeing in the holes you in the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.020
 reality with the wax will 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.020
 Holes in the hair will leave with the glue 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.059
 once you got to be 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.969
 every morning and you will give a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.640
 Finishing with your finger will take you away. 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.930
 will clean spoon as the towel leaves 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.850
 goodbye 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.820
 now you will get a lighter and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 heat the well to scoop up is not 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.180
 Craque did not see people this is just 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.390
 searching for the table passes in hand to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.400
 Do not get so hot because you 're going 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:23.869
 use the coffee spoon 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:31.350
 Let me take a shower and go with her. 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:34.710
 gives the finish having a smooth it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.380
 Can you do it with a hot spoon? 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.729
 put the left so close to the spoon 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.310
 because dirty leaves a black mark and you 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.659
 will you stay with a daniel boyce bread? 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:54.000
 So you warm away, you have to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:58.860
 leave the teaspoon warm and not 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.680
 ready you left the mark and that's how it goes 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:09.509
 no hole you're going to dust and squeeze 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.550
 strong enough against this whole mermaid 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.680
 paste 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.770
 the powder will actually give a little 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.500
 texture in it all a bit of texture 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:25.580
 skin and you pass may new to you 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.770
 get cover even more 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:35.900
 little holes that probably still 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:38.630
 left over from now on will be a 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.680
 issue of using base 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:49.970
 now you will see with your biggest base 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:56.780
 very thick lane and will pass in 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:00.080
 All of this to fill all the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.430
 holes that were left over 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.110
 now with your sponge you go 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.770
 spend because I'll tell you something 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.870
 of this base that if you do not use you will 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.120
 realize that it is very thick but it was 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
 very good to make the eyebrow 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.040
 disappear bearded to be so 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.020
 that a lot of delivery and only uses this cage is 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.360
 very good for theater and cinema 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:32.239
 if need be, turn once more and 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:34.610
 passes more base base ii is more or less 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.160
 What are you going to achieve? 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:43.970
 after you got through the base 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:46.989
 quite base you back with the powder and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.989
 always tightening 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.980
 so that's practically that 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.950
 okay so this is it you will get more or 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.170
 less this effect is more or less this 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.850
 that will happen you will simply 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.960
 by far 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.180
 everyone will get the impression that you 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.120
 Do not have an eyebrow is something I already 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.610
 I spent the glue here now waiting to dry 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.250
 the hell with you because as you go 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.040
 Using the glue, you get a lot here and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.290
 she gets very hard dry I do it like this 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.980
 after you body with the spoon 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.330
 I clean it and know everything it gets ready 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.120
 new to be used 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.430
 so this is it now I'm going to cover this 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.980
 eyebrow and I'll be back then this is it 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.900
 here is more or less so I'm not going 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.910
 to say that it's perfect because I do not 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.370
 I could see what I was doing. 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.850
 I was looking through the camera monitor 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.870
 but I can say that if you do 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.780
 He is very fit for as long as he is. 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.760
 the impression it will give is really 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.750
 far away you have no eyebrow 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.700
 some 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.530
 Then you'll drag by 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.980
 example you will draw eyebrow 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.610
 You 'll shade your mouth before 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.190
 all this will really make you 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.480
 you do not see anything 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.510
 So that's how far she's going to be. 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.520
 really perfect of course if you look 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.920
 very closely you will see the defects 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.900
 but this is a normal thing 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.430
 if you want a super smooth thing you 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.050
 will really have to drag the performance 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.160
 Brazilian or I love you so much 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.980
 but to make a drag show or make a 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.740
 performance that you can not 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.410
 about being some this is a technique 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.480
 which I advise I hope you 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.060
 have enjoyed this first of the lion and 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.090
 Portuguese if you like please 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.220
 put a positive 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.900
 make a comment on the channel 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.390
 Say what you think 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.130
 so that's it until the next tutorial 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.130
 with pleasure, bye
