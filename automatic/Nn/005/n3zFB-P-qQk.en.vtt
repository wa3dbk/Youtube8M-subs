00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.229 
important that you wait till it be solid
before<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.069> shake<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:12.910> if<00:02:13.090> it's

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
before you shake it because if it's

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.210 
before you shake it because if it's
liquid<00:02:13.480> when<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.959> shake<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.410> will<00:02:14.739> explode

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
liquid when you shake it it will explode

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.850 
liquid when you shake it it will explode
all<00:02:15.610> over<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.269> place<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.989> top<00:02:17.200> will<00:02:17.410> explode

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
all over the place the top will explode

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.400 
all over the place the top will explode
off<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.430> you'll<00:02:18.549> have<00:02:18.790> dough<00:02:19.599> hanging<00:02:20.230> off<00:02:20.379> of

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
off and you'll have dough hanging off of

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.850 
off and you'll have dough hanging off of
the<00:02:20.620> ceiling<00:02:21.690> no<00:02:22.690> one<00:02:22.840> asked<00:02:23.140> me<00:02:23.470> how<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.680> know

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
the ceiling no one asked me how I know
this<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.819> is<00:02:24.940> an<00:02:25.150> absolute<00:02:25.629> fact<00:02:25.660> if<00:02:26.170> you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
this but it is an absolute fact if you

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.229 
this but it is an absolute fact if you
want<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.560> find<00:02:26.769> out<00:02:27.010> give<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.610> shot<00:02:27.849> but<00:02:28.180> I

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.119 
want to find out give it a shot but I
wouldn't<00:02:28.660> recommend<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.260> not<00:02:29.530> shaking<00:02:30.010> it

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
wouldn't recommend it not shaking it
