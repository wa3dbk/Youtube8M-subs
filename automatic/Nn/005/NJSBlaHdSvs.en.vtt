normally put it on I'd twisted but I
don't<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.410> all

stretched out right there so I twist
mine<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:20.070> fixes<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.510> also<00:00:21.689> looks

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

eight and then go from here to there and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.479 
eight and then go from here to there and
then<00:00:55.940> no<00:00:57.590> you're<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.649> basically<00:00:58.890> making<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
then no you're just basically making a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.540 
then no you're just basically making a
big<00:00:59.670> square<00:01:00.059> around<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:02.039> make<00:01:02.219> sure<00:01:02.430> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
big square around it you make sure to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
big square around it you make sure to
keep<00:01:02.670> pushing<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.420> there's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
keep pushing them down because there's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
keep pushing them down because there's
going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.229> six<00:01:04.589> rubber<00:01:04.830> bands<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
going to be like six rubber bands on one

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.960 
going to be like six rubber bands on one
peg<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> push<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.350> down<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.729> take

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
peg so push them down and then you take

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
peg so push them down and then you take
your<00:01:09.000> next<00:01:09.330> color<00:01:09.659> which<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> purple<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
your next color which are the purple and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
your next color which are the purple and
you<00:01:11.700> don't<00:01:11.909> twist<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.810> them

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you don't twist them you just put them

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.800 
you don't twist them you just put them
on<00:01:13.220> regularly<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.570> push<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
on regularly like that and then push it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.230 
on regularly like that and then push it
down<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.000> put<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.689> push<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> down

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
down and put that one on push it down

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.130 
down and put that one on push it down
come<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:23.390> put<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
come on down and put this one on and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.660 
come on down and put this one on and
then<00:01:25.229> put<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.580> gonna

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
then put it down and then you're gonna

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.539 
then put it down and then you're gonna
take<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:27.540> next<00:01:27.780> color<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.350> put<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.490> again

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
take your next color and put it on again

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.580 
take your next color and put it on again
start<00:01:30.450> make<00:01:30.750> sure<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.990> start<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.380> same

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
start make sure you start in the same

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.660 
start make sure you start in the same
place<00:01:31.710> every<00:01:31.979> time<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.659> then<00:01:34.220> keep<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.250> in

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
place every time and then keep going in

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
place every time and then keep going in
this<00:01:35.700> square<00:01:38.450> keep<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.560> your

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this square keep going and then do your

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.719 
this square keep going and then do your
last<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:42.360> you're<00:01:42.570> gonna<00:01:42.780> um<00:01:43.579> do<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
last one and then you're gonna um do the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.539 
last one and then you're gonna um do the
looping<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.890> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
looping so this is kind of like the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.639 
looping so this is kind of like the
hexafish<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.390> you're<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:49.079> you're<00:01:49.320> saying

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
hexafish if you're one if you're saying

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.649 
hexafish if you're one if you're saying
that<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.220> well<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> basically<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.420> what

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that to you so well it basically is what

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
that to you so well it basically is what
you're<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.860> you're<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
you're going to do is you're going to
loop<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> platter<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> started

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
loop them in the platter and you started

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
loop them in the platter and you started
so<00:01:56.189> first<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.850> put<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.869> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so first you put this one on so you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.920 
so first you put this one on so you
bring<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.920> over<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> then<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
bring this one up and over and then this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
bring this one up and over and then this
one<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.350> also<00:02:01.439> up<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.189> bring<00:02:02.460> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
one was also up here so you bring this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.899 
one was also up here so you bring this
bottom<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.290> over<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.759> went

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
bottom one up and over and then you went

said there's six rubber bands on one of

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.160 
said there's six rubber bands on one of
these<00:02:37.500> pegs<00:02:37.769> at<00:02:38.010> all<00:02:38.129> times<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.720> gets<00:02:39.840> kind

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
these pegs at all times so it gets kind

both at the same time and loop them over

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.620 
both at the same time and loop them over
that<00:03:17.159> would<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.489> bad<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:18.030> would<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.269> real<00:03:18.480> bad

it would mess it up really bad so do not
do<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.419> then<00:03:22.349> put<00:03:22.500> your<00:03:22.530> next<00:03:22.859> color<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.250> RS

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
popping out like first grab it and pull

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.580 
popping out like first grab it and pull

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
it and pull it tight like when it's like

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.620 
it and pull it tight like when it's like
first<00:04:44.950> popping<00:04:45.370> out<00:04:45.520> like<00:04:45.820> when<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.480> can<00:04:46.600> just

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
barely grab it pull it tight and it'll

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.090 
barely grab it pull it tight and it'll
make<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.510> like<00:04:49.540> two<00:04:49.870> times<00:04:50.080> as<00:04:50.260> longer<00:04:50.620> so

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
make it like two times as longer so

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.620 
make it like two times as longer so
don't<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.400> make<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.790> way<00:04:51.910> down<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.270> here<00:04:52.450> and

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
don't like make it way down to here and

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.960 
don't like make it way down to here and
then<00:04:52.690> pull<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:53.100> because<00:04:54.100> that'll<00:04:54.430> like<00:04:54.670> I

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
then pull it because that'll like I

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.300 
then pull it because that'll like I
don't<00:04:55.420> know<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:56.110> then<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.770> just<00:04:57.070> want<00:04:57.250> to

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
don't know and then you just want to

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.770 
don't know and then you just want to
keep<00:04:57.550> going<00:04:57.910> till<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.150> get<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.480> lengths<00:04:58.690> you

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
keep going till you get the lengths you

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.250 
keep going till you get the lengths you
went<00:04:59.020> like<00:04:59.710> you<00:05:00.490> want<00:05:03.630> once<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:04.750> get<00:05:04.960> it<00:05:05.080> to

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
went like you want once you get it to

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.160 
went like you want once you get it to
your<00:05:05.530> desired<00:05:06.040> blend<00:05:06.430> you're<00:05:07.390> going<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.900> um

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
your desired blend you're going to um

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.830 
your desired blend you're going to um
you<00:05:08.860> should<00:05:09.070> only<00:05:09.310> have<00:05:09.550> two<00:05:09.760> on<00:05:09.970> you're<00:05:10.660> going

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
you should only have two on you're going

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.260 
you should only have two on you're going
to<00:05:11.170> loop<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.650> bottom<00:05:12.220> one<00:05:12.400> loop<00:05:12.790> it<00:05:12.940> again

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
to loop the bottom one loop it again

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.080 
to loop the bottom one loop it again
like<00:05:13.600> you<00:05:13.750> would<00:05:13.930> if<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.080> had<00:05:14.170> three<00:05:14.500> on<00:05:14.650> there

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
like you would if you had three on there

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.460 
like you would if you had three on there
so<00:05:16.090> just<00:05:16.240> keep<00:05:16.450> looping<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:17.080> like<00:05:17.320> you

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
so just keep looping it like you

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.950 
so just keep looping it like you
normally<00:05:17.680> would<00:05:17.920> and<00:05:18.280> then<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.420> should<00:05:19.630> only

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
normally would and then you should only

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.120 
normally would and then you should only
have<00:05:20.940> two<00:05:21.940> rubber<00:05:22.180> bands<00:05:22.450> on<00:05:22.630> each<00:05:22.660> peg<00:05:23.130> and

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
have two rubber bands on each peg and

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.190 
have two rubber bands on each peg and
what<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.460> do<00:05:24.580> is<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:25.030> just<00:05:25.060> basically<00:05:25.510> put

you want to put the lead part down first

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.360 
you want to put the lead part down first
because<00:06:05.380> if<00:06:05.620> you<00:06:05.740> were<00:06:05.830> to<00:06:05.920> put<00:06:06.010> a<00:06:06.070> regular

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
because if you were to put a regular

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.760 
because if you were to put a regular
pencil<00:06:06.730> down<00:06:06.880> you<00:06:07.630> would<00:06:07.840> need<00:06:07.990> to<00:06:08.230> sharpen<00:06:08.470> it

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
pencil down you would need to sharpen it

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.100 
pencil down you would need to sharpen it
and<00:06:08.860> that's<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.460> part<00:06:09.610> that<00:06:09.730> would<00:06:10.060> open<00:06:10.210> so

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
and that's the part that would open so

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.980 
and that's the part that would open so
you<00:06:11.670> you<00:06:12.670> just<00:06:12.880> got<00:06:13.030> to<00:06:13.060> kind<00:06:13.270> of<00:06:13.450> find<00:06:13.750> the

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
you you just got to kind of find the

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.050 
you you just got to kind of find the
center<00:06:14.320> of<00:06:14.350> this<00:06:14.590> and<00:06:14.920> just<00:06:15.160> keep<00:06:15.520> wiggling<00:06:15.730> it

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
center of this and just keep wiggling it

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.680 
center of this and just keep wiggling it
down<00:06:16.240> in<00:06:16.450> there<00:06:16.600> so<00:06:17.290> you<00:06:17.350> get<00:06:17.650> it<00:06:17.740> fully<00:06:18.070> on<00:06:20.010> and

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
down in there so you get it fully on and

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.460 
down in there so you get it fully on and
then<00:06:22.690> once<00:06:22.900> it<00:06:23.050> pops<00:06:23.290> out<00:06:24.330> you<00:06:25.330> want<00:06:25.540> to<00:06:25.660> take

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
then once it pops out you want to take

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.980 
then once it pops out you want to take
these<00:06:26.830> ones<00:06:27.400> right<00:06:27.550> here<00:06:27.640> like<00:06:28.480> there's<00:06:28.810> two

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
these ones right here like there's two

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.810 
these ones right here like there's two
of<00:06:29.020> them<00:06:29.140> and<00:06:29.410> you<00:06:29.830> want<00:06:29.980> to<00:06:30.070> put<00:06:30.310> them<00:06:30.550> over

be bad and pull this out and then pull

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:13.480 
be bad and pull this out and then pull
it<00:07:11.479> down<00:07:11.750> so<00:07:12.259> they<00:07:12.470> so<00:07:12.949> they're<00:07:13.130> pretty<00:07:13.310> far

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.760 
it down so they so they're pretty far
back<00:07:13.610> on<00:07:13.819> and<00:07:14.030> then<00:07:14.780> like<00:07:15.169> that<00:07:15.349> see<00:07:15.680> how

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
back on and then like that see how

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.469 
back on and then like that see how
that's<00:07:15.979> all<00:07:16.130> stretched<00:07:16.370> out<00:07:16.610> I<00:07:16.789> just<00:07:17.150> like<00:07:17.330> to

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 
that's all stretched out I just like to

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.990 
that's all stretched out I just like to
twist<00:07:17.720> mine<00:07:17.990> I<00:07:18.259> think<00:07:19.130> it<00:07:19.250> looks<00:07:19.280> cooler<00:07:19.729> and

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
twist mine I think it looks cooler and

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.830 
twist mine I think it looks cooler and
then<00:07:20.930> it<00:07:21.169> still<00:07:21.470> works<00:07:22.060> pretty<00:07:23.060> good<00:07:23.180> and<00:07:23.509> it's

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
then it still works pretty good and it's

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:44.500 
then it still works pretty good and it's
actually<00:07:24.430> really<00:07:25.430> comfy<00:07:26.240> to<00:07:26.389> write<00:07:26.690> with<00:07:26.900> like

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.510
