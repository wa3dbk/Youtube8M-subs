oh<00:00:45.660> yeah<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.770> 18<00:00:47.190> million<00:00:47.399> pixels<00:00:48.410> you're

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
oh yeah it's 18 million pixels you're

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
oh yeah it's 18 million pixels you're
used<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> working<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> full-frame<00:00:50.730> 1d<00:00:51.149> s

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
which is 21 million pixels so we're

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000
