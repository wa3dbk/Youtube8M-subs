00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the halo on Xbox one trailer what could

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.830 
the halo on Xbox one trailer what could
it<00:00:24.840> possibly<00:00:25.019> mean<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.519> let's<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.330> started

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it possibly mean so let's get started

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.740 
it possibly mean so let's get started
with<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.980> basically<00:00:29.550> he<00:00:30.060> could<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.449> going

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
with this so basically he could be going

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.659 
with this so basically he could be going
rogue<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> biggest<00:00:32.009> thing<00:00:32.219> going

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
rogue this is the biggest thing going

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.760 
rogue this is the biggest thing going
out<00:00:32.820> around<00:00:33.239> there<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.290> everybody's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
out around there on what everybody's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.100 
out around there on what everybody's
thinking<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:36.030> makes<00:00:36.329> sense<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.870> lot<00:00:36.899> of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
thinking and it makes sense in a lot of

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.670 
thinking and it makes sense in a lot of
ways<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:39.020> basically<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
ways to think that so basically if you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.790 
ways to think that so basically if you
do<00:00:40.829> notice<00:00:41.070> his<00:00:41.520> visor<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.239> cracked<00:00:42.960> now<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
do notice his visor is cracked now this

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190 
do notice his visor is cracked now this
is<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> key<00:00:45.300> pictures<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
is actually one of the key pictures to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.950 
is actually one of the key pictures to
look<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:47.430> um<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.510> he<00:00:48.660> was

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
look at because um you know if he was

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900 
look at because um you know if he was
going<00:00:49.170> rogue<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.070> explain<00:00:50.430> why<00:00:50.670> he

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
going rogue it would explain why he

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.600 
going rogue it would explain why he
couldn't<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.570> repaired<00:00:52.110> um<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:53.399> one

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
couldn't get that repaired um it's one

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
couldn't get that repaired um it's one
of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> bigger<00:00:54.030> things<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.570> look<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.170> does

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
of the bigger things to look at it does

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.040 
of the bigger things to look at it does
make<00:00:55.649> sense<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.250> formation<00:00:56.820> um<00:00:57.270> it's

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
make sense in that formation um it's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
make sense in that formation um it's
probably<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> biggest<00:00:59.270> reasons<00:01:00.270> out

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
probably one of the biggest reasons out

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
probably one of the biggest reasons out
there<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> why<00:01:01.020> people<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.410> thinking<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there and why people are thinking this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.140 
there and why people are thinking this
but<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.199> same<00:01:04.439> time<00:01:04.739> um<00:01:05.280> he<00:01:05.760> could<00:01:06.000> be

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
but at the same time um he could be

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.570 
but at the same time um he could be
wearing<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.720> cloak<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.350> hide<00:01:07.380> he<00:01:08.340> could<00:01:08.460> be

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
wearing that cloak to hide he could be

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
wearing that cloak to hide he could be
hiding<00:01:08.790> from<00:01:09.060> enemies<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> Prometheans

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
hiding from enemies the Prometheans

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
hiding from enemies the Prometheans
maybe<00:01:10.979> even<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> UNSC<00:01:11.790> he<00:01:12.060> did<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.479> some

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
maybe even the UNSC he did get in some

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.050 
maybe even the UNSC he did get in some
trouble<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.520> hierarchies<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.700> Halo<00:01:14.939> 4

help sneak him out possibly now these
are<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:38.939> uh<00:01:39.240> theories<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
are just uh theories on that but it it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.330 
are just uh theories on that but it it
is<00:01:42.479> pretty<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.229> showing<00:01:43.619> him<00:01:43.920> hiding

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is pretty much showing him hiding

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.580 
is pretty much showing him hiding
himself<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.270> let's<00:01:45.450> take<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.320> another

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
himself so let's take and that's another

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
himself so let's take and that's another
huge<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> same<00:01:48.479> time<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.990> does

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
huge one and at the same time this does

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.819 
huge one and at the same time this does
fit<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> rogue<00:01:50.579> idea<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:52.560> what

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
fit in with the rogue idea and then what

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.120 
fit in with the rogue idea and then what
we<00:01:52.920> also<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> talk<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:55.290> how

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
we also have to talk about is on how

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.990 
we also have to talk about is on how
does<00:01:56.340> his<00:01:56.520> armor<00:01:57.000> react<00:01:57.409> due<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.680> um<00:01:58.860> him<00:01:59.790> not

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
does his armor react due to um him not

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760 
does his armor react due to um him not
having<00:02:00.210> Cortana<00:02:00.780> with<00:02:00.960> him<00:02:01.079> anymore<00:02:01.259> now

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
having Cortana with him anymore now

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.810 
having Cortana with him anymore now
um<00:02:01.950> due<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.939> him<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.329> having<00:02:03.570> an<00:02:03.840> AI<00:02:03.960> his<00:02:04.820> armor

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
um due to him not having an AI his armor

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
um due to him not having an AI his armor
is<00:02:05.850> shield<00:02:06.479> everything<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.259> has<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.710> with

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
could be hiding or he could just be um

hiding because that makes a lot of sense
in<00:03:46.370> different<00:03:47.090> ways<00:03:47.239> maybe<00:03:47.930> he<00:03:48.079> wants<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.410> keep
