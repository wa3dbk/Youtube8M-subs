 is today on your son 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.610
 cap after a superb update I 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.239
 am on the oc scanner rsa or the boyfriend that 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.720
 go quietly 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:26.369
 yeah that's okay it's all right and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.829
 if we make a short video 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.680
 right now it's to show 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.420
 this beautiful and beautiful mages 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.559
 so as you can see on the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.000
 top of the screen on the left right now 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.100
 my team who gives me an order 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.840
 that's the beautiful age too that he does not 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 it's useless now 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.400
 press this little button the sir donald 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 fehr his record is superb it is used to 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.200
 nothing that was the big reason he can 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 at the door on the f 4 but especially then 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.790
 I do not know if you see there all of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.980
 after 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.210
 fetini red dots that at the bottom of 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.829
 the screen so I do not know if it's you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 sky who took the bomb there a yes 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.350
 it's me it's me, well, here it is and beat the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.989
 new update 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.670
 today has this January 30, 2014 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.710
 and here's the bomb 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.020
 even when we do not see it we see it 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.520
 so I actually have the purpose of diffusing it to 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.619
 from today it's more to do 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.729
 of the competition because at the base I 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.299
 believe we were gone for a fashion 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.890
 competitive with that but it's a fashion 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.890
 troll the goal is to kill the person 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.500
 with a defined scheme for example and I 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.700
 amuses me it's right when there is a 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.320
 little orange thing that is based on any 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.399
 the map 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.399
 I give young ideas resided 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.929
 table is the counterpart 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.880
 my sisters still dare it's still 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.560
 momentum what's still huge 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.240
 we have the right to give orders but 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.100
 good we must also be seen what 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.170
 like it should be 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.840
 so that's the hall it was just a 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.060
 little video actually to show a little 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.810
 apt to ispoure already laid especially a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.569
 question also why why this 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.610
 bullshit actually when you get to 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.730
 mark battlefield the twitter account 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.140
 battlefield that 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.910
 you will listen a little the life of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:18.840
 players to do that you have it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:21.930
 searched where the players' lives are here and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.410
 not even get complicated because their 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.000
 habitat 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.040
 you kill me one on the video I'm going 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.900
 but you'll see that it's half 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.820
 hour that I chase you the couple is 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.230
 in your since season beat almost 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.630
 I say that I tell you I lie down in 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.310
 the flowers so in short so here's so 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.290
 you do not know what to do anymore 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.290
 I have an idea for you it's a bit 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.710
 this little troll mode there that has become 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.150
 the bun is broadcasting so that was it just 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.740
 a short video pretty fast 1 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.270
 frankly I do not think we have 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.410
 need more it went on it I 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.310
 do not know if you noticed a few 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 changes but I still have time 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.710
 still playing it I'm only coming 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.540
 only seconds from work and I fall 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.680
 on it, a peacock is only what 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.790
 ddh aÃ¯ssa there would be some 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.670
 changes at a code date 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.630
 small internal changes 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.220
 So now, that's true 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.320
 that I could not see also if 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.060
 that was the case I hope in any case 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.410
 Here at least the last 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.520
 no one so already that she is 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.290
 will find against 4 is enough 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.400
 difficult still that's for sure and at 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.959
 throne the tarn yesterday I'll go see 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.190
 okay so that's why that's what 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.210
 I was going to see but otherwise the same will cause 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.190
 never go troll the mendoza 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.840
 never again went to get the bomb 54 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.470
 reputation is the bar that's why 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.970
 I did this 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.070
 the Indian tale of match m brightkite 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.500
 eat like that it's fast in diffuse 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.900
 with sky their story just right 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.980
 see a bit of the immensity of bullshit 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.830
 what could be done about this update 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.480
 if you see the video you made me 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.400

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.810
 match against the worst have both 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.590
 final to play I think that's it 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.520
 dead what's not going to be possible to 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.590
 water to see more respect 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.910
