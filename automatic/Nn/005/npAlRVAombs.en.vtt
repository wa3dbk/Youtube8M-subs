00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.580 
you need to be really prepared like you
have<00:01:33.420> your<00:01:33.540> timer<00:01:33.869> has<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.320> ahead<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
have your timer has to be ahead of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.590 
have your timer has to be ahead of
everybody<00:01:34.829> else<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.270> timers

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
everybody else is because all the timers

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
everybody else is because all the timers
are<00:01:36.780> not<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> sink<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.979> know<00:01:38.100> some<00:01:38.340> are

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
are not in the sink you know some are

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340 
are not in the sink you know some are
faster<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.909> much<00:01:39.030> slower<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.079> what<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.259> suggest

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
faster so much slower so what I suggest

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.069 
faster so much slower so what I suggest
is<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> refresh<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> page<00:01:41.460> before<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.869> timer

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
is you refresh the page before the timer

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.719 
is you refresh the page before the timer
runs<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.860> make<00:01:44.009> sure<00:01:44.040> your<00:01:44.280> time<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
runs out so make sure your time is up to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.039 
runs out so make sure your time is up to
date<00:01:44.759> um<00:01:47.149> if<00:01:48.149> you're<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.540> fast<00:01:48.630> internet

date um if you're a really fast internet

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.480 
date um if you're a really fast internet
it<00:01:49.110> shouldn't<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> problem<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it shouldn't be a problem you know I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.850 
it shouldn't be a problem you know I

miss out on any releases because i have

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.840 
miss out on any releases because i have
really<00:01:54.360> fast<00:01:54.540> internet<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.079> my<00:01:55.170> pot<00:01:55.549> is<00:01:56.549> the

really fast internet and my pot is the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
really fast internet and my pot is the
best<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.689> together<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.380> the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.210 
though they're all priced the same but
they<00:03:12.349> have<00:03:12.439> to<00:03:12.470> be<00:03:12.620> purchased<00:03:13.010> individually

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
they have to be purchased individually

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.849 
they have to be purchased individually
and<00:03:14.150> my<00:03:14.209> check<00:03:14.659> out<00:03:14.750> pots<00:03:14.930> are<00:03:15.169> purchased

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
and my check out pots are purchased

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.250 
and my check out pots are purchased
individually<00:03:15.980> as<00:03:16.430> well<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.810> reason<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.109> did

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
individually as well the reason I did

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.229 
individually as well the reason I did
that<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.409> because<00:03:18.729> by<00:03:19.729> coating<00:03:19.970> them

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
that is because by coating them

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.509 
that is because by coating them
separately<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:21.019> can<00:03:21.440> have<00:03:21.620> each<00:03:21.769> bot<00:03:22.010> run<00:03:22.340> as

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
separately I can have each bot run as

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.039 
separately I can have each bot run as
fast<00:03:22.669> as<00:03:22.819> possible<00:03:22.879> and<00:03:23.540> that's<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> most

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
fast as possible and that's the most

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.569 
fast as possible and that's the most
important<00:03:24.440> thing<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.069> thing<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.459> need

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
important thing in this thing you need

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.819 
important thing in this thing you need
you<00:03:25.819> need<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.090> speed<00:03:26.389> so<00:03:27.379> that's<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.739> way

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
you need to speed so that's the way

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.270 
you need to speed so that's the way
that's<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.159> reason<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.459> did<00:03:28.609> that<00:03:28.639> um<00:03:30.099> you<00:03:31.099> know

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
running on really really slow internet

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.450 
running on really really slow internet
running<00:06:47.990> on<00:06:48.170> 2<00:06:48.380> megabits<00:06:48.800> per<00:06:48.920> second<00:06:49.310> when<00:06:49.430> I

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
running on 2 megabits per second when I

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.310 
running on 2 megabits per second when I
