was in service for eight months and then
it<00:03:03.330> started<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> rattle<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:06.230> find<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.380> really

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
part such as a fan for let's say a

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.050 
part such as a fan for let's say a
laptop<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.560> manufacturer<00:03:17.310> will<00:03:17.430> care<00:03:17.700> enough

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
laptop the manufacturer will care enough

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.710 
laptop the manufacturer will care enough
to<00:03:18.680> put<00:03:19.680> some<00:03:19.890> grease<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.820> shaft<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.510> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
to put some grease on the shaft in the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.340 
to put some grease on the shaft in the
manufacturing<00:03:22.320> process<00:03:23.630> but<00:03:24.630> no<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.140> this

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
manufacturing process but no in this

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.930 
manufacturing process but no in this
case<00:03:25.620> they<00:03:25.830> did<00:03:26.040> not<00:03:26.959> so<00:03:27.959> basically<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.590> had<00:03:28.860> to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
case they did not so basically I had to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.210 
case they did not so basically I had to
tear<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.120> computer<00:03:30.480> back<00:03:30.630> down<00:03:31.100> take<00:03:32.100> the

tear that computer back down take the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.270 
tear that computer back down take the
fan<00:03:32.459> back<00:03:32.730> out<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.410> had<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.650> apply<00:03:34.980> some

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
fan back out and I had to apply some

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.670 
fan back out and I had to apply some
grease<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.239> shaft<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.260> fan<00:03:37.470> works

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
grease to this shaft the fan works

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.460 
grease to this shaft the fan works
wonderfully<00:03:38.250> now<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:39.330> as<00:03:39.420> quiet<00:03:39.690> as<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.020> be
