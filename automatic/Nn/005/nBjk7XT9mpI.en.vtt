00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
power house we also talk about energy

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.300 
power house we also talk about energy
savings<00:03:51.060> let's<00:03:51.269> talk<00:03:51.480> about<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.500> portable

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
savings let's talk about that a portable

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.160 
savings let's talk about that a portable
dehumidifier<00:03:53.459> versus<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.480> whole<00:03:54.660> house<00:03:54.900> key

dehumidifier versus the whole house key

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.449 
dehumidifier versus the whole house key
yeah<00:03:55.410> there's<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.709> significant<00:03:56.310> energy

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
yeah there's a significant energy

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.460 
yeah there's a significant energy
savings<00:03:56.700> between<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.480> portable<00:03:57.959> if<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.080> notice
