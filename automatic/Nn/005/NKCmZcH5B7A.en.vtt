reading books on the iPhone because this

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.880 
reading books on the iPhone because this
is<00:02:20.690> pretty<00:02:20.870> much<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.020> exact<00:02:21.380> same<00:02:21.590> sort<00:02:21.830> of

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
is pretty much the exact same sort of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.559 
is pretty much the exact same sort of
display<00:02:22.100> right<00:02:22.459> you've<00:02:22.850> played<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.120> eating

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
display right you've played with eating

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.660 
display right you've played with eating
before<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.800> seeing<00:02:25.130> how<00:02:25.220> some<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.580> those

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
before and in seeing how some of those

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.100 
before and in seeing how some of those
things<00:02:25.940> work<00:02:26.150> how<00:02:26.300> do<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.450> compare<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.959> eat

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
things work how do you compare it to eat

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.920 
things work how do you compare it to eat
ink<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:28.370> more<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:28.880> 50-50<00:02:29.390> I'd<00:02:29.630> say<00:02:29.780> they're

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
ink it's more of a 50-50 I'd say they're

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.810 
ink it's more of a 50-50 I'd say they're
both<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.470> same<00:02:30.500> footing<00:02:31.070> because<00:02:31.220> they

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
both on the same footing because they

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.130 
both on the same footing because they
don't<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.209> same<00:02:32.240> strengths<00:02:32.870> but<00:02:33.020> they

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
don't have the same strengths but they

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.080 
don't have the same strengths but they
and<00:02:33.260> they<00:02:33.320> also<00:02:33.440> have<00:02:33.590> different<00:02:33.709> weaknesses

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
and they also have different weaknesses

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.880 
and they also have different weaknesses
so<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.420> find<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.260> most<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.800> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
so I find that the most of the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.410 
so I find that the most of the
situations<00:02:37.430> which<00:02:37.610> I'm<00:02:37.790> reading<00:02:38.060> books<00:02:38.270> on

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
situations which I'm reading books on

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.380 
situations which I'm reading books on

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.059
