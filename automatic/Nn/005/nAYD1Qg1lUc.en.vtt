00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.590
 Hello, my name is The Walt Disney Company 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.980
 today 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.830
 Ropework now 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.539
 The first rope work is tied 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.820
 I think the king of not 某 line 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:28.270
 This is a basic in the basic variety and keep this in mind 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.840
 I think that it will be life saving after the application is useful 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.840
 Involuntarily evening 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.670
 First of all 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.650
 Basics in the basics of rope work 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.690
 I live in a club 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.420
 Wave Shibuya 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.420
 Make a loop at the end of the rope 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.920
 Size does not change 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.320
 I can not solve something 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.180
 Miscellaneous goods hooked to the other side of the farmer's platform 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.180
 1 if you kick the malt 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 Oh, when you turn on 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.240
 I think to save lives 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240
 4 line 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.380
 My wife is this 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.830
 Isn't it too late 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.960
 I do not absolutely remember 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.119
 Go to the north 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.119
 I'm making it a little easy to understand 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.020
 Rope characteristics are on the little finger side 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.560
 I change the whole thing and don't remember the basics 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.930
 Do not be relied have to say this time of something 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.310
 Such a buss day Oh 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.010
 corner 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.640
 There is a coming axis like 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.200
 Yes if it increases 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.200
 Cook on the little finger side 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.260
 I got a small frame when I went 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.260
 This is Ow want to make 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 Under the axis 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.060
 This wind from the news 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.569
 Down the house 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.090
 Please 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.740
 Come back on 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.040
 Return to the small circle 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.040
 However 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.020
 So the inn 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.020
 After all while adjusting 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.910
 I also do 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.620
 By 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.280
 As long as you can not take it out absolutely 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.280
 Do not hesitate 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.160
 I have 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:04.790
 Make the inner little bit and move under the axis to get back to the original little bit 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.329
 q and 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.329
 I can do it 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.870
 Easy to solve at this time 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 A little longer 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.060
 Four 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.310
 Here 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.880
 One of the red butterfly knot is not a turret in 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.880
 Then 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:44.200
 Easy-to-understand Kedomo tied a little loosely 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.739
 I'm able to make a tie to the one that has a hina line 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.739
 Unravel 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.590
 Actual time 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:04:00.849
 When helping people or loading something on a loading platform 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.849
 Ne way Is that went to the first I'm no so much easier to solve 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.250
 As subsequent application, for example, this 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.680
 I want to tie myself 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.190
 I hope this helps 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.629
 cure 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.640
 Good 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.110
 Yes 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.110
 Bowline was signed lifesaving knot certain line
