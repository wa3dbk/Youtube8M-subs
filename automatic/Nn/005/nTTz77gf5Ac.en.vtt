00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that all the way up to her scalp and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410 
that all the way up to her scalp and
then<00:01:22.470> lock<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.100> place<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.640> bending<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> end

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.719 

now<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.780> find<00:01:33.079> that<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.530> great<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.280> purple

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
now I find that the great and the purple

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.510 
now I find that the great and the purple
rods<00:01:34.939> are<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.360> best<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:36.380> use<00:01:36.619> for<00:01:37.009> people<00:01:37.039> with

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
rods are the best to use for people with

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.149 
rods are the best to use for people with
long<00:01:37.850> hair<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.539> use<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:39.439> on<00:01:39.649> my<00:01:39.680> hair<00:01:40.009> before

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
long hair I use this on my hair before

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.270 
long hair I use this on my hair before
and<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.549> was<00:01:40.640> very<00:01:41.060> difficult<00:01:41.479> for<00:01:41.840> me<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.500> use

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
and it was very difficult for me to use

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.249 
and it was very difficult for me to use
because<00:01:43.579> I<00:01:43.789> just<00:01:43.970> had<00:01:44.090> all<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:44.360> extra<00:01:44.570> space

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
because I just had all this extra space

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.730 
because I just had all this extra space
so<00:01:45.679> yes<00:01:46.219> if<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.460> have<00:01:46.610> long<00:01:47.000> hair<00:01:47.380> gray<00:01:48.380> and

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
so yes if you have long hair gray and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.179 
so yes if you have long hair gray and
purple<00:01:49.240> flexi<00:01:50.240> rods<00:01:50.420> are<00:01:50.689> best<00:01:51.409> for<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.950> if

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
purple flexi rods are best for you if

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.550 
purple flexi rods are best for you if
you<00:01:52.670> got<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:52.850> short<00:01:53.149> hair<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.659> me<00:01:53.929> or<00:01:54.140> shorter

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
you got a short hair like me or shorter

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.850 
you got a short hair like me or shorter
hair<00:01:54.770> rather<00:01:55.100> then<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.329> yellow<00:01:57.020> flexi<00:01:57.619> rods

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
hair rather then the yellow flexi rods

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.610 
hair rather then the yellow flexi rods
will<00:01:58.159> probably<00:01:58.789> be<00:01:59.060> best<00:01:59.270> for<00:01:59.750> you

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.720 

okay<00:02:03.620> so<00:02:03.680> now<00:02:04.040> I'm<00:02:04.160> done<00:02:04.280> putting<00:02:04.550> the
