that you know we want to sort of attack
the<00:00:40.700> challenge<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.450> we<00:00:41.600> have<00:00:41.629> against<00:00:42.350> a

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
the challenge that we have against a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.640 
the challenge that we have against a
very<00:00:42.590> good<00:00:42.680> team

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.920 

I<00:00:45.770> think<00:00:46.700> with<00:00:46.820> everything<00:00:47.060> that<00:00:47.330> happens<00:00:47.720> you

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
I think with everything that happens you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.780 
I think with everything that happens you
know<00:00:48.050> every<00:00:48.290> time<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:48.620> have<00:00:48.800> graduation<00:00:49.520> every

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
know every time we have graduation every

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.400 
know every time we have graduation every
time<00:00:49.970> school<00:00:50.300> starts<00:00:50.690> every<00:00:50.930> time<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.260> have<00:00:51.380> a

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
time school starts every time we have a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.080 
time school starts every time we have a
football<00:00:51.860> game<00:00:52.040> every<00:00:52.340> halftime<00:00:52.790> we<00:00:52.910> have<00:00:53.060> a

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
football game every halftime we have a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.020 
football game every halftime we have a
major<00:00:53.360> event<00:00:53.630> here<00:00:54.140> I<00:00:54.290> think<00:00:55.250> it<00:00:55.430> makes<00:00:55.760> people

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
major event here I think it makes people

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.870 
major event here I think it makes people
feel<00:00:56.330> more<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.840> more<00:00:56.960> normal<00:00:57.590> about<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.700> way

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
feel more and more normal about the way

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.990 
feel more and more normal about the way
things<00:00:59.570> are<00:00:59.870> going<00:00:59.900> I<00:01:00.460> think<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.820> leadership

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
things are going I think the leadership

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.950 
things are going I think the leadership
on<00:01:02.480> our<00:01:02.630> team<00:01:02.870> did<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.140> phenomenal<00:01:03.350> job<00:01:03.770> of

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
on our team did a phenomenal job of

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.110 
on our team did a phenomenal job of
contributing<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.230> to<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.190> help<00:01:07.910> other

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
contributing to the to the to help other

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.120 
contributing to the to the to help other
people<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:08.660> I<00:01:09.260> think<00:01:09.290> that<00:01:09.740> was<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.950> great

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
people and I think that was a great

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.220 
people and I think that was a great
opportunity<00:01:10.460> for<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.540> players<00:01:11.780> on<00:01:12.020> our<00:01:12.050> team

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
opportunity for the players on our team

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.460 
opportunity for the players on our team
to<00:01:13.210> get<00:01:14.210> some<00:01:14.420> positive<00:01:14.600> self<00:01:15.080> gratification

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
to get some positive self gratification

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.609 
to get some positive self gratification
from<00:01:15.980> serving<00:01:16.490> somebody<00:01:16.910> else<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.320> think

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
from serving somebody else and I think

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.620 
from serving somebody else and I think
that<00:01:18.830> they<00:01:19.040> still<00:01:19.729> feel<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> little<00:01:20.240> bit<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:20.540> a

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
that they still feel a little bit of a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.180 
that they still feel a little bit of a
responsibility<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.590> obligation<00:01:21.650> to

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
responsibility and obligation to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.400 
responsibility and obligation to
continue<00:01:22.400> to<00:01:22.760> do<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.360> by<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:23.960> way<00:01:24.110> they

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
continue to do that and by the way they

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.740 
continue to do that and by the way they
play<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:25.100> know<00:01:25.220> maybe<00:01:25.369> that<00:01:25.640> does<00:01:25.910> you<00:01:26.630> know

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
play you know maybe that does you know

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.140 
play you know maybe that does you know
something<00:01:27.200> for<00:01:27.350> all<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.650> as<00:01:27.830> well<00:01:28.090> but<00:01:29.090> I

something for all that as well but I

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.940

even though there was a lot of cleanup

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
team I think as coaches you know we all

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.990 
team I think as coaches you know we all
we<00:02:08.390> all<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:09.200> routines<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:10.520> know<00:02:10.640> we<00:02:10.850> all

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
we all like routines you know we all

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.240 
we all like routines you know we all
like<00:02:11.300> once<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.810> get<00:02:11.990> in<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.200> routine<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:13.220> know

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
like once you get in a routine you know

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.980 
like once you get in a routine you know
you<00:02:13.400> feel<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.180> know<00:02:14.390> what<00:02:14.630> you're<00:02:14.840> going

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
you feel like you know what you're going

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.080 
you feel like you know what you're going
to<00:02:15.110> expect<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:16.100> know<00:02:16.250> each<00:02:16.490> day<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.910> every

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
to expect you know each day and every

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.720 
to expect you know each day and every
player<00:02:17.240> knows<00:02:17.540> what<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.960> expect<00:02:18.350> each<00:02:18.470> day<00:02:18.730> but

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
player knows what to expect each day but

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.280 
player knows what to expect each day but
i<00:02:19.850> also<00:02:20.000> think<00:02:20.210> when<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.690> play<00:02:20.870> eight<00:02:21.050> games

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
i also think when you play eight games

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.170 
i also think when you play eight games
in<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.560> row<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.950> like<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:22.640> did<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.990> may<00:02:24.890> be

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
in a row like like we did that may be

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.800 
in a row like like we did that may be
physically<00:02:26.180> emotionally<00:02:27.310> psychologically

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
physically emotionally psychologically

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.630 
physically emotionally psychologically
mentally<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.080> mean<00:02:30.440> every<00:02:31.010> way<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.520> can

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
mentally I mean every way that you can

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.080 
mentally I mean every way that you can
think<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:33.740> probably<00:02:34.010> need<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> rest<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
think of you probably need a rest and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.270 
think of you probably need a rest and
maybe<00:02:35.210> maybe<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.200> was<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> good<00:02:36.680> thing<00:02:36.740> now

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
maybe maybe that was a good thing now

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.940 
maybe maybe that was a good thing now
you<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.270> when<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.570> come<00:02:38.720> out<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:38.960> play<00:02:39.050> you

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
you know when you come out and play you

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.620 
you know when you come out and play you
know<00:02:40.040> how<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.280> play<00:02:40.580> sort<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.120> determines

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
know how you play sort of determines

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.880 
know how you play sort of determines
whether<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.080> was<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> good<00:02:42.440> thing<00:02:42.620> or<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.830> bad

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
whether it was a good thing or a bad

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.280 
whether it was a good thing or a bad
thing<00:02:43.040> but<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.760> think<00:02:44.150> if<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.660> ask<00:02:44.870> every

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
thing but I think if you ask every

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.370 
thing but I think if you ask every
player<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:46.790> probably<00:02:47.090> would<00:02:47.570> say<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.110> at

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
player they probably would say that at

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.930 
player they probably would say that at
this<00:02:48.770> point<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.220> season<00:02:49.400> after<00:02:49.730> eight

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
this point in the season after eight

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.190 
this point in the season after eight
straight<00:02:50.240> weeks<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.660> playing<00:02:50.840> pretty<00:02:51.110> good

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
straight weeks of playing pretty good

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.970 
straight weeks of playing pretty good
competition<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:53.150> was<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.390> welcome<00:02:53.980> sort

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
competition that it was a welcome sort

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.720 
competition that it was a welcome sort
of<00:02:55.130> change<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.910> help<00:02:56.420> them<00:02:56.660> sort<00:02:56.990> of<00:02:57.140> recover

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
of change to help them sort of recover

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.520 
of change to help them sort of recover
physically<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.030> emotionally<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.900> the
