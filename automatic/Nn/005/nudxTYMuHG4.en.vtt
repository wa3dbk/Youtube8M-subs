picture that you've drawn all right I

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.830 
picture that you've drawn all right I
didn't<00:03:09.709> make<00:03:09.800> any<00:03:10.040> texture<00:03:10.489> on<00:03:10.670> her<00:03:10.700> fins<00:03:11.570> and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
didn't make any texture on her fins and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.990 
didn't make any texture on her fins and
it<00:03:12.050> looks<00:03:12.230> like<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.440> should<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.519> I'm<00:03:13.670> gonna<00:03:13.850> use

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
it looks like I should so I'm gonna use

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.600 
it looks like I should so I'm gonna use
a<00:03:14.030> pencil<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.630> do<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.019> first

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.370 

and<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:18.270> I'll<00:03:18.420> pull<00:03:18.660> out

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
and then I'll pull out

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.860 
and then I'll pull out
again<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.970> good<00:03:21.120> idea<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.600> get<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
again it's just a good idea to get the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
again it's just a good idea to get the
general<00:03:22.170> idea

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
general idea

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.980 
general idea
always<00:03:23.430> with<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.610> pencil<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.300> then<00:03:24.660> with<00:03:24.960> a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
always with a pencil and then with a

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.690 
always with a pencil and then with a
marker<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.460> so<00:03:26.670> much<00:03:26.850> easier<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.240> fix

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
marker this is so much easier to fix

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.760 
marker this is so much easier to fix
if<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.390> don't<00:03:30.260> like<00:03:30.410> your<00:03:30.530> pencil<00:03:30.950> lines<00:03:35.770> so

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
if you don't like your pencil lines so

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.870 
if you don't like your pencil lines so
my<00:03:37.010> favorite<00:03:37.520> part<00:03:37.550> is<00:03:38.180> always<00:03:39.050> erasing<00:03:39.890> and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
my favorite part is always erasing and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.610
