in<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.650> help<00:04:53.800> us<00:04:54.009> to<00:04:54.129> build<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.460> part<00:04:54.759> the

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
in to help us to build this part the

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.140 
in to help us to build this part the
domes<00:04:55.689> are<00:04:56.050> all<00:04:56.439> made<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.830> local<00:04:57.520> clay<00:04:57.729> local

domes are all made in local clay local

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.570 
domes are all made in local clay local
mud<00:04:58.360> which<00:04:59.319> gives<00:04:59.620> about<00:04:59.860> Arthur<00:05:00.280> feeling

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
mud which gives about Arthur feeling

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.330 
mud which gives about Arthur feeling
hence<00:05:00.789> the<00:05:01.300> name<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:01.870> earth<00:05:02.050> star<00:05:02.439> I<00:05:02.650> think

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
hence the name the earth star I think

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.249 
hence the name the earth star I think
