 She would have moaned in pain! Forced people forgiveness 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.680

 the whole planet. To suddenly not hear

 last children's cry, Think about living it !!! " 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.900
 Ah, if the earth could speak! 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.330
 She would say so to people:

 "Enough to feud, is it better not to live in peace, 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.000
 Keeping your land under the sun loyalty? 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:13.000
 After all, you plow me, because you walk on me.
