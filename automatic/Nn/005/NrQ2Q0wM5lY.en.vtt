different<00:00:31.260> something<00:00:31.890> less<00:00:32.130> expensive

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
different something less expensive

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.010

here's<00:00:33.570> keep<00:00:33.780> askin<00:00:35.180> some<00:00:36.180> projections<00:00:36.960> show

here's keep askin some projections show

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
here's keep askin some projections show
diamonds<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.219> shorter<00:00:38.760> supply<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
diamonds to be in shorter supply in the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.020 
diamonds to be in shorter supply in the
future<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.559> how<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.340> your<00:00:41.520> hands<00:00:41.940> on

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
future so how can you get your hands on

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.990 
future so how can you get your hands on
less<00:00:42.390> expensive<00:00:43.110> diamonds<00:00:43.379> maybe<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.430> third

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
less expensive diamonds maybe a third

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.810 
less expensive diamonds maybe a third
cheaper<00:00:45.690> here's<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.739> answer<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.700> are

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
cheaper here's one answer but there are

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.529 
cheaper here's one answer but there are
shades<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.360> gray<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.430> shades<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.640> yellow<00:00:50.670> from

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
shades of gray and shades of yellow from

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.020 
shades of gray and shades of yellow from
so<00:00:51.930> many<00:00:52.079> different<00:00:52.410> angles<00:00:52.770> diamonds<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so many different angles diamonds are a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.279 
so many different angles diamonds are a
cornerstone<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.840> life<00:00:56.750> supposedly<00:00:57.750> formed
