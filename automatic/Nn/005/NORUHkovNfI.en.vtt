00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.609
 good evening to you all 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 introduce the star to get it 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.300
 or at least its interface 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 of administration and so we're going 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.550
 start by using the application that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.099
 is provided with the nas directly on 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.920
 cd so by opening it you'll have it like 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.610
 these will allow you to list all 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.129
 the nas available on your lan or any 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.410
 at least the asus comes out in duplicate 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.210
 clicking here you have the interface 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.030
 administration 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:52.440
 just log in here is a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.210
 administration interface as it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.140
 appears for the first time at 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.760
 some explanations ready and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.789
 the discovery assistant who normally 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.090
 so it starts looking very much like a 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.979
 bones with pretty square icons 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.659
 although now she is not in 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.380
 fat design we find above of 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.630
 basis of what to control the access of 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.220
 users to add one it's 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.220
 simple just write here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.140
 hop we can define the role 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.240
 administrator or restrict it to 2.3 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.000
 weaker and so here we have 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.119
 created a new user we 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.300
 can we communicate a login ourselves 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.680
 and a password and a web address 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.540
 with which he can connect to 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.030
 this administration interface 6 and 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.680
 access for example folders 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.470
 shared online or in folders 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.860
 shared on the network that are round 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.759
 restricted access speaking of access 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.369
 shared online 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.570
 we can consult the different 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:18.060
 documents that are here directly via 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.440
 internet in the central app that we 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.510
 allows to manage so all 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 applications on the nas 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.720
 we have the applications installed 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.850
 basic there is none 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.010
 and all the others so for the bets 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.829
 up to date will be listed here the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.340
 textbook installations are possible 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.980
 by selecting apk files and in 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.660
 upload them here is a newspaper the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.260
 facilities we have a lot 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.450
 many applications that are here 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.780
 but we do not have as for the at home 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.870
 competitor synology the possibility of 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.200
 put auxiliary deposits 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.220
 users 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.280
 but we still have them 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.519
 applications already that originally wrong asus 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.799
 that they are pretty good among these 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.030
 we find will miss especially cervarix 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.269
 which will allow you to enjoy 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.549
 fully from your hdmi output and 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.799
 to use two applications such as 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.160
 the portal adjuster which is a portal 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.850
 access to chrome xbmc and others 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.200
 applications you have installed among 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.840
 the popular apps you have 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.160
 xbmc which is a media player that you 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.500
 will watch movies listen 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.530
 music watching pictures 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.240
 directly on the hdmi port you can 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.970
 control 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.320
 xbmc through your phone with 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.360
 cathy be with your smartphone to 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.820
 through the wifi with the app app 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.890
 blind or also not with a remote 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.270
 Logitech infrared or remote control 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.820
 infrared offer precisely you have 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.060
 also the latest applications 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.470
 developed for this model there who you 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.570
 will install suddenly 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.860
 latest versions or news if 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.980
 you keep up to date on the outputs 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.590
 developments you also have by 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.230
 category because no it's nice 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.190
 but we do not always know what it's like 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.890
 of each application 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.540
 for example to do management 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.430
 content we have all these 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.010
 applications there with wikis cms 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.660
 to make your websites and you 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.220
 also have applications in beta this 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.630
 therefore untested applications 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.250
 in the backup application and 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.740
 restoration you will find what 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.090
 synchronize at 4.5 for 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.110
 back up folders from the 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.860
 ftp backup to backup ftp on 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.040
 the nas or save the nas on an ftp 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.880
 the same for external hard drives 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.880
 etc., etc 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.700
 you also have an activity monitor 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.230
 to know what are the resources 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:05.030
 consumed on your nas to know which 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.950
 percentage of cpu and what 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.750
 solicit the CPU for example you 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.370
 want to see the consumption of cepeo 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.650
 watching a video you launch this 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.000
 application you launch a video and 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.890
 you look at what it gives to the 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.210
 cpu also valid for the memory 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:23.800
 the network the use of the disk and the 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.800
 different processes in state 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.919
 you have something to manage 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.680
 here we see that we have close to 1 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.820
 with a volume 1 of capacities 3tera because 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.470
 we use records 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.850
 3tera dwd raid of course among the 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.979
 system information you have two 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.449
 three interesting tricks such as the 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:54.460
 version of the administration system the 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:59.020
 duration of use my email address at 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.860
 case where the model of the nas its processor 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.610
 so one atom at 1 giga hertz of heart 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.550
 four helpers 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.320
 a gigabyte of memory and that the processor 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.419
 is currently 72 secret what me 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.840
 seems a lot 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:15.699
 network level we are unreported 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:21.160
 on the network the public ip address 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:22.090
 the private ip address and that's pretty much 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.620
 all there is interesting 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.060
 the event log the 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.710
 connected users so for 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.570
 the moment there is only me and a doctor 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.080
 to the story to see this when there is 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.130
 problems 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.729
 do a little technos tic them 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:38.110
 applications on the set of par2 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.760
 that there are no worries even three by 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.930
 three or four by four as much as 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.000
 you do not want as much as you want 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:49.240
 if you will for example display 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.310
 led as well as configure what is said 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.380
 in the same help 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.120
 the help is pretty well damn well 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.900
 categorize with a search field 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.900
 which is always useful 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.000
 what else can you say you have the 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.570
 possibility to make small adjustments 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.570
 restart or stopped 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:13.660
 you have something too if I do not 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.820
 not deceive enable or disable port 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.600
 hdmi 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.660
 what to enable or disable ignition 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.460
 diodes in order to be able to pass a 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.320
 night without being disturbed by the light 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.440
 which flashes hard drives that 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.880
 scratch and that's about it all so 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.710
 you have questions do not hesitate to 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.420
 leave a comment or on the forum 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.090
 from cowcotland or on the site of 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.660
 cowcotland and so I wish you a 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.660
 have a good day
