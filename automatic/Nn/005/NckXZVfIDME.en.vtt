00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 I got there I got there around 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.000

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.160
 confusion has started there was a lot of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.199
 people there because it was not big 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.870
 At least I understood at first and spoke 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.030
 that I had to stay in a room 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.890
 It's getting there, the guy does not allow 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 entrance into the room he talked about entering 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 with the game or that's where you start 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.740
 to see the organization of the event is fine 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.659

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.659

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.740
 Calm down there to go back

 when I was leaving more people on

 very much in the midst of everyone is 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.979
 The main thing is to meet a girlfriend who

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.880

 I get there though is to direct to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.360
 My house I walked 100 km up 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.820

 Paul I stayed an hour in the traffic but 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.599
 We can go to hell to get there because 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.540
 she says that although old though not 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.599
 wanna leave, no 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.010
 It was good, I'm not leaving. I was late. 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.180
 time to arrive an hour when you 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.980
 Are you going to have to go to the room? 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.569
 Only I said so let me in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.609
 That's when he said it was for me. 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.260
 wanted to take me into the room he 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.400
 called in the room I got there I found the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.439
 people should be seeing now 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.549
 I found personal stuff, and that's it. 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.170
 world began to explain that it was 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.760
 happening, I'll explain to you 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.859
 Now what they told me is 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.129
 What happened was the following to the 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.629
 bookstore is in question that gave 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.840
 provided the space for an exit 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.939
 Buttars did not expect the strength of 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.519
 youtube games like this 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.980
 they expected to know about 400 500 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.139
 people who had a lot of people there 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.090
 a lot of people were told yesterday one thousand and two hundred 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.730
 for more people 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.280
 he will be a type not even 500 people were from 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.629
 50 people in place and training then 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.700
 wait a little bit for us 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.040
 lung people burst was very cool 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.810
 It was very hard, there were a lot of people there. 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.970
 the problem was not really having much 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.090
 the problem is greater achievement of 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.500
 bookstore and the mall are no 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.060
 get people under control 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.650
 they were not able to control and 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.049
 put the blame on us 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.459
 speaking that occupy ours that people 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.629
 had taken those people will be the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.299
 I already went there because we went 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.889
 invited to the event, then I 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.629
 I wanted to leave it here for you. 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.440
 My apologies and I think in the name 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.180
 of all the people, sorry you are 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.379
 I wish I had taken a photo I was 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.139
 very happy to be there was a lot 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.030
 happy was very happy same is e 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.709
 No plate to take photo with. 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.209
 No one could give an autograph that 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.159
 No one wanted to hug each of you. 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.269
 Give a kiss on everyone's forehead . 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.459
 a staff was able to take a picture with me 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.889
 It already made me very happy if I stayed. 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.290
 very sad on the part of the organization 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.790
 the mall's bookstore is not 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.019
 supporting and then we have to 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.329
 to run away 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.010
 This is the word that runs away from you. 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.689
 Because the mall said it was 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.729
 people leaving the show is leaving the mall 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.139
 they simply took us out there 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.849
 Speaking like that, you can not stay 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.129
 here you have to leave here because 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.569
 keyboard with the hot head has just 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.650
 get there and make sure I leave the 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.229
 shopping I stayed in how long the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.849
 We talked for an hour or so and already had 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.989
 and I had to though I understood I was 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.599
 with my girlfriend still with my brother-in-law 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.639
 they had to know how to face everything 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:22.580
 that problem knows that you were having 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.970
 A lack of organization of the fuck is 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.120
 from the bookstore 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.130
 and beauty neither the cool part my father had 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.540
 with that you have to leave to play 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.700
 and we could not pass in the middle of 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.370
 because it was not going to cause much 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.040
 it's a lot of total push-push 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.900
 So, what happened, we got out. 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.380
 to be by the roof of old type shopping 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.090
 epic the type of idea was there that is 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.490
 Thank impossible stuff we have 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.050
 to be by the roof of the mall there 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.060
 in the hail in the back of a small room 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.220
 who was here a ladder should be 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.620
 with you are watching the video with the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.870
 maybe even a few feet up there 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.550
 finish climbing the ladder and we had 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.980
 that putting people off had to run away 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.510
 over the mall linked type movem 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.860
 In shift he is lying as he was 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.870
 too dark, too much to see 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.980
 so much that neither film the film then looks 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.270
 that it was a little clearer that it had 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.250
 some lights, something 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.570
 and then we had to go out there 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.330
 We left the back of the mall. 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.750
 very interconnected type of globe 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.550

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.390
