00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.850
 hi friends this time we are going to 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.520
 do the 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.750
 the accuser of the bancal where I have 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.060
 peppers and tomatoes has already been talked about in 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.150
 another video about what are the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.520
 benefits or why to make a 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.860
 quilted also called a lot in 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.920
 our garden 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.379
 remember basically that keep the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.559
 soil moisture and prevent the 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.370
 plants touch the ground directly 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.040
 avoiding in this way diseases that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.110
 they can affect and come from the ground 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.970
 is our positive we also avoid 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.460
 in the hottest months such as the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.070
 of the summer that is when we produce in 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.970
 the components of our garden 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.340
 more than eggplant peppers and so on 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.409
 we avoid 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.840
 direct solar radiation on the 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.829
 soil which favors the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.130
 maintenance of the structure thereof 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:26.469
 and avoiding solar radiation is avoided 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.500
 Soil temperature and per share 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.880
 of water soil moisture and this 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.130
 it also comes very well to the plant 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.420
 although it does not have as much temperature because 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 there is not so much water stress 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:47.350
 well I'm saying practically all the 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.350
 bancal lacks a meter 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:20.860
 the time for diameters 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.860
 herbs of many very small diameters 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.210
 trunks of weed shrubs a 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.210
 little thicker 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.550
 because the bad ones can be there 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.130
 coming herbs 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.520
 we take care a little bit we are putting them in 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.250
 the bench 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.580
 leave also another advice that straw 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.100
 be dry if we make a cut and it's 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.940
 low or this grass is wet leave it 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.790
 dry in the sun for a few days the dais 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.740
 Turn it around so that it is well dried in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.540
 fermentation is that they can cause 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.560
 bad odors and phytosanitary problems 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.870
 in the plants agree if that's what 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:23.070
 we use with more effective reason 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.070
 very many any leave it 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:38.240
 and containment to avoid with the idea 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.430
 that water 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:47.270
 until the driver is not performing 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.800
 out this is more or less hard 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.340
 this way we're going to allow the 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:57.170
 irrigation does not go through the terraces and 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.410
 they do not have any kind of wood and the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.410
 Water 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.890
 that's why we are 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.539
 just bing I do as he believes and never 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.060
 we break the surface crust in the 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:31.010
 ground 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.720
 we eliminate want to see I have left in the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.930
 surface 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.289
 I used it with such a big hoe 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.180
 careful to perform the work on 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.840
 in the plants in this case we are 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.260
 on wood 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.120
 not hit the floor at any time I 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.120
 I limit myself to making an exile 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:06.400
 divine and as you see a return 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.249
 OK 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:14.249
 and now I have here 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:34.210
 this amount of grass and we're going to 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:37.020
 favor the retention of water avoiding 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.020
 the evaporation 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.270
 and we are depositing 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.590
 the stage 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:20.139
 to you the kind of needs and 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.580
 your characteristics 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.580
 characteristics of your web 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.529
 I like it 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:37.829
 what I do is interesting and it turns out 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.829
 Useful 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.289
 and we have it covered as you see 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.210
 no no 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:08.310
 the padding as you already know from other 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.310
 Sometimes I have not shown them on video 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.960
 apply it also to the streets 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.620
 previously he will have given a cut 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:22.090
 there are currently in the streets that do not 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.090
 they have padding 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:36.320
 but that is useful as has already been said 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.320
 and I'm going to show you now 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.789
 but that looks good 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:59.140
 and this would be many thanks a 

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.140
 greeting and until another day
