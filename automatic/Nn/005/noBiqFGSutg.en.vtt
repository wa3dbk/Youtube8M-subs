00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.319
 and people along the Etterbeek spectrum once more technically and performs 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.080
 this week I have chosen quite a few minutes and it is going down 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.520
 other about it and the next generation of consoles 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.040
 where also started last year 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.300
 that will be with you about what you see on the displays then will 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.860
 I certainly sent this to me five times a week 15 there he 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.099
 certainly sent Prince five times to people aged 8 2 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.269
 and to use it in the sewer just at the last minute I have been there 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.010
 to see 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.840
 because that is just a delicious and delicious piece of points here 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.820
 and I certainly 25 5 too strong for quivest because of the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.450
 do what you want you not only that is just very much about paris 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.690
 just nice around 14 o'clock world 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.590
 actually it does not know itself on earth with recess is a bit of a cunt 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.940
 can go around in that world 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 Only the GT500 has more to do in that world 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.280
 this trendy comes a children's run both come out and dancers go dry for years 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.660
 the current 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.630
 both don't just want five as a milk goat 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.630
 but I have time the piece from bold previous record came out 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.740
 within a few days just the car and got into New York 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.090
 billiard dollars in revenue 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.670
 passed away and that is of course too much of a mess 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.390
 but we can talk about that 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.020
 falls start here from it falls 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.250
 You can of course all fall 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.480
 probably the stone 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.950
 except live 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.340
 then imagine and 10 furthermore his performance includes more titles 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.390
 but they are the most important things that you are following 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.980
 year 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.680
 They have announced that they have their own 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.910
 and once also come everything the seller is six 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.050
 operating system 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.689
 and rising prices 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.860
 send the lesson to market 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.330
 and they said that this is a free on the operating system for example 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.300
 that is a bit like and by the way it is actually alone and black is not free 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.009
 but you know what i mean 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.460
 it needs a little bit 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
 and becoming a target of the computer only for free 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.940
 what she mainly with the toll demands what was already announced people what they 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.090
 mainly wanting to do with it is to give people the functionality 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.030
 denys of a computer 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.460
 Stream with steam to, for example, a device in the living room 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.879
 if used 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.409
 and therefore they can 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.130
 We have streamed your living room to the TV for the game 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.750
 and they also announced 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.130
 that he turned out to be several companies we are going to collaborate also for bolt the music 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.030
 or TV or movie services 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.129
 to spend if everything goes well with a little netflix that actually does 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.039
 but where I am mainly at the moment that most of you are interested 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.389
 whether it can really be in independent operating system such as min 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.099
 if that is or how you like it or that it will be a kind of peel as known 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.650
 being over the with sand hem 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.550
 those things peel over and never do that is one with a hater cissÃ© and painter 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.180
 across 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.500
 or that it will become the scaffolding distance system 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.490
 and if the latter, then I doubt whether people will install that much 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.789
 because tonight they are familiar with often and there 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.799
 run all kinds of programs on basically everything and if you have to 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.719
 switching next to being specially not very smart I don't think that much 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.329
 people are going to do that but it is not the sand development mainly 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.119
 because they will probably be embarrassed by their own racing team soon 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.549
 going to announce and stop one's own 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.669
 compost 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.759
 what I then immediately go but a group of compasses are always there 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.979
 very nice bridge and that goes into the series a and they have announced 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.929
 or rather 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.259
 that consoles never become more powerful than computers 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.040
 in the flesh the aim is the battlefield bosch such a flat de 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.579
 prices rose it's worth 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.939
 just as powerful or more powerful than ever 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.649
 psv heart became that moment 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:53.009
 that is actually completely gone now and he puts that as the main reason 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.139
 is because, for example, Sony 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.880
 microsoft and nintendo 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.420
 they can no longer do everything themselves, and also that they can no longer do self-research 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.739
 but graphic chips 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.669
 after processors to 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.180
 employers things like that 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.060
 and as a result, they are now purchasing this from companies that have specialized 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.459
 are for points 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.939
 the municipality would have taken place says three years after 9 and 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:18.259
 At processors you end up with the team to be able to stick to the rules 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.259
 Be the things in advance memory is called hard drives 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.330
 commit yes 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.360
 PCs will always be more powerful than consoles and there I am 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.659
 agree 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.599
 then on over the places traffic often of a hit nice to work with 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.189
 that will be the first said that the playstation 4 bought at a loss and 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.449
 so the places will be sold to open the cable market at 99 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.729
 euro and sony that turned out so that meant so much that making the 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.870
 console is of course 399 euros 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.620
 and that was also the case for the playstation 3 in the end 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.260
 are the cost for the ps a dimmer has gone down and there she still makes 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.790
 profits are running but in the beginning it was just like now with the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.970
 playstation 4 they have to get the profits out of for example extra 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.250
 for the buttons false system guilty if they hit like checkers and 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.250
 that the cameras you hear things like that 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.699
 that people buy that kind of products is experienced in vianen and me 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.549
 profitable but yes it was about next generation consoles I want 

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:26.059
 soon the latest news review that is about par was 7 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.539
 He certainly came out of the internet especially Apple iPod all chances 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.430
 but i became 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.570
 and he received support seven times before game comes worded 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.539
 and that is nothing deme on your iphone 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.110
 and yes really a new experience I indicated that game but on the ai 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.730
 from 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.830
 that often does not work well with, for example 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.160
 shooters because you 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.620
 you have 2 give you no physical buttons and that just feels very good 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.509
 very kutwijf mainly shooters 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.550
 the comedian and control saver warriors 7 so for the iphone and the ipad 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.680
 and then you can just play a shooting game with normal flicker with normal 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.980
 the property steaks and such 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.310
 actually just so states the ps vita is only then on your smartphone according to the 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.940
 newspaper 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.479
 and i think that deme on for example so yeah right van and arjen pet really one 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.020
 give a big boost in any case 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.229
 the experience you have because it works now and then it just really works this way 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.539
 the game comes a group of archbold or high from the parquet 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.210
 he would like to close this question to you 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.319
 would your child think pose for your skin or buy your ipad so that you are on you 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.350
 ever the parquet goes deme there I am so curious about whether 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.540
 for example, do you prefer the price is a guitar 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.510
 on the nintendo 3ds figure 2 ds let it know in the comments were the fia nice 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.660
 I like the case very much if you can just leave it at that 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.070
 wondering if this week the home help can get thumbs up cia than they do 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.200
 that really vab not great and then don't leave your interest for it 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.860
 look and remember that we are now on me with a nephew seems smeared but 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.030
 want to see from me 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.920
 and then pots won week later
