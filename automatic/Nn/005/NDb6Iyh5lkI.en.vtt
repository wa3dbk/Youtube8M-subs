foot<00:00:15.660> brakes<00:00:16.520> if<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.640> breaks<00:00:17.760> at<00:00:17.970> all<00:00:18.529> it's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
foot brakes if it breaks at all it's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.660 
foot brakes if it breaks at all it's
been<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:19.949> quite<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> while<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
been like that for quite a while and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
been like that for quite a while and
that<00:00:21.420> only<00:00:21.539> applies<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> front<00:00:22.320> wheels

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that only applies to the front wheels

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.150 
that only applies to the front wheels
though<00:00:22.619> because<00:00:22.769> we've<00:00:22.980> actually

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
though because we've actually

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.640 
though because we've actually
disconnected<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> bat<00:00:24.210> ones<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
disconnected the bat ones so that's a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.050 
disconnected the bat ones so that's a
separate<00:00:25.949> issue<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> separate<00:00:26.640> issues<00:00:26.910> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
separate issue the separate issues that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
separate issue the separate issues that
the<00:00:27.119> handbrake<00:00:27.510> drags<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.019> unless<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.070> have

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the handbrake drags on unless you have

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
the handbrake drags on unless you have
it<00:00:29.369> half<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.000> hamri<00:00:30.420> doesn't

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it half on and hamri doesn't

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
it half on and hamri doesn't
work<00:00:30.960> she's<00:00:31.740> basically<00:00:31.949> been<00:00:32.250> caused<00:00:32.520> by

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
work she's basically been caused by

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.729 
work she's basically been caused by
ripping<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> handbrake<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.510> reverse<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
ripping the handbrake in reverse and the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
ripping the handbrake in reverse and the
line<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.100> basically<00:00:35.430> grip<00:00:35.670> drums<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.360> they

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
line was basically grip drums and they

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.970 
line was basically grip drums and they
get<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.719> sort<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> torn<00:00:37.290> around<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
get all sort of torn around the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.740 
get all sort of torn around the
inside<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> brakes<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:39.300> plays<00:00:39.510> hell<00:00:39.690> with

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
inside of the brakes it plays hell with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.270 
inside of the brakes it plays hell with
it<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.110> remember<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.950> we're<00:00:41.100> sort

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it and remember going bit so we're sort

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850 
it and remember going bit so we're sort
of<00:00:41.309> making<00:00:41.550> 36<00:00:41.940> bits<00:00:42.420> fit<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.590> Chris<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
of making 36 bits fit so Chris is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.940 
of making 36 bits fit so Chris is
lashing<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:46.670> how<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:48.239> bend<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> vise

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
lashing it up how to bend it in the vise

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.479 
lashing it up how to bend it in the vise
so<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.850> bleeding<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> front<00:00:51.420> brakes

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
so I'm just bleeding the front brakes

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.340 
so I'm just bleeding the front brakes
see<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.760> sort<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.350> hopefully

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
see if I can sort that out hopefully

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.569 
see if I can sort that out hopefully
that's<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> fix<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.250> too<00:00:56.399> sure

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that's going to fix it I'm not too sure

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
that's going to fix it I'm not too sure
why<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.690> disappear<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.199> changing

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
why they just disappear we are changing

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.900 
why they just disappear we are changing
master<00:00:58.680> cylinder<00:00:58.980> ages<00:00:59.280> ago<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> pop

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
master cylinder ages ago because you pop

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.000 
master cylinder ages ago because you pop
that<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> put<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> master<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> off

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that so you put up a master on it off

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130 
that so you put up a master on it off
for<00:01:02.129> 36<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.850> possibly<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.480> ears<00:01:03.660> got<00:01:03.870> into

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
for 36 and possibly some ears got into

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
for 36 and possibly some ears got into
it<00:01:04.229> mirando<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.860> fluid<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.250> something<00:01:05.489> i

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it mirando and fluid or something i

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
it mirando and fluid or something i
SPECT<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.510> without<00:01:06.659> field<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.560> hopefully

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
SPECT one without field so hopefully

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
SPECT one without field so hopefully
it's<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:11.240> was<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.420> working

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's just a bit there I was out working

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.980 
it's just a bit there I was out working

a field earlier oh no I may have
accidentally<00:01:16.740> missed<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.729> may<00:01:18.299> have

accidentally missed a bit I I may have
accidentally<00:01:18.930> made<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> track<00:01:20.060> um<00:01:21.110> yeah<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> put

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
accidentally made a track um yeah I put

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
accidentally made a track um yeah I put
like<00:01:22.740> an<00:01:22.890> oval<00:01:23.159> track<00:01:23.400> basically<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.030> round

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
like an oval track basically right round

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789 
like an oval track basically right round
the<00:01:24.270> outside<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.750> field<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the outside of that field it's going to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.310 
the outside of that field it's going to
be<00:01:25.920> plowed<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.400> few<00:01:26.580> weeks<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.390> thought<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
be plowed in a few weeks but I thought I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
be plowed in a few weeks but I thought I
was<00:01:28.829> ripping<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> over<00:01:29.369> I'd<00:01:29.460> leave<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:29.939> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
was ripping it over I'd leave a bit so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.429 
was ripping it over I'd leave a bit so
we<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.270> take<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:30.930> trash<00:01:31.229> out

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
we can take it for a good trash out

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.340 
we can take it for a good trash out
there<00:01:34.729> right<00:01:35.869> finished<00:01:36.869> being<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> brakes

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
there right finished being the brakes

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
there right finished being the brakes
had<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> standard-issue<00:01:38.400> break<00:01:38.759> nipple

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
had a standard-issue break nipple

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.850 
had a standard-issue break nipple
failure<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.869> bled<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> pipe<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
failure so I just bled out the pipe and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980 
failure so I just bled out the pipe and
for<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> first<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:41.970> basically<00:01:42.689> since<00:01:42.810> we've

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
for the first time basically since we've
