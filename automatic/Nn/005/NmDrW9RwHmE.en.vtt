00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.760
 two systems that is called formed by a natural community 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.179
 that is structured with the viatical components that is the living beings 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.109
 ecosystem 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.389
 the components also cosmic or the physical environment 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.019
 at home until it started to develop 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 between 1927 and 1930 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.229
 take into account the complex interactions between organisms 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.519
 plants 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.230
 animals 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.310
 bacteria 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.000
 wings 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 protists and even more 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 that form the community 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.100
 and the energy and material tricks that go through it 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.760
 the functioning of all ecosystems 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.120
 It's similar 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.730
 all that yes all in conscience p reading through the different components 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.470
 of the ecosystem 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.560
 Maintains life and immobilizes water in minerals and other components 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.690
 Ecosystem chemicals 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.740
 the fountain 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.540
 first and main 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.110
 of energy I am being 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.700
 In all ecosystems there is also a continuous movement of materials 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.580
 the different chemical elements 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.120
 it happens light injuries the water and air 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.930
 the organisms 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.790
 all living beings mistakes 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.010
 until I return 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.650
 would be 68 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.790
 to the ground goal average dollars 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.119
 seles demands the law 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.060
 the matter is recycled yes my key church 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.110
 although it is true the NGOs the inter 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.080
 at this height 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.480
 to save face scared 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.780
 the abstract is grateful for the affection in which the boxes 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 it is said that it is one hundred percent 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.060
 the risk with 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.790
 hands 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
 the past due loan manager 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.039
 for the ecosystems of the third date masks 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.079
 in mine although the exit totally to get wet 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.079
 jajajajajajajajajaja things are not what they were 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.299
 I am nothing like 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.719
 to achieve it the Buenosairean 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.989
 after leaving behind the proposal more 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.629
 all areas surrounding the cathedral 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.879
 always happens there is talk of sant joan 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.879
 to highlight 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.339
 the one that more has a great dimension the life of the alive beings 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.569
 Climatic factors make nature different environments 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.569
 in which life develops 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.369
 the relationship that exists between living beings and the finished environment 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.170
 creates a natural balance between the different species that inhabit it 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.879
 if it is altered 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.669
 great problems occur in nature 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.669
 and in the lives of all living beings 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.409
 the human being can influence ecosystems 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.489
 neglecting animal and plant species 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.489
 polluting the earth 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.769
 the occasion example 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.280
 that allows to understand the damage caused by the emission of gas fronts 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.599
 contaminants 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.049
 caused by the human shield and that has strongly altered the health of man 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.500
 Life on earth 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.659
 as it was suddenly said 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.719
 water depends, two thirds of the earth is covered with water 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.889
 salty and form a broad and complex ecosystem 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:47.059
 The landscapes of the earth can be characterized to enlarge features according to the 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.269
 total water availability 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.659
 and its temporary distribution 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.439
 the differences between a desert and a tropical forest are obvious 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.679
 and sometimes they find a few kilometers away 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:02.459
 although the marker to much of the earth and has always been an attractive 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.639
 for man 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.089
 because of its immensity man depends on fresh water 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.969
 the lakes reservoirs rivers 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.649
 although it occupies a minimal part of the surface of the continents 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.859
 maintains a very high diversity 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.589
 and they are the source of fresh water for all non-marine organisms 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.219
 it is in these ecosystems where the confrontation between the use of water by 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.439
 the man in front of the conservation of the resource becomes more and more patent 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:36.439
 The water hydrological cycle is the basis for the functioning of all 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.009
 guys continent systems 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.370
 the evaporation of water is the origin of the rain 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.560
 on which both plant production and runoff depend 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.599
 surface that will feed rivers and lakes 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.179
 rainwater can quickly drain into resources 

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:55.370
 fluvial that collect it 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.490
 infiltrate the substrate can be cured directly 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.469
 biotic resources 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.999
 are all those resources if they have life all the classic media 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.580
 specifically are all those resources 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.129
 definitely 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:16.569
 with this new service 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.210
 five luxury hotels develop eg trees 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.210
 animals 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.539
 at the same time 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:26.879
 I thought 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.240
 the interested associations 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.439
 in the part in terna ecosystems were conformed 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.089
 they are considered parts like wealth resistance 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.449
 the most injured 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.449
 the purple road accidents 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.449
 this morning and until the same 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.210
 partnerships 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.639
 three principles 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.330
 these dishonest acts or the external part 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.319
 that make up an ecosystem 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.389
 such as the athletic conditions in which ecosystems develop 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.969
 such as normality 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.259
 in the floors 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.800
 map of theological modifications and the degree of fragmentation which all 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.110
 as a whole, they allow us to assess the fragility 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.779
 inherent to each ecosystem
