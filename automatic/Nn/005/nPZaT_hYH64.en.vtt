for<00:02:19.230> word<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> field<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.100> firstly<00:02:20.790> a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
for word that the field is firstly a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.270 
for word that the field is firstly a
camera<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.870> that's<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.410> light<00:02:22.650> menu<00:02:23.100> here

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
camera so that's in the light menu here

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
camera so that's in the light menu here
and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.060> camera<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.770> there's<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.830> little

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
need um now to make this easier for let

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.220 
need um now to make this easier for let
the<00:02:37.950> field<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.760> get<00:02:38.910> may<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.269> into<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the field if we get may go into the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.640 
the field if we get may go into the
different<00:02:40.620> view<00:02:40.860> menu<00:02:41.640> um<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.780> let's<00:02:43.350> hop

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
different view menu um and let's hop

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.110 
different view menu um and let's hop
these<00:02:43.920> kind<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> what<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.519> need<00:02:44.730> unless

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
these kind of what you need unless

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.340 
these kind of what you need unless
you're<00:02:45.360> doing<00:02:45.600> some<00:02:45.840> different<00:02:45.959> different

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
you're doing some different different

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.570 
you're doing some different different
zones<00:02:48.350> yes<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.560> what<00:02:49.739> we<00:02:49.799> need<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> change<00:02:50.190> is

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
zones yes so what we need to change is

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.059 
zones yes so what we need to change is
in<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.850> attributes<00:02:51.510> menu<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.530> camera<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
in the attributes menu the camera a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.780 
in the attributes menu the camera a
camera<00:02:53.730> here<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.420> going<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.780> depth<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:56.670> can

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
camera here and going to depth we can

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.210 
camera here and going to depth we can
change<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.180> target<00:02:57.390> distance<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:59.070> is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
change the target distance is that is

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.370 
change the target distance is that is
where<00:02:59.730> we<00:02:59.760> want<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.540> camera<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:01.049> focused

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
where we want the camera to be focused

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.069 
where we want the camera to be focused
on<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:03.630> kind<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.870> want<00:03:04.049> it

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
on so we in this one we kind of want it

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.270 
on so we in this one we kind of want it
to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.410> round<00:03:05.250> here<00:03:06.410> as<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.560> see<00:03:07.590> when<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.160> go

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
to be round here as you see when you go

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.090 
to be round here as you see when you go
closer<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> focus<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.510> lot<00:03:09.900> shorter<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
closer in the focus a lot shorter the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.940 
closer in the focus a lot shorter the
GAO<00:03:11.280> take<00:03:11.910> us<00:03:12.030> all<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.420> lot<00:03:12.810> bigger<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:13.769> we

make<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.459> kind<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.669> the<00:04:05.729> basic<00:04:06.030> effects<00:04:06.299> we

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
make the kind of the basic effects we

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.900 
make the kind of the basic effects we
need<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.870> worry<00:04:07.049> about<00:04:07.139> is<00:04:07.470> blur<00:04:08.130> strength<00:04:08.699> fur

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
need to worry about is blur strength fur

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.599 
need to worry about is blur strength fur
um<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.560> moving<00:04:10.769> this<00:04:10.829> up<00:04:10.979> and<00:04:11.070> down<00:04:11.250> but<00:04:11.489> it

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
um so moving this up and down but it

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.699 
um so moving this up and down but it
goes<00:04:11.760> make<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.359> more<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:12.959> less<00:04:13.109> blow<00:04:13.350> in<00:04:13.620> the

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
goes make it more or less blow in the

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.670 
goes make it more or less blow in the
places<00:04:13.919> that<00:04:14.070> we've<00:04:14.310> specified<00:04:15.350> right<00:04:16.350> if<00:04:16.530> we

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
places that we've specified right if we

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.780 
places that we've specified right if we
now<00:04:16.859> render<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:19.079> looks<00:04:19.229> absolutely

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
now render this it looks absolutely

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.879 
now render this it looks absolutely
honorable<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.940> can<00:04:21.150> start<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.750> see<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:22.470> bit<00:04:22.860> of

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
honorable you can start to see a bit of

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.490 
honorable you can start to see a bit of
blur<00:04:23.280> come<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.270> these<00:04:24.389> last<00:04:24.600> ones<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.410> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
blur come on these last ones and to the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.700 
blur come on these last ones and to the
closer<00:04:25.770> ones<00:04:26.070> um<00:04:26.660> that's<00:04:27.660> not<00:04:27.870> achieve<00:04:28.380> that

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
closer ones um that's not achieve that

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.469 
closer ones um that's not achieve that
blurry<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.340> i<00:04:29.400> can<00:04:29.520> probably<00:04:29.699> put<00:04:30.090> up<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.270> blur

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479
