00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 if you are asked to buy 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.799
 will rate the shop 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:16.619
 then the spam is saying the dishes 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:17.760
 more on this in this video hello I am 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.840
 christian solmecke attorney and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.570
 partner of the Cologne media law firm 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 wild beuger &amp; solmecke sitting next to me 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 the well known dr carsten 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.900
 foischlich hi carsten of his mark 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.960
 She is sitting at her work trusted shops and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.030
 We are responsible for e-commerce 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.829
 I also have such mails 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.630
 Get carsten after every purchase 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.670
 Actually, they say they were 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.309
 please satisfied with the performance 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230
 rate us but I can get it too 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.910
 constantly and sometimes I do that too 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.370
 but mostly I do not feel like it 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.489
 and if I 'm looking for it myself yes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 when i find i rate and where and yes 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 that bothers me too much 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.219
 and yes, but it is very common 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.690
 and many do not seem to find that 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.000
 to have that it is nothing else than 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.470
 spam but that was just such a time 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.150
 player whose decision from 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.530
 amtsgericht dÃ¼sseldorf not the first 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.880
 decision of this kind but one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.549
 current decision 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.970
 and what is that decision too 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.100
 read 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.479
 quite simply say that if not and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 more greeks are in there please 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.320
 proven me then that is nothing 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 other than e-mail advertising and for ever 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.259
 I always need more advertising 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.070
 there is no consent 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.840
 exceptions 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.119
 that is nothing but when I am one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.150
 get newsletter or otherwise 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.950
 Concrete product advertising why because it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 also the so-called sales promotion 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.380
 serves and this advertising concept is very 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 that defines everything that means 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.860
 directly or indirectly 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 sales promotion is advertising and yes 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 because the court says why am I because 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.399
 want to have a rating because of me 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.570
 want to advertise the great I am 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.840
 and even if I do not 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.030
 I can also publish from it 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.759
 optimize a process and again 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.530
 times my paragraph improve so that works 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.579
 very very far this jurisdiction that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 I also find a far-reaching 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.289
 decision what should the entrepreneur 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.520
 now do as usual after that 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.990
 want to connect evaluation systems 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.399
 yes, of course we have with the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.590
 topic already busy because that yes 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.239
 not new is just this right there 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.349
 already judgments will be 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.500
 already appreciated 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.780
 and yes we have different tools around 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.280
 to obtain this consent 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 Calling ship in red lake button 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.930
 We where to go directly after the purchase 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.310
 I can say later to the 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.200
 be remembered 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.480
 then we get these from trusted shops 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.030
 consent and then send as well 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.260
 the e-mail or more 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.670
 possibilities also have sample texts the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.040
 you can obtain such consent 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.560
 is relatively little effort 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.170
 one builds additional checkbox to residents 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.120
 coupled with others 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.160
 consent texts and then I may 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.360
 so send these mails for 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.299
 I just do business 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.410
 an evaluation e-mail a purchase 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.139
 send afterwards 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.880
 rather a certified system 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.430
 Use that as well 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.430
 inquire first and then you are as 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.530
 Business people on the safe side 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.810
 Thank you Carsten for bringing this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.670
 We make a very important decision like me 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.700
 think yes that maybe knows more 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.230
