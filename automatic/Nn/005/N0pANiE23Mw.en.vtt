frames these could go up in my doll
houses<00:04:57.169> because<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.070> would<00:04:58.220> be<00:04:58.340> like<00:04:58.520> kinda

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
houses because that would be like kinda

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.780 
houses because that would be like kinda
like<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.240> poster<00:04:59.750> picture<00:05:00.320> huh<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.610> thought

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
like a poster picture huh so I thought

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.520 
like a poster picture huh so I thought
that<00:05:01.940> might<00:05:02.060> be<00:05:02.150> cool<00:05:02.300> anyways<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.140> will

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
that might be cool anyways I will

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.560 
that might be cool anyways I will
continue<00:05:03.980> collecting<00:05:04.310> them<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.210> hopefully

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
continue collecting them and hopefully

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.590 
continue collecting them and hopefully
get<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.870> full<00:05:06.140> set<00:05:06.320> sooner<00:05:06.650> or<00:05:06.770> later<00:05:07.300> yes<00:05:08.300> I

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
get a full set sooner or later yes I

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.530 
get a full set sooner or later yes I
like<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.530> sparkly<00:05:09.950> ones<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.370> best<00:05:10.580> but<00:05:11.330> I

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
like the sparkly ones the best but I

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.480 
like the sparkly ones the best but I
mean<00:05:11.720> that's<00:05:12.140> why<00:05:12.590> they<00:05:12.740> only<00:05:12.830> put<00:05:13.070> one<00:05:13.100> end<00:05:13.340> to

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
mean that's why they only put one end to

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.670 
mean that's why they only put one end to
this<00:05:13.640> special<00:05:13.880> I<00:05:14.180> think<00:05:14.900> this<00:05:15.080> also<00:05:15.290> is<00:05:15.500> really
