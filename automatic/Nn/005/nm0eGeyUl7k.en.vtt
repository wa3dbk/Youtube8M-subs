00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.150
 gas equipment installed on 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.849
 the car allows you to drive the engine 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.440
 into motion with the help of gas energy such 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.020
 the way has as its undeniable 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.800
 advantages and certain 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.720
 limitations 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.520
 one of the main advantages of work 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.540
 car on gas is 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.669
 economy 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.220
 the cost of gas is much lower 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.259
 gasoline cost savings with 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.050
 such gas fuel can reach 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.520
 50 percent with a lifetime 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.089
 car engine significantly 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.500
 increases but such savings exist and 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.749
 but on the other hand 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.510
 engine power is reduced while 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.370
 average 7 percent when operating 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.159
 In urban conditions, the difference is not particularly 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 noticeably but here on high-speed highway 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.769
 this flaw becomes palpable 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.089
 using gas as fuel 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.460
 characterized by much less noticeable 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.879
 noise level car running on 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.920
 gas 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.229
 emits much less into the atmosphere 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.960
 harmful substances making it 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.640
 environmentally friendly mode of transport but not worth it 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.740
 forget that installation 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.080
 special equipment on the car 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.750
 these are certain financial costs 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.700
 besides the weight of your car after 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.580
 gas equipment installations 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.470
 increases by about 30 kilograms 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.120
 vehicle mechanism in which 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.490
 gas fuel is used 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.040
 much less prone to wear 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.080
 gas combustion produces less precipitation 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.780
 than when burning gasoline or diesel 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.230
 fuel spark plugs serve much 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.170
 longer and oil is not allowed due 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.060
 making it possible to change much less frequently in the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.690
 same time the gas cylinder itself refills 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.210
 longer and harder than filling up a gas tank 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.340
 it is completely impossible because of this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.800
 internal pressure rises and 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.320
 accordingly the gas temperature is what 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.600
 creates danger of explosion besides 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.040
 the moment when the gas cylinder runs out 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.560
 very easy to miss 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.870
 car suddenly becomes when 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.030
 from the cylinder will develop the last pair 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.460
 gas however gas equipment 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.280
 allows you to switch control mode 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.080
 from gas to gasoline so having 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.720
 a certain amount of gasoline fuel 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.030
 you can not be afraid to stall at the most 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.680
 inopportune moment among the tangible 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.510
 gas installation flaws 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 equipment on the car follows 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.620
 note the complications of its operation 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.930
 also due to the specifics 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.910
 gas fuel to cars 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.060
 working on them are presented 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.080
 increased security requirements 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.760
 re-equipment of the car is subject to 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.950
 mandatory registration 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 but if you close your eyes to all the cons 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.120
 gas equipment 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 she is a great way 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.160
 save on constantly rising in price 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.160
 gasoline
