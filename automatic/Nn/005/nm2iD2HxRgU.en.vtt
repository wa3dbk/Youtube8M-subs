00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.289
 in a house seven children with a mom at 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:27.710

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.860
 mom took it out to the oven and there is an omelette 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.860
 we look at the seven children 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.360
 when mom was going to put it in the oven 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.730
 the tortilla jumped out of his hand and japan 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:56.560
 all removed we are hungry we want 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.950

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.890
 and then came the rooster he said hey 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.040
 tortillas where you with so much floor are 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.130
 so close that I want to eat you but the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.550
 tortilla said he did not eat 17 children 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.370
 that also not only with the trade said 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.600
 the tortilla 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:22.220
 then came the cow he said hey omelette 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.220
 where are you going so hurried said the cow 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.740
 they are so donated that he stayed to eat with 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.409
 the tortilla answered 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 I do not agree with the seven children I do not 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.360
 It suits the rooster and I do not eat 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.930
 but for a moment the dog was 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.130
 hear tortilla where two with so much weight 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:52.280
 said the dog 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.280
 It is not so close that it tells you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.490
 the tortilla replied I did not eat the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.289
 Seven children do not invite me I did not eat 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.289
 the cow and neither my food 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.869
 soon 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.930
 It is a long and tense 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:20.230
 I'm running out of water that could 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:24.470
 could join and split 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.890
 and soon the hook appeared 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.310
 and there told him that I had my monkey 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.310
 the drops 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.840
 the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.520
 the roots more text extended the bit 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.100
 almost ate it but it bore the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:54.310
 shore and there then there the tortilla 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.880
 he jumped on a rome and left 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:05.910
 and we're still not hungry we have 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.910

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.960
 then we are hungry we want to run 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.960
 that mom made her a rich soup 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.410
 in the tortilla they never returned it to 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.700
