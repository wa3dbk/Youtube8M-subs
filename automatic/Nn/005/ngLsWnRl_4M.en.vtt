for<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.430> guys<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:20.630> weapon<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.170> pretty<00:01:21.620> good

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
for you guys the weapon is a pretty good

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.860 
for you guys the weapon is a pretty good
weapon<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.280> can<00:01:22.400> have<00:01:22.520> only<00:01:23.090> early<00:01:23.390> on<00:01:23.660> in<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
weapon you can have only early on in the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.510 
weapon you can have only early on in the
game<00:01:23.900> though<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.470> honestly<00:01:25.190> would<00:01:25.490> not

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
game though I honestly would not

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.980 
game though I honestly would not
recommend<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.270> if<00:01:26.420> you've<00:01:26.570> already<00:01:26.720> finished

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
recommend it if you've already finished

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.210 
recommend it if you've already finished
the<00:01:27.260> game<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.650> have<00:01:27.740> other<00:01:27.979> high-level

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
the game and have other high-level

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.520 
the game and have other high-level
weapons<00:01:28.820> because<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.780> damage<00:01:30.110> isn't<00:01:30.260> that

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
weapons because the damage isn't that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.999 
weapons because the damage isn't that
high

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
high

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.230 
high
the<00:01:31.130> only<00:01:31.250> thing<00:01:31.460> that's<00:01:31.670> really<00:01:31.880> good<00:01:32.090> about

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
the only thing that's really good about

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.359 
the only thing that's really good about
the<00:01:32.420> correc<00:01:32.690> machete<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.470> handling<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
the correc machete is the handling the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.830 
the correc machete is the handling the
handling<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.850> pretty<00:01:35.060> high<00:01:35.210> up<00:01:35.240> which<00:01:35.600> means

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
handling is pretty high up which means

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.630 
handling is pretty high up which means
you<00:01:35.960> can<00:01:36.080> swing<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.619> blade<00:01:36.830> like<00:01:37.100> extremely

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
you can swing the blade like extremely

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.120 
you can swing the blade like extremely
fast<00:01:37.970> compared<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.840> other<00:01:38.960> weapons<00:01:39.380> we're

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
fast compared to other weapons we're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.740 
fast compared to other weapons we're
gonna<00:01:40.280> quilt<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.670> for<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:40.880> guys<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.330> show<00:01:41.630> it
