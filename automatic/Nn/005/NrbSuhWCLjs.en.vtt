00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.400
 they told him he has some players that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.779
 we do not wish you that we did not want to go and 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.369
 once I was just water and then 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.369
 started what I wanted 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.050
 and there he began to play the barrier of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.390
 central software and they put it in the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.890
 union because it started forward 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 and I always forward and when he 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.970
 I was like that from the defense that I saw that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.040
 he scored goals and he did not score goals 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.540
 I had another position I am forward and what 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.170
 front are those who are alone with the 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:05.009
 great forward that the position of the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 defense then he saw that his brother 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.520
 He is a forward and scored goals 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.910
 front are mahatma because they put 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.910
 goals 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.780
 he came to me from forward of no 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780
 game 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:35.640
 the forward and so he always said what 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.640
 had once held an opportunity 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 I was saying 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.280
 yes also but not only propose as 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.940
 goal that looked like it was like a thing 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.560
 that he was not doing for a purpose 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.130
 economic was not doing it because 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 does the process that tried to correct a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.790
 bit 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.130
 even though like you 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.349
 we do not have such an economic situation 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.560
 extreme that we said and needed 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.750
 that will help us mainly in the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.290
 house because the leases and 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.190
 they become pretty good and although not 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.190
 they go too far 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.030
 slope they were on the street 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.030
 that they were something 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.980
 to my table 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.020
 to
