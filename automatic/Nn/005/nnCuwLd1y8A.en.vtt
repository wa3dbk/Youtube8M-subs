it is more a bad i think it would be
make<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> better<00:01:11.250> classics<00:01:12.180> figure<00:01:12.630> than<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
make a better classics figure than the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
make a better classics figure than the

far<00:01:23.929> that<00:01:24.929> says<00:01:25.679> for<00:01:26.039> that<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.970> we're<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
far that says for that if we're the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.889 
far that says for that if we're the
field<00:01:28.200> commode<00:01:28.440> transform<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.630> very<00:01:31.310> simple

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
field commode transform them very simple

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.969 
field commode transform them very simple
but<00:01:33.899> yet<00:01:34.819> intuitive<00:01:36.170> pop<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> arms<00:01:37.830> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
but yet intuitive pop out the arms to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.330 
but yet intuitive pop out the arms to
the<00:01:38.009> side<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:39.080> bring<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.440> camera<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
of tucked away like so and they'll pop

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.830 
of tucked away like so and they'll pop
out<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.110> seems<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.740> fairly<00:01:59.130> stuck

store com I believe it's only about 20

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.590 
store com I believe it's only about 20
bucks<00:04:04.440> or<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.890> for<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> Japanese<00:04:05.940> version<00:04:05.970> I

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
bucks or so for the Japanese version I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.550 
bucks or so for the Japanese version I
think<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.620> actually<00:04:08.040> easier<00:04:08.430> fine<00:04:08.790> then<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
think it's actually easier fine then the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.680 
think it's actually easier fine then the
American<00:04:10.560> version<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.150> cheaper<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.299> which<00:04:12.510> is

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
American version and cheaper to which is

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.660 
American version and cheaper to which is
kind<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.530> you<00:04:13.650> think<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.100> opposite

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
kind of that you think the opposite

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.270 
kind of that you think the opposite
would<00:04:14.820> be<00:04:14.880> true<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.510> yeah<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> definitely<00:04:16.280> this

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
would be true so yeah I definitely this

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.830 
would be true so yeah I definitely this
is<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.489> such<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.019> great<00:04:19.019> looking<00:04:19.289> figure<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.620> think
