00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.410
 omar congratulations that great return of 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.750
 holy faith to the group stage of the cup 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.810
 liberators 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.539
 thank you very much spoons air expected me 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.630
 it seems that today 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.560
 we knew the game that we are going to have was 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.570
 matter of time the goal comes and 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.759
 I think the game is what they work on 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.759
 they delivered an excellent first time 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.589
 where 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.120
 even for a moment they complicated us 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.290
 but 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 it seems to me that little by little we are going 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.160
 wearing that your work and I think 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.160
 that with the goal of edison 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.530
 we finished killing a team that was 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 well stopped provided is not interesting 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.909
 precisely with edison méndez luis 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.670
 Carlos Arias suddenly this team 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.829
 generates more than what we had the year 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 passed as the following mar pérez and with 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.850
 the 10 there are inside the court I think 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.180
 yes, I think so, because of the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.770
 quality of players that there are without 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.960
 desmeritar to the former co months 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.840
 I think today the best contracting 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.110
 that has had good recent years that has 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.320
 had santa faith is is méndez more the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.460
 turn of six ever the turn of wilder 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.909
 of otálvaro plus the boys who add up 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.950
 and they are gaining experience to a staff 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.130
 who has a lot of experience 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.850
 it seems that we are combining youth 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.070
 with veterans who have 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.990
 many matches over and it's a 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.729
 very nice combination at this time to 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.140
 see how you get the goal of Daniel 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.420
 Towers because I was waiting for it 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.180
 only the team and the fans in 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.119
 general how they feel with the view that 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.670
 means happy happy power for the 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.290
 people seem to get is 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.799
 you are going through a great moment is a 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.799
 player that out there 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.290
 they help you in various sectors not only in 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.569
 his position and that gives us peace of mind 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.489
 us that he or she has already 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.599
 converted is something that came 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.239
 dreaming what was coming he had been thinking and and 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.640
 the way it was done it seems to me that it is 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.079
 something very beautiful very beautiful 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.510
 omar pérez is aware that after 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.610
 five years are of holy faith that I am 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.659
 attached to the casual legend the bloated 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.780
 he sees it as the flagship player that up 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.150
 where Maria really filled it 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.430
 of conscious des inside was 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.640
 I simply do something what I feel does not 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.770
 It is very rewarding to see each of the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.140
 messages that send me 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.340
 thank you congratulating 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.220
 or treating me often what for me 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.410
 I'm not, I'm not, I'm not sorry, because there's 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.060
 a great team there is a great job there 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.010
 a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.560
 in those five years they have been great 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.480
 people who have contributed to the club today in 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.130
 day we live a very nice situation of 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.569
 be a liberators cup thanks to 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.030
 the people who have gone through this 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.300
 club 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.390
 I am fortunate to stay in a 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.090
 institution so many years yes 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.270
 and I thank God very much for that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.360
 because it's not easy it's not easy to be 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.740
 in a club a long time 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.780
 and thank God the results guarantee 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:48.890
 also a project because the first 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.970
 good what happened last semester 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.330
 that when they do not show up 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.690
 the results is one the first the 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.910
 guilty the technical takes out that he is not going to 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.990
 it will not take long for that to come 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.580
 when when we lose the first game 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.760
 one try to identify those things and 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.170
 that's why you should not believe much 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.670
 more than it is in the or in the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.280
 victories 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.590
 and be in the same person when when 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.079
 the results are not as such as 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.459
 thank you very much and hopefully through 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.440
 of this leadership the great days of 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.930
 captain we can be back in 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.639
 eighth in the liberators hopefully hopefully 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.610
 you want the illusion that we all have 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.230
 because mainly we are mainly 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.720
 us and our family those who 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.680
 we want to win after the fans know that 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.720
 you catch all that says and hopefully in 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.710
 June we have one or two that always 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.710
 we long for that
