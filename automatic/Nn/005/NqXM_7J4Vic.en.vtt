00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
that aren't really thought about um so I

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.500 
that aren't really thought about um so I
think<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.560> family<00:04:39.400> recipes<00:04:39.940> are<00:04:40.120> often

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
think that family recipes are often

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.430 
think that family recipes are often
forgotten<00:04:41.070> when<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.190> comes<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.970> and

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
forgotten when it comes to and

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.719 
forgotten when it comes to and
documenting<00:04:44.440> other<00:04:44.620> things<00:04:44.979> like<00:04:45.190> dates<00:04:45.520> of

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
documenting other things like dates of

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.730 
documenting other things like dates of
birthdays<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.300> stuff<00:04:46.390> like<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:46.660> so<00:04:46.780> that

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
birthdays and stuff like that so that

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.890 
birthdays and stuff like that so that
was<00:04:47.860> just<00:04:48.039> the<00:04:48.160> thought<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.520> had<00:04:48.900> when

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
was just the thought that I had when

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.440 
was just the thought that I had when
creating<00:04:50.200> this<00:04:50.470> mini<00:04:50.740> album<00:04:51.010> swap<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.490> that<00:04:52.240> is

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
creating this mini album swap so that is

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.860 
creating this mini album swap so that is
why<00:04:52.660> am<00:04:53.050> i<00:04:54.180> through<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.300> challenge<00:04:55.510> in<00:04:55.750> there

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
why am i through that challenge in there

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.219 
why am i through that challenge in there
so<00:04:56.680> there<00:04:57.460> are<00:04:57.669> three<00:04:58.210> um<00:05:00.780> recipe<00:05:01.780> cards<00:05:02.110> in
