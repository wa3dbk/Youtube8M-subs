when<00:00:21.790> we<00:00:21.910> first<00:00:22.210> came<00:00:22.480> onto<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.960> scene<00:00:23.140> in

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
when we first came onto the scene in

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.770 
when we first came onto the scene in
2005<00:00:24.100> building<00:00:24.640> our<00:00:24.790> electric<00:00:25.300> vehicles<00:00:25.630> here

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
2005 building our electric vehicles here

2005 building our electric vehicles here
in<00:00:25.840> Gainesville<00:00:26.080> Florida

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
in Gainesville Florida

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.410 
in Gainesville Florida
most<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.520> other<00:00:27.640> golf<00:00:27.940> carts<00:00:28.300> in<00:00:28.390> the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
most of the other golf carts in the

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.510 
most of the other golf carts in the
industry<00:00:28.900> we're<00:00:29.230> averaging<00:00:29.350> between<00:00:29.770> 25<00:00:30.490> and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
industry we're averaging between 25 and

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.270 
industry we're averaging between 25 and
35<00:00:31.300> miles<00:00:31.630> per<00:00:31.780> charge<00:00:31.930> we<00:00:32.860> didn't<00:00:33.100> think<00:00:33.190> that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
35 miles per charge we didn't think that

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.549 
35 miles per charge we didn't think that
this<00:00:33.399> was<00:00:33.579> sufficient<00:00:33.789> so<00:00:34.660> our<00:00:34.870> vehicles<00:00:35.350> all

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
this was sufficient so our vehicles all

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.440 
this was sufficient so our vehicles all
get<00:00:35.800> currently<00:00:36.160> up<00:00:36.399> to<00:00:36.670> 50<00:00:37.000> miles<00:00:37.180> per<00:00:37.329> charge

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
get currently up to 50 miles per charge

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.630 
get currently up to 50 miles per charge
now<00:00:38.320> we're<00:00:38.650> not<00:00:38.800> one<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.130> rest<00:00:39.340> on<00:00:39.489> our<00:00:39.579> laurels

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
now we're not one to rest on our laurels

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.880 
now we're not one to rest on our laurels
so<00:00:40.239> we're<00:00:40.420> trying<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.720> get<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.989> largest<00:00:41.440> range

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
so we're trying to get the largest range

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.470 
so we're trying to get the largest range
out<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.340> any<00:00:42.460> electric<00:00:42.850> vehicle<00:00:43.239> on<00:00:43.360> the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
out of any electric vehicle on the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.120 
out of any electric vehicle on the
market<00:00:43.840> in<00:00:43.989> this<00:00:44.170> category<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.770> low<00:00:44.890> speed

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
market in this category the low speed

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.580 
market in this category the low speed
vehicles<00:00:45.579> so<00:00:46.090> we've<00:00:46.239> put<00:00:46.390> together<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:46.720> xlc

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
vehicles so we've put together this xlc

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.590 
vehicles so we've put together this xlc
model<00:00:47.920> it's<00:00:48.310> got<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.670> most<00:00:48.820> powerful<00:00:49.090> solar

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
model it's got the most powerful solar

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.630 
model it's got the most powerful solar
that<00:00:49.840> we<00:00:49.960> can<00:00:50.110> get<00:00:50.230> on<00:00:50.410> this<00:00:50.590> roof<00:00:50.860> it<00:00:51.100> has<00:00:51.399> an

end-of-day recap to tell you how many
miles<00:01:48.729> we've<00:01:48.939> gone<00:01:49.060> but<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.450> vehicle<00:01:49.899> is

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
miles we've gone but the vehicle is

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.849 
miles we've gone but the vehicle is
still<00:01:50.169> going

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
still going

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.099 
still going
we<00:01:51.130> were<00:01:51.249> hoping<00:01:51.549> for<00:01:51.609> 75<00:01:52.329> miles<00:01:52.659> for<00:01:53.020> this

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
we were hoping for 75 miles for this

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.589 
we were hoping for 75 miles for this
charge<00:01:53.709> we're<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.159> at<00:01:54.369> ninety<00:01:54.969> five<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.539> a

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
charge we're now at ninety five and a

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.809 
charge we're now at ninety five and a
half<00:01:55.630> miles<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:56.439> still<00:01:56.560> going<00:01:56.859> strong<00:01:57.249> so

half miles and still going strong so

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:58.800 
half miles and still going strong so
what<00:01:57.969> we're<00:01:58.119> doing<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.419> we're<00:01:58.509> gonna<00:01:58.599> keep

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
what we're doing is we're gonna keep

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.480 
what we're doing is we're gonna keep
driving<00:01:59.289> keep<00:01:59.319> seeing<00:01:59.740> how<00:01:59.859> long<00:02:00.069> do<00:02:00.219> you<00:02:00.279> get

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
driving keep seeing how long do you get

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.190 
driving keep seeing how long do you get
now<00:02:00.969> our<00:02:01.149> goal<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.359> to<00:02:01.479> see<00:02:01.689> if<00:02:01.779> we<00:02:01.840> can<00:02:01.929> get<00:02:02.109> it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
now our goal is to see if we can get it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.229 
now our goal is to see if we can get it
to<00:02:02.289> a<00:02:02.319> hundred<00:02:02.709> miles<00:02:02.859> per<00:02:03.159> charge<00:02:03.189> let's<00:02:04.090> see

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
to a hundred miles per charge let's see

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.490 
to a hundred miles per charge let's see
if<00:02:04.299> we<00:02:04.389> can<00:02:04.539> do<00:02:04.659> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.469 

96<00:02:08.500> miles<00:02:08.800> without<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.250> single<00:02:09.700> charge<00:02:10.239> and

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
96 miles without a single charge and

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.050 
96 miles without a single charge and
today<00:02:11.170> hasn't<00:02:11.680> even<00:02:11.739> been<00:02:12.010> fully<00:02:12.220> sunny<00:02:12.610> we've

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
today hasn't even been fully sunny we've

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.970 
today hasn't even been fully sunny we've
had<00:02:13.209> partly<00:02:13.540> cloudy<00:02:13.930> almost<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.650> entire<00:02:14.950> day

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
had partly cloudy almost the entire day

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.890 
had partly cloudy almost the entire day
so<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.849> obviously<00:02:15.970> was<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.480> maker<00:02:16.690> we

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
so that obviously was in the maker we

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.570 
so that obviously was in the maker we
have<00:02:17.049> less<00:02:17.319> range<00:02:17.560> coming<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.129> of<00:02:18.220> our<00:02:18.340> solar

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
have less range coming out of our solar

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.059 
have less range coming out of our solar
panels<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.510> fully<00:02:19.780> sunny<00:02:20.110> day<00:02:20.410> with<00:02:20.920> some

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
panels on a fully sunny day with some

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.190 
panels on a fully sunny day with some
stop<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.549> go<00:02:21.700> throughout<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.060> day<00:02:22.200> easily

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
stop and go throughout the day easily

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.809 
stop and go throughout the day easily
over<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> hundred<00:02:23.769> miles<00:02:23.920> per<00:02:24.190> charge<00:02:24.220> this

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
over a hundred miles per charge this

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.449 
over a hundred miles per charge this
vehicles<00:02:25.299> got<00:02:25.450> non-stop<00:02:26.230> since<00:02:26.470> 9:50<00:02:27.310> this

here<00:02:47.829> we<00:02:47.950> are<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.340> end<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.549> testing<00:02:48.970> you'll

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
here we are at the end of testing you'll

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.630 
here we are at the end of testing you'll
see<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.690> odometer<00:02:50.200> reads<00:02:50.410> 110<00:02:51.340> point

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
see that the odometer reads 110 point

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.509 
see that the odometer reads 110 point
three<00:02:52.000> we<00:02:52.780> started<00:02:53.200> at<00:02:53.319> five<00:02:53.650> point<00:02:53.980> three<00:02:54.280> so

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
three we started at five point three so

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.229 
three we started at five point three so
this<00:02:54.640> cart<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.329> got<00:02:55.739> 105<00:02:56.739> miles<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.640> this

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
this cart just got 105 miles on this

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.150 
this cart just got 105 miles on this
single<00:02:58.480> charge<00:02:58.900> you'll<00:02:59.560> see<00:02:59.709> we<00:02:59.829> still<00:03:00.010> do

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
single charge you'll see we still do

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.920 
single charge you'll see we still do
have<00:03:00.310> power<00:03:00.609> it<00:03:00.849> is<00:03:00.940> slowing<00:03:01.329> down<00:03:01.359> now<00:03:01.720> though

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
have power it is slowing down now though

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.420 
have power it is slowing down now though
the<00:03:02.170> top<00:03:02.349> speed<00:03:02.650> isn't<00:03:02.769> nearly<00:03:03.040> as<00:03:03.160> what<00:03:03.370> he

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the top speed isn't nearly as what he

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.920 
the top speed isn't nearly as what he
used<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.700> be<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.060> we're<00:03:04.180> ending<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.510> test<00:03:04.720> now

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
used to be so we're ending the test now

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.420 
used to be so we're ending the test now
at<00:03:05.489> 105<00:03:06.489> miles<00:03:06.940> gained<00:03:08.010> alright<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.129> we<00:03:09.220> just

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
at 105 miles gained alright so we just

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.250 
at 105 miles gained alright so we just
completed<00:03:09.849> testing<00:03:10.389> as<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.720> showed<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.049> we

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
completed testing as I showed you we

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.830 
completed testing as I showed you we
were<00:03:11.349> able<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.590> get<00:03:11.910> 105<00:03:12.910> miles<00:03:13.389> on<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.720> single

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
were able to get 105 miles on a single

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.319 
were able to get 105 miles on a single
charge<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:14.950> vehicle<00:03:15.430> most<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.269> the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
charge of this vehicle most of the

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.819 
charge of this vehicle most of the
testing<00:03:16.720> done<00:03:16.900> was<00:03:17.109> during<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.410> partly<00:03:17.709> cloudy

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
testing done was during a partly cloudy

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.890 
testing done was during a partly cloudy
day<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.880> vehicle<00:03:19.239> never<00:03:19.510> stopped

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
day and the vehicle never stopped

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.390 
day and the vehicle never stopped
driving<00:03:20.200> from<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.680> beginning<00:03:21.069> of<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.250> day<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
driving from the beginning of the day to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.949 
driving from the beginning of the day to
the<00:03:21.639> end<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.209> were<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.419> use<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.870> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
the end so if you were to use it in a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.659 
the end so if you were to use it in a
more<00:03:23.190> systematic<00:03:24.190> setting<00:03:24.489> where<00:03:24.609> you

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
more systematic setting where you

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.740 
more systematic setting where you
actually<00:03:24.880> gonna<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.060> stopping<00:03:25.359> throughout

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
actually gonna be stopping throughout

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.180
