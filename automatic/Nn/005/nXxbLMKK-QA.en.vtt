00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
leak leaks probably getting picked so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
leak leaks probably getting picked so
day<00:00:35.730> ponder<00:00:36.800> image<00:00:38.780> grotto<00:00:44.659> it<00:00:45.659> might<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:45.989> be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
day ponder image grotto it might just be

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.479 
day ponder image grotto it might just be
I<00:00:46.199> might<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.559> take<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> ponder<00:00:47.250> here

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I might just take the ponder here

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
I might just take the ponder here
because<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.449> puts<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.900> shimmer

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because then it puts them on shimmer

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.899 
because then it puts them on shimmer
ingrata<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.339> those<00:00:50.460> are<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.640> only<00:00:50.790> two

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
ingrata like those are was only two

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:58.180 
ingrata like those are was only two
lands<00:00:51.269> you'd<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.629> draw<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:51.989> some<00:00:52.110> lands

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.650 

Dave<00:00:59.190> ponder<00:00:59.670> image<00:01:00.149> grotto<00:01:00.629> gutshot<00:01:05.539> so<00:01:06.539> the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
Dave ponder image grotto gutshot so the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.180 
Dave ponder image grotto gutshot so the
only<00:01:06.780> 2<00:01:06.930> i'm<00:01:07.050> questioning<00:01:07.229> or<00:01:07.470> ponder<00:01:07.830> or<00:01:07.979> mana

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
only 2 i'm questioning or ponder or mana

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:22.300 
only 2 i'm questioning or ponder or mana
leak

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:31.260 

I<00:01:22.369> think<00:01:23.210> its<00:01:23.299> mana<00:01:23.509> leak<00:01:23.689> here

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:40.969 

so<00:01:32.270> he's<00:01:32.450> out<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.630> ponder

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.050 

and<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.130> assume<00:01:42.220> he's<00:01:42.490> going<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.670> put<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.820> land

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
and I assume he's going to put a land

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.950 
and I assume he's going to put a land
into<00:01:43.270> play<00:01:43.450> tapped<00:01:45.420> chose<00:01:46.420> not<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.750> shuffle

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
into play tapped chose not to shuffle

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:56.430 
into play tapped chose not to shuffle
there<00:01:47.409> it<00:01:47.530> is<00:01:52.050> let's<00:01:53.050> each<00:01:53.200> discard<00:01:55.320> let's<00:01:56.320> get

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
there it is let's each discard let's get

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.680 
there it is let's each discard let's get
rid<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.740> swamp

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:10.229 

so<00:02:02.320> no<00:02:02.530> day

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.899 

reaching<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.330> discard<00:02:11.720> again<00:02:12.700> get<00:02:13.700> rid<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.819> this

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
reaching a discard again get rid of this

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:23.040 
reaching a discard again get rid of this
other<00:02:14.120> Liliana

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
let's get in there with a Nexus before

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:50.370 
let's get in there with a Nexus before
we<00:02:41.070> do<00:02:41.160> anything

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380

image<00:06:28.080> in<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:28.470> first<00:06:28.680> game<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:29.009> that<00:06:29.100> was

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
image in the first game and that was

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.350 
image in the first game and that was
basically<00:06:29.400> it<00:06:29.789> so<00:06:30.210> we'll<00:06:30.930> keep<00:06:31.080> it<00:06:31.199> like<00:06:31.320> this
