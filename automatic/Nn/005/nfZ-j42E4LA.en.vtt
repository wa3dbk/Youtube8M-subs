00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:30.029
 knitting with beads in a circle knit 7 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:33.000
 air loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:39.870
 connect their ring with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:47.410
 connecting loop now push 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:51.340
 bead on the hook right next vdevaem 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:58.950
 base loop and knit stitch 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:03.509
 nakida and repeat so seven times 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:07.600
 move the next bead to the right 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:15.909
 knot the next loop without 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:19.240
 nakida grab the thread for the beads and so 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:23.770
 until the end I knitted 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.639
 and from the seamy side you can see that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 our first meal was all the beads 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:32.130
 next knit the next row 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:45.450
 move the bead to the right and then thread it 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.450
 hook into the next loop of the base 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:01.990
 grabbing a string of beads and knitting 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:03.510
 nakida column then move again 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.960
 bead 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.140
 right and same loop 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:18.880
 we knit one more column without nakida 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:24.700
 and then we knit each loop 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:33.580
 two bars, without sc pushes 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:36.090
 every time bead so knit to the end 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.090
 row 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.610
 so I already got off if you turn on 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:06.650
 wrong side we can see that in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:10.620
 the second row we will have 14 beads 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.420
 now proceed to knit the third row 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:19.110
 this row is harder to knit 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:23.099
 fit it just as we push 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.500
 right one bead then next 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.370
 noose 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:39.209
 we knit the base with one 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:42.870
 nakida then move the bead again and in 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:51.870
 we knit the same loop one more 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:55.110
 nakida column again and move 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.500
 bead and 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:04.680
 we knit the base in the second loop 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:08.519
 Only one column, without sc and then 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.760
 knitting alternate in every second loop 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:18.180
 grounds will knit on 2 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.359
 double crochet and here I am 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.300
 knitted the third row 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.050
 if you turn it inside out, you can 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.510
 count 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.710
 that in the third row we will have 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:35.900
 twenty one beads and they will 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:39.450
 be very close to each other 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.919
 further knit will be much easier in 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:47.039
 each next row do all 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.780
 additions with single crochets in those 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:53.490
 same very points where 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.070
 additions were made in the previous row with 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.310
 you were Irina
