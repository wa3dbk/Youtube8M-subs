00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.059
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.700
 video today we are as you see with the engine 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.919
 or the motorcycle g and that is what we want to do 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.090
 a quick review of the news that 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.800
 has android 4.4 point 2 kit kat for 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.660
 this model because we say for this 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.779
 model because the news of 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.899
 Kitkat are rather dependent on 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.309
 device is to say in whatever they are 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.770
 lower-end phones to notice more 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.660
 fluency those that have a sensor 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.989
 infrared rays to control the TV 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.480
 they will have the native support but the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.850
 that do not have this circumstance because 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.890
 they will see it improved what are the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.839
 aspects in which we are going to have 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.030
 improved our engine or the motorcycle gp with 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.390
 this update that comes by or is 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.370
 depending on our country and the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.780
 scalability of the update 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.399
 It will take a little longer or a little less 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.679
 from about two weeks ago is 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.390
 updating in europe but there's still 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.550
 people who do not have it we have 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.159
 arrived recently and we wanted to do this 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.290
 video that comes first most striking 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.119
 of this new update because not 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.060
 we have the google xperia launcher that already 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.860
 it's something 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.829
 that we already knew that the xperia of the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.329
 night I was only in those five and that the 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.200
 nexus 4 for example did not have the motogp 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.560
 neither is not android 4.4 kitkat yes 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.909
 we have the immersive mode something that we're going 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.159
 to see for example in the new application 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.320
 of gallery in which when we open you see 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.670
 that the bar disappears 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.860
 notifications if we make a small 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.159
 shuai down from the side 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.259
 superior appears but disappears if not 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.929
 we need that which does not 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.700
 annoy you would also like that 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.149
 bar disappeared apply them 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.850
 the virtual buttons but in this case 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.880
 well it does not disappear this is the new 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.189
 gallery application that is already of the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.539
 that we have spoken to you in an article in 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.420
 android fax but we also want 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.420
 show you other news that is 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.940
 have improved in this version and it's the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.940
 photo editor as you see now is 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.269
 rather more advanced has to start 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.290
 many filters we can also put 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.740
 certain frames we can reset what 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.650
 what we have done export 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.610
 we can modify the color of course 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.670
 the exhibition we can graduate 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.640
 the blur 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.040
 we can do it with the brightness we can 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.230
 do what 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.359
 with saturation as you see in white and 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.620
 black is to say that the photo editor 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.379
 We recommend that you take a look because 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.790
 you have many options here for example 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.939
 the shadow is modified only the screen 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.939
 of the terminal 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.130
 we can also modify the reflections and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.870
 increase the contrast in order that has 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.200
 many options this is the second of 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.900
 the other news is that we have to 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.830
 part of new icons as you see the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.890
 notification bar 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.800
 now it has all the icons in white 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.390
 we had the icons of the second panel of 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.269
 notifications also varied the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.920
 fit now is a little nut and if 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.170
 we are going 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.900
 to wireless connections more in 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.120
 application is more predetermined you can already 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.640
 come by default hangout even though our 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.230
 case we have activated still the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.940
 messages is also incorporated the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.950
 recording the screen but for that 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.980
 we need to have the mobile phone connected to 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.830
 Android sdk but simply with that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.300
 We can now record our own 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.810
 actions on screen up to three minutes 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.989
 but if we needed to have the sdk and the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.400
 computer connected to the mobile another of the 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.579
 options that give us 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.659
 improved in the mobile is the speed 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.659
 of camera focus 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.000
 As you can see, it 's a bit faster than 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.000
 before 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.690
 Focus a little better 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.010
 and it's still pretty fast to be 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.190
 a mid-range mobile at the price of the range 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.260
 low as we always say 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.180
 there is one thing that you have modified at least 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.160
 from other versions and another model of 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.550
 android and is that if we go to the 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.700
 adjustments at the end we see that we do not have the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.860
 developer option is not 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.630
 enabled what we have is that we go 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.980
 about the phone and the number of 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.980
 compilation press repeatedly 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.509
 and the options for activating 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.279
 development is the compilation number 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.389
 the last option about the phone 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:06.699
 because we have the updates of 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.699
 system where they are going to 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.190
 the development options appear as 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.190
 you see already appear in the normal menu that 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.470
 it was hidden and in it we can 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.190
 modify another of the great novelties 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.590
 from android 4.4 which is art android 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.910
 runtime which is the new routine of 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.910
 execution of the applications that 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.700
 replaces dalvik improvements has more 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.310
 fluidity gives more autonomy but 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.990
 It is still unstable because 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.330
 there are many applications that have not been 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.770
 updated if you want you can try it and 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.210
 the moment you see that there is 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.950
 applications that start to give you more 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.920
 failures of normal because it would return to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.290
 dalvik and without problem these are the 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.510
 main novelties in the other the motorcycle 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.490
 if you think we've left some 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.740
 we have not gone into detail in all the 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.760
 Android 4.4 news simply 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.890
 we have discussed the ones that are more 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.180
 important in our opinion if you believe 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.520
 that we have left some of you leave us 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.010
 a comment and you go through the 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.020
 thorough analysis of the engine or motorcycle gp 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.730
 what we have done and where we are going 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.060
 to also include in this video a 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.060
 greeting
