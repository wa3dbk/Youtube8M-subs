00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.220
 at 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.620
 it's a big heart and smooth in vain 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.600
 directory for poultry choir 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.950
 quite limited and that's a work 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.360
 essential is a work in 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.580
 which a heart to show 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.470
 the range of its possibilities at 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.380
 power at the color level 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.930
 voices in the game and then have 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.430
 in this version the percussion of 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.809
 piano and heart it's a work 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.520
 interesting because the heart is 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.350
 treated as a percussion instrument 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
 without really to work the whole 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.660
 diction to work the expression the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.700
 dynamic 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.989
 pedagogically it's the work he 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.989
 we had to tackle this year 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 I'm happy with the result because it's 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.580
 a very very demanding work and that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.170
 asks for huge energy 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.960
 I find that what the heart develops 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.850
 there in energy power in pallet of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.409
 colors it's already for a year of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.640
 work something pretty 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:24.619
 fantastic yes ok another thing already said 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.229
 many times that I will repeat if 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.110
 you try to breathe singing 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.330
 everything you shift all the repetitions 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.580
 carmina burana started at the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.979
 returned in August 2013 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.440
 the musical work of carl orff asked 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.810
 nine months of hard work for the 120 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.179
 conservatory singers came all 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.869
 very diverse musical horizons have made 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:52.220
 these four measures 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:53.479
 irini tab berne a1 of hassle I do not 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.549
 not necessarily count the people who are 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.229
 readers and who have pretty voices etc 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.700
 we really try a heart for me 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.360
 in a conservatory it's a place of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.580
 training 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.049
 so we're here to take people to 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 a certain level that happens at this level 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.649
 and gradually they go up their 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.880
 to make progress left at this 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.229
 that after two three four years he 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.399
 had sung in our heart and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.079
 feed the other courses of the meeting 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.870
 why not but it's really a 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.240
 training heart 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.450
 the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.450
 and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.760
 Yes 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.080
 I have always loved music and 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.959
 the services offered by this choir have 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.700
 always more I already have I started 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.769
 to be a spectator and then 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.260
 so much more than I wanted to do 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.560
 part at the beginning I am non- readers 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.239
 I do not read the notes and I am 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 totally beginner 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.130
 I had just a desire it was 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.080
 sing me I appreciate the framework the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.849
 first of all the squad that is still 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.340
 quite consequent so it allows to have 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.620
 I mean the gathering to see 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.099
 interesting amateur voices that get 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.019
 mix so had the most powerful 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.310
 less successful but it's these 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.290
 five hours amateurs of which everyone 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.200
 is part of the same voice all at once 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.200
 coming 2nd 2-3 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.220
 and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.110
 d 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.400
 during rehearsals I do a lot 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.080
 analysis is a game 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.580
 I explain to singers how is 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.380
 built the music have listened well 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.150
 the votes one by one from 11 to 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.890
 listen to the piano 11 by telling a 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.959
 little bit there the history of design 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.700
 of the work but especially before 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.230
 repetition or after repetition 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.020
 singers have sessions of 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.090
 mandatory vocal training and for 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.950
 those who do it needs and finances 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.940
 musical training also this is the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.010
 big difference with the years 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.459
 previous is that we have this year 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.660
 music training and music lessons 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.020
 vocal technique that we did not have 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.560
 previously 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.190
 so we have a training really 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.380
 musical 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:13.269
 whatever our level it requires a 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.720
 personal work that's what I have 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.919
 discovered 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.900
 we can not only if we want 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.150
 to invest if you want to improve 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.810
 we can not just rest 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.260
 on rehearsals that take place 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.630
 during the year 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.630
 once a week same thing and he 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.770
 even this beginning I put in loop I 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.210
 put in good we will pass the measure 5 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.210
 when these four are perfect 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.479
 the big day has finally arrived and 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.560
 a few hours before the first 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.039
 representation 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.169
 the atmosphere remains very studious for 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.610
 all these amateur choristers the show 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.310
 is the result of a year of commitment and 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.940
 hard working often accompanied 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.940
 of sacrifices 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200
 Oh 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.990
 the three carmina burana shows 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.090
 were sold out in front of a 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:27.009
 audience each time excited by 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.009
 the excellence of the performance of the choir
