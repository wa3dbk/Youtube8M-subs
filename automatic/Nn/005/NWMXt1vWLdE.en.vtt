normally<00:01:24.450> you're<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> smaller<00:01:25.770> space

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
normally you're just in a smaller space

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
normally you're just in a smaller space
and<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.549> consequences<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.330> more<00:01:27.479> severe<00:01:27.930> I'm

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and the consequences are more severe I'm

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.109 
and the consequences are more severe I'm
not<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.159> over<00:01:29.369> any<00:01:29.520> specific

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
not going to go over any specific

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
not going to go over any specific
scenarios<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.840> video<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> bit

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
scenarios in this video so it is a bit

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
scenarios in this video so it is a bit
shorter<00:01:32.340> hopefully<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:33.689> these

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
shorter hopefully you can take these

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.109 
shorter hopefully you can take these
exercises<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.460> online<00:01:35.670> mode
