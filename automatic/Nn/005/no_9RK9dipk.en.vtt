 a milan but in the book it says that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.100
 galileo is just a yellow book as you want 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.290
 be so sure of your accusations 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.930
 these are traces of chocolate that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.740
 fool he could be the thief if

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.060
 an easy job you need to be ready 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 at all you would rather break stones 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.200
 could dig a tunnel and come out 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.950
 while I was reading right under the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.470
 table 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.799
 I'm sure the hole is down here 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.140
 of the tunnel you dug 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.680
 yet I was sure it was me 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.920
 guilty I'll never talk to you again 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.230

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.930
 I was traveling to go to get you the 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.620
 book you asked me this morning but 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.000
 certain fantasy you could not have been that 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.609
 you and why ever 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.510
 but it is too innocent the air but it is 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.640
 absurd 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.670
 in my book the culprit was in the end 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.939
 just the kind of suspect but that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.959

 made a bit of confusion a party is made 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.450
 moment dile galileo would mean 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.590
 something about what it is 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.430
