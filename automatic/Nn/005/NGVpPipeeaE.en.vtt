00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.350
 this new video ex under that speaks to you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.929
 and we're going to talk about the new new 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.179
 mater new network matte you why 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
 new is already because of 164 with land 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.789
 experimental yuma research for sarah 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.449
 liquid and already driving them incredible oh well 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.279
 returning the game and with the human now 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.830
 you can create any material from 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.699
 I'll just show you the game 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.250
 because these things are in my hand 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.219
 they wanted everything ready then 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.329
 part of our max fabri gator basta 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.430
 connect it to an energy source 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.829
 any source of energy takes everyone 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.610
 the assemblies and will begin to produce the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.020
 our most liquid matter 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.250
 to a container that can be there I go 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.410
 out of any liquid whatsoever 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.850
 fashion is not a problem 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.550
 once we get our you matter 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.360
 liquid we have to go to create 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.590
 rice paddies to use the ju matter of the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.620
 rice paddies for molds 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.520
 chemical composition recordings 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.650
 of objects 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.360
 I'll show you everything starts from 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.479
 scanner course simply one 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.200
 scanner that goes to scan the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.110
 material and chemical composition 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.290
 of iron example objects but I can 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 even take iridium 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 let's take a piece of this video 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.450
 scanner, however, works together with this 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.330
 what is the storage pattern here 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.860
 partner was supporting to memorize what 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.230
 scan the scanner 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 so I take the lines and put it 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.220
 look inside begins to scan 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.090
 of the videos with 102 per cent 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.560
 figures puts us three or four minutes a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.640
 time he finished our scan 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.840
 the composition of the video elements 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.250
 will be stored in the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.380
 pattern supports now we wait for that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.270
 ends 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.710
 here we are again exactly three have passed 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.810
 minutes has almost finished ours 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.479
 scan 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.259
 and here we have an atomic value 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.869
 of the iris 22 bucket dio matter that is 22 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.020
 thousand and one million thousand k which would be a 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.429
 million energy when it says scome 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.530
 completed it will appear this is 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.929
 simply click save if 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.209
 click on save if there is 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.250
 with partners hours says this next 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.550
 you will find the pattern here enough that you do 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 he slams rave must be a unit 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.830
 because before now how are you looking 0 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.340
 now 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.350
 1 and we have our iridium see if 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.690
 I want here I can put a card 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 of memory that I do not recommend it not 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.340
 they serve a lot when you can put one 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.500
 memory card and store this 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.910
 this yield much more simply 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.520
 you can safely take the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.050
 replicator and put it next to this 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.970
 replicator will immediately contact you 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.860
 with the astore ge and from here 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.560
 you can access all areas patten 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.960
 who memorized look at new mater 22 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.410
 thousand would be 22000 and then baguettes 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.310
 22 baguettes and one million euros 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.680
 simply how to carry it 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.540
 the help we are producing here 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.850
 that we are not producing because we need to 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.000
 amplify what it produces with 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.800
 waste look at scraps as usual for 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.450
 anyone in two brackets will know how 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.720
 it works just put on scrubs and 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.370
 we increase the production logic ok 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.930
 we produced a bucket of matter 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 I take the liquid from the conveyor 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.870
 whatever we go on earth but let's see 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.870
 if there is fluid, here they are 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.349
 I simply connect then it should 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.860
 be a shit 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.970
 here is that growing hammer of the earth 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.970
 in the rexton 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.370
 ok look the ju matter goes in where 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.599
 prayed and replicator begins to work 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.569
 at the moment we will be reached 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.209
 22,000 emily baguettes ie 22 baguettes 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.760
 that is, you have a thousand will begin to cost the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.590
 our video works with whatever 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.970
 mineral and this is nice cordate iron 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.970
 or that I know gold 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.739
 on average, the things we do one thing 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.319
 silver I don't know, we see silver 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.670
 takes silver shade you can find again 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.120
 space should take the same 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.120
 we see 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.120
 yes even the silver all whatever 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.470
 mineral to watch but now the mining and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.470
 what is wood or cud takes everything 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.080
 scans it does the calculation of atoms 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.280
 makes a pattern and you can have it 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.410
 replicated to be able to replicate 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.940
 endlessly 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.800
 ok guys for this tutorial 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.210
 I hope all the interesting petrova if 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.830
 you need some tutorials in 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.430
 particular of the kraft industry of a 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.930
 new way 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.780
 you can easily contact me 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.520
 leaving a message is not a problem 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.300
 hello to all of you guys and to the next one 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.300
 greeting from the funder
