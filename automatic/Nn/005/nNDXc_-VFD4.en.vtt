okay<00:00:28.710> yeah<00:00:29.670> as<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:31.320> it's<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> best

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
okay yeah as I think it's the best

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.360 
okay yeah as I think it's the best
assault<00:00:33.030> rifle<00:00:33.450> because<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.500> assume<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
assault rifle because then assume the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.119 
assault rifle because then assume the
one<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:36.480> recoil<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.440> miss<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.890> sort

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
one that has recoil and i miss the sort

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.560 
one that has recoil and i miss the sort
of<00:00:38.219> recoil<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.850> makes<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> game<00:00:39.329> more

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
of recoil and makes the game more

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.040 
of recoil and makes the game more
realistic<00:00:39.899> my<00:00:40.620> opinion<00:00:41.010> yeah<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.660> just
