using the mp5k and in this one I'm using

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.810 
using the mp5k and in this one I'm using
the<00:00:43.770> silencer<00:00:44.550> attachment<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> basically

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the silencer attachment and so basically

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
the silencer attachment and so basically
what<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.360> comes<00:00:48.450> down<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> gun

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
what it comes down to is with this gun

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.959 
what it comes down to is with this gun
you<00:00:50.039> don't<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> play<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> map<00:00:50.789> like

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you don't want to play on a map like

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.799 
you don't want to play on a map like
derail<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.949> know<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.520> felt<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.690> wanted

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
derail but you know I felt like I wanted

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
derail but you know I felt like I wanted
to<00:00:54.989> put<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:55.980> only

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to put this up I think this was only

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830 
to put this up I think this was only
like<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> 31<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> five<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.420> something<00:00:57.539> like

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
like a 31 and five or something like

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
like a 31 and five or something like
that<00:00:57.899> before<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.980> short<00:00:59.190> range<00:00:59.460> gun<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that before a short range gun like the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
that before a short range gun like the
mp5k<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> map<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.199> derail<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.800> really

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
mp5k on a map like derail that's really

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
mp5k on a map like derail that's really
not<00:01:02.190> bad<00:01:04.369> it's<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:06.350> it's<00:01:07.350> hard<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
not bad it's really a it's hard to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.640 
not bad it's really a it's hard to
explain<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.090> good<00:01:09.210> gun<00:01:09.720> given<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
explain it's a really good gun given the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.609 
explain it's a really good gun given the
Matt<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.299> use<00:01:12.510> Skid<00:01:12.810> Row<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.049> lot<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
Matt and I know I use Skid Row a lot and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.410 
Matt and I know I use Skid Row a lot and
stuff<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.040> Skid<00:01:14.430> Row<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.970> as

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
stuff like that Skid Row is is as

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.390 
stuff like that Skid Row is is as
actually<00:01:15.990> probably<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.560> only<00:01:16.740> map<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
actually probably the only map that I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
actually probably the only map that I
would<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.790> safe<00:01:18.090> running<00:01:18.540> around<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
would be safe running around with the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.649 
would be safe running around with the
silencer<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.860> gun<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.790> only<00:01:21.119> map<00:01:21.299> unless

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
asking for much this is probably not the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.840 
asking for much this is probably not the
best<00:05:26.440> gun<00:05:26.770> I'd<00:05:26.950> never<00:05:27.130> use<00:05:27.310> them<00:05:27.400> like<00:05:27.580> search

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
it try it with the other sites first

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.090 
it try it with the other sites first
give<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:32.020> know<00:05:32.110> three<00:05:32.380> or<00:05:32.410> four<00:05:32.650> games<00:05:32.889> with

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
give you know three or four games with

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.770 
give you know three or four games with
each<00:05:33.220> either<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.820> holographic<00:05:34.240> or<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:34.660> red

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
each either the holographic or the red

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.110 
each either the holographic or the red
side<00:05:34.930> or<00:05:35.080> both<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.850> despite<00:05:36.850> what<00:05:37.090> people

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
side or both and despite what people

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.340 
side or both and despite what people
think<00:05:37.360> they<00:05:37.570> are<00:05:37.600> two<00:05:37.840> different<00:05:37.870> kinds<00:05:38.139> of

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
think they are two different kinds of

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.700 
think they are two different kinds of
sites<00:05:38.500> so<00:05:39.370> uh<00:05:39.400> I<00:05:39.880> don't<00:05:40.690> know<00:05:40.870> go<00:05:41.110> go<00:05:41.350> give<00:05:41.560> this

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
sites so uh I don't know go go give this

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.680 
sites so uh I don't know go go give this
a<00:05:41.770> go<00:05:42.010> do<00:05:42.520> not<00:05:42.669> play<00:05:42.880> it<00:05:43.000> on<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.150> map<00:05:43.360> like<00:05:43.660> this

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
a go do not play it on the map like this

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.690 
a go do not play it on the map like this
but<00:05:44.139> I<00:05:44.200> wanted<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.680> put<00:05:45.010> this<00:05:45.100> up<00:05:45.280> on<00:05:45.370> derail

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
but I wanted to put this up on derail

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.430 
but I wanted to put this up on derail
because<00:05:45.970> it<00:05:46.030> wasn't<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.270> bad<00:05:46.389> score<00:05:46.690> it's<00:05:47.320> on<00:05:47.410> a

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
because it wasn't a bad score it's on a

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.920 
because it wasn't a bad score it's on a
big<00:05:47.680> map<00:05:47.919> and<00:05:48.190> I<00:05:49.150> think<00:05:49.450> i<00:05:49.479> patrolled<00:05:49.840> it

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
big map and I think i patrolled it

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.600 
big map and I think i patrolled it
properly<00:05:50.320> how<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.680> actually<00:05:51.190> get<00:05:51.400> too<00:05:51.520> close

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
properly how to actually get too close

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.090 
properly how to actually get too close
combat<00:05:52.120> situations<00:05:52.900> even<00:05:53.530> though<00:05:53.590> on<00:05:53.710> TDM

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
combat situations even though on TDM

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.190 
combat situations even though on TDM
they<00:05:54.760> usually<00:05:55.060> don't<00:05:55.180> spawn<00:05:55.479> way<00:05:55.810> too<00:05:55.870> far

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
they usually don't spawn way too far

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.320 
they usually don't spawn way too far
away<00:05:56.370> but<00:05:57.370> at<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:57.520> same<00:05:57.729> time<00:05:57.880> there's<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.180> lot

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
away but at the same time there's a lot

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.640 
away but at the same time there's a lot
of<00:05:58.360> hills<00:05:58.570> and<00:05:58.780> everything<00:05:59.110> like<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.289> with

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
of hills and everything like that with

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.290 
of hills and everything like that with
that<00:05:59.770> you<00:06:00.070> know<00:06:00.100> horrible<00:06:00.460> accuracy<00:06:01.090> of<00:06:01.120> this

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
that you know horrible accuracy of this

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.969 
that you know horrible accuracy of this
gun<00:06:01.479> in<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.720> first<00:06:01.900> place<00:06:02.310> you<00:06:03.310> know<00:06:03.430> you're

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
gun in the first place you know you're

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.710 
gun in the first place you know you're
you're<00:06:05.979> more<00:06:06.430> inclined<00:06:06.789> to<00:06:07.000> miss<00:06:07.210> a<00:06:07.240> lot<00:06:07.479> more

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
you're more inclined to miss a lot more

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.189 
you're more inclined to miss a lot more
and<00:06:08.259> it<00:06:08.800> gets<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.340> little<00:06:09.490> crazy<00:06:09.789> sometimes<00:06:10.199> the

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
and it gets a little crazy sometimes the

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.499
