pretty<00:00:08.670> quickly<00:00:08.910> through<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.240> first

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
pretty quickly through this first

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540 
pretty quickly through this first
section<00:00:09.690> i<00:00:10.139> have<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.710> say<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> beginning

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
section i have to say that the beginning

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.169 
section i have to say that the beginning
part<00:00:12.110> right<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.250> hardest<00:00:14.700> part<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
part right here is the hardest part in a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.760 
part right here is the hardest part in a
level<00:00:16.460> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:17.940> there's<00:00:18.810> simply<00:00:19.199> no

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
level this is because there's simply no

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.599 
level this is because there's simply no
where<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> back<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:22.400> as<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.519> can

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
where for you to back up to I as you can

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.990 
where for you to back up to I as you can
see<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:23.850> using<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.330> singularity<00:00:24.869> pretty<00:00:25.619> often

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
see I'm using a singularity pretty often

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.710 
see I'm using a singularity pretty often
also<00:00:27.000> using<00:00:27.390> those<00:00:27.510> throws<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> kills

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
also using those throws to get the kills

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.600 
also using those throws to get the kills
but<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> really<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.130> just

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
but I really what I really want is just

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.520 
but I really what I really want is just
to<00:00:32.640> lay<00:00:32.940> these<00:00:33.450> houses<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.050> much<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.380> possible

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to lay these houses as much as possible

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030 
to lay these houses as much as possible
so<00:00:35.070> myself<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.450> allies<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:37.530> strip<00:00:37.800> them<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so myself my allies can strip them of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.850 
so myself my allies can strip them of
their<00:00:38.100> armor<00:00:39.230> as<00:00:40.230> soon<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.500> i'm<00:00:40.620> done<00:00:40.649> with

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
their armor as soon as i'm done with

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.040 
their armor as soon as i'm done with
that<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.040> come<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> reload<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> ammo

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that I come up here and reload on ammo

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
that I come up here and reload on ammo
and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.860> sort<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.270> come

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and then I'm going to just sort of come

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.410 
and then I'm going to just sort of come
down<00:00:45.480> staircase<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> sit<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> bottom<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
down staircase and sit the bottom and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
down staircase and sit the bottom and
fight<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> delaying<00:00:48.750> action<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:50.129> try<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
fight a delaying action as they try to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.720 
fight a delaying action as they try to
come<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> ramp<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:55.160> going<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> instant

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
come up the ramp I going for the instant

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.099 
come up the ramp I going for the instant
kills<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.149> away<00:00:57.329> before<00:00:57.390> they've<00:00:57.840> started

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
kills right away before they've started

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.939 
kills right away before they've started
a<00:00:58.469> running<00:00:59.160> named<00:00:59.340> Ernest<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.590> they

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
a running named Ernest you know as they

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.789 
a running named Ernest you know as they
start<00:01:02.160> although<00:01:02.430> often<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.210> toss<00:01:03.449> out<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
start although often to toss out the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.580 
start although often to toss out the
singularity<00:01:05.330> singularity<00:01:06.330> works<00:01:07.170> really

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
singularity singularity works really

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.340 
singularity singularity works really
well<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> staircase<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.140> thing

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
well here on the staircase but one thing

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.160 
well here on the staircase but one thing
that<00:01:10.590> makes<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.250> challenging<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.170> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that makes it so challenging is that the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
that makes it so challenging is that the
Scion<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> taking<00:01:14.220> shots<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.610> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
Scion is going to taking shots at you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.290 
Scion is going to taking shots at you
the<00:01:15.119> whole<00:01:15.150> time

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
the whole time

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.330 
the whole time
and<00:01:16.720> as<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:16.990> can<00:01:17.110> see<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.620> white<00:01:17.800> secularity

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
and as you can see that white secularity

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.450 
and as you can see that white secularity
right<00:01:18.550> there<00:01:18.730> completely<00:01:19.540> blocking<00:01:19.960> all

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
right there completely blocking all

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.380 
right there completely blocking all
husks<00:01:21.460> trying<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.850> make<00:01:21.970> their<00:01:22.120> way<00:01:22.240> up<00:01:22.270> the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
husks trying to make their way up the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.180 
husks trying to make their way up the
staircase<00:01:22.690> give<00:01:23.410> me<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.590> opportunity<00:01:23.800> to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
staircase give me the opportunity to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.550 
staircase give me the opportunity to
area<00:01:24.520> remove<00:01:24.760> them<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.210> take<00:01:25.810> away<00:01:25.990> most<00:01:26.230> not

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
area remove them and take away most not

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.070 
area remove them and take away most not
all<00:01:26.590> their<00:01:26.920> offer<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.370> see<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:30.820> lost<00:01:31.750> thane

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
all their offer you can see I lost thane

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.190 
all their offer you can see I lost thane
there<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:32.620> so<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.610> revived<00:01:34.120> him<00:01:34.360> but

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
there and so I revived him but

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.140 
there and so I revived him but
unfortunately<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.800> lost<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.160> far<00:01:36.190> immediately

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
unfortunately I lost so far immediately

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.110 
unfortunately I lost so far immediately
afterwards<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:39.100> I'm<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.520> trying<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.060> keep

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
afterwards but I'm just trying to keep

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.330 
afterwards but I'm just trying to keep
my<00:01:40.270> eyes<00:01:40.660> alive<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.680> trying<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.950> revive<00:01:42.160> them

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
my eyes alive and trying to revive them

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.210 
my eyes alive and trying to revive them
tactically<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.660> give<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.050> husks<00:01:44.950> another

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
tactically to to give the husks another

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.910 
tactically to to give the husks another
target<00:01:45.670> would<00:01:46.660> have<00:01:46.720> been<00:01:46.810> really<00:01:47.620> good<00:01:47.860> in

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
target would have been really good in

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.790 
target would have been really good in
the<00:01:48.100> situation<00:01:48.640> if<00:01:48.760> I<00:01:48.880> had<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.540> force<00:01:50.050> thing<00:01:50.470> to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
the situation if I had a force thing to

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.490 
the situation if I had a force thing to
run<00:01:51.100> ahead<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.430> me<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.290> would<00:01:53.410> have

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
run ahead of me because it would have

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.140 
run ahead of me because it would have
taken<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.770> pressure<00:01:53.980> off<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.400> shepherd<00:01:54.760> and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
taken the pressure off of shepherd and

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.240 
taken the pressure off of shepherd and
that's<00:01:55.900> really<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.260> only<00:01:56.500> person<00:01:56.920> trying<00:01:57.160> to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
that's really the only person trying to

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.920 
that's really the only person trying to
save<00:01:57.400> right<00:01:57.610> here

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.160 

give<00:02:00.770> them<00:02:00.890> as<00:02:01.010> many<00:02:01.130> charts<00:02:01.430> as<00:02:01.550> possible<00:02:02.170> to

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
give them as many charts as possible to

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.340 
give them as many charts as possible to
stay<00:02:03.890> alive<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.490> just<00:02:04.850> get<00:02:05.780> fist<00:02:06.140> fight<00:02:06.320> with

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
stay alive I just get fist fight with

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.780 
stay alive I just get fist fight with
him<00:02:06.590> right<00:02:06.740> there<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.100> then<00:02:07.370> after<00:02:07.670> those

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
him right there and then after those

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.180 
him right there and then after those
husks<00:02:08.090> are<00:02:08.149> dead<00:02:08.330> than<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.780> by<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.740> time<00:02:09.979> you

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
husks are dead than the by that time you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.820 
husks are dead than the by that time you
know<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.429> silence<00:02:10.820> finally<00:02:11.150> get<00:02:11.270> coming<00:02:11.480> up

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
know the silence finally get coming up

know the silence finally get coming up
my<00:02:12.830> recommendation<00:02:13.070> here<00:02:13.700> is<00:02:13.850> don't<00:02:14.330> let

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
my recommendation here is don't let

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.230 
my recommendation here is don't let
yourself<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.840> locked<00:02:15.050> into<00:02:15.230> cover<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.940> just

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
yourself get locked into cover but just

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.730 
yourself get locked into cover but just
run<00:02:17.720> back<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.380> forth<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.070> see<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.560> see

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
run back and forth as you see as you see

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.150 
run back and forth as you see as you see
me<00:02:21.920> doing<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.400> you're<00:02:22.670> going<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.820> see<00:02:24.070> one<00:02:25.070> of

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
me doing and you're going to see one of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.520 
me doing and you're going to see one of
them<00:02:25.250> right<00:02:25.520> here<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:26.090> by<00:02:26.600> running<00:02:26.900> behind<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
them right here is by running behind the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.840 
them right here is by running behind the
from<00:02:30.530> solid<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:32.170> think<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> fuel<00:02:33.560> tank<00:02:33.850> by

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
from solid I think it's a fuel tank by

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.300 
from solid I think it's a fuel tank by
running<00:02:35.120> behind<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.630> I'm<00:02:35.900> able<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.980> cause

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
running behind that I'm able to cause

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.650 
running behind that I'm able to cause
the<00:02:37.730> Scion<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.830> lose<00:02:39.830> its<00:02:40.070> lock<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.580> me<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.970> to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
the Scion to lose its lock on me and to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.660 
the Scion to lose its lock on me and to
have<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.930> switch<00:02:42.170> targets<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.550> to

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
have to switch targets and I have to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.699 
have to switch targets and I have to
switch<00:02:43.880> targets<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.739> am<00:02:46.660> delaying<00:02:47.660> its<00:02:48.020> ability

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
switch targets I am delaying its ability

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.070 
switch targets I am delaying its ability
to<00:02:48.739> use<00:02:49.100> its<00:02:49.459> shock<00:02:49.730> wave<00:02:50.000> which<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.750> just<00:02:50.900> so

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
to use its shock wave which is just so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.080 
to use its shock wave which is just so
brutal<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:53.739> way<00:02:54.739> it's<00:02:55.340> just<00:02:55.610> going<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.790> slow

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
brutal that way it's just going to slow

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.300 
brutal that way it's just going to slow
down<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.690> number<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.230> shock<00:02:57.440> waves<00:02:57.680> he<00:02:57.890> uses

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
down the number of shock waves he uses

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.580 
down the number of shock waves he uses
because<00:02:58.940> i<00:02:59.030> believe<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.750> width<00:02:59.930> sound<00:03:00.260> works

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
because i believe the width sound works

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.310 
because i believe the width sound works
is<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:00.980> has<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.310> target<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.970> or<00:03:02.540> one<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.230> your

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
is it has to target you or one of your

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.780 
is it has to target you or one of your
allies<00:03:03.680> for<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.920> specific<00:03:04.190> amount<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.730> time

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
allies for a specific amount of time

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.910 
allies for a specific amount of time
before<00:03:05.180> it's<00:03:05.510> going<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.690> open<00:03:05.780> fire<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.500> so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
before it's going to open fire on you so

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.100 
before it's going to open fire on you so
by<00:03:07.160> having<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.820> constantly<00:03:08.330> switched<00:03:08.630> targets

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
by having it constantly switched targets

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.740 
by having it constantly switched targets
it's<00:03:09.410> not<00:03:09.620> going<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.830> fire<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> shot<00:03:10.660> come<00:03:11.660> up

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
it's not going to fire a shot come up

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.449 
it's not going to fire a shot come up
here<00:03:11.930> get<00:03:12.110> them<00:03:12.200> at<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.320> gel<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.220> didn't

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
here get them at a gel but I didn't

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.259 
here get them at a gel but I didn't
actually<00:03:13.580> need<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.120> then<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:16.519> know<00:03:16.580> get<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
actually need and then you know get the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.210 
actually need and then you know get the
stuff<00:03:18.110> from<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.320> terminals<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:18.980> then<00:03:19.130> I'm

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
stuff from the terminals and then I'm

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.220 
stuff from the terminals and then I'm
just<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:20.180> know<00:03:20.209> as<00:03:20.360> soon<00:03:20.570> as<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.780> hear<00:03:21.019> the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
just you know as soon as I hear the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.500 
just you know as soon as I hear the
sound<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.430> stopped<00:03:22.880> moving<00:03:23.090> forward<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:24.250> think

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
sound I stopped moving forward I think

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.789 
sound I stopped moving forward I think
one<00:03:26.510> thing<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.780> people<00:03:27.200> might<00:03:27.350> run<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.620> over

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
one thing that people might run it over

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.539 
one thing that people might run it over
here<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.610> they<00:03:28.940> don't<00:03:29.090> realize<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.780> a

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
here is that they don't realize that a

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.009 
here is that they don't realize that a
rush<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.700> coming<00:03:32.030> they<00:03:32.390> might<00:03:32.570> hear<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.780> sound

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
rush is coming they might hear a sound

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.750 
rush is coming they might hear a sound
but<00:03:33.350> they<00:03:33.530> might<00:03:33.650> have<00:03:33.799> walked<00:03:33.980> too<00:03:34.160> far<00:03:34.190> maybe

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
but they might have walked too far maybe

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.560 
but they might have walked too far maybe
activated<00:03:35.420> two<00:03:35.660> instead<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.200> one<00:03:37.330> right<00:03:38.330> there

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
activated two instead of one right there

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.539 
activated two instead of one right there
I<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:39.470> know<00:03:39.590> was<00:03:39.739> getting<00:03:39.980> surrounded<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:40.489> I

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
I you know was getting surrounded so I

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.300 
I you know was getting surrounded so I
hit<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.880> area<00:03:41.090> r<00:03:41.269> even<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.959> singularity<00:03:42.709> to

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
hit the area r even the singularity to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.550 
hit the area r even the singularity to
hopefully<00:03:43.489> pick<00:03:43.760> up<00:03:43.940> us<00:03:44.450> Maltese<00:03:45.110> right<00:03:45.350> there

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
hopefully pick up us Maltese right there

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.250 
hopefully pick up us Maltese right there
and<00:03:46.100> getting<00:03:46.910> out<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.180> sticky<00:03:47.450> situation

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.140 

missed<00:03:50.980> with<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:51.159> singularity<00:03:51.730> right<00:03:51.909> there

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
missed with the singularity right there

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.550 
missed with the singularity right there
and<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:53.019> into<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.200> little<00:03:53.319> bit<00:03:53.470> of

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
and so I get into a little bit of

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.220 
and so I get into a little bit of
trouble<00:03:53.939> using<00:03:54.939> Samaras<00:03:55.599> throw<00:03:55.900> because<00:03:56.140> I

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
trouble using Samaras throw because I

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.020 
trouble using Samaras throw because I
don't<00:03:56.379> accuse<00:03:57.069> my<00:03:57.280> own<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.579> this<00:03:57.730> husk

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
don't accuse my own on this husk

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.649 
don't accuse my own on this husk
although<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:59.349> actually<00:03:59.620> turns<00:03:59.829> out<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.099> miss

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
although it actually turns out to miss

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.740 
although it actually turns out to miss
completely<00:04:01.659> um<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:03.489> best<00:04:03.909> tactic<00:04:04.329> right<00:04:04.510> here

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
completely um the best tactic right here

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.390 
completely um the best tactic right here
would<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.019> actually<00:04:05.200> been<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.739> run<00:04:06.159> down

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
would have actually been to run down

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.660 
would have actually been to run down
that<00:04:06.430> ring<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.510> was<00:04:08.470> fortunate<00:04:08.739> in<00:04:09.099> that<00:04:09.159> I

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
that ring I was fortunate in that I

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.780 
that ring I was fortunate in that I
didn't<00:04:10.030> have<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:11.260> only<00:04:11.739> had<00:04:11.920> about<00:04:12.040> four<00:04:12.760> or

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
didn't have I only had about four or

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.850 
didn't have I only had about four or
five<00:04:12.909> hustle<00:04:13.720> running<00:04:13.989> at<00:04:14.110> me<00:04:14.260> so<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.560> was<00:04:14.739> able

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
five hustle running at me so I was able

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.069 
five hustle running at me so I was able
to<00:04:14.980> just<00:04:15.099> retreat<00:04:15.819> backwards<00:04:16.209> but<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.959> was<00:04:17.049> a

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
to just retreat backwards but that was a

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.939 
to just retreat backwards but that was a
bad<00:04:17.260> situation<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:18.039> there<00:04:18.729> are<00:04:18.910> husks<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.949> I

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
bad situation if there are husks and I

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.830 
bad situation if there are husks and I
wasn't<00:04:21.729> able<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.090> stop<00:04:22.150> them<00:04:22.419> all<00:04:22.600> of<00:04:22.690> my

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
wasn't able to stop them all of my

wasn't able to stop them all of my
singularity<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.620> would<00:04:23.889> have<00:04:23.979> been<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.100> bad

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
singularity I would have been a bad

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.129 
singularity I would have been a bad

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
me from here the two as you can see he

me from here the two as you can see he
starts<00:06:09.240> to<00:06:09.300> consider<00:06:09.659> in<00:06:09.870> melee<00:06:10.229> range<00:06:10.500> when

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
starts to consider in melee range when

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.290 
starts to consider in melee range when
i'm<00:06:11.310> actually<00:06:11.520> not<00:06:11.729> being<00:06:12.539> blocked<00:06:12.840> by<00:06:14.300> the

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
i'm actually not being blocked by the

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.499 
i'm actually not being blocked by the
environment<00:06:15.569> so<00:06:16.439> that's<00:06:17.310> this<00:06:17.639> first<00:06:18.300> section

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509

environment so that's this first section
i<00:06:18.870> think<00:06:19.139> that<00:06:19.289> this<00:06:19.500> was<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:21.270> toughest<00:06:21.659> part

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
i think that this was the toughest part

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.290 
i think that this was the toughest part
i<00:06:22.189> there's<00:06:23.189> a<00:06:23.279> few<00:06:23.490> more<00:06:23.610> husks<00:06:24.000> that<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.210> have

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
i there's a few more husks that you have

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.879 
i there's a few more husks that you have
to<00:06:24.419> deal<00:06:24.569> with<00:06:24.719> after<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.169> Sun<00:06:25.379> but<00:06:25.680> if<00:06:25.770> you
