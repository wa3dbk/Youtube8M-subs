00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
never bring him on or anything and you

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.070 
never bring him on or anything and you
know<00:00:13.620> early<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.219> heard<00:00:14.400> he<00:00:14.549> had<00:00:14.639> autism

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
know early on we heard he had autism

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
know early on we heard he had autism
okay<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.470> then<00:00:16.680> then<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.880> mean<00:00:18.060> when<00:00:18.210> he<00:00:18.240> died

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
okay so then then you mean when he died

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.019 
okay so then then you mean when he died
or<00:00:19.050> well<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.130> don't<00:00:20.250> think<00:00:20.699> he<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.910> on

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
or well I I don't think he was on

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.880 
or well I I don't think he was on
medication<00:00:21.180> first<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.350> all<00:00:22.470> because<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.800> know

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
medication first of all because I know

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.250 
medication first of all because I know
there<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.609> I'd<00:00:24.090> live<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.480> go<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.050> much

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
there and I'd live to go how much

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.529 
there and I'd live to go how much
they're<00:00:25.560> against<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.070> had<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.310> fight<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:27.390> my

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
they're against I had to fight from my

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.200 
they're against I had to fight from my
life<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.260> take<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> medication<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.250> needed<00:00:29.640> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
life to take the medication I needed so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.440 
life to take the medication I needed so
I<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> dad<00:00:31.489> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.610> with<00:00:32.880> autism

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I think as a dad you know with autism

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
I think as a dad you know with autism
which<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> different<00:00:34.260> than<00:00:34.290> epilepsy<00:00:35.100> he

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
which is different than epilepsy he

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.720 
which is different than epilepsy he
probably<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.860> from<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.040> I've<00:00:38.190> heard<00:00:38.670> from

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
probably just from what I've heard from

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.799 
probably just from what I've heard from
some<00:00:39.800> people<00:00:40.800> who<00:00:40.829> worked<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.899> with<00:00:42.899> him<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
some people who worked with with him the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
some people who worked with with him the
kid<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.200> didn't<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.620> any<00:00:46.680> medication<00:00:47.460> he

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
kid really didn't get any medication he

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
kid really didn't get any medication he

seizure in the bathtub I had a seizure
in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> bathtub<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.710> was

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
in the bathtub so I know what that was

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.900 
in the bathtub so I know what that was
and<00:00:59.399> to<00:01:00.090> say<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> was<00:01:00.859> Kawasaki<00:01:01.859> syndrome<00:01:02.070> was

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and to say it was Kawasaki syndrome was

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.750 
and to say it was Kawasaki syndrome was
just<00:01:03.239> BS<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:04.110> his<00:01:04.350> wife<00:01:04.680> Kelly<00:01:05.430> Preston

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
just BS because his wife Kelly Preston

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.140 
just BS because his wife Kelly Preston
was<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> spokespeople<00:01:07.380> against

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
was one of the spokespeople against

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.300 
was one of the spokespeople against
psychiatry<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.240> psychology<00:01:09.470> right<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
psychiatry and psychology right and so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
psychiatry and psychology right and so
they<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.939> looked<00:01:12.150> awful<00:01:13.110> within<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
they would have looked awful within the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
they would have looked awful within the
autistic<00:01:14.430> community<00:01:14.479> with<00:01:15.479> parents<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
autistic community with parents of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.109 
autistic community with parents of
autistic<00:01:16.200> kids<00:01:16.830> getting<00:01:17.280> therapy<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:18.000> their

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
autistic kids getting therapy for their

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
autistic kids getting therapy for their
kids<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.810> here's<00:01:19.320> these<00:01:19.590> big<00:01:19.890> celebrities

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
kids and here's these big celebrities

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
kids and here's these big celebrities
against<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.409> that's

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
against it you know so I think that's

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.499 
against it you know so I think that's
why<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.159> came<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> Kawasaki

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
why they came up with the Kawasaki

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
why they came up with the Kawasaki
syndrome<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.320> he<00:01:25.409> eventually<00:01:25.710> admitted<00:01:26.189> his

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
syndrome and he eventually admitted his

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.460 
syndrome and he eventually admitted his
kid<00:01:26.610> did<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.970> autism<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.960> feel<00:01:28.229> bad<00:01:28.439> for
