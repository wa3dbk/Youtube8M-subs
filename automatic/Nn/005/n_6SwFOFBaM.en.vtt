00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello all together this is my first 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.550
 video and it works mainly in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
 make my videos around hair nails and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.610
 I show and show you in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 never made england 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 the sensor out needs the three 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.510
 different colors and white red 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.750
 or pink one sees smells and blue 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.400
 I have specially nail polish system completely 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900
 thin with that you can do fine work 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840
 do 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.960
 We have that from the internet and applies 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.720
 you can find around two euros three euros 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.700
 depending on the brand ok then we start now 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:49.020
 The first thing you have to do is to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 outline 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.030
 from the warehouse and thus saves the white 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 The easiest way is if you then the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.110
 dashes parallel makes it straight 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.979
 Go upstairs one time 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.390
 if it's a bit too high up 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.770
 does not do anything you can do it with the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770
 paint over with other nail polish 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 and next you take the red 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:09.450
 or pink said difference you can see 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.670
 not so then she paints the inner 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.080
 but is not bad as for example 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.660
 here on the left there is little bit 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.190
 made bad but yes even with yourself 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.620
 the pink and then you can too 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.880
 for celebrate and at the end that again 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.880
 white coat 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.670
 So it's easiest with so 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.460
 I like it because the nice ones are long 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.600
 but are the normal nickel and yes man 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.920
 looks there is also easily done in the end 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.920
 I know that again for better with that 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:22.010
 if there you take the blue and with the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.510
 blue times from the remaining areas so 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.510
 that between the white ones 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.560
 so only the last little one 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.459
 and then we'll improve it 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.459
 with the white pencil 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:36.689
 it remains ready now again 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.689
 White 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.910
 so and already a nail is done and 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.860
 do that now slowly everything 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.910
 So now you know how it works and on 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.090
 end it would look like that so both 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.090
 hands 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.169
 I hope you are the sg zh I believe 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.520
 that the easiest way to and 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.910
 thank you for listening and see you 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.910
