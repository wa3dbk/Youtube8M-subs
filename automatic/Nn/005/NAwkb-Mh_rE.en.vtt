taking care of this entire left side

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.899

there's<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.430> zip<00:02:22.640> line<00:02:22.849> up<00:02:23.090> there<00:02:23.270> yes<00:02:23.780> there

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
there's a zip line up there yes there

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.780 
there's a zip line up there yes there
are<00:02:24.200> zip<00:02:24.560> lines<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.099> game<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.520> can't

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
are zip lines in this game and you can't

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.790 
are zip lines in this game and you can't
take<00:02:26.030> them<00:02:26.209> all<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.660> way<00:02:26.959> across<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.470> gully

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
take them all the way across the gully

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.770 
take them all the way across the gully
however<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.670> probably<00:02:29.060> wouldn't<00:02:29.569> do<00:02:29.660> it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
however I probably wouldn't do it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.630 
however I probably wouldn't do it
because<00:02:30.140> if<00:02:30.470> you've<00:02:30.620> ever<00:02:30.770> played<00:02:31.040> black<00:02:31.430> ops

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
because if you've ever played black ops

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.729 
because if you've ever played black ops
one<00:02:31.970> you'll<00:02:32.180> note<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.569> zip<00:02:33.140> lines<00:02:33.440> are<00:02:33.709> very

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
one you'll note that zip lines are very

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.520 
one you'll note that zip lines are very
dangerous<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.819> they<00:02:35.239> leave<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.690> exposed<00:02:36.050> so

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
dangerous and they leave you exposed so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.960 
dangerous and they leave you exposed so

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
over here I usually play a little bit

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.160 
over here I usually play a little bit
more<00:02:40.580> aggressive<00:02:40.730> than<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.450> but<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.019> know

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
more aggressive than this but you know

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.100 
more aggressive than this but you know
I'm<00:02:42.380> holding<00:02:43.010> down<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.370> very<00:02:44.209> key<00:02:44.630> point<00:02:44.989> of

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
I'm holding down a very key point of

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.080 
I'm holding down a very key point of
this<00:02:45.200> map<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.709> I'm<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.310> only<00:02:46.430> person<00:02:46.519> over

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
this map and I'm the only person over

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.910 
this map and I'm the only person over
