00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.759
 good hello everyone again this is the 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.910
 second part so to speak of some 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.570
 way of the video from my collection of 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.940
 erasers 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.189
 I had already said that now I'm going to 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.170
 teach the sets left these out here 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:22.039
 because I had taught them and well I'm going 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.630
 to continue with these 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.630
 I'm missing one is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.660
 with these and then I'll change good 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.610
 I also have this set of hearts that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.879
 As you can see, it's from the same brand as the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.879
 same template I have this whale 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.250
 I have this d 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.609
 kimonos 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.320
 and then this is not the same brand 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.690
 but it's the same as little circles 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.720
 the truth that these are my favorites 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.400
 They are very comfortable to store and like 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.860
 others are going out there is all good 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.010
 then I had stopped teaching this 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.040
 gigantic rubber that I have with the flag 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.400

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.070
 I love it and we love it with 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.830
 all my heart because it is one of my 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.430
 favorite countries that I would like 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.410

 Well, it 's because my favorite is elsa 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.070

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.970
 It reminds me of my sister and me and good 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.520

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.409
