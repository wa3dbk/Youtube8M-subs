good<00:04:59.540> Colt<00:04:59.840> also<00:05:00.350> but<00:05:00.590> sports<00:05:01.280> write<00:05:01.520> that<00:05:01.820> it

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
good Colt also but sports write that it

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.060

second<00:05:04.460> was<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.670> best<00:05:04.850> race<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.240> think<00:05:05.270> the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
second was the best race I think the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.540 
second was the best race I think the
court<00:05:05.750> went<00:05:05.990> but<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.170> honestly<00:05:06.410> do<00:05:06.950> I<00:05:06.980> I<00:05:07.370> never
