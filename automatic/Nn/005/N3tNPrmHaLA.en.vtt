bit of a review of this I've had time to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.740 
bit of a review of this I've had time to
look<00:00:21.180> over<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:22.020> everything<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.720> here<00:00:24.720> goes

when you if you order this program you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.230 
when you if you order this program you
will<00:00:28.199> first<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.740> taken<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.090> an

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
will first be taken to kind of an

introductory page it's a video where ben
explains<00:00:34.290> how<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> most<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
explains how you can get the most out of

explains how you can get the most out of
this<00:00:36.239> program<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.050> i<00:00:37.530> would<00:00:37.680> really

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
this program and i would really

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
this program and i would really
encourage<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.730> follow<00:00:39.059> his<00:00:39.629> advice<00:00:39.840> here

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
encourage you to follow his advice here

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.979 
encourage you to follow his advice here
because<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.610> may<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.059> necessarily<00:00:42.210> want<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
because you may not necessarily want to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200 
because you may not necessarily want to
just<00:00:43.200> jump<00:00:43.260> into<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.800> training<00:00:44.100> videos<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
just jump into the training videos and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.080 
just jump into the training videos and
stuff<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.280> there's<00:00:47.280> he's<00:00:47.670> put<00:00:47.910> really

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
stuff like that there's he's put really

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.840 
stuff like that there's he's put really
a<00:00:48.180> lot<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.660> thought<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.260> how<00:00:50.129> he's<00:00:50.399> designed

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
a lot of thought into how he's designed

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.500 
a lot of thought into how he's designed
the<00:00:51.059> training<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.960> follow<00:00:52.559> his<00:00:52.770> advice<00:00:52.949> here

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
the training so follow his advice here

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.660 
the training so follow his advice here
another<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.809> i<00:00:55.020> will<00:00:55.079> explain<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
another thing i will explain to you is

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
another thing i will explain to you is
kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> how<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> training<00:00:57.930> works<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
kind of how the training works in this

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.330 
kind of how the training works in this
program<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.559> start<00:01:01.800> off<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.160> what's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
program you you start off with what's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.429 
program you you start off with what's
called<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> primer<00:01:02.940> phase<00:01:03.300> that's<00:01:04.140> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
called a primer phase that's just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
called a primer phase that's just
getting<00:01:04.860> your<00:01:04.979> body<00:01:05.220> ready<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.659> weeks<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
getting your body ready for the weeks of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.520 
getting your body ready for the weeks of
training<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.799> come<00:01:08.390> phase<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.080> two<00:01:10.260> are

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
training to come phase one and two are

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.789 
training to come phase one and two are
high-volume<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.760> lot<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.900> lot<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.500> reps

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
high-volume a lot of a lot of reps

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
high-volume a lot of a lot of reps
involved<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:14.939> type<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> working<00:01:15.990> out

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
involved with this type of working out

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.280 
involved with this type of working out
that's<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> first<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:17.250> phases<00:01:17.840> phase<00:01:18.840> three

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that's the first two phases phase three

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.039 
that's the first two phases phase three
is<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.040> power<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.880> hypertrophy<00:01:21.810> training

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
is more of power in hypertrophy training

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.219 
is more of power in hypertrophy training
so<00:01:22.650> that's<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.369> little<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:23.880> different<00:01:24.390> than

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so that's a little bit different than

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
so that's a little bit different than
what<00:01:25.560> you'll<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> previous<00:01:26.820> week's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
what you'll do in the previous week's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.429 
what you'll do in the previous week's
phase<00:01:28.170> 4<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.530> strength<00:01:29.159> training<00:01:29.990> phase<00:01:30.990> five

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
phase 4 is strength training phase five

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.640 
phase 4 is strength training phase five
is<00:01:31.829> d<00:01:32.310> loading<00:01:32.790> that's<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.360> of

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
is d loading that's kind of

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.630 
is d loading that's kind of
intentionally<00:01:34.650> cutting<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.460> your

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
intentionally cutting back on your

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.999 
intentionally cutting back on your
volume<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.270> intensity<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.960> give<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.590> body

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
volume and intensity to give your body

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.440 
volume and intensity to give your body
some<00:01:38.189> time<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.729> rest<00:01:39.439> Phase<00:01:40.439> six<00:01:40.470> is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
some time to rest Phase six is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
some time to rest Phase six is
overreaching<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:43.049> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.159> an

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
overreaching that's kind of like an

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
overreaching that's kind of like an
intentional<00:01:45.149> overtraining<00:01:45.960> since<00:01:46.530> you've

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
intentional overtraining since you've

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.359 
intentional overtraining since you've
just<00:01:46.890> rested<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.630> phase<00:01:48.630> seven<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> called<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
just rested in phase seven is a called a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.210 
just rested in phase seven is a called a
hyper<00:01:50.640> recovery<00:01:51.390> phase<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> those<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
hyper recovery phase so those are the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.580 
hyper recovery phase so those are the
different<00:01:53.640> phases<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.360> program<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
different phases in this program the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.289 
different phases in this program the
whole<00:01:55.799> thing<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:56.909> start<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
whole thing if you do it from start to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.440 
whole thing if you do it from start to
finish<00:01:57.600> will<00:01:57.869> last<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.560> 18<00:01:59.250> weeks<00:01:59.579> some

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
finish will last for 18 weeks some

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
finish will last for 18 weeks some
people<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.869> asked<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.409> how<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.799> compares

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
people have asked you how this compares

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.940 
people have asked you how this compares
to<00:02:02.399> mi40<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.930> program<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> good<00:02:04.770> bit

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to mi40 this program is a good bit

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.880 
to mi40 this program is a good bit
longer<00:02:05.250> than<00:02:05.700> mi<00:02:05.939> 40<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.439> get<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> lot<00:02:07.860> more

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
longer than mi 40 and you get a lot more

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.669 
longer than mi 40 and you get a lot more
content<00:02:08.610> than<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.910> did<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.959> 40<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.560> my

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
content than you did with in my 40 in my

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.340 
content than you did with in my 40 in my
40<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.069> good<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:11.700> i<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:12.239> mi40x

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
40 is good but i think mi40x

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.490 
40 is good but i think mi40x
kind<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:14.130> next<00:02:14.370> level<00:02:15.290> another<00:02:16.290> thing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
kind of the the next level another thing

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.230 
kind of the the next level another thing
I'll<00:02:16.620> talk<00:02:16.800> about<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> little<00:02:17.370> bit<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
I'll talk about it a little bit is the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.830 
I'll talk about it a little bit is the
cell<00:02:18.750> expansion<00:02:19.380> protocol<00:02:20.280> or<00:02:20.790> CEP<00:02:21.540> there's

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
cell expansion protocol or CEP there's

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570 
cell expansion protocol or CEP there's
been<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> lot<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.290> questions<00:02:22.770> about<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.280> too

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
been a lot of questions about that too

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.170 
been a lot of questions about that too
and<00:02:23.970> here's<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> idea<00:02:25.170> behind<00:02:25.700> CEP<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.000> cell

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and here's the idea behind CEP the cell

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.560 
and here's the idea behind CEP the cell
expansion<00:02:27.450> protocol<00:02:28.640> our<00:02:29.640> bodies<00:02:30.180> are<00:02:30.210> our

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
expansion protocol our bodies are our

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.010 
expansion protocol our bodies are our
muscles<00:02:31.760> basically<00:02:32.760> one<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.630> ways<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
muscles basically one of the ways that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.310 
muscles basically one of the ways that
they<00:02:34.200> grow<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.130> they<00:02:35.780> accept<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.960> donor

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
they grow is that they accept a donor

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.570 
they grow is that they accept a donor
and<00:02:37.620> nuclei<00:02:38.630> from<00:02:39.630> or<00:02:40.170> donor<00:02:40.440> nucleus<00:02:41.070> from

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and nuclei from or donor nucleus from

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.710 
and nuclei from or donor nucleus from
the<00:02:41.700> satellite<00:02:42.690> cells<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:44.730> won't<00:02:45.510> try<00:02:45.660> to

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
the satellite cells and I won't try to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.750 
the satellite cells and I won't try to
get<00:02:45.900> into<00:02:46.080> all<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> details<00:02:46.800> about<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.400> but

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
get into all the details about that but

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.240 
get into all the details about that but
i<00:02:48.000> will<00:02:48.690> say<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:48.960> i've<00:02:49.410> heard<00:02:49.710> other<00:02:50.130> people

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
i will say that i've heard other people

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.120 
i will say that i've heard other people
talk<00:02:50.550> about<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.480> long<00:02:52.200> before<00:02:52.590> i<00:02:52.620> watch<00:02:52.920> this

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
talk about this long before i watch this

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.340 
talk about this long before i watch this
program<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.760> i<00:02:53.790> know<00:02:53.910> it's<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.270> valid<00:02:54.690> theory<00:02:55.050> of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
program so i know it's a valid theory of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.730 
program so i know it's a valid theory of
muscle<00:02:55.980> growth<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:57.690> CEP<00:02:58.380> what<00:02:58.590> you're

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
muscle growth and with CEP what you're

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.910 
muscle growth and with CEP what you're
doing<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.490> you're<00:03:00.080> he<00:03:01.080> introduces<00:03:01.740> some

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
doing is you're he introduces some

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.160 
doing is you're he introduces some
techniques<00:03:02.490> for<00:03:02.610> how<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.420> coax<00:03:03.930> your

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
techniques for how you can coax your

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.850 
techniques for how you can coax your
muscles<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:05.120> borrow<00:03:06.120> these<00:03:06.390> nuclei<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.140> get

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
muscles to borrow these nuclei and get

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.620 
muscles to borrow these nuclei and get
bigger<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.250> that's<00:03:08.670> basically<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.480> idea

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
bigger so that's basically the idea

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.710 
bigger so that's basically the idea
behind<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.340> i<00:03:11.550> can't<00:03:11.820> give<00:03:12.030> too<00:03:12.300> much

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
behind that and i can't give too much

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.410 
behind that and i can't give too much
away<00:03:13.080> as<00:03:13.410> far<00:03:13.650> as<00:03:13.800> how<00:03:13.980> he<00:03:14.040> how<00:03:14.730> he<00:03:14.760> tells<00:03:15.300> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
away as far as how he how he tells you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.750 
away as far as how he how he tells you
to<00:03:15.450> go<00:03:15.630> about<00:03:15.810> doing<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:16.680> i<00:03:17.310> will<00:03:17.580> say

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
to go about doing that but i will say

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.350 
to go about doing that but i will say
it's<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.030> valid<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.320> valid<00:03:19.680> scientific

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
it's a valid it's a valid scientific

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.110 
it's a valid it's a valid scientific
idea<00:03:21.360> as<00:03:21.480> far<00:03:21.510> as<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> muscle<00:03:22.410> growth<00:03:22.590> goes<00:03:23.120> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
idea as far as a muscle growth goes you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.050 
idea as far as a muscle growth goes you
will<00:03:24.330> if<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:24.990> buy<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.320> program<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.250> will<00:03:26.730> of

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
will if you buy this program you will of

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.350 
will if you buy this program you will of
course<00:03:27.330> get<00:03:27.750> video<00:03:28.560> library<00:03:29.210> these<00:03:30.210> are

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
course get video library these are

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.170 
course get video library these are
downloadable<00:03:30.900> videos<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:32.670> quality<00:03:32.910> is

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
downloadable videos and the quality is

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.270 
downloadable videos and the quality is
really<00:03:33.270> good<00:03:33.630> instead<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.530> being<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:35.100> real

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
really good instead of just being a real

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.100 
really good instead of just being a real
small<00:03:35.580> video<00:03:35.970> when<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.450> download<00:03:36.840> one<00:03:36.990> of

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
small video when you download one of

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.200 
small video when you download one of
these<00:03:37.230> it's<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:38.130> kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.460> a<00:03:38.580> full<00:03:38.820> screen

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
these it's it's kind of a full screen

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.540 
these it's it's kind of a full screen
thing<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.410> I've<00:03:40.590> always<00:03:40.770> thought<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.160> Ben

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
thing and I've always thought that Ben

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.000 
thing and I've always thought that Ben
does<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> really<00:03:42.480> great<00:03:42.750> job<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.470> training

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
does a really great job of training

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.250 
does a really great job of training
videos<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:44.940> that's<00:03:45.120> one<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.630> big<00:03:45.780> perks<00:03:46.050> of

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
videos so that's one of the big perks of

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.640 
videos so that's one of the big perks of
this<00:03:46.380> program<00:03:46.880> you'll<00:03:47.880> also<00:03:48.120> get<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.840> nutrition

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
this program you'll also get a nutrition

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.560 
this program you'll also get a nutrition
guide<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.280> course<00:03:50.580> if<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.880> want<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.270> put<00:03:51.450> on

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
guide of course if you want to put on

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.810 
guide of course if you want to put on
muscle<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.230> have<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.500> follow<00:03:52.740> a<00:03:52.920> nutrition

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
muscle you have to follow a nutrition

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
muscle you have to follow a nutrition
program<00:03:54.320> there<00:03:55.320> is<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.560> supplement<00:03:56.190> guide<00:03:56.840> and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
program there is a supplement guide and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.690 
program there is a supplement guide and
one<00:03:58.350> thing<00:03:58.530> I'll<00:03:58.620> say<00:03:58.650> about<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.160> supplement

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
one thing I'll say about the supplement

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.750 
one thing I'll say about the supplement
guide<00:03:59.850> is<00:04:00.120> his<00:04:00.960> advice<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.770> good<00:04:02.040> but<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.520> may

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
guide is his advice is good but you may

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.850 
guide is his advice is good but you may
want<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.120> shop<00:04:03.420> around<00:04:03.630> about<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.500> see<00:04:04.680> if<00:04:04.740> you

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
want to shop around about and see if you

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.230 
want to shop around about and see if you
can<00:04:05.010> find<00:04:05.160> some<00:04:05.430> better<00:04:05.700> deals<00:04:06.030> on

so<00:04:26.940> what<00:04:27.660> do<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:27.870> think<00:04:27.960> about<00:04:28.260> this<00:04:28.590> program

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
so what do I think about this program

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.480 
so what do I think about this program
overall<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.380> only<00:04:31.710> thing<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.250> really

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
overall the the only thing that I really

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.390 
overall the the only thing that I really
don't<00:04:33.000> like<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.780> sales<00:04:34.320> page<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:35.070> me<00:04:35.220> all

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
don't like is the sales page to me all

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.370 
don't like is the sales page to me all
the<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:36.150> marketing<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.960> all<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.260> stuff

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
the the marketing and all that stuff

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.640 
the the marketing and all that stuff
with<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.740> sales<00:04:37.980> page<00:04:38.250> I'm<00:04:38.580> not<00:04:38.820> crazy<00:04:39.060> about

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
with the sales page I'm not crazy about

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.010 
with the sales page I'm not crazy about
but<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.800> actual<00:04:41.280> program<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:42.630> it's<00:04:42.810> a

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
but the actual program I think it's a

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.140 
but the actual program I think it's a
good<00:04:43.470> value<00:04:43.680> for<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.400> money<00:04:44.430> if<00:04:44.970> you're

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
good value for the money if you're

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.950 
good value for the money if you're
thinking<00:04:45.450> about<00:04:45.830> 18<00:04:46.830> weeks<00:04:47.160> that's<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.540> that's

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
thinking about 18 weeks that's a that's

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.080 
thinking about 18 weeks that's a that's
a<00:04:49.110> pretty<00:04:49.320> good<00:04:49.500> value<00:04:49.919> if<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.880> were<00:04:50.970> to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
a pretty good value if you were to

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.550 
a pretty good value if you were to
compare<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.510> to<00:04:51.690> what<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.110> would<00:04:52.230> cost<00:04:52.260> to

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
compare that to what it would cost to

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.530 
compare that to what it would cost to
buy<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.919> personal<00:04:53.520> trainer<00:04:53.820> or<00:04:54.120> something<00:04:54.450> like

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
buy a personal trainer or something like

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.050 
buy a personal trainer or something like
that<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:55.590> me<00:04:55.740> it's<00:04:55.889> a<00:04:55.980> cost<00:04:56.280> effective<00:04:56.520> way<00:04:56.880> to

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that to me it's a cost effective way to

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.780 
that to me it's a cost effective way to
get<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.450> lot<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:57.930> good<00:04:58.919> solid<00:04:59.340> training

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
get a lot of good solid training

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.719 
get a lot of good solid training
information<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.950> think<00:05:01.950> this<00:05:02.070> program<00:05:02.550> would

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
information I think this program would

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.420 
information I think this program would
be<00:05:02.940> best<00:05:03.300> suited<00:05:03.570> for<00:05:03.750> someone<00:05:04.350> who's<00:05:05.190> been

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
be best suited for someone who's been

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.460 
be best suited for someone who's been
training<00:05:05.669> for<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> little<00:05:06.150> while<00:05:06.389> maybe<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:07.200> few

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
training for a little while maybe a few

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.070 
training for a little while maybe a few
months<00:05:07.950> or<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.130> year<00:05:08.250> or<00:05:08.490> two<00:05:08.700> and<00:05:08.970> looking<00:05:09.930> to

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.110 
months or a year or two and looking to
break<00:05:10.350> through<00:05:10.740> some<00:05:11.010> plateaus<00:05:11.550> in<00:05:11.880> gaining

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120
