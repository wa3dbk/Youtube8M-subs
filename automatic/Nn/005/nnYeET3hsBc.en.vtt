00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello friends first of all I want 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.799
 thank you for following me on facebook and 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.570
 on twitter here I leave the links of 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.059
 my facebook and twitter pages for 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.890
 that they visit them and they are also in the 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.770
 video description 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.740
 many times we leave our computer 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.740
 personal or our laptop in the middle of 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.900
 work and want anyone to see what 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.660
 we are doing therefore 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.790
 activate our screen saver 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.140
 but there is a way for that once 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.170
 our protector has been activated 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.180
 screen is necessary a key one 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.950
 password to reactivate the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.000
 computer and return to our homework 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.220
 normal this key obviously should be 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.289
 only known to us by the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.390
 computer users at the moment 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.720
 for this we are going to establish a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.870
 password on start control panel 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.840
 user account 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.739
 and here is the user currently 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.519
 my account 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.680
 my user already has a password for 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.320
 so I'm not going to add it but 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.140
 is here if you do not have it will come out 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.979
 here an option to create password something 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 well and they create it now the second step is 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.109
 go desk 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.460
 Right click and we give you to customize 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:25.009
 now we go to the protective option of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.009
 screen we will choose here an image 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.049
 or an animation and what we are going to do 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.990
 is to put here in show the screen of 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.640
 login when resuming and ready 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.170
 We set a waiting time for 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 example one minute apply and accept and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.690
 ready with this we'll wait a minute and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.220
 the screen saver will appear and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.250
 we will have to put our password 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.159
 to log in again and ready 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.810
 I hope you can use this tutorial as 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.430
