00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.820
 dr 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.520
 us when the company four years 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.560
 back with the idea of ​​revolutionizing 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.840
 way people buy shoes and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.090
 our strong point has always been the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.490
 convenience that we bring to the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.289
 consumers can buy 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 online they do not need to have all this 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.730
 store experience they do not need 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.920
 catch a transit spend a time in life 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.970
 them with this fact of purchase and with that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.690
 they have time to enjoy life 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.430
 their 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.320
 then the concept that brought much 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.800
 side of people enjoy life there 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.890
 outside we needed to make a move 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.809
 too strong to really become a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.000
 fashion store very strong work that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.820
 started at the beginning of last year and here 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.489
 there is actually now the highlight ne 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 with ss development of our own 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:09.780
 the Dafiti collection called me this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.430
 incredible design of a brand and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.320
 actually we ended up riding eight 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 fifa brands have their own 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 internal agency is your house that is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.450
 organizing all this work fitch 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
 collection together with our 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.670
 employees is a great challenge to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.619
 2015 but that everyone is so 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.850
 excited to do because the result 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.720
 We are sure that you will stay. 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.720
 Wonderful 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.979
 I think the biggest challenge of this campaign 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.840
 was to translate what the team of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.670
 created that it was the urban scenario 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 but we did not want to identify 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.380
 that was new york he was london 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.110
 or create sao paulo we painted 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.329
 pedestrian tracks brought traffic light 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 we hired the incredible plastic artist 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.750
 to make the whole piece of graphite , 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.270
 The idea was to bring some of this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.670
 to the studio and then our challenge was 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.009
 try to rebuild a piece of this 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.500

 we have this dog of six 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.150
 people in that 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.189
 in urban environment at this location and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.829
 scenery and what we wanted 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.530
 energy of the class arriving invading the 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.379

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.599

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.489

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.810
 external and non-recording and dec 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.670
 tenth personality taxi cabs 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.939

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.939
 you 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.650
 one thing that caught my attention 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.030
 was the size of the production so I stayed 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.680
 scared even when we were 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.939
 Losing filming was an experience 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.650
 very cool, I've never worked 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.889

 who has been rolling in the wings or in the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.220
 I even think it's being 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.290
 evidenced through photos 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.989
 the clothes are beautiful also the collection is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.120

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.889

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.729
 count on so many good people 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.729
