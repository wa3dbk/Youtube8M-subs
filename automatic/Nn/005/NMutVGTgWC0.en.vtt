evening<00:01:10.579> will<00:01:11.579> pump<00:01:11.790> anywhere<00:01:12.119> from

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
evening will pump anywhere from

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
approximately one milliliter all the way

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
approximately one milliliter all the way
up<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> around<00:01:14.700> ten<00:01:15.119> milliliters<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.170> first

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
up to around ten milliliters the first

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
up to around ten milliliters the first
thing<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.829> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> enter<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.640> how

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
thing that I'm going to enter is how

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.210 
thing that I'm going to enter is how
much<00:01:18.060> water<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.540> moving<00:01:18.899> through<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.649> river

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
much water is moving through the river

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.639 
much water is moving through the river
and<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:21.090> we'll<00:01:21.270> set<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.720> simple<00:01:22.079> pumping

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
and then we'll set up a simple pumping

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.460 
and then we'll set up a simple pumping
system<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.460> pump<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> pheromone<00:01:25.020> into

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
system that will pump the pheromone into

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
system that will pump the pheromone into
the<00:01:25.590> trap<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.610> doesn't<00:01:26.939> take<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.119> much

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the trap it doesn't take very much

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
the trap it doesn't take very much
pheromone<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> lamprey<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> able<00:01:29.189> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
pheromone for the lamprey to be able to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.780 
pheromone for the lamprey to be able to
detect<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.920> you're<00:01:31.920> interested<00:01:32.310> in

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
detect it if you're interested in

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.639 
detect it if you're interested in
fishing<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.509> any<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> those<00:01:33.869> larger<00:01:34.229> fish

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
fishing for any of those larger fish

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.310 
fishing for any of those larger fish
species<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> should<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.390> at<00:01:37.259> least

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
species then you should be at least

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.139 
species then you should be at least
educated<00:01:38.040> about<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.549> effects<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.000> sea

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
educated about the effects of sea

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.440 
educated about the effects of sea
lamprey<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> Michigan<00:01:42.000> we're

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lamprey so right now in Michigan we're

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.230 
lamprey so right now in Michigan we're
pumping<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.469> pheromone<00:01:43.920> three<00:01:44.219> KPCS<00:01:44.880> into

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
pumping the pheromone three KPCS into

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.899 
pumping the pheromone three KPCS into

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
kill them it's not a love potion it's a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.819 
kill them it's not a love potion it's a
