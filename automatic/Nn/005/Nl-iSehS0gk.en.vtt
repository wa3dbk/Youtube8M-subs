00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello my dear, there is one today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.810
 video about the five advantages of salad 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.179
 The first advantage is salad is so 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.059
 delicious you can combine very well 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.610
 on with raw or fried vegetables 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 I would have to use different oils 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 For example, I like to use oil 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.859
 and that is the first advantage of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.570
 salad as he is just so diverse 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.340
 that you see him with so many things vision 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.109
 can and therefore never actually 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 boring tastes salad goes to 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.460
 example very well with fried mushrooms 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.969
 with steamed tomatoes or with 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.160
 inlaid orange slices or for example also 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.840
 Just a few zucchini world 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 Over salad also contains a great deal 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 fiber which causes ours 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.840
 stomach is well filled and how long 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.239
 They stay 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.399
 Advantage 3 You will not be like this in the summer 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 be crowded and I find it completely I 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 the whole summer days are called correct 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.110
 there you have something right 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.149
 to eat warm food 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 That's why it's such a big salad 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.410
 Ideal for when a huge portion of salad 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.140
 Per day then you are already 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 crazy with all the vitamins 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.290
 antioxidants and so on 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 which actually needs of course 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.560
 and everything in it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.450
 but you are right to a portion 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 Salad really in any case very much 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.140
 A good salad is natural 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.310
 also a perfect resteessen if you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.170
 only a few mushrooms or a few 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 tomato paprika course not find it 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.310
 just make sense to cook something or 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.930
 to think about what can I do and am 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.490
 salad is actually perfect because you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.140
 needs only a little bit of all 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.490
 as I said a few leftovers and then has 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.619
 you already have such a great salad 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.509
 Another advantage to the salad is the oil 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.890
 lets come in I use for example 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.600
 always oil or hemp 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.330
 and the good thing is it's one of those 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.159
 the main advantages of this oil is to 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.080
 example very strong anti inflammatory and 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.220
 this is due to the omega-3 fatty acids never 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.540
 contained therein 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.000
 So if you are, for example, inflammatory 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.580
 conditional diseases then have on everyone 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.979
 fall off or oil for example 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.200
 lends is totally fast made that 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.180
 Fiber in the salad act like 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.369
 a sponge in our body and can 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.840
 so absorb many toxin in the intestine and 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.820
 then just cut out if you eg 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.710
 You should have more blockages 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.119
 salad and fiber to take you 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.050
 The salad makes it possible for you 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.060
 can do better 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.070
 the muscle contraction that the name just 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.350
 always transported before 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.580
 Simply created and therefore it 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.530
 is definitely better if you have it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.940
 times has problems can go to the toilet 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.350
 Of course, to say more about it 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.800
 I think that's enough for a little one 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.220
 Video 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.220
 bye for now
