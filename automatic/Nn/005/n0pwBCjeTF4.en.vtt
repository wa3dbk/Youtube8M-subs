 of the nice weather also all will be viewing 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.640

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.270

 [Music] 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.320

 4 liter v8 this is a 3 liter 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.409
 six-in-line 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.510
 well then you often hear at the end 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.430
 of this story so the 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.170
 Cintiq sound experience less but yes 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.640

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.660
 so anything that makes a little noise 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.660

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.920

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.630

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.050
 sit like that was full 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.270
 that is what we thought 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.189
 [Applause] 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.780

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.250
 Tom had worked yes where of course 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.630
 Also to note is how the radio 538 is 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.210
 peter's comes a hefty one that can harmonize 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.410
 do harman kardon system 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.610
 very thick yes I think it's just one 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.520
 wiser progress I have to say then 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.160

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.250
 have to buy but now i'm in it and 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.890
 view a bit from the outside 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.690
 I think a whole thing is a hotel 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.340
 and especially natural emp that speaks 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.490

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.260

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.820
 personalized and yes exactly and 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.140
 with that you can actually get the brilliance of 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.970
 set the loto 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.610
 you can open a number of copies separately 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.530
 serve the rigidity of your chassis 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.420
 change your steering wheel to that comfort position 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.650
 at a sport it really can be quite here 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.430
 simply create your own position 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.080

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.550

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.819
 basically everything reasonable in comfort 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.560
 position is that actually finished driving 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.819
