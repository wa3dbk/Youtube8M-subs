00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
kind of liquid it becomes paracellular

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.720 
kind of liquid it becomes paracellular
and<00:03:22.430> gelatinous<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.850> should<00:03:24.030> say<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.340> and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
and gelatinous I should say and so and

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.830 
and gelatinous I should say and so and
it<00:03:27.299> absorbs<00:03:27.510> everything<00:03:28.170> really<00:03:28.500> quickly<00:03:28.920> so

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
it absorbs everything really quickly so

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.080 
it absorbs everything really quickly so

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
about two-thirds cup of water and then

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.520 
about two-thirds cup of water and then
it<00:03:38.970> should<00:03:39.209> look<00:03:39.329> like<00:03:39.389> up<00:03:39.690> pancake<00:03:40.350> batter

your<00:04:40.280> water<00:04:40.490> bottle<00:04:40.970> yes<00:04:41.840> exactly<00:04:42.230> like<00:04:42.590> this

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
your water bottle yes exactly like this

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.790 
your water bottle yes exactly like this

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
so the chunks I'm getting them and all

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.290 
so the chunks I'm getting them and all
this<00:04:45.950> actually<00:04:46.190> end<00:04:46.490> up<00:04:46.580> throwing<00:04:46.790> this<00:04:47.090> whole

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
this actually end up throwing this whole

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.250 
this actually end up throwing this whole
pulp<00:04:47.660> away<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.820> then<00:04:49.820> that's<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.720> and<00:04:51.080> then

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
pulp away and then that's that and then

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.840 
pulp away and then that's that and then
we<00:04:51.500> have<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.850> steamed<00:04:53.090> vegetables<00:04:54.850> arugula
