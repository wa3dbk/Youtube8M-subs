00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.160 
now first we're going to solve with the
3d<00:02:14.130> text<00:02:14.520> layers<00:02:14.840> which<00:02:15.840> are<00:02:15.990> basically

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
3d text layers which are basically

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.610 
3d text layers which are basically
lenders<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.100> did<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:18.140> hold<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> letters

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
lenders that I did of hold the letters

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.270 
lenders that I did of hold the letters
and<00:02:19.860> different<00:02:20.760> fonts<00:02:21.270> here<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:26.190> can

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and different fonts here and you can

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.600 
and different fonts here and you can
just<00:02:26.460> change<00:02:26.700> change<00:02:27.480> them<00:02:28.490> change<00:02:29.490> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
just change change them change the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.390 
just change change them change the
colors<00:02:29.970> if<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.480> want<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:31.020> Photoshop<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.040> by

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
colors if you want in Photoshop that by

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.060 
colors if you want in Photoshop that by
doing<00:02:32.640> hue<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.150> saturation<00:02:33.180> or<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:34.980> just

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
doing hue and saturation or you can just

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.850 
doing hue and saturation or you can just
