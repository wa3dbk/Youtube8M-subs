00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.000
 Just a long time ago it was only in the world of fiction 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.000
 Woman cool you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.790
 A car that runs on its own without the help of a driver 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:45.520
 It is a so-called robot car 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:47.640
 In the last few years, each automaker and it's biggest google have been developing at a steady pace 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.640
 I will 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:58.230
 In the spring of this year, about 5500 k test drive across the United States succeeded 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.230
 further 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:15.960
 Even robot tracks better than robot cars improve 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.960
 Just last month this self-driving truck was authorized for public road trials in Nevada 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:26.460
 The robot car uses cameras and radar sensors to recognize surrounding information 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:34.070
 Mechanism that enables automatic travel by analyzing in detail 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:39.220
 Unlike human beings, it is said that traffic accidents can be dramatically reduced because they are not affected by fatigue and fatigue . 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:44.340
 So worrisome is the fact that when the will as we ride 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.340
 Many manufacturers target this number 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 23 car blue led into downpour 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.069
 It will be five years until we can see the robot car that runs in the city 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.569
 Do you think 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.569

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.370
 What 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.160
 It is a feeling that it is useful or not . 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.160
 There were a lot of people who felt reality 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:07.970
 But in fact, the states and regions that are legally preparing for the spread of robot cars were in the United States 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.610
 5 places 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.480
 Under such circumstances, the state of Nevada approved test operation to google's robot car 3 years ago 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.340
 Since 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.900
 Anyway, cooperative collection for development 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:31.360
 It seems that the governor, who is active in introducing the latest technology, supports the development with the Lord 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:35.970
 Therefore , I was a manager of the Nevada Land Transport Bureau and attended the test drive of the robot car many times. 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.970
 I asked to talk to Jude, who say
