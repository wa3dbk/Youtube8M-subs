00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:13.370
 the staff here at night already with the new 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.139
 car 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.450
 the most anticipated Ford 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.980
 this year spent the whole day with the 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.730
 today because you're recording here already 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.730
 at the end of the day 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.839
 well this is the small big engine 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.570
 1.0 three-cylinder as you can see is 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.430
 very compact and to compensate for this 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.540
 Gorgeous - the Ford used that 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.430
 technologies 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.680
 so here we are talking about 1.0 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.910
 which has four valves per cylinder and 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.310
 in addition it has double command 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.380
 that is, it would take the command of the 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.790
 valves both at the intake and in the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.610
 escape this new job is 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.860
 expected still gives the platform of new 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.770
 fiesta he brings some things already 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.200
 known as the electrical direction that is 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.960
 same system of the boss that is where the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.369
 ethics, she has a year to two 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.040
 vibrations 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:11.689
 she is fast she has a good time 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.700
 Communication is also pro driver but 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.770
 in relation to the party changes a lot 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.539
 I thought I was even surprised. 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.340
 as they made from the same platform a 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.070
 quite different car 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.899
 the first impression I got was a 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.390
 car much bigger inside then the shape 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.799
 from a distance here to the ceiling 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.229
 much larger than does not close does not close 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.960
 you drive very low it's kind of a 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.590
 cockpit on offer has a connotation one 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.969
 slightly more sporty than the car is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.890
 so I think women will go 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.850
 quite like that position of driving 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.679
 taller 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.899
 he has a seat too with a little 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:49.369
 less side support and more 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.950
 concern for comfort - with Rene 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.359
 also in relation to the party with a 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.789
 difference felt in this car at 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:59.479
 suspension the same way he brought it 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.299
 a greater height is a position of 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.399
 driving more relaxed let's say the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.759
 own part of the suspension also of 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.670
 suspension was also made with a view to 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.230
 more comfort than the new party 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.480
 Then you ask me but it got bad 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.610
 Not too far from that. 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.360
 the car has quite a behavior 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.590
 stable 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.230
 it is so compared with hp 20 onyx it 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.230
 is well within this category 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.750
 and I came also a while ago from the bank 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.410
 behind 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.010
 I'm 78 to me driving and 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.170
 someone wraps around in the back is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.330
 there is plenty of room to spare 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.300
 the space also has plenty for the head 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.690
 on the car's performance you could say 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.160
 that he will take the lead in 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.230
 category of 1.0 is a very good engine. 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.270
 quite elastic is the three engine 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.580
 cylinders the vibration went very well 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.200
 contained by the form you may not realize 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.360
 other people here in the newsroom 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.550
 driving the car we bought while 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.890
 three-cylinder engine like hb 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.440
 the motor of the own wide then the people 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.420
 noticed a very close motor 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.350
 he has that little bit of three 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.170
 cylinders right 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.840
 You need a little stronger the motorcycle. 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.970
 with a very cool low touch 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.280
 so much so that it enabled Ford to put a 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.140
 a slightly longer exchange rate 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.360
 so you travel with him on the road to 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.410
 120 per hour at our default speed 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.220
 on the roads 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.170
 you travel with it to 3,700 viruses can 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.510
 affect 120 per hour in fifth gear 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.610
 if you compare for example another one 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.269
 zero point itself and stays in the 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.600
 4,100 shots then you win and 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.480
 noise is you have a much smaller noise 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.500
 engine has entered the car and also 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.049
 in consumption 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.239
 you have a smoother spinning engine 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.320
 generating less you spend less 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.360
 fuel 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.830
 in terms of good price I think the 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.299
 photo was very realistic 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.250
 they put in the range of 35 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.810
 the first to the first version that already comes 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.019
 with everything you need 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.640
 already has electric air conditioning 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.620
 already has a sound system with the largest 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.160
 doc that you fit your cell phone here 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.700
 Do you use your cell phone as GPS with this 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.080
 end 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.360
 this version here is sl is the top goes 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.190
 add stability control 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.900
 it will also add the wheels of 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.770
 light alloy ring 15 are the same 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.470
 the party rs and nÃ© will add too 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.300
 What sync do you have? 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.620
 besides the bluetooth connection you have the 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.630
 voice commands you can do 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.600
 as new fiesta is open here speak 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.560
 Call the person already calling with 10 more 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.840
 one thousand command 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.960
 so if you compare the HB with the same 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.190
 content that will go to the 37 37 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.020
 500 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.720
 so I think it's going to be a good fight 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.220
 way and I think you can sell and 10 more 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.919
 thousand units per month 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.710
 they want to be leader of the category between 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.710
 1.0 in retail
