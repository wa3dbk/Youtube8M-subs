their their composite rods are like

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.590 
their their composite rods are like
extremely<00:01:55.140> light<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.560> can't<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:56.600> realize

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
extremely light you can't really realize

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.000 
extremely light you can't really realize
how<00:01:57.690> light<00:01:57.990> isn't<00:01:58.230> see<00:01:58.380> actually<00:01:58.620> hold<00:01:58.830> one

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
how light isn't see actually hold one

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.890 
how light isn't see actually hold one
but<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.700> mean<00:01:59.910> that's<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> first<00:02:00.360> thing<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
but I mean that's the first thing that

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.350 
but I mean that's the first thing that
people<00:02:01.140> notice<00:02:01.440> is<00:02:01.710> how<00:02:01.830> light<00:02:02.070> they<00:02:02.280> are

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
people notice is how light they are

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.050 
people notice is how light they are
again<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.600> seven-eleven<00:02:04.230> it's<00:02:04.440> got<00:02:04.620> a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
again it's a seven-eleven it's got a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.660 
again it's a seven-eleven it's got a
rather<00:02:06.060> soft<00:02:06.480> tip<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.050> it<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> got<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.460> lot

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
rather soft tip on it but it's got a lot

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.609 
rather soft tip on it but it's got a lot
of<00:02:08.700> backbone<00:02:09.119> once<00:02:09.510> you<00:02:09.630> hook<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> fish<00:02:09.960> it's

of backbone once you hook a fish it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.990 
of backbone once you hook a fish it's
very<00:02:10.830> pure<00:02:11.040> ball<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:11.520> could<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.820> a<00:02:11.850> good

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
rods had some that but blanks for too

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.440 
rods had some that but blanks for too
long<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:04.770> we've<00:04:05.490> all<00:04:05.670> got<00:04:05.850> their<00:04:06.090> lip<00:04:06.240> gloss

and edwyn eavers or any block it we had

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.520 
and edwyn eavers or any block it we had
a<00:04:08.940> lot<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.120> mediums<00:04:09.480> on<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.810> at<00:04:09.990> what<00:04:10.290> length

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
a lot of mediums on this at what length

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.400 
a lot of mediums on this at what length
we<00:04:10.709> wanted<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.280> kind<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.930> kind<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:13.019> went<00:04:13.230> in

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
we wanted and we kind of kind of went in

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.050 
we wanted and we kind of kind of went in
between<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.860> got<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.340> perfect<00:04:14.580> what<00:04:14.970> we

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
between and got the perfect what we

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.940 
between and got the perfect what we
think<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.480> perfect<00:04:15.900> length<00:04:16.019> for<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.380> butt

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
think is a perfect length for the butt

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.490 
think is a perfect length for the butt
of<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.130> rod<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:18.570> got<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> couple<00:04:18.930> regular<00:04:19.320> guys

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
of the rod you got a couple regular guys

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.650 
of the rod you got a couple regular guys
go<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.010> micro<00:04:20.400> guides<00:04:20.609> which<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.269> really

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
go to the micro guides which I really

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.940 
go to the micro guides which I really
like<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> micro<00:04:22.230> guides<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:22.650> there's<00:04:22.830> so

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
like the micro guides but there's so

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.220 
like the micro guides but there's so
much<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.340> rod<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.940> wrap<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.450> ground

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
much to this rod the wrap and the ground

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.140 
much to this rod the wrap and the ground
that<00:04:25.350> we<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.620> graphite<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.280> what<00:04:26.790> makes<00:04:27.000> them

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
that we the graphite is what makes them

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.090 
that we the graphite is what makes them
a<00:04:27.270> double<00:04:27.450> X<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.080> makes<00:04:28.650> them<00:04:28.770> extremely

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
a double X and makes them extremely

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.060 
a double X and makes them extremely
strong<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:30.480> extremely<00:04:30.750> light<00:04:31.169> but<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.980> know

write<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.790> helped<00:05:02.180> design<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.630> handles<00:05:02.990> the

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
write I helped design the handles the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.430 
write I helped design the handles the
lengths<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.250> got<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.460> drop<00:05:04.910> shot<00:05:05.120> model<00:05:05.480> here<00:05:05.720> and

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
lengths I got a drop shot model here and

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.140 
lengths I got a drop shot model here and
this<00:05:06.980> is<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.160> shaky<00:05:07.460> head<00:05:07.700> model<00:05:07.910> only

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
this is a shaky head model only

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.850 
this is a shaky head model only
difference<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.050> shaky<00:05:09.350> head<00:05:09.530> models

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
difference is the shaky head models

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.980 
difference is the shaky head models
gonna<00:05:10.010> be<00:05:10.070> a<00:05:10.100> little<00:05:10.250> bit<00:05:10.340> stiffer<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:11.810> what

but<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.370> mainly<00:05:31.940> smooth<00:05:32.420> transition<00:05:32.990> for<00:05:33.350> me

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
but the mainly smooth transition for me

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.610 
but the mainly smooth transition for me
is<00:05:33.650> then<00:05:34.480> what<00:05:35.480> makes<00:05:35.690> me<00:05:35.870> love<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:36.170> rod<00:05:36.380> so

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
it's hard to explain why but maybe it's

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.990 
it's hard to explain why but maybe it's
because<00:06:07.300> of<00:06:07.479> the<00:06:07.750> way<00:06:08.680> they<00:06:08.830> feel<00:06:09.069> the<00:06:09.340> power
