they're kind of related to spiders for
that<00:00:24.140> matter<00:00:24.669> they<00:00:25.669> are<00:00:25.699> SAP<00:00:26.300> feeding

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
that matter they are SAP feeding

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.769 
that matter they are SAP feeding
organisms<00:00:27.499> and<00:00:28.310> there's<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:29.329> couple<00:00:29.570> of

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
organisms and there's a couple of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.260 
organisms and there's a couple of
important<00:00:30.320> parts<00:00:30.859> of<00:00:31.039> spider<00:00:31.369> mite<00:00:31.640> biology

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
important parts of spider mite biology

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.150 
important parts of spider mite biology
that<00:00:32.810> we<00:00:32.900> can<00:00:33.079> take<00:00:33.230> advantage<00:00:33.380> of<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.070> we're

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
that we can take advantage of and we're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.180 
that we can take advantage of and we're
trying<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.489> manage<00:00:34.700> them<00:00:35.030> one<00:00:35.750> is<00:00:36.190> that

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
trying to manage them one is that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.160 
trying to manage them one is that
they're<00:00:37.550> very<00:00:37.579> small<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:38.690> they<00:00:38.780> have<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.930> lot<00:00:39.140> of

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
they're very small so they have a lot of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.319 
they're very small so they have a lot of
exposed<00:00:39.710> surface<00:00:40.160> area<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:41.270> means

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
exposed surface area and that means

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.900 
exposed surface area and that means
they're<00:00:41.719> very<00:00:41.750> vulnerable<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:43.129> desiccating

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
they're very vulnerable to desiccating

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.229 
they're very vulnerable to desiccating
to<00:00:44.090> drying<00:00:44.480> out<00:00:44.949> okay<00:00:45.949> and<00:00:46.219> what<00:00:46.789> that<00:00:47.000> means

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
to drying out okay and what that means

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.479 
to drying out okay and what that means
if<00:00:47.780> you're<00:00:47.930> a<00:00:47.960> spruce<00:00:48.289> spider<00:00:48.620> mite<00:00:48.890> is<00:00:49.100> that

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
if you're a spruce spider mite is that

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.430 
if you're a spruce spider mite is that
you<00:00:49.609> don't<00:00:49.850> want<00:00:50.090> to<00:00:50.149> feed<00:00:50.449> on<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.780> outside<00:00:51.289> of

the tree you don't really want to be up

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.009 
the tree you don't really want to be up
in<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.969> top<00:00:53.210> of<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.480> tree<00:00:53.719> where<00:00:53.750> you're

those benefits may be that they can

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.980 
those benefits may be that they can

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
faster which means they're reproducing

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.720

more<00:02:15.080> another<00:02:15.800> thing<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.129> can<00:02:16.250> happen<00:02:16.430> is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
more another thing that can happen is

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.150 
more another thing that can happen is
the<00:02:16.879> fee

male<00:02:17.280> spruce<00:02:17.670> spider<00:02:17.970> mites<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.480> they<00:02:18.630> get<00:02:18.870> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
male spruce spider mites if they get a

little bit of extra nitrogen will

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.150 
little bit of extra nitrogen will
produce<00:02:20.910> more<00:02:21.270> offspring<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.800> means<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
produce more offspring so that means a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.000 
produce more offspring so that means a
bigger<00:02:23.370> population<00:02:23.670> those<00:02:24.770> mites<00:02:25.770> will

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
bigger population those mites will

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.340 
bigger population those mites will
mature<00:02:26.220> they'll<00:02:26.700> produce<00:02:26.880> offspring<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.840> it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
mature they'll produce offspring and it

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.770 
mature they'll produce offspring and it
can<00:02:28.500> get<00:02:28.650> out<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.890> control<00:02:29.160> very<00:02:29.490> quickly

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
have condensation and so forth and then

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.870 
have condensation and so forth and then
you<00:02:42.570> really<00:02:43.020> see<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.470> often<00:02:44.250> times<00:02:44.460> become<00:02:44.850> a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
fall and sometimes what happens is we go

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.790 
fall and sometimes what happens is we go
through<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.880> drought<00:02:51.240> period<00:02:51.780> maybe<00:02:52.500> in<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
through a drought period maybe in the

through a drought period maybe in the
spring<00:02:53.160> more<00:02:53.370> commonly<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> drought<00:02:54.510> in

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
spring more commonly we get a drought in

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.840 
spring more commonly we get a drought in
August<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.490> causes<00:02:56.490> some<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
August and that causes some of the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.000 
August and that causes some of the
proteins<00:02:57.330> within<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.810> tissues<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.740> tree

proteins within the tissues of the tree

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.950 
proteins within the tissues of the tree
to<00:02:59.190> break<00:02:59.430> down<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.330> get<00:03:00.450> more<00:03:00.660> amino

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
to break down and you get more amino

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.000 
to break down and you get more amino
acids<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.680> SAP<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.730> benefits<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.570> mites

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.530 
acids in the SAP that benefits the mites
you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.160> look<00:03:05.310> at<00:03:05.430> your<00:03:05.580> trees<00:03:05.850> yeah<00:03:06.240> maybe

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
you can look at your trees yeah maybe

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.880 
you can look at your trees yeah maybe
you<00:03:06.750> see<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.050> have<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.200> little<00:03:07.380> bit<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.590> spruce

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
you see you have a little bit of spruce

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.320 
you see you have a little bit of spruce
spider<00:03:08.220> mite<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.640> there<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:08.940> see<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> little

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
spider mite in there you see a little

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.150 
spider mite in there you see a little
bit<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.540> webbing<00:03:09.990> maybe<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.500> see<00:03:10.680> some<00:03:10.890> actual

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
bit of webbing maybe you see some actual

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.640 
bit of webbing maybe you see some actual
mites<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:12.360> come<00:03:12.600> back<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.870> three<00:03:13.440> weeks

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
mites if you come back in three weeks

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.370 
mites if you come back in three weeks
maybe<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> month<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.540> population<00:03:15.750> may

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
maybe in a month the the population may

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.410 
maybe in a month the the population may
have<00:03:16.590> exploded<00:03:17.100> just<00:03:17.940> because<00:03:18.210> of<00:03:18.360> this

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
have exploded just because of this

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.910 
have exploded just because of this
reproduction<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.230> because<00:03:19.440> now<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.710> have

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
reproduction and because now you have

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.640 
reproduction and because now you have
multiple<00:03:20.580> generations<00:03:21.030> feeding<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.110> in<00:03:22.410> terms

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
multiple generations feeding so in terms

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.760 
multiple generations feeding so in terms
of<00:03:22.860> trying<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.130> manage<00:03:23.430> spruce<00:03:23.910> spider<00:03:24.209> mite

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
of trying to manage spruce spider mite

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.960 
of trying to manage spruce spider mite
one<00:03:25.770> of<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.950> things<00:03:26.190> that's<00:03:26.340> real<00:03:26.580> important

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
one of the things that's real important

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.790 
one of the things that's real important
is<00:03:27.090> scouting<00:03:27.420> your<00:03:27.690> trees<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.560> closer

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
is scouting your trees and the closer

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.290 
is scouting your trees and the closer
those<00:03:29.040> trees<00:03:29.310> get<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.640> harvest<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.120> more

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
those trees get to harvest the more

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.270 
those trees get to harvest the more
important<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.900> scout<00:03:31.350> them<00:03:31.530> if<00:03:31.770> you're

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
important it is to scout them if you're

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.890 
important it is to scout them if you're
going<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.459> find<00:03:32.760> mice<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.300> best<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.600> find

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
going to find mice it's best to find

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.220 
going to find mice it's best to find
them<00:03:34.050> early<00:03:34.290> know<00:03:35.070> what<00:03:35.310> you're<00:03:35.459> dealing<00:03:35.670> with

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
them early know what you're dealing with

secondly there are predatory mites tiny
mites<00:03:40.830> these<00:03:41.160> are<00:03:41.370> mites<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.850> you're<00:03:42.000> not

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
mites these are mites that you're not

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.310 
mites these are mites that you're not
going<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.360> be<00:03:42.420> able<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.630> see<00:03:42.870> without<00:03:43.140> a

going to be able to see without a

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.380 
going to be able to see without a
microscope<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.670> may<00:03:44.820> not<00:03:44.970> even<00:03:45.030> realize

microscope and you may not even realize

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.360 
microscope and you may not even realize
they're<00:03:45.989> out<00:03:46.020> there<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.590> they're<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.100> whole

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
they're out there and they're a whole

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.270 
they're out there and they're a whole
lot<00:03:47.640> better<00:03:47.940> at<00:03:48.360> tracking<00:03:49.080> down<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.830> hunting

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
lot better at tracking down and hunting

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.820 
lot better at tracking down and hunting
and<00:03:50.580> capturing<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.750> killing<00:03:51.780> spruce<00:03:52.530> spider

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
and capturing and killing spruce spider

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.100 
and capturing and killing spruce spider
mites<00:03:53.130> then<00:03:53.880> you're<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.300> be<00:03:54.510> even<00:03:54.900> with

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
mites then you're going to be even with

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.680 
mites then you're going to be even with
the<00:03:55.140> best<00:03:55.440> insecticide<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.239> want<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.540> try

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
the best insecticide so you want to try

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.810 
the best insecticide so you want to try
to<00:03:57.750> conserve<00:03:58.380> those<00:03:58.680> predatory<00:03:59.280> mites<00:03:59.580> and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
to conserve those predatory mites and

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.150 
to conserve those predatory mites and
there's<00:04:00.450> actually<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> way<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.290> do<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.860> and

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
there's actually a way to do this and

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.910 
there's actually a way to do this and
it's<00:04:02.430> because<00:04:02.940> there<00:04:03.330> are<00:04:03.480> now<00:04:03.800> products<00:04:04.800> that

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
it's because there are now products that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.400 
it's because there are now products that
have<00:04:05.010> been<00:04:05.040> developed<00:04:05.820> maite<00:04:06.270> sites<00:04:06.630> that

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
have been developed maite sites that

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.340 
have been developed maite sites that
will<00:04:07.770> kill<00:04:08.190> spider<00:04:09.060> mites<00:04:09.390> including<00:04:09.989> spruce

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
will kill spider mites including spruce

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.990 
will kill spider mites including spruce
spider<00:04:10.709> mite<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.130> kind<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.400> mites<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.820> feed

spider mite the kind of mites that feed
on<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.360> SAP<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.410> plants<00:04:13.940> those<00:04:14.940> new

predatory<00:04:18.330> mites<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.200> you're<00:04:19.380> kind<00:04:19.560> of

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
predatory mites and so you're kind of

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.620 
predatory mites and so you're kind of
getting<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.919> best<00:04:20.160> of<00:04:20.310> both<00:04:20.489> worlds<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.180> have

getting the best of both worlds you have

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.360 
getting the best of both worlds you have
to<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:21.870> very<00:04:22.109> careful<00:04:22.650> with<00:04:22.740> those<00:04:22.860> products

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
to be very careful with those products

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.070 
to be very careful with those products
most<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.760> them<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.180> only<00:04:24.330> apply<00:04:24.720> once

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
most of them you can only apply once

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.080 
most of them you can only apply once
during<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.650> season<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.280> don't<00:04:26.789> want<00:04:27.000> to

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
apply them more than what the label

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.150 
apply them more than what the label
specifies<00:04:29.510> because<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.660> don't<00:04:30.840> want

becomes resistant to the miticide so you

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.280 
becomes resistant to the miticide so you
