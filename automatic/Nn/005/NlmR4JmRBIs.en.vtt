I'm going every three weeks and the more
often<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> quicker<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.120> do

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
often I go then the quicker they can do

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
often I go then the quicker they can do
the<00:00:48.360> adjustments<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.620> that's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the adjustments and you know that's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
the adjustments and you know that's
going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> cut<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.340> time<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> long<00:00:51.030> run

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
going to cut off time in the long run

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.209 
going to cut off time in the long run
which<00:00:51.809> hopefully<00:00:52.079> isn't<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.620> much<00:00:52.739> longer<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
which hopefully isn't that much longer I

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.000 
which hopefully isn't that much longer I
keep<00:00:53.520> saying<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.149> keep<00:00:54.449> hoping<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:55.710> time

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
keep saying that I keep hoping this time

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.750 
keep saying that I keep hoping this time

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
because one of the chains the power

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.840

close and because all the gaps that I
can<00:01:55.439> feel<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.280> actually<00:01:56.790> closing<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
can feel and see actually closing up the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630 
can feel and see actually closing up the
midline<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.100> point<00:01:59.310> where<00:01:59.490> it's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
midline is right on point where it's

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
midline is right on point where it's
supposed<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.930> everything's<00:02:01.350> good<00:02:03.320> he

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
supposed to be so everything's good he

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.899 
supposed to be so everything's good he
took<00:02:04.530> me<00:02:04.680> off<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> bands<00:02:05.280> during<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.729> day

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
took me off the bands during the day

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.700 
took me off the bands during the day
which<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.299> awesome<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:07.110> almost<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.649> good

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
which is awesome that's almost as good

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.190 
which is awesome that's almost as good
as<00:02:07.860> getting<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> braces<00:02:08.640> off<00:02:08.899> because<00:02:09.899> for

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
as getting the braces off because for

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.110 
as getting the braces off because for
the<00:02:10.259> past<00:02:10.289> month<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.979> had<00:02:11.039> had<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> wear<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> two

the past month I had had to wear the two

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.010 
the past month I had had to wear the two
diagonals

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
diagonals

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.910 
diagonals
and<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.800> here<00:02:13.980> all<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.550> time<00:02:14.870> which<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.320> eat

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and one up here all the time which I eat

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
and one up here all the time which I eat
about<00:02:17.130> eat<00:02:17.340> meals<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.760> day<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.600> was<00:02:18.750> really

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
about eat meals a day so that was really

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.320 
about eat meals a day so that was really
opinion<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> be<00:02:19.620> taking<00:02:19.980> those<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.520> out<00:02:20.640> so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
opinion to be taking those in and out so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.970 
opinion to be taking those in and out so
at<00:02:21.450> least<00:02:21.600> now<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> only<00:02:22.350> have<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.650> wear<00:02:22.800> those

at least now I only have to wear those

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.280 
at least now I only have to wear those
at<00:02:23.190> night<00:02:23.400> which<00:02:24.300> means<00:02:24.330> they<00:02:24.810> never<00:02:25.020> get<00:02:25.170> in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290

diagonal up here they just just on the
top<00:02:39.510> they<00:02:40.500> closed<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.980> gap<00:02:41.130> up<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.580> back

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
top they closed the gap up in the back

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.960

I've<00:02:42.390> been<00:02:42.750> wearing<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.170> two<00:02:43.530> months<00:02:43.800> ago

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
and it closed up the gap then we took it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.750 
and it closed up the gap then we took it
off<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> month<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.160> gap<00:02:50.340> opened

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
I had it back on and it closed it again

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.330 
I had it back on and it closed it again
and<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:57.030> time<00:02:57.380> last<00:02:58.380> week<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.860> Tuesday<00:02:59.310> he

together<00:03:01.650> again<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.490> just<00:03:03.390> stick<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
together again and just stick with the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.620 
together again and just stick with the
two<00:03:04.200> diagonals<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.400> now<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.180> been<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.360> week

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
two diagonals but now it's been a week

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.940 
two diagonals but now it's been a week
since<00:03:06.660> then<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.350> I<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:07.590> noticed

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
since then and I actually noticed

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.860 
since then and I actually noticed
yesterday<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:09.210> was<00:03:09.240> starting<00:03:09.660> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
yesterday that I was starting the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.630 
yesterday that I was starting the
starting<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.710> food<00:03:11.010> stuck<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.490> there

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
starting to get food stuck in there

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.240 
starting to get food stuck in there
again<00:03:11.910> which<00:03:12.600> means<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:13.140> gap<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:13.860> opening

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
again which means that gap was opening

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.950 
again which means that gap was opening
back<00:03:14.400> up<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.540> i<00:03:15.570> don't<00:03:15.720> know<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:15.870> that's

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
back up so i don't know if that's

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.470 
back up so i don't know if that's
something<00:03:16.230> he's<00:03:16.440> planning<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.490> know<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.670> keep

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
something he's planning you know to keep

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.770 
something he's planning you know to keep
shifting<00:03:19.020> stuff<00:03:19.410> over<00:03:19.830> but<00:03:20.550> i<00:03:20.850> actually<00:03:21.240> went

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
shifting stuff over but i actually went

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.110 
shifting stuff over but i actually went
ahead<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.500> put<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.130> band<00:03:23.370> back<00:03:23.550> on<00:03:23.670> last

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
ahead and and put the band back on last

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.440 
ahead and and put the band back on last
night<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.190> i'm<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.490> going<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.760> try<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.060> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
night and i'm just going to try it I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.390 
night and i'm just going to try it I
should<00:03:28.230> probably<00:03:28.350> call<00:03:28.770> but<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.070> know<00:03:29.160> I've

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
should probably call but I know I've

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.449 
should probably call but I know I've
called<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.970> many<00:03:30.030> times<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.220> past

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
called so many times you know the past

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.370 
called so many times you know the past
three<00:03:32.760> appointments<00:03:33.300> I've<00:03:33.390> moved<00:03:33.630> up<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
three appointments I've moved up so I

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.800 
three appointments I've moved up so I
really<00:03:35.370> think<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:36.270> it's<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:36.600> that

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
really think that that it's just that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.810 
really think that that it's just that
one<00:03:37.110> gap<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.530> really<00:03:37.800> stubborn<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.490> think<00:03:38.730> if

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
one gap is really stubborn so I think if

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.540 
one gap is really stubborn so I think if
I<00:03:38.910> just<00:03:39.120> wear<00:03:39.300> it<00:03:39.420> at<00:03:39.540> night<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.950> it'll<00:03:41.400> keep

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
I just wear it at night then it'll keep

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.190 
I just wear it at night then it'll keep
that<00:03:41.790> tight<00:03:42.090> while<00:03:42.660> still<00:03:42.990> keeping

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
that tight while still keeping

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.110 
that tight while still keeping
everything<00:03:43.560> else<00:03:43.800> tight<00:03:44.100> if<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.760> notice

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
everything else tight if I do notice

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.030 
everything else tight if I do notice
that<00:03:45.450> some<00:03:45.660> gaps<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> front<00:03:46.530> start<00:03:46.860> to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
that some gaps in the front start to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.520 
that some gaps in the front start to
open<00:03:47.490> back<00:03:47.880> up<00:03:48.090> because<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:48.570> pulling<00:03:48.930> that

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
open back up because it's pulling that

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.350 
open back up because it's pulling that
obviously<00:03:50.040> take<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.459> off<00:03:50.640> or<00:03:50.880> just<00:03:50.940> called

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
obviously take that off or just called

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.750 
obviously take that off or just called
but<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.680> already<00:03:53.070> noticing<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.730> difference

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
but I'm already noticing a difference

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.490 
but I'm already noticing a difference
just<00:03:54.240> from<00:03:54.300> wearing<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.840> one<00:03:55.020> night<00:03:55.050> it's

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
just from wearing it one night it's

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.960 
just from wearing it one night it's
starting<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:55.890> close<00:03:56.040> back<00:03:56.370> up<00:03:56.400> because<00:03:56.790> it's

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
starting to close back up because it's

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.270 
starting to close back up because it's
it's<00:03:57.240> really<00:03:57.450> fast<00:03:57.900> because<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.410> band<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.130> so

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it's really fast because the band is so

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.199 
it's really fast because the band is so
tight<00:03:59.550> right<00:03:59.580> there<00:03:59.959> so<00:04:00.959> that's<00:04:01.950> it

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
tight right there so that's it

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.000 
tight right there so that's it
everything's<00:04:03.209> going<00:04:03.420> good<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.170> said<00:04:04.440> my

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
everything's going good like I said my

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.900 
everything's going good like I said my
next<00:04:05.850> appointment<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:06.540> four<00:04:07.380> weeks<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.550> i
