00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 to die is tragic enough though 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.010
 if it still synonymous when mixing 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.420
 happens then that's really like though 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello together with the film factory to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.620
 tragic death of the talented 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.820
 actor philip seymour hoffman 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.310
 I did not even deal with it 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.890
 which actors really tragic 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.020
 have died and 13 tragic 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 I have death cases for you now 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.789
 Place 13 I brantley he plays 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.349
 the main role in the crow and there 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.599
 you could out of cost and time 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.090
 namely no pistols dummy anymore 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 took a real should indeed 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.079
 direction schreckschuss go it solved 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.670
 but a part of the projectile and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.710
 brought the main actor in the middle of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 a close up I find 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.190
 unbelievably tragic because it is still at 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 the shooting happened and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.340
 that's why my 13th 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.890
 on the twelve I have bruce lee the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 most famous martial arts fighter of all 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 times 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.980
 and it is actually the father of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.390
 Brantley's bar shooting and bruce 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.710
 lee indirectly also namely in the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.289
 filming the man with the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.110
 death claw he overworks himself and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.450
 died of cerebral edema that is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.520
 Both were in the film industry and both 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.409
 The quasi set I think 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.270
 unbelievably tragic and that's why 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.560
 they also packed right with the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.299
 emphasize again that it is now 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 somehow no ranking from because of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.750
 place 13 can be less sad 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.100
 as in place one but is easy 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.049
 times order for myself 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 Decided on the 11 I have cory 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.860
 monteith that the famous glee 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.689
 actor last year too 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.549
 with a heroin drug cocktail ins 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.650
 beyond conveyed and there we see 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.090
 just over and over again that is fierce 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 to work in his industry 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 the pressure seems to be endless 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.020
 and cory monteith just did not come along 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.119
 clear name drugs and died on the 10th 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.299
 i have marilyn monroe and that is yes 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.390
 been the biggest filmdiva ever 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.920
 they also took their own lives in 1962 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.259
 form of tablets 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 that is very tragic because she was just 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.470
 an exception like her too 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.320
 very much in hollywood today 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.820
 Very rare to see under her 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.969
 most famous movie is likely and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.259
 some like it's hot but many 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.000
 great movies came out but 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.420
 unfortunately no more 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.430
 because 1962 wanted to report where not 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.930
 Age at number nine I have romy 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.460
 Tailor the famous sissi 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.650
 Actress still today 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.500
 christmas with us on the screen 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.930
 the names are in 1982 with tablets 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.970
 the life and one still says today 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.740
 that it's not just the tablets 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.140
 but also her broken heart 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.450
 because she has the death of her son the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.250
 died very early did not survive 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.080
 and that's why they say give her 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.870
 broken heart made sure that 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.420
 she herself taken that next to 1982 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.370
 has on the 8 I've river phoenix is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.110
 the brother of joaquin phoenix the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.540
 meanwhile also very successful 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.220
 and Oscar winner also honors many 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.620
 movies shot river phoenix died 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 but then in 1993 on a drug cocktail 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.660
 so there again problems in the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.610
 psyche is addicted to drugs and that is very 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.320
 Some will be tragic to you 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.690
 certainly from he indiana jones 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.340
 just know something old 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.200
 has not become the good one 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.060
 and also all the more tragic that be now 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.480
 brother is so incredibly successful 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.190
 sometimes that's just life 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.840
 writes tragic stories 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.640
 history of river phoenix is ​​one 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.650
 on seventh place I have brittany 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.140
 Murphy also particularly tragic because you 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.610
 do not know 100% until today 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.530
 how did it happen? 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.660
 He died of a heart condition 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.720
 however, you are still today 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.370
 also sure that it's intense 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.650
 Drug use with her former partner 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.230
 the little later also at one 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.750
 heart disease died in any case reason 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.510
 For that she was with roles like in 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.950
 eight mile or crazy but also 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.680
 in clueless the breakthrough was successful 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.360
 one of the most complex and 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.209
 most flexible actor of her generation 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.519
 which unfortunately died in 2009 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.100
 on the six I have long song 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.690
 may not all know but 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.220
 scrubs fans know the actor 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.090
 every case has itself last year 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.250
 shot 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.590
 he was severely depressed and suffered from 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.510
 borderline syndrome has life that way 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.579
 could not stand it anymore and then took it 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.010
 Life on the 5th died one of the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.310
 greatest rebels of all time today 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.459
 James Dean is such an absolute sign 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.010
 none for coolness and striking poses 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.540
 smoked as well as james dean or died 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.270
 already in the age 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.680
 of 24 years in a car accident and 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.240
 one of the most famous roles of him 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.090
 was too and they do not know what they are 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.980
 and so he died a lot 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.990
 i david too early on the four 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.970
 many know carradine from martial 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.890
 arts film straight on cable 1 and 2 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.810
 probably the maca was the death of 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.120
 all died while mixing while he was mixing 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.950
 himself was more lustful 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.330
 feel 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.100
 wikipedia does not say that as diligently as 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.810
 I say yes, but died saying yes 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.360
 Car erotic choking game 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.920
 the result is the same he just died 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.500
 as he satisfied himself 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.840
 I like it very much but very tragic 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.490
 and the thought itself to die like that 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.940
 to read about in the newspaper too 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.650
 have to 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.900
 I find it very bad and not 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.880
 I would say full on place three 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.320
 philipp seymour hoffman and that is 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.060
 one of the most gifted 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.200
 actor last years been ob 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.600
 now mainstream like mission impossible 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.250
 or tribute of panem or the 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.160
 smaller films for the east as well 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.560
 kitty won as once often 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.390
 Siblings services and and disbelief 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.580
 ask meryl streep was always there 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.530
 to the point and the more tragic it is 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.820
 that there again the drugs in the game 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.430
 were and that's why I have philipp 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.350
 seymour hoffman on the 3rd place 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.870
 I also have something very tragic 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.750
 Not long ago Paul Walker 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.210
 star from the far away views row died 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.050
 also because of driving too fast in the 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.300
 automobile 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.950
 He was on the side of a race driver 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.920
 and they lost control over the 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.900
 dare and still burned in the wreck that 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.400
 was very tragic and also a reason 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.900
 why this year the feast in the 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.030
 freestyle light comes to the theaters 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.650
 but everything is rewritten around him 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.990
 also to set a monument and therefore 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.410
 comes the seventh person in freestyle it 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.490
 in 2015 on the only one and me 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.260
 would like to emphasize once again that 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.090
 now no ranking is because of the 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.710
 once is more tragic and sad than 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.140
 the 13 but I have to be in any one 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.370
 fashion style make such a ranking follow 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.770
 can not say everything at once 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.500
 so now the once heath ledger 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.680
 was an absolute exceptional talent 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.660
 died in 2008 just because of the consequences 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.720
 taking medications and that was 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.700
 very very sad you already knew 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.430
 from his mental problems and he 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.830
 was always one 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.990
 rather the one who was a bit more sensitive 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.340
 as others has been filming in many 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.010
 I played with you 10 things 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.480
 So hate the first breakthrough 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.790
 finally arrived in the Olympics 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.220
 at with brokeback mountain he has with 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.720
 jackson hole the school cowboy relationship 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.350
 played and then he still has for the 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.300
 role of the joker with his last film 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.980
 He also has batman the dark knight 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.230
 still posthumously get the oscar completely 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.610
 Cope was a terrific achievement and 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.100
 he is not even 30 years old 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.390
 and is now mine 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.640
 sad ending 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.200
 here are the tragic deaths of 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.060
 I want the actors of you 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.220
 know now there are already 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.680
 He is still playing the role of actor 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.240
 still mourns or is there others 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.680
 Artists can also be musicians at 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.140
 he are really very very sad 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.220
 that's no longer art 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.140
 can do that please write 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.730
 my comments it is hard to do so 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.440
 to tell a video that has me 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.600
 liked or did not like it 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.460
 if it was informative for you and 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.350
 get some new information here 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.480
 could then let the thumb thumbs 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.220
 up there who but now says dear 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.140
 so where would I prefer to go to 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.270
 go to the cinema and see a movie review 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.370
 I linked two and they exist 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.530
