00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.240
Hi. You're watching Make Thrift Buy. A show

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.970
where you send me clothes that you've found
on the internet and I try my best to re-create

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.799
them. Today's challenge was sent in by chrisk
cupcakes, who asked me to re-create this t-shirt

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.620
by The Left Bank which retails for 20 to 30
dollars with 18 dollars shipping on top of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.199
that if I wanted to buy it.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.590
So let's go get started.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.679
First, I drew a city skyline shape onto a
piece of cardboard with pencil. I cut this

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.679
out using scissors. Then I placed this half-way
down on a slightly too-large black t-shirt.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.930
I also taped the cardboard onto the shirt
with the idea of keeping it in place.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.670
Then I filled a spray bottle with some bleach,
put on a pair of gloves for safety, and I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.960
started spraying the t-shirt with the bleach.
I didn't really know how much bleach to use,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.550
so I kind of just went for it, spraying the
bleach on pretty liberally. I tried to spray

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.920
on the most bleach closest to the skyline
and less up at the top of the shirt. It slowly

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.760
started turning red wherever the bleach was.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.770
I then carefully tried to remove the cardboard
and this is where I realized I probably shouldn't

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.229
have taped it down. So don't do that.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.420
But anyway, I then gave the shirt a good rinse.
Then I chucked the shirt in the washing machine

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.850
on its own for a really short cycle. Then
I hung it out on the line to dry.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.979
Unfortunately, some of the bleach made it
through to the back of the shirt. So I thought,

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.009
“Next time I should put a piece of cardboard
inside the shirt to stop this from happening”.

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.350
For some reason, I then totally forgot to
do this. I proceeded to repeat the same thing

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.319
that I did before, on the back of the t-shirt
this time. At least I didn't stick the stencil

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.149
down on the shirt this time which made removing
the stencil a lot easier.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.840
Now I ended up with these areas where the
bleach went really blotchy which I think could

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.210
probably be fixed next time by being more
careful to do an even spray across the shirt.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.200
Nonetheless, I rinsed the bleach off and I
hung it out to dry.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.920
Okay. So the back sucks, but the front is
actually pretty alright.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.920
Actually, looking at the original shirt, there's
bigger splotches on that shirt too. So, yeah.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.810
I totally did the splotches on purpose?

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.780
I then decided to make some of the splotches
more obvious, or something. So I mixed up some

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.350
paint with a little bit of fabric medium and
I started painting blotches onto the back

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.500
of the t-shirt. I then took some artistic
license and turned this blotch down here into

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.170
a UFO. Then somehow that escalated fairly
quickly into a full-blown alien attack apocalyse

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.530
scene complete with falling asteroids and
burning buildings.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.720
So yeah. That happened.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.000
I then decided that I would maybe just not
touch the front at all and leave it as it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.280
was. So after setting the paint into the back
of the shirt using an iron, the last step

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.600
was to cut the arms shorter. As t-shirt material
doesn't fray, I simply rolled the sleeves

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.120
over twice to cuff them.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.120
[music plays]

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.590
So... I'd say you probably can make this yourself
and, if I was to do it again, I would remember

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.910
to put some cardboard inside the shirt before
I spray it with bleach. That was my main problem.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.260
But yeah, for 3 dollars, I'm pretty happy
with it. So-

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.380
[scissor and zipper sound effects]

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.880
But if you wanted the real-deal, then I would
suggest checking out Left Bank's website-

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.990
the designer who made the original t-shirt.
The store's actually run by an independent

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.670
designer who hand-makes the stuff themselves
and isn't even terribly expensive. So it's

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.820
a pretty cool company to go and support if
you can afford to.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.470
Although, theirs is missing a crucial alien
apocalypse scene on the back. Anyway, if you

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.420
enjoyed this episode, then please give me
a thumbs up, subscribe to my channel, share

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.890
my videos, and keep those awesome suggestions
for new challenges coming. I'll see you all

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.630
next time.
