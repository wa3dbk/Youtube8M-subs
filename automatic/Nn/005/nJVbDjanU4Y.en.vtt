Hello , you're on the channel life dolls

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.040
In this video , I'll show you how to make an organizer !

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.480
Lets go!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:26.200
We need: scissors, needle and thread , pen , ruler, fabric and a piece of paper

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:38.880
First, take the paper and cut out a square

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.240
Now cut out the shapes and contours are on fabric

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:47.794
it will be pockets

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:03.200
that would make these semicircles must take carved circle and cut in half

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.680
that would make the foundation you need to take 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.240
one large rectangle and fold it in half and sew the edges

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.560
Next you have to cut out all the pockets

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.080
If you damage one pocket would be better to remake it

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:10.160
then begin to sew pockets

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:20.880
Finally this video came to an end . We have been doing it all day long.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.720
Already the sun was beginning to set

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.880
