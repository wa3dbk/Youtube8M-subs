 wait five seconds to come out 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.510
 they will be here and they managed to assault 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 advertising 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.110

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.000
 download 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.670
 they are only two parts as he had said 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.170
 previously the first part is of a 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 gigabyte and the second part is 654 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.830
 megabytes 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.830
 ok I will leave you 2 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 two files 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.720
 you give him to extract here 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.400
 they asked for the design password 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.760
 this w 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:52.280
 virtual exchanges dot org 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:56.390
 ok because the agreement will leave them 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.880
 three files ignore these two and 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.439
 let's go in the folder 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.090
 I hope I wait before doing something 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.109
 First 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.650
 so I will leave you 24 files of the 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.490

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.800
 can you ignore these 3 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.150
 let's go back to the solos we are interested where 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.150
 is the game or isa 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.050
 you can open it with the one of August when 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.950

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.450
 excuse point 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.519

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.480
 unknown publisher make changes 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.310

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.850
 our case 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.580

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.330
 install 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.030
