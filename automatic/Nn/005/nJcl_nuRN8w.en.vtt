00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.340
 it's time for a new card chaos 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.920
 and as you can see above that is the topic 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.440
 Spiders spin everywhere and in this time 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.690
 There are many networks on your way 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.070
 weber the whole thing works like that 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.779
 Do not put a deck together but you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.490
 is put 1 you can one of the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.320
 select new classes and then leads 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.359
 the duel started the same 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.220
 So you do not have the chance before 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 to see what's going on there 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.310
 for those in there you see 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.399
 What should they be in there for that matter? 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.030
 net weber in principle you play with 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.760
 a lid full of net weber and the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.469
 appropriate classes conjure up theirs 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.020
 For example, I have as 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.270
 priest then has a holy wrath 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.280
 or kandis points double or should 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.280
 fun or the hunter can face me 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 fire a shot or fall 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.030
 use and the whole unfolds 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 then that you want the networks 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.300
 Weber constantly compete against each other 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 to let 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.420
 against your enemies and then looks 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 what get so and you see it already 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.560
 a fun mix of such 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.150
 for example, the beast I have there 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.830
 I've already gotten mechsner 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.820
 more often seen that then on the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.420
 hand was played 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.369
 or here king moakler of course and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.290
 then we would have to look with the stuff like that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.390
 if not working now, for example 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.790
 have so much idea of wild animals decks 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.100
 hunters will definitely be worthwhile 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.259
 previously before you start the house of cards 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.670
 to look into your collection to see 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.210
 what are they for? 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.770
 For example, you can also use the maps 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.840
 malorny get straight or 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.700
 will be cut down is actually in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 thuine card but he is just one 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.500
 wild animal and accordingly you can the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.479
 also get the hand and I have 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 just like the hunter a bit 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 flattened he has his whole hand empty 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.470
 played and I have such a small one there 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.790
 cards advantage that i thought oh that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.680
 but makes no fun I'll go out 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.439
 now I have felt but you will 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.630
 anyway small lakes and as usual if 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.189
 her in the cards chaos wins if you 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 against a randomly chosen one 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.850
 Counterparties have been active since and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.759
 you win a card 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.340
 pack from the classic collection 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.930
 Of course that also means that meanwhile 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.430
 maybe many people 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.530
 the cards already have the then in 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.879
 this package in there are in my 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.200
 case it was like this for example i have 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.180
 I already have five days of war 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.180
 well, the next time a pity
