and<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:18.060> trigger<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.109> Salter<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.390> trigger

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and this trigger is a Salter the trigger

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.519 
and this trigger is a Salter the trigger
that<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.930> there<00:00:22.490> was<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.580> screwy

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
that was in there was all screwy

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.609 
that was in there was all screwy
so<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:26.150> finally<00:00:27.150> saw<00:00:28.050> without<00:00:28.260> triggering<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
so I finally saw without triggering the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.179 
so I finally saw without triggering the
address<00:00:28.920> right<00:00:29.070> now<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:30.119> he<00:00:30.210> could<00:00:30.359> use<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:31.189> but

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
address right now so he could use it but

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.690 
address right now so he could use it but
I<00:00:32.550> got<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.120> trigger<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.520> one

at all or things like that a lot of
times<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.310> trigger<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:17.970> kinda

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
times the trigger because that's kinda

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.260 
times the trigger because that's kinda
like<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> computer<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> drill

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
like the computer of the drill

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.380 
like the computer of the drill

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
alright so there's going to be four I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.010 
alright so there's going to be four I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
believe they're t15 screws right here

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890 
believe they're t15 screws right here
right<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.549> see<00:01:29.579> them<00:01:29.850> over<00:01:30.000> and

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
whole trigger that should hold it in

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.420 
whole trigger that should hold it in
good<00:05:26.190> it<00:05:27.180> should<00:05:27.390> fit<00:05:27.660> like<00:05:27.690> perfectly

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430
