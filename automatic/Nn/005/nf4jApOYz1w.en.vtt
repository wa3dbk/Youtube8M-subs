00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
at home that's a good idea so what do we

at home that's a good idea so what do we
got<00:00:27.789> here<00:00:27.820> so<00:00:28.240> what<00:00:28.570> we<00:00:28.660> have<00:00:28.840> here<00:00:28.869> as<00:00:29.410> you<00:00:29.590> can

got here so what we have here as you can

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.620 
got here so what we have here as you can
see<00:00:29.859> there's<00:00:30.039> two<00:00:30.220> separate<00:00:30.519> layers<00:00:30.730> of<00:00:31.000> in<00:00:31.510> a

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
see there's two separate layers of in a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.450 
see there's two separate layers of in a
liquid<00:00:31.810> here<00:00:32.080> someone<00:00:32.529> on<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.800> bottom<00:00:33.130> ok

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
liquid here someone on the bottom ok

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.250 
liquid here someone on the bottom ok
this<00:00:33.700> is<00:00:33.850> what<00:00:34.030> ok<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.420> then<00:00:34.719> I<00:00:34.780> pour<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.230> oil

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
this is what ok and then I pour the oil

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.560 
this is what ok and then I pour the oil
on<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:35.680> top<00:00:35.860> ok<00:00:36.250> just<00:00:36.370> regular<00:00:36.760> always<00:00:37.059> just

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
on the top ok just regular always just

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.670 
on the top ok just regular always just
stands<00:00:37.750> at<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:37.899> top<00:00:37.960> because<00:00:38.230> it's<00:00:38.500> less

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
stands at the top because it's less

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.920 
stands at the top because it's less
denser<00:00:39.010> than<00:00:39.129> water<00:00:39.190> so<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:40.120> can<00:00:40.660> see<00:00:40.780> this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
denser than water so you can see this

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.049 
denser than water so you can see this
too<00:00:41.410> thick<00:00:41.620> layers<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:42.190> know<00:00:42.309> separation

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
too thick layers you know separation

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.549 
too thick layers you know separation
here<00:00:43.270> now<00:00:43.690> this<00:00:43.809> is<00:00:43.899> just<00:00:43.930> regular<00:00:44.200> vegetable

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
here now this is just regular vegetable

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.889 
here now this is just regular vegetable
oil<00:00:44.980> just<00:00:45.309> privileged<00:00:45.850> apology<00:00:46.390> ok<00:00:46.629> something

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
depending upon what sort of fireworks

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.560 
depending upon what sort of fireworks
that<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.280> want<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.520> make<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.820> can<00:00:51.969> in<00:00:52.210> a<00:00:52.329> mix

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
that you want to make you can in a mix

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.880 
that you want to make you can in a mix
and<00:00:52.690> all<00:00:52.840> this<00:00:53.020> match<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.500> although<00:00:53.739> they

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
and all this match and although they

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.680 
and all this match and although they
know<00:00:54.039> you're<00:00:54.550> gonna<00:00:54.670> drop<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.210> what

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
know you're gonna drop it and what

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.569 
know you're gonna drop it and what
happens<00:00:56.020> here<00:00:56.110> is<00:00:56.140> you<00:00:56.230> got<00:00:56.379> on<00:00:57.160> this<00:00:57.309> side<00:00:57.550> so

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
happens here is you got on this side so

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.040 
happens here is you got on this side so
which<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:57.910> much<00:00:58.149> more<00:00:58.329> clear<00:00:58.629> because<00:00:58.809> can

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
which is much more clear because can

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.389 
which is much more clear because can
start<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.440> fireworks<00:00:59.620> before<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.250> it's

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
start the fireworks before so it's

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.830 
start the fireworks before so it's
already<00:01:00.520> messy<00:01:00.969> on<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.210> side<00:01:01.390> I'm<00:01:01.629> going<00:01:01.660> to

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
already messy on this side I'm going to

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.079 
already messy on this side I'm going to
put<00:01:02.050> it<00:01:02.140> on<00:01:02.199> this<00:01:02.350> side<00:01:02.410> so<00:01:02.859> as<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.730> can<00:01:03.879> see

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
put it on this side so as you can see

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.359 
put it on this side so as you can see
here<00:01:04.360> when<00:01:04.510> I<00:01:04.570> put<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.869> drop<00:01:05.140> nothing<00:01:05.950> much

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
here when I put the drop nothing much

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.250 
here when I put the drop nothing much
happened<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:06.970> slowly<00:01:07.420> what<00:01:07.780> will<00:01:07.869> happen<00:01:08.170> is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
happened so slowly what will happen is

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.440 
happened so slowly what will happen is
that<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:08.640> food<00:01:09.640> droplets<00:01:10.090> they<00:01:10.330> will

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
that this food droplets they will

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.969 
that this food droplets they will
separate<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:10.930> they<00:01:11.200> will<00:01:11.350> diffuse<00:01:11.799> through

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
separate and they will diffuse through

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.219 
separate and they will diffuse through
the<00:01:12.100> oil<00:01:12.310> air<00:01:12.549> and<00:01:12.790> then<00:01:13.150> go<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.479> water<00:01:13.720> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
the oil air and then go to the water the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.600 
the oil air and then go to the water the
important<00:01:14.619> thing<00:01:14.650> is<00:01:14.890> they<00:01:15.070> don't<00:01:15.220> mix<00:01:15.400> with

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
important thing is they don't mix with

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.030 
important thing is they don't mix with
the<00:01:16.119> oil<00:01:16.750> oil<00:01:17.020> it's<00:01:17.259> so<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.500> diffusing

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
the oil oil it's so it's diffusing

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.590 
the oil oil it's so it's diffusing
through<00:01:18.070> but<00:01:18.549> it's<00:01:18.670> not<00:01:18.790> mixing<00:01:19.240> with<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.420> oil

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
through but it's not mixing with the oil

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.560 
through but it's not mixing with the oil
it's<00:01:19.869> not<00:01:19.930> mixing<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:20.680> slowly<00:01:21.250> let's<00:01:21.520> say<00:01:21.670> ok

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
it's not mixing so slowly let's say ok

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.620 
it's not mixing so slowly let's say ok
the<00:01:22.750> one<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:24.400> actually<00:01:24.549> even<00:01:24.909> almost<00:01:25.240> see

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
the one I can actually even almost see

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.990 
the one I can actually even almost see
the<00:01:25.659> gods<00:01:26.350> going<00:01:26.680> through<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.400> oil<00:01:27.610> now<00:01:27.909> I'm

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
the gods going through the oil now I'm

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.280 
the gods going through the oil now I'm
sorry<00:01:28.210> talk<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.479> me<00:01:28.570> why<00:01:28.720> does<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:29.049> have<00:01:29.140> is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
sorry talk to me why does it have is

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.560 
sorry talk to me why does it have is
this<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.439> chemical<00:01:30.070> just<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.549> oil<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.240> but

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
this a chemical just the oil and the but

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.870 
this a chemical just the oil and the but
I<00:01:31.600> think<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.049> more<00:01:32.350> water<00:01:32.680> based<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.640> they

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
I think this is more water based so they

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.340 
I think this is more water based so they
have<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.210> go<00:01:34.360> down<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.869> then<00:01:34.960> also<00:01:35.079> I<00:01:35.259> think

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
have to go down and then also I think

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.569 
have to go down and then also I think
the<00:01:35.530> interesting<00:01:35.770> thing<00:01:36.040> is<00:01:36.100> as<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.400> goes

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
the interesting thing is as it goes

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.880 
the interesting thing is as it goes
through<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.090> euler<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.380> should<00:01:38.590> slowly

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
through the euler it should slowly

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.800 
through the euler it should slowly
stretch<00:01:39.310> out<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.820> should<00:01:39.970> separate<00:01:40.360> so

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
stretch out and it should separate so

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.999 
stretch out and it should separate so
then<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.079> goes<00:01:41.259> through<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.560> oil<00:01:41.740> in<00:01:41.829> there

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
then it goes through the oil in there

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.350 
then it goes through the oil in there
and<00:01:42.130> then<00:01:42.220> gets<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.549> water<00:01:42.759> layer<00:01:43.030> it's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
and then gets the water layer it's

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.359 
and then gets the water layer it's
diffuse<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.110> separates<00:01:44.619> more<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.040> more<00:01:45.189> it

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
diffuse it separates more and more it

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.789 
diffuse it separates more and more it
gives<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.939> F<00:01:46.149> fireworks<00:01:46.720> feeling<00:01:47.649> so

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
gives you the F fireworks feeling so

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.319 
gives you the F fireworks feeling so
maybe<00:01:47.979> we<00:01:48.189> can<00:01:48.310> still<00:01:48.610> see<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.790> know<00:01:48.939> here<00:01:49.180> and

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
maybe we can still see you know here and

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.420 
maybe we can still see you know here and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
i have my lab coat hanger right here so

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.130 
i have my lab coat hanger right here so
it's<00:01:51.939> just<00:01:52.060> slowly<00:01:52.540> poop<00:01:53.020> poop<00:01:53.470> poop<00:01:54.149> poop<00:01:55.149> ok

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140
