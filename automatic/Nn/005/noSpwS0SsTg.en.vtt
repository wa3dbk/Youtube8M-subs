00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.480
 or the pornographic how is it so good 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.510
 I do not care about that and because 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.270
 let's start today we will talk about plagiarism 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.980
 which they are made and other companies 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.960
 you will already be tired of me 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.820
 only that they do are videos of plagiarism and 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.060
 of plagiarism but is that I have asked 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.070
 many many people would I say this 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.020
 It will be the last video of plagiarism that I will do 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.940
 here in this channel and stop 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.880
 bother with their plagiarism that is the only thing 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.890
 who like xd let's start with the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.230
 control shock that is a copy of 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.120
 super nintendo control simply 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.060
 if we put an amendment that is 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.520
 is then the analog control that pulled 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.380
 nintendo and sony plagiarized it after they're 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.690
 the plagiarism of tracks to mario bros 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.030
 the portable playstation and the game boy 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.860
 they look a lot like the playstation eye is a 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.460
 vile copy of the kinect and playstation 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.719
 move is a copy of the wi 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.340
 jajajajajajajaja but what is this shit 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.530
 element and so none of the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.600
 things that I just named are plagiarism 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.609
 well let me say that the command of 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.560
 super nintendo is equal to play 1 

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:08.930
 because in that generation they are jim 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.909
 and they're going to pull out a console together but 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.439
 Nintendo turned to zombies or 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.659
 took advantage of it and brought out a 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.539
 videoconsole as was the playstation and 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.829
 let me tell you that they have done very well 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.259
 besides nintendo did not invent the 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.899
 Analog analogs he invented them 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.850
 atari for a long time to 3 now 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.189
 tell me what cracks and mario look like 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.439
 crash is a mario dog is a human 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.810
 crush has a sister and mario has a 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.460
 brother crush they like apples and 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.679
 Mario likes silver, that is, 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.319
 coins grace betrayal to his girlfriend already 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.140
 mario peace never betrays him and if he 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.209
 we compared with super mario 64 then I should 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.310
 say that if they look like but the first 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.189
 clash delivery came out two months later 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.759
 from super Mario 64 who was going to make a 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.200
 game in such a short time good let's continue 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.909
 now let's see what the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.909
 portable playstation to the gameboy 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.939
 in nothing that the playstation eye is a 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.409
 copy of the money well the 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.240
 playstation eye went out for the 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.729
 playstation 2 while the kinect 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.440
 it came out much later and finally the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.870
 playstation move was being projected 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.610
 long ago before the playstation eye 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.650
 when they were going to take it out for 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.870
 playstation 2 discovered that it made him 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.470
 something is missing and that's why they created the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.660
 famous playstation3 ok that's it 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.459

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.700

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.700
