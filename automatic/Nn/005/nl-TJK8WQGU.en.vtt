00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
guns on every map that I play and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
guns on every map that I play and
actually<00:01:55.110> makes<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.470> lot<00:01:55.680> better<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
actually makes it a lot better and you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.200 
actually makes it a lot better and you
have<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> much<00:01:56.909> easier<00:01:57.119> time<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.899> mantle

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
have a much easier time on the mantle

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.870 
have a much easier time on the mantle
next<00:02:00.210> what<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.219> flares

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
next what we have is gonna be the flares

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.450 
next what we have is gonna be the flares
now<00:02:03.299> upgrade<00:02:03.810> flares<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.619> actually<00:02:05.070> does<00:02:05.250> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
now upgrade flares what actually does is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.479 
now upgrade flares what actually does is
that<00:02:05.670> increases<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> duration<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.170> 50%<00:02:07.979> so

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that increases the duration by 50% so

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830 
that increases the duration by 50% so
normally<00:02:09.300> flares

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
normally flares

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
normally flares
they'll<00:02:10.289> be<00:02:10.470> glowing<00:02:10.860> green<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.430> they'll

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
they'll be glowing green and they'll

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880 
they'll be glowing green and they'll
last<00:02:11.970> 20<00:02:12.390> seconds<00:02:12.780> when<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.290> an<00:02:13.379> upgrade

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
last 20 seconds when you have an upgrade

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.550 
last 20 seconds when you have an upgrade
where<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.640> will<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:14.880> glowing<00:02:15.150> pinkish<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.050> in

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
where it will be glowing pinkish and in

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.180 
where it will be glowing pinkish and in
last<00:02:16.860> 30<00:02:17.370> seconds<00:02:18.000> now<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.290> effect<00:02:19.500> also

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
last 30 seconds now this effect also

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.710 
last 30 seconds now this effect also
applies<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.459> sticky<00:02:20.910> flares<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.450> when<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
applies for sticky flares so when you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.330 
applies for sticky flares so when you
throw<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> sticky<00:02:22.440> flare<00:02:22.650> instead<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.010> lasting

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
throw a sticky flare instead of lasting

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.070 
throw a sticky flare instead of lasting
20<00:02:23.640> seconds<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.150> then<00:02:24.240> exploding<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> will<00:02:25.020> be

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
20 seconds and then exploding it will be

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.610 
20 seconds and then exploding it will be
lasting<00:02:25.470> 30<00:02:25.800> seconds<00:02:26.569> flares<00:02:27.569> are<00:02:27.810> very

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
lasting 30 seconds flares are very

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.199 
lasting 30 seconds flares are very
useful<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.520> could<00:02:29.640> help<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.940> lot<00:02:30.090> with

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
useful and it could help a lot with

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.690 
useful and it could help a lot with
score<00:02:30.570> runs<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.350> massive<00:02:32.040> scavenger<00:02:32.520> is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
score runs so massive scavenger is

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.800 
score runs so massive scavenger is
really<00:02:33.209> helpful<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.600> these<00:02:33.900> situations

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
really helpful for these situations

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.020 
really helpful for these situations
lastly<00:02:36.810> we<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> Hitman<00:02:37.740> right<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.430> then

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
lastly we have the Hitman right so then

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.210 
lastly we have the Hitman right so then
hypno<00:02:39.450> knife<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:40.110> doesn't<00:02:40.620> make<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.010> aliens

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
hypno knife it doesn't make the aliens

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.090 
hypno knife it doesn't make the aliens
actually<00:02:41.880> last<00:02:42.120> longer<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.290> assume<00:02:43.739> that

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
actually last longer so we assume that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.790 
actually last longer so we assume that
it<00:02:44.970> actually<00:02:45.600> makes<00:02:45.810> them<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.230> more<00:02:46.500> health

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
it actually makes them have more health

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.420 
it actually makes them have more health
and<00:02:47.040> deal<00:02:47.850> more<00:02:48.120> damage<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.680> actually

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and deal more damage so this actually

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.350 
and deal more damage so this actually
really<00:02:51.120> helps<00:02:51.390> out<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> lot<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:53.030> observed<00:02:54.030> from

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
really helps out a lot I observed from

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
really helps out a lot I observed from
personal<00:02:55.050> experience<00:02:55.680> Hiep<00:02:56.130> knowing<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.640> bunch

actually killing enemies for me while on
the<00:03:08.760> other<00:03:08.910> maps<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.360> now<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.540> could<00:03:09.840> actually

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
the other maps but now I could actually

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.640 
the other maps but now I could actually
see<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.610> also<00:03:11.610> they<00:03:12.330> aren't<00:03:12.870> dying<00:03:13.230> out<00:03:13.440> as

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
see it also they aren't dying out as

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.910 
see it also they aren't dying out as
quickly<00:03:14.010> as<00:03:14.220> they<00:03:14.430> used<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:15.200> they<00:03:16.200> would<00:03:16.620> last

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
quickly as they used to they would last

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.590 
quickly as they used to they would last
a<00:03:17.160> longer<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.610> fight<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.940> they<00:03:18.030> last<00:03:18.390> their

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
a longer the fight and they last their

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.199 
a longer the fight and they last their
full<00:03:18.810> 3<00:03:19.110> minutes<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.590> fighting<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.640> they

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
full 3 minutes of fighting so they

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.530 
full 3 minutes of fighting so they
actually<00:03:21.959> come<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.680> use<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.519> speak<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.420> this
