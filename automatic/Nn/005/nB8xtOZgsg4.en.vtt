00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
yeah there were it depends on how you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.590 
yeah there were it depends on how you
sort<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.580> handle<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:44.360> there<00:01:44.479> were

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
sort of handle it there were

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.180 
sort of handle it there were
possibilities<00:01:45.020> of<00:01:45.260> more<00:01:45.620> than<00:01:45.650> one<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.160> I

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
possibilities of more than one but I

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.160 
possibilities of more than one but I
don't<00:01:46.370> think<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.670> had<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.630> fight<00:01:47.840> more<00:01:48.140> than
