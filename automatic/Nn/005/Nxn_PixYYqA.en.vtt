00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and figure out where the next note

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.020 
and figure out where the next note
should<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.640> how<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> develop

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
should go and see that's how you develop

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.020 
should go and see that's how you develop
that<00:00:51.360> year<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.020> instance<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.590> was<00:00:52.710> going

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
that year so for instance if I was going

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
that year so for instance if I was going
let's<00:00:54.030> say<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.420> gonna<00:00:54.510> do

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.920 

you<00:01:03.160> see<00:01:03.340> so<00:01:03.880> you<00:01:03.910> take<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.360> idea<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.870> you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
you see so you take that idea and you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.390 
you see so you take that idea and you
figure<00:01:05.199> out<00:01:05.230> okay<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.340> then<00:01:09.400> oh<00:01:11.400> that's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
figure out okay and then oh that's

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.500 
figure out okay and then oh that's
terrible<00:01:12.610> no<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:12.970> don't<00:01:13.150> want<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.330> do<00:01:13.390> that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
terrible no I don't want to do that

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:23.100 
terrible no I don't want to do that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
one's not right either right then you

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.370 
one's not right either right then you
come<00:01:25.930> around<00:01:26.050> oh<00:01:27.780> okay<00:01:28.780> well<00:01:28.930> there<00:01:29.050> it<00:01:29.110> is

come around oh okay well there it is
and<00:01:29.470> you<00:01:29.770> keep<00:01:29.979> developing<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.180> your

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
and you keep developing that so your

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.660 
and you keep developing that so your
your<00:01:31.780> your<00:01:32.260> inner<00:01:32.500> ear<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:32.920> getting<00:01:33.220> used<00:01:33.430> to

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
your your inner ear is getting used to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.540 
your your inner ear is getting used to
where<00:01:33.970> things<00:01:34.300> are<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.720> terms<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.380> pitch<00:01:35.649> but

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
where things are in terms of pitch but

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.950 
where things are in terms of pitch but
you're<00:01:36.759> also<00:01:36.940> getting<00:01:37.180> used<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.600> where<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.869> is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
you're also getting used to where it is

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.690 
you're also getting used to where it is
on<00:01:37.990> your<00:01:38.200> fret<00:01:38.410> board<00:01:38.680> okay<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.310> you're<00:01:39.580> really

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
on your fret board okay so you're really

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.190 
on your fret board okay so you're really
getting<00:01:39.880> two<00:01:40.149> things<00:01:40.360> for<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.660> price<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:41.050> one

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
getting two things for the price of one

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.740 
getting two things for the price of one
by<00:01:41.380> doing<00:01:41.680> those<00:01:41.800> exercises<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:43.330> same<00:01:43.570> thing

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
by doing those exercises the same thing

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.350 
by doing those exercises the same thing
is<00:01:43.840> gonna<00:01:43.899> happen<00:01:44.200> as<00:01:44.500> we<00:01:44.680> move<00:01:45.160> into<00:01:45.520> chords

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
is gonna happen as we move into chords

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.359 
is gonna happen as we move into chords
but<00:01:46.990> please<00:01:47.229> remember<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.680> there<00:01:47.979> are<00:01:48.100> times

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
but please remember that there are times

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.290 
but please remember that there are times
when<00:01:48.580> you're<00:01:48.700> going<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.850> want<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.119> create

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
when you're going to want to create

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.969 
when you're going to want to create
melodies<00:01:49.690> on<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.140> guitar<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.440> aren't

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
melodies on the guitar that aren't

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.100 
melodies on the guitar that aren't
necessarily<00:01:51.460> just<00:01:51.610> chords<00:01:52.360> but<00:01:52.930> you're

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
necessarily just chords but you're

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.690 
necessarily just chords but you're
trying<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.440> find<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> melody<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.310> hear<00:01:54.670> a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
trying to find the melody so you hear a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.310 
trying to find the melody so you hear a
song<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.240> you're<00:01:55.780> trying<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.050> figure<00:01:56.200> out

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
song and you're trying to figure out

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.200 
song and you're trying to figure out
where<00:01:56.530> those<00:01:56.710> notes<00:01:56.950> are<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.160> your<00:01:57.340> guitar<00:01:57.640> so

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
where those notes are in your guitar so

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.170 
where those notes are in your guitar so
you<00:01:58.300> start<00:01:58.539> using<00:01:58.750> visual<00:01:59.470> logic<00:01:59.740> if<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:01.000> move

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
you start using visual logic if I move

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.469 
you start using visual logic if I move
this<00:02:01.479> way<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.410> pitch<00:02:02.619> goes<00:02:02.860> up<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:04.300> move

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
this way the pitch goes up if I move

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.969 
this way the pitch goes up if I move
that<00:02:04.659> way<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.110> pitch<00:02:05.260> goes<00:02:05.500> down<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:05.920> know

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
that way the pitch goes down and I know

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.320 
that way the pitch goes down and I know
that<00:02:06.190> seems<00:02:06.430> obvious<00:02:06.580> but<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.970> just<00:02:07.090> need<00:02:07.240> to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
that seems obvious but you just need to

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.870 
that seems obvious but you just need to
think<00:02:07.510> about<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.869> if<00:02:08.049> I<00:02:08.470> move<00:02:08.679> this<00:02:09.010> way<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
think about that if I move this way the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.720 
think about that if I move this way the
pitch<00:02:10.090> goes<00:02:10.360> down<00:02:10.630> if<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.560> move<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.010> way<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
pitch goes down if I move that way the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.900 
pitch goes down if I move that way the
pitch<00:02:12.940> goes<00:02:13.209> up<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.230> I'm<00:02:14.440> on

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
pitch goes up so if I'm on

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.610 
pitch goes up so if I'm on
I<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.030> think<00:02:22.210> well<00:02:22.480> where<00:02:23.050> is<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.380> pitch

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
I have to think well where is that pitch

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.110 
I have to think well where is that pitch
does<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.920> go<00:02:24.010> higher<00:02:24.310> or<00:02:24.340> does<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.730> go<00:02:24.880> lower

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
does it go higher or does it go lower

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.450 
does it go higher or does it go lower
and<00:02:25.450> then<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.500> think<00:02:26.710> how<00:02:26.860> much<00:02:27.100> higher

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
and then I have to think how much higher

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.890 
and then I have to think how much higher
does<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:27.940> go<00:02:28.090> than<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.390> other<00:02:28.540> pictures<00:02:28.870> that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
does it go than the other pictures that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990 
does it go than the other pictures that
I've<00:02:29.110> already<00:02:29.380> played<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.460> it<00:02:30.580> does<00:02:30.760> take<00:02:30.970> a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
I've already played so it does take a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.060 
I've already played so it does take a
little<00:02:31.210> bit<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.480> practice<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.770> you'd<00:02:32.950> be

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
little bit of practice but you'd be

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.050 
little bit of practice but you'd be
surprised<00:02:33.430> at<00:02:33.580> how<00:02:33.610> much<00:02:33.850> you're<00:02:33.970> gonna

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
surprised at how much you're gonna

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.120 
surprised at how much you're gonna
develop<00:02:34.420> your<00:02:34.690> ear<00:02:34.900> by<00:02:35.110> doing<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:35.470> simple

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
develop your ear by doing just simple

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.760 
develop your ear by doing just simple
little<00:02:36.280> exercises<00:02:37.030> like<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.390> with<00:02:37.930> any<00:02:38.290> song

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
little exercises like that with any song

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.570 
little exercises like that with any song
doesn't<00:02:39.220> matter<00:02:39.430> what<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.530> know<00:02:41.650> my

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
doesn't matter what it is you know my

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.130 
doesn't matter what it is you know my
kids<00:02:42.850> love<00:02:43.060> spongebob<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.810> could<00:02:43.960> use

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
kids love spongebob so you could use

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.210 
kids love spongebob so you could use
something<00:02:44.410> like<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:44.920> could<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.100> all

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
something like that it could be all

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.980 
something like that it could be all
kinds<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.550> different<00:02:45.820> things<00:02:45.850> but<00:02:46.600> using

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
kinds of different things but using

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.050 
kinds of different things but using
single<00:02:47.350> notes<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:48.040> develop<00:02:48.460> those<00:02:48.640> melodies

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
single notes to develop those melodies

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.090 
single notes to develop those melodies
and<00:02:49.270> fill<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.080> blanks<00:02:50.440> once<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:50.980> get
