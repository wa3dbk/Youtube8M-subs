face like ears or horn or anything that
you<00:03:29.260> want<00:03:29.440> extending<00:03:29.980> away<00:03:30.220> from<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.610> head

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
you want extending away from the head

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.020 
you want extending away from the head
it's<00:03:31.569> important<00:03:32.079> for<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.190> structurally<00:03:33.819> work

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
it's important for to structurally work

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.380 
it's important for to structurally work
that<00:03:34.629> you<00:03:34.750> make<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.190> pretty<00:03:36.190> thick<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:37.060> start

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
that you make it pretty thick to start

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.119 
that you make it pretty thick to start
where<00:03:37.569> it<00:03:37.599> attaches<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.470> then<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:38.739> can<00:03:38.859> taper

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
where it attaches and then it can taper

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.740 
where it attaches and then it can taper
to<00:03:39.430> being<00:03:39.640> thinner<00:03:39.940> as<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.180> goes<00:03:40.390> away<00:03:40.540> from

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
to being thinner as it goes away from

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.050 
to being thinner as it goes away from
the<00:03:40.930> head<00:03:41.200> for<00:03:41.980> instance<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:42.670> you're<00:03:42.849> going<00:03:42.910> to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
the head for instance if you're going to

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.089 
the head for instance if you're going to
make<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.239> horn<00:03:44.370> instead<00:03:45.370> of<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.810> trying<00:03:46.810> to

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
make a horn instead of just trying to

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.949 
make a horn instead of just trying to
attach<00:03:48.099> something<00:03:48.760> that's<00:03:49.030> very<00:03:49.239> thin<00:03:49.659> and

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
attach something that's very thin and

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.839 
attach something that's very thin and
flimsy<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:53.260> probably<00:03:53.769> won't<00:03:53.980> last<00:03:54.340> it'll

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
flimsy that probably won't last it'll

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.539 
flimsy that probably won't last it'll
break<00:03:55.120> as<00:03:55.359> it's<00:03:55.540> drying<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.159> better<00:03:57.370> idea

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
break as it's drying it's a better idea

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.680 
break as it's drying it's a better idea
to<00:03:59.099> get<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.159> chunk<00:04:00.609> of<00:04:00.790> clay<00:04:00.940> get<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.450> kind<00:04:01.569> of

to get a chunk of clay get it kind of

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.110 
to get a chunk of clay get it kind of
moist<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:04.140> roll<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.500> into<00:04:05.739> more<00:04:06.579> of<00:04:06.639> a<00:04:06.760> cone

moist and roll it into more of a cone

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.210 
moist and roll it into more of a cone
shape

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.130 

that<00:04:12.220> way<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:12.579> have<00:04:12.610> a<00:04:12.700> nice<00:04:12.909> thick<00:04:13.150> base<00:04:13.720> here

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
that way we have a nice thick base here

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.360 
that way we have a nice thick base here
that<00:04:15.419> we<00:04:16.419> can<00:04:17.970> attach<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.419> head<00:04:19.829> always<00:04:20.829> if

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
that we can attach to the head always if

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.980 
that we can attach to the head always if
you're<00:04:21.519> making<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:21.820> tongue<00:04:22.060> or<00:04:22.360> horn<00:04:22.750> or

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
you're making a tongue or horn or

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.029 
you're making a tongue or horn or
anything<00:04:23.199> like<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.740> can<00:04:23.889> have<00:04:24.009> a

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
anything like that you can have a

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.689 
anything like that you can have a
moisture<00:04:24.639> and<00:04:24.850> just<00:04:25.570> pull<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.440> shape<00:04:28.169> and

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
moisture and just pull the shape and

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.920 
moisture and just pull the shape and
then<00:04:30.699> since<00:04:30.940> I'm<00:04:31.120> attaching<00:04:31.600> this<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.780> a

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
then since I'm attaching this to a

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.390 
then since I'm attaching this to a
curved<00:04:32.259> surface<00:04:33.870> I'd<00:04:34.870> want<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.169> curve<00:04:35.530> my<00:04:35.800> cut

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.300 

so<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.699> attaches<00:04:40.060> on<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.770> head<00:04:41.949> a<00:04:41.979> little

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
so that it attaches on the head a little

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.140 
so that it attaches on the head a little
better<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:46.660> was<00:04:46.810> going<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:46.990> make<00:04:47.199> an<00:04:47.350> ear<00:04:48.150> or

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
better if I was going to make an ear or

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.779 
better if I was going to make an ear or
any<00:04:49.870> other<00:04:50.169> part<00:04:50.500> extending<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.220> want<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.699> use

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
any other part extending I want to use

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.520 
any other part extending I want to use
the<00:04:51.910> same<00:04:52.120> principle<00:04:52.690> in<00:04:52.750> keeping<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.229> really

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
the same principle in keeping it really

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.740 
the same principle in keeping it really
thicker<00:04:54.070> at<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.400> base<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.000> then<00:04:55.539> getting

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
thicker at the base and then getting

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.740 
thicker at the base and then getting
thinner<00:04:56.080> ears<00:04:56.800> can<00:04:57.100> be<00:04:57.220> made<00:04:57.370> out<00:04:57.400> of<00:04:57.669> slabs<00:04:58.210> or

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
thinner ears can be made out of slabs or

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.689 
thinner ears can be made out of slabs or
they<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.830> be<00:04:59.949> kind<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.280> sculpted<00:05:01.030> my<00:05:01.750> hand

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
they can be kind of sculpted my hand

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.270 
they can be kind of sculpted my hand
just<00:05:03.699> try<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.060> keep<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.479> nice<00:05:04.720> thick<00:05:05.650> base<00:05:05.919> about

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
just try to keep a nice thick base about

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.790 
just try to keep a nice thick base about
quarter-inch<00:05:06.880> or<00:05:07.060> so<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:07.650> then<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.680> can

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
quarter-inch or so and then you can

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.900 
quarter-inch or so and then you can
always<00:05:09.070> get<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.460> thin<00:05:09.759> at<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:11.199> edge<00:05:11.639> as<00:05:12.639> long

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
always get it thin at the edge as long

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.610 
always get it thin at the edge as long
as<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.210> body<00:05:13.509> of<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:13.870> remains<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.410> little

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
as the body of it remains a little

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.750 
as the body of it remains a little
thicker<00:05:14.889> that<00:05:15.580> will<00:05:15.760> help<00:05:16.000> ensure<00:05:16.389> that<00:05:16.590> it

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
thicker that will help ensure that it

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.060 
thicker that will help ensure that it
will<00:05:18.760> go<00:05:18.910> on<00:05:19.120> without<00:05:19.300> breaking<00:05:20.070> also

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
will go on without breaking also

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.950 
will go on without breaking also
whenever<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.520> attach<00:05:21.789> these<00:05:22.150> extra<00:05:22.539> features

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
make sure to slip and score them at this

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.010 
make sure to slip and score them at this
