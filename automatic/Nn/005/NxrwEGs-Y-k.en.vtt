00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.680 
behind why splatoon does not have voice
chat<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.430> could<00:00:32.640> always<00:00:32.820> guess<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
assume the reason but this the reason

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.450 
assume the reason but this the reason
was<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.660> given<00:00:37.079> until<00:00:37.230> last<00:00:38.160> week

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
