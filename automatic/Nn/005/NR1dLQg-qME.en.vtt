again

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
again
a<00:02:05.549> lot<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> specifics<00:02:07.110> are<00:02:07.259> classified

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
a lot of the specifics are classified

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.979 
but I think it's pretty safe to say I
