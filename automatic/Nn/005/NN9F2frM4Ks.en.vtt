 as the whole year has changed 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.599
 installation technology 1 to the heights so 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.509
 more serious 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.009
 but for now he didn’t need a strike 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.699
 rearrange the Donbass Cup 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.909

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.440
 century 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.900
 then 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.840
 days left eight hours respectively 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200

 the collection will have to be transferred as 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.609
 Someday the trend will be earned to us 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.570
 happiness so 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.730
 should i install windows i need to stop 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.409
 indust 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.109
 what to do how have changed 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.030
 technology especially if we have 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.530
 no I did not see how to stop we do not have 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.770
 will it be like that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.960
 The main idea in this matter is just 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.120
 that he 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.100
 we are just looking for an article on the microsoft site 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.640
 which is called it puts the car wand 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 notebook 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.920
 placement area of ​​work involves 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.770
 part from samsung dividends 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 accordingly on this plane 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.119
 nyandoma family itself dividend but this 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.340
 paragraph 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 which offers fashionistas to create 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.150
 it must inevitable mistakes that were 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
 dozens of hickeys in the Altai who fought 1 to 7 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.630
 so 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.080
 we go 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.090
 on beating gives birth 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.470
 note the system offers in 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.530
 frameworks and kickbacks and kickbacks most important 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.860
 so easy to load offside 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 relevant utility 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.050
 alas in our body and such heights he 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.860
 here we need to choose actually 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.649
 saying pehees 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.869
 given in the present set 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.749
 I do this and private year 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.449
 since actually residents 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:20.039
 village deflated set 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.039
 the sequence is extremely simple 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.289
 I know how to install residents download 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.349
 run and prisons installation services 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.629
 file install utility select 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.479
 actually if yes to specify it 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.930
 information about where you need to just 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.219
 and the system will be the button 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.869
 and kustanay created booties 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:39.460
 spikelets 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.180
 we will get very fast 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.609
 and then our utility 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.359
 Hurricane 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.789
 ask for administrative 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.139
 right as always 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.319
 our first action 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.319
 point edge 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.869
 I know where I live here 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.159
 this stalk lives 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.379
 on disk 5 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.439
 on this disc I tested the conditions and in 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.269
 This directory contains windows themes 64. 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.379
 bit act 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.309
 it's because we need an alliance like that 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.299
 time everything is as it should be 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.949
 according to 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.149
 the next step is x 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:22.979
 And note Andreas himself 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.159
 saying they avoid 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.769
 expected to use 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.779
 own that's why it is a fight 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.759
 last thing you need to make her secret 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.039
 to tell 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.369
 copy now being created 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:39.739
 boot avoid at the same time we can 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.319
 look at the time times which is it 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.649
 will be executed 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.649
 once a year we went in format na 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.659
 So 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.259
 know camp know camp know camp 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:55.709
 but approximately 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.709
 15 seconds have passed 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.769
 Emergency Commander occupation 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.959
 ungrateful 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.959
 and more 4 3 0 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.789
 process is in progress 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.229
 Method if there is a new mode 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.809
 part leaders 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.809
 two minutes 10 seconds 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.840
 six percent by copying 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.740
 the other day the tenth minute for example on 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:51.749
 9 34 03 cyclone first trial on row 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.569
 normative copying time 95 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.590
 percent 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.180
 justify 90 percent now 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.199
 wait and see I think a minute 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.159
 canada will provide in order to 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.159
 to copy 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.150
 so in the sixteenth minute 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.150
 I don't even know about the seventeenth minute 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.710
 99 percent and 100 percent 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.000
 ready copying everything can proceed 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:25.360
 created by 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.360
 to work 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.479
 and to make sure that we have everything 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.320
 ok so as we like we look at 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.430
 we are under pressure on our domain we see 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.430
 typical gomik bendas all 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.949
 typical directory contents u if 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.469
 see what is the value but here we are 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.110
 probably found chagin time and 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.130
 will make-up 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.780
 goal installation with glorious meat so 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.289
 simply and easily 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.389
 creators boot 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.100
 action rules the edges 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.170
 install windows on a laptop or what 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.310
 or other devices apple store use 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.439
 utility 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:07.129
 thank
