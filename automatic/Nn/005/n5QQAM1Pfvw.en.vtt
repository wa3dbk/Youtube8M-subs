let me have weak to God so this week we
covered<00:00:12.619> two<00:00:12.829> more<00:00:13.039> essential<00:00:13.940> jazz<00:00:14.179> moves

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
covered two more essential jazz moves

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:26.019 
covered two more essential jazz moves
starting<00:00:15.319> with<00:00:15.469> show<00:00:24.039> that<00:00:25.039> decides<00:00:25.699> that

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
starting with show that decides that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.060 
starting with show that decides that
we're<00:00:26.210> swinging<00:00:27.050> like<00:00:27.289> a<00:00:27.320> pendulum<00:00:27.769> and

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
we're swinging like a pendulum and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.929 
we're swinging like a pendulum and
thinking<00:00:28.429> about<00:00:28.640> our<00:00:28.759> history<00:00:30.669> we<00:00:31.669> could<00:00:31.759> also

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
thinking about our history we could also

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:42.729 
thinking about our history we could also
do<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:32.329> with<00:00:32.419> twist<00:00:32.780> twist<00:00:41.230> twist<00:00:42.230> eight<00:00:42.530> three

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
do it with twist twist twist eight three

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.560 
do it with twist twist twist eight three
over<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.399> can<00:00:43.579> see<00:00:43.730> your<00:00:43.850> back<00:00:44.090> pocket

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
over so you can see your back pocket

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.310 
over so you can see your back pocket
just<00:00:45.230> like<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.600> so<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:47.690> have<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.840> couple<00:00:48.079> of

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
just like so so we have a couple of

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.959 
just like so so we have a couple of
different<00:00:48.649> places<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:49.010> add<00:00:49.309> that<00:00:49.519> into<00:00:49.760> our

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
different places to add that into our

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.810 
different places to add that into our
living<00:00:50.210> up<00:00:50.420> thank<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:51.440> one<00:00:52.250> place<00:00:52.460> was<00:00:52.670> in

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
living up thank you so one place was in

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.880 
living up thank you so one place was in
double<00:00:53.030> handles<00:00:53.539> here<00:00:54.109> we<00:00:54.320> can<00:00:54.469> do<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.649> shops

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
double handles here we can do the shops

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.130 
double handles here we can do the shops
so<00:00:55.250> we<00:00:55.370> did<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.519> swing<00:00:55.820> up<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.179> get<00:00:56.629> these<00:00:56.780> double

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
so we did a swing up to get these double

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.919 
so we did a swing up to get these double
handle<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.739> we<00:00:58.129> went<00:00:58.370> back<00:00:58.609> on<00:00:59.030> chest<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.839> the

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
handle and we went back on chest on the

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:12.490 
handle and we went back on chest on the
rocks

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.080 

and<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.890> leave<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> rough<00:01:14.370> step<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.880> any

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and so you can leave a rough step on any

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.020 
and so you can leave a rough step on any
of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> bat<00:01:16.040> motions<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.250> shots<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.910> get

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
of the bat motions of the shots to get

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.230 
of the bat motions of the shots to get
back<00:01:18.180> into<00:01:18.330> things<00:01:19.100> we<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.250> did<00:01:20.910> they<00:01:21.000> commit

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
back into things we also did they commit

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
back into things we also did they commit
the<00:01:21.480> in<00:01:21.600> place<00:01:21.870> but<00:01:22.230> with<00:01:22.410> twists<00:01:22.980> so<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the in place but with twists so in this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
the in place but with twists so in this
case<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> leader<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> actually<00:01:25.260> twisting

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
case the leader is actually twisting

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.350 
case the leader is actually twisting
through<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> vector<00:01:26.430> body<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
through the vector body so that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:40.820 
through the vector body so that
transfers<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> power

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.020 

so<00:01:41.830> you<00:01:41.920> get<00:01:42.100> turned<00:01:42.280> right<00:01:42.520> out<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.700> one<00:01:42.940> of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
so you get turned right out of one of

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.360 
so you get turned right out of one of
those<00:01:43.150> quits<00:01:43.420> or<00:01:44.050> go<00:01:44.230> into<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.560> rock<00:01:44.710> step<00:01:45.010> on

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
those quits or go into the rock step on

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.770 
those quits or go into the rock step on
the<00:01:46.000> backswing<00:01:46.810> just<00:01:47.080> as<00:01:47.170> we<00:01:47.320> get<00:01:47.470> on<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:02.340 

backside<00:01:52.780> we're<00:01:53.680> doing<00:01:53.860> some<00:01:54.010> Charleston<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
backside we're doing some Charleston and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.440 
backside we're doing some Charleston and
then<00:02:02.790> again<00:02:03.790> we<00:02:03.970> can<00:02:04.150> rock<00:02:04.300> step<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:07.240> just

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
then again we can rock step you just

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:17.880 
then again we can rock step you just
make<00:02:07.600> sure<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.150> she<00:02:16.209> feels<00:02:16.590> exactly<00:02:17.590> where

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
make sure you so she feels exactly where

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.500 
make sure you so she feels exactly where
my<00:02:17.920> body's<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.459> fishing<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:22.209> those<00:02:22.360> are<00:02:22.480> our

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
my body's going fishing so those are our

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.710 
my body's going fishing so those are our
three<00:02:22.600> shadows<00:02:23.459> second<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.940> practice<00:02:31.150> both

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
three shadows second so we practice both

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.500 
three shadows second so we practice both
sides<00:02:32.080> switching<00:02:33.010> by<00:02:33.130> bringing<00:02:33.430> our<00:02:34.090> cords

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
sides switching by bringing our cords

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.510 
sides switching by bringing our cords
with<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.680> switching<00:02:36.010> side<00:02:36.190> solution

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
with that and switching side solution

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.390 
with that and switching side solution
that<00:02:36.820> could<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.090> five<00:02:37.600> six<00:02:38.110> seven<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:38.950> one<00:02:39.160> two

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
that could be five six seven and one two

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:53.190 
that could be five six seven and one two
three<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.390> we're<00:02:52.540> just<00:02:52.570> shifting<00:02:52.840> our<00:02:53.170> weight

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
three so we're just shifting our weight

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.670 
three so we're just shifting our weight
forward<00:02:53.560> onto<00:02:54.400> our<00:02:54.910> bent<00:02:55.230> front<00:02:56.230> leg<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.590> then

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
forward onto our bent front leg and then

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.310 
forward onto our bent front leg and then
backwards<00:02:57.310> toward<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.150> back<00:02:58.510> leg<00:02:58.780> switching

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
backwards toward that back leg switching

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.500 
backwards toward that back leg switching
which<00:02:59.470> for<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.739> step<00:02:59.950> which<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.970> an<00:03:01.150> industry

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
which for the step which is an industry

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:14.089 
which for the step which is an industry
throwing<00:03:02.500> our<00:03:02.620> arms

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.300 

style<00:03:14.340> how<00:03:14.519> much<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.150> want<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.359> put<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:16.310> and

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
style how much do you want to put it and

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.679 
style how much do you want to put it and
we<00:03:17.370> did<00:03:17.579> these<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.849> three<00:03:17.999> positions<00:03:18.420> as<00:03:18.540> well

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
we did these on three positions as well

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:32.379 
we did these on three positions as well
starting<00:03:19.579> position<00:03:20.579> look<00:03:21.180> like<00:03:21.359> this<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.620> we

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
starting position look like this so we

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.209 
starting position look like this so we
leaders<00:03:33.389> were<00:03:33.629> sure<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.200> send<00:03:34.829> our<00:03:35.010> weight

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:35.219 
leaders were sure to send our weight

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.550 
leaders were sure to send our weight
forward<00:03:35.250> onto<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.930> into<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.319> first

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
forward onto the into that first

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.890 
forward onto the into that first
Halloween<00:03:37.950> for<00:03:38.310> them<00:03:38.430> she<00:03:38.909> really<00:03:39.239> feels<00:03:39.719> that

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
Halloween for them she really feels that

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.629 
Halloween for them she really feels that
something's<00:03:40.560> different<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:41.040> feel<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.459> way

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
something's different you feel that way

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.610 
something's different you feel that way
and<00:03:41.819> then<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:42.540> get<00:03:42.659> out<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.019> we<00:03:43.290> shook<00:03:43.439> their

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and then to get out of it we shook their

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:53.589 
and then to get out of it we shook their
way<00:03:43.709> back<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.849> wasn't<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.239> great<00:03:52.340> so

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
way back to that wasn't that great so

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.970 
way back to that wasn't that great so
that<00:03:54.599> was<00:03:54.689> in<00:03:54.780> closed<00:03:55.019> position<00:03:55.169> we<00:03:55.530> also<00:03:55.680> did

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
that was in closed position we also did

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.479 
that was in closed position we also did
open<00:03:56.639> position<00:03:57.409> with<00:03:58.409> a<00:03:58.439> little<00:03:58.769> more<00:03:58.949> a

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
open position with a little more a

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:15.520 
open position with a little more a
little<00:04:00.269> more<00:04:00.540> style<00:04:00.959> started

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.719 

so<00:04:16.530> there<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:16.859> started<00:04:17.190> an<00:04:17.340> airplane

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
so there we started an airplane

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.120 
so there we started an airplane
Charleston<00:04:18.239> went<00:04:18.840> into<00:04:19.079> our<00:04:19.169> Halloween<00:04:19.620> or<00:04:19.739> an

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
Charleston went into our Halloween or an

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.879 
Charleston went into our Halloween or an
open<00:04:20.459> position<00:04:20.579> here<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.359> then<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:22.229> let<00:04:22.680> out<00:04:22.860> of

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
open position here and then I let out of

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.890 
open position here and then I let out of
it<00:04:23.100> by<00:04:23.310> punching<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.759> hamstring<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:24.810> we

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
it by punching the hamstring so that we

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.560 
it by punching the hamstring so that we
both<00:04:25.080> spin<00:04:25.610> ending<00:04:26.610> up<00:04:26.729> kicking<00:04:27.030> through<00:04:27.389> with

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
both spin ending up kicking through with

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:45.920 
both spin ending up kicking through with
the<00:04:27.690> inside<00:04:28.020> foot<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.419> tricky<00:04:45.720> part
