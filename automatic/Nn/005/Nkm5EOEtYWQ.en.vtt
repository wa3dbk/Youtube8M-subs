e4 is considered you know by many as

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.029 
e4 is considered you know by many as
like<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.510> best<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> smooth<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.890> can

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
like the best for a smooth that you can

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.270 
like the best for a smooth that you can
do<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> move<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.650> by<00:01:07.650> contrast

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
do so now you move on and by contrast

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
do so now you move on and by contrast
you<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:09.930> control<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you don't really take control of the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.870 
you don't really take control of the
center<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
center if you think of this as a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.630 
center if you think of this as a
battlefield<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> battlefield

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
battlefield so we have a battlefield

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
battlefield so we have a battlefield
with<00:01:14.930> three<00:01:15.930> different<00:01:16.110> types<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> soldiers

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.790 
attacking this space which you already
controlled<00:02:09.060> last<00:02:09.300> before<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.170> moved<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
controlled last before you moved and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.350 
controlled last before you moved and
this<00:02:11.129> space<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> already<00:02:12.000> controlled

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
this space would you already controlled

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.210 
this space would you already controlled
before<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.810> move

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
before you move

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.740 
before you move
didn't<00:02:13.400> really<00:02:13.550> gain<00:02:13.820> any<00:02:14.060> ground<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.660> you

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
didn't really gain any ground so you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.470 
didn't really gain any ground so you
just<00:02:14.900> basically<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.860> know<00:02:16.030> made<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> move<00:02:17.330> in

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
just basically you know made a move in

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.620 
just basically you know made a move in
it<00:02:17.630> didn't<00:02:18.290> accomplish<00:02:18.500> much<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> now<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> bring

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
it didn't accomplish much so now I bring

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.290 
it didn't accomplish much so now I bring
this<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:21.050> bring<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:22.280> out<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.550> control<00:02:22.970> all

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
this I bring this out to control all

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.940 
this I bring this out to control all
four<00:02:23.570> of<00:02:23.600> these<00:02:23.780> pieces<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.440> center<00:02:24.800> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
four of these pieces in the center and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.540 
four of these pieces in the center and
to<00:02:25.730> give<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.570> bishop<00:02:27.230> now<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.710> whole<00:02:27.980> avenue

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
to give this bishop now a whole avenue

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.340 
to give this bishop now a whole avenue
for<00:02:29.120> itself<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.810> attack<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.510> now<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:33.170> move

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
for itself to attack so now you move

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.610 
for itself to attack so now you move
this<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:34.040> move<00:02:34.220> your<00:02:34.430> king<00:02:35.000> your<00:02:35.720> night<00:02:36.380> out

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
this you move your king your night out

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.530 
this you move your king your night out
which<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.130> good<00:02:37.310> move<00:02:37.580> because<00:02:37.790> when<00:02:38.420> you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
which is a good move because when you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.560 
which is a good move because when you
attack<00:02:38.930> me<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.550> by<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.850> not<00:02:41.120> only<00:02:41.240> did<00:02:41.480> you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
attack me and by and not only did you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.870 
attack me and by and not only did you
bring<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.840> new<00:02:41.990> piece<00:02:42.260> out<00:02:42.470> into<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.040> new

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
bring a new piece out into the new

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.449 
bring a new piece out into the new
soldier<00:02:44.300> out<00:02:44.420> into<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.900> field<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.950> you're

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
soldier out into the field but you're

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.090 
soldier out into the field but you're
attacking<00:02:47.060> my<00:02:47.570> pawn<00:02:47.840> which<00:02:48.140> forces<00:02:48.800> me<00:02:48.920> to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
attacking my pawn which forces me to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.340 
attacking my pawn which forces me to
respond<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.300> hinders<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.200> know

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
respond to that and hinders you know

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.730 
respond to that and hinders you know
whatever<00:02:51.680> plan<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.010> may<00:02:52.340> have<00:02:52.459> had<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:55.459> now<00:02:55.610> I

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
whatever plan I may have had so now I

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.710 
whatever plan I may have had so now I
respond<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.950> could<00:02:58.160> have<00:02:58.280> respond<00:02:58.700> by<00:02:59.090> moving

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
respond I could have respond by moving

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.350 
respond I could have respond by moving
my<00:02:59.870> King's<00:03:00.590> Bishop<00:03:00.920> pawn<00:03:01.370> forward<00:03:01.880> but<00:03:02.150> if<00:03:02.270> I

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
my King's Bishop pawn forward but if I

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.590 
my King's Bishop pawn forward but if I
had<00:03:02.510> done<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.200> would<00:03:03.770> be<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:05.000> wasting<00:03:05.510> a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
had done that I would be just wasting a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.960 
had done that I would be just wasting a
turn<00:03:05.840> because<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.830> wouldn't<00:03:07.190> be<00:03:07.310> developing<00:03:07.880> a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
turn because I wouldn't be developing a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.550 
turn because I wouldn't be developing a
piece<00:03:08.270> no<00:03:08.630> new<00:03:08.810> soldiers<00:03:09.200> would<00:03:09.320> be<00:03:09.380> brought

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
piece no new soldiers would be brought

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.530 
piece no new soldiers would be brought
out<00:03:09.620> into<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.950> battlefield<00:03:10.520> and<00:03:10.790> I'd<00:03:11.360> be

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
out into the battlefield and I'd be

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.890 
out into the battlefield and I'd be
weakening<00:03:12.050> my<00:03:12.730> my<00:03:13.730> potential<00:03:14.300> kingside

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
weakening my my potential kingside

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.330 
weakening my my potential kingside
castle<00:03:15.440> which<00:03:15.620> I'm<00:03:15.800> really<00:03:16.040> looking<00:03:16.310> forward

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
castle which I'm really looking forward

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.070 
castle which I'm really looking forward
to<00:03:16.700> doing<00:03:16.850> because<00:03:17.120> that's<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.480> best<00:03:17.660> way<00:03:18.019> to

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
to doing because that's the best way to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.110 
to doing because that's the best way to
protect<00:03:18.440> your<00:03:18.769> king<00:03:18.980> now<00:03:19.610> you've<00:03:19.790> already

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
protect your king now you've already

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.670 
protect your king now you've already
kind<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.420> messed<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.840> up<00:03:20.959> with<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.320> an

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
kind of messed it up with that an

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120 
kind of messed it up with that an
initial<00:03:22.190> move<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.570> now<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:24.500> piece<00:03:24.860> wasn't

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
initial move so now this piece wasn't

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.370 
initial move so now this piece wasn't
under<00:03:25.550> attack<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.600> kind<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.959> wasted

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
under attack so you just kind of wasted

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.259 
under attack so you just kind of wasted
a<00:03:27.440> move<00:03:27.650> moving<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.340> up<00:03:28.459> there<00:03:28.790> where<00:03:29.180> you

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
a move moving it up there where you

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.670 
a move moving it up there where you
should<00:03:29.480> have<00:03:29.660> brought<00:03:29.870> out<00:03:30.110> either<00:03:30.320> you're

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
should have brought out either you're

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.280 
should have brought out either you're
either<00:03:31.310> your<00:03:31.580> other<00:03:31.760> night<00:03:32.060> or<00:03:32.600> moved<00:03:32.930> upon

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
either your other night or moved upon

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.050 
either your other night or moved upon
forward<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.010> your<00:03:34.280> bishop<00:03:34.700> could<00:03:34.880> get

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
forward so that your bishop could get

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.479 
forward so that your bishop could get
out<00:03:35.209> or<00:03:35.480> something<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.040> you'd<00:03:37.250> be<00:03:37.400> able

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
out or something so that you'd be able

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.759 
out or something so that you'd be able
to<00:03:37.610> get<00:03:37.820> more<00:03:38.269> control<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.780> more<00:03:39.110> pieces<00:03:39.560> but

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
to get more control of more pieces but

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.500 
to get more control of more pieces but
instead<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.100> just<00:03:40.250> moved<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:41.090> second

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
instead you just moved this a second

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.210 
instead you just moved this a second
time<00:03:41.540> which<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.320> you<00:03:42.560> know<00:03:42.680> was<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.860> mistake

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
time which I you know was a mistake

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.160 
time which I you know was a mistake
because<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.820> didn't<00:03:44.060> see<00:03:44.209> my<00:03:44.360> queen<00:03:44.720> there<00:03:44.959> to

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
because you didn't see my queen there to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.080 
because you didn't see my queen there to
take<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.560> but<00:03:45.920> even<00:03:46.040> if<00:03:46.190> my<00:03:46.370> queen<00:03:46.700> wasn't

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
take it but even if my queen wasn't

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.270 
take it but even if my queen wasn't
there<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.780> wouldn't<00:03:48.080> have<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:49.070> wouldn't

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
there you wouldn't have you wouldn't

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.039 
there you wouldn't have you wouldn't
have<00:03:49.400> accomplished<00:03:49.940> much<00:03:50.209> by<00:03:50.510> moving<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.959> up

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
have accomplished much by moving it up

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.660 
have accomplished much by moving it up
there<00:03:51.260> especially<00:03:51.739> because<00:03:52.160> you're<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.459> close

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
there especially because you're so close

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.130 
there especially because you're so close
to<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.910> pawns<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.420> could<00:03:53.570> just<00:03:53.600> move<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
to the pawns and I could just move the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.300 
to the pawns and I could just move the
pawn<00:03:54.320> down<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:54.950> would<00:03:55.040> have<00:03:55.070> had<00:03:55.220> to

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
pawn down and then you would have had to

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.640 
pawn down and then you would have had to
run<00:03:55.459> away<00:03:55.610> in<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.390> beginning<00:03:56.780> remember<00:03:56.900> try

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
run away in the beginning remember try

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.539 
run away in the beginning remember try
not<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:58.100> move<00:03:59.000> your<00:03:59.060> pieces<00:04:00.160> more<00:04:01.160> than<00:04:01.310> once

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
not to move your pieces more than once

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.800 
not to move your pieces more than once
until<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.299> have<00:04:02.540> enough<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:03.860> your<00:04:04.160> minor

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
until you have enough of your minor

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.350 
until you have enough of your minor
pieces<00:04:05.810> out<00:04:06.110> onto<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.470> board<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.820> I<00:04:07.850> just<00:04:08.120> take

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
pieces out onto the board so I just take

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.949 
pieces out onto the board so I just take
it's<00:04:08.690> obviously<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:09.350> know<00:04:09.470> just<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.950> mistake

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
it's obviously you know just a mistake

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.100 
it's obviously you know just a mistake
so<00:04:11.959> now<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:13.459> attack<00:04:13.850> which<00:04:14.600> again<00:04:14.870> doesn't

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
so now you attack which again doesn't

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.949 
so now you attack which again doesn't
really<00:04:15.620> develop<00:04:16.220> any<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.820> your<00:04:17.090> any<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.810> your

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
really develop any of your any of your

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.640 
really develop any of your any of your
pieces<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.880> i<00:04:20.660> decided<00:04:21.080> i'm<00:04:21.229> going<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.620> i

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
pieces and i decided i'm going to i

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.020 
pieces and i decided i'm going to i
don't<00:04:22.010> want<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.190> run<00:04:22.340> away<00:04:22.490> because<00:04:22.760> i'm

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
don't want to run away because i'm

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.710 
don't want to run away because i'm
already<00:04:23.270> out<00:04:23.510> there<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:24.349> I<00:04:24.380> scoot<00:04:24.770> over<00:04:25.039> once

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
already out there so I scoot over once

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.100 
already out there so I scoot over once
one<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:27.220> attack<00:04:27.580> again<00:04:27.940> now<00:04:28.870> at<00:04:28.990> this

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
one and you attack again now at this

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.190 
one and you attack again now at this
point<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.650> don't<00:04:30.130> want<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:31.780> know<00:04:31.900> I've<00:04:31.990> already

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
point I don't want you know I've already

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.020 
point I don't want you know I've already
moved<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.620> three<00:04:32.860> times<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:33.520> that's<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.850> big

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
moved it three times so that's a big

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.780 
moved it three times so that's a big
waste<00:04:34.210> for<00:04:34.510> me<00:04:34.860> wasting<00:04:35.860> time<00:04:36.040> but<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.580> didn't

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
waste for me wasting time but you didn't

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.220 
waste for me wasting time but you didn't
really<00:04:36.910> accomplish<00:04:37.240> much<00:04:37.570> that's<00:04:37.840> not<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.200> bad

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
really accomplish much that's not so bad

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.650 
really accomplish much that's not so bad
so<00:04:39.070> now<00:04:39.160> that<00:04:39.370> move<00:04:39.670> didn't<00:04:40.330> really<00:04:40.450> do

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
so now that move didn't really do

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.930 
so now that move didn't really do
anything<00:04:40.930> your<00:04:41.590> bishop<00:04:42.250> was<00:04:42.370> protected<00:04:42.910> by

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
anything your bishop was protected by

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.480 
anything your bishop was protected by
your<00:04:43.270> rook<00:04:43.600> so<00:04:44.170> you<00:04:44.260> didn't<00:04:44.530> really<00:04:44.560> need<00:04:44.950> to

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
your rook so you didn't really need to

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.240 
your rook so you didn't really need to
move<00:04:46.360> this<00:04:46.570> pawn<00:04:46.840> up<00:04:47.080> all<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.440> did<00:04:47.620> was<00:04:47.650> hinder

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
move this pawn up all you did was hinder

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.440 
move this pawn up all you did was hinder
the<00:04:48.520> bishops<00:04:48.910> ability<00:04:49.390> to<00:04:49.540> attack<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.090> moved

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
the bishops ability to attack so I moved

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.940 
the bishops ability to attack so I moved
another<00:04:52.690> piece<00:04:52.990> at<00:04:53.170> now<00:04:53.380> if<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:53.590> look<00:04:53.710> at<00:04:53.860> the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
another piece at now if you look at the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.400 
another piece at now if you look at the
board<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.340> have<00:04:54.610> three<00:04:55.000> I<00:04:55.330> have<00:04:55.810> two<00:04:56.050> minor

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
board I have three I have two minor

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.040 
board I have three I have two minor
pieces<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:57.160> one<00:04:57.340> major<00:04:57.610> piece<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.270> complete

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
pieces and one major piece and complete

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.950 
pieces and one major piece and complete
control<00:04:59.350> of<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.680> center<00:04:59.890> where<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.730> have<00:05:01.390> one

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
control of the center where you have one

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.660 
control of the center where you have one
minor<00:05:02.350> peace<00:05:02.680> out<00:05:02.890> that's<00:05:03.250> completely

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
minor peace out that's completely

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.370 
minor peace out that's completely
useless<00:05:03.970> because<00:05:04.300> it's<00:05:04.600> blocked<00:05:04.870> by<00:05:05.320> this

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
useless because it's blocked by this

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.770 
useless because it's blocked by this
pawn
