00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
I have three of these exact cases that

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.840 
I have three of these exact cases that
i'll<00:00:50.450> be<00:00:50.480> putting<00:00:50.840> online<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:54.559> then<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.610> rest

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
now these will be the cells made a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:51.700 
now these will be the cells made a
smaller<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.730> here<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:40.250> show<00:01:41.250> you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.000 
inside of these guys are so close this
way<00:02:51.050> here<00:02:51.470> if<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:52.130> look<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.690> outside<00:02:55.780> is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
way here if you look the outside is

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.880 
way here if you look the outside is
completely<00:02:58.010> covered<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.579> then<00:02:59.540> there's<00:02:59.750> that

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
and what that does is it allows the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.280 
and what that does is it allows the
spacing<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.220> close<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:05.079> virtually<00:03:06.079> no

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
spacing to be close and virtually no
