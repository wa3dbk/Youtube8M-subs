00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.289 

so<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.980> first<00:00:05.190> thing<00:00:05.310> on<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> list<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:06.089> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
so the first thing on the list is the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.650 
so the first thing on the list is the
testa<00:00:06.870> which<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.500> here<00:00:07.830> there<00:00:08.099> are<00:00:08.340> two<00:00:09.030> testes

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
testa which is here there are two testes

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.039 
testa which is here there are two testes
they're<00:00:10.530> paired<00:00:10.950> organs<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.210> testes<00:00:12.690> serve

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
they're paired organs the testes serve

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.700 
they're paired organs the testes serve
as<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.980> primary<00:00:15.080> reproductive<00:00:16.080> organs

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
as the primary reproductive organs

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.150 
as the primary reproductive organs
within<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> mail<00:00:17.400> meaning<00:00:17.910> they<00:00:18.740> produce<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
within the mail meaning they produce the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.050 
within the mail meaning they produce the
sex<00:00:20.460> cells<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.090> Gammy's<00:00:21.570> which<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> sperm

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
sex cells or Gammy's which are the sperm

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.349 
sex cells or Gammy's which are the sperm
so<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.990> top<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.470> each<00:00:25.980> test<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so on top of each test this is the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.200 
so on top of each test this is the
epididymis<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.010> epididymis<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
epididymis and the epididymis is the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.410 
epididymis and the epididymis is the
area<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.650> firm<00:00:32.009> migrated<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.000> once

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
area that the firm migrated to once

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
area that the firm migrated to once
they've<00:00:33.660> been<00:00:33.690> produced<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.890> will<00:00:35.040> sit

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
they've been produced and they will sit

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
they've been produced and they will sit
here<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.000> continue<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.750> mature<00:00:37.129> until<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
here and continue to mature until the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.069 
here and continue to mature until the
time<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> ejaculation<00:00:39.480> during<00:00:40.910> ejaculation

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079

deferens has been muscular tube that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
deferens has been muscular tube that
carries<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> sperm<00:00:54.199> towards<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.500> end<00:00:55.829> point

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
carries the sperm towards this end point

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760 
carries the sperm towards this end point
where<00:00:56.610> an<00:00:56.760> intersect<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> ejaculatory

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
where an intersect with the ejaculatory

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.880 
where an intersect with the ejaculatory
duct<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.239> vas<00:01:00.420> deferens<00:01:01.079> becomes<00:01:01.559> slightly

duct the vas deferens becomes slightly

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.050 
duct the vas deferens becomes slightly
enlarged<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.239> area<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.690> called<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> ampulla

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
enlarged this area is called the ampulla

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.630 
enlarged this area is called the ampulla
and<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> also<00:01:07.110> where<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.159> seminal

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and this is also where the seminal

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.980 
and this is also where the seminal
vesicle<00:01:09.330> releases<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.380> seminal<00:01:11.010> fluid<00:01:11.780> at<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
vesicle releases if seminal fluid at the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
vesicle releases if seminal fluid at the
same<00:01:13.200> time<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.650> sperm<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.189> released<00:01:14.640> into

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
same time that sperm is released into

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.620 
same time that sperm is released into
the<00:01:15.390> ejaculatory<00:01:16.380> duct<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the ejaculatory duct so this is the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.820 
the ejaculatory duct so this is the
ejaculatory<00:01:19.790> duct<00:01:20.790> shown<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
ejaculatory duct shown here the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.340 
ejaculatory duct shown here the
ejaculatory<00:01:23.340> duct<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.479> intersect

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
ejaculatory duct will then intersect

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740 
ejaculatory duct will then intersect
with<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.009> join<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.850> urethra

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
with it will join up with a urethra

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.289 
with it will join up with a urethra
which<00:01:28.140> allows<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.130> semen<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.880> released

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
which allows the semen to be released

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.130 
which allows the semen to be released
from<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.930> man's<00:01:31.170> body<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:31.979> penis<00:01:33.140> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
from the man's body through the penis so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.310 
from the man's body through the penis so
if<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> inside<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.750> toughest

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
if we look at the inside of the toughest

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.819 
if we look at the inside of the toughest
we<00:01:37.590> also<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.430> seminar<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.060> tubules<00:01:39.829> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
we also see the seminar of tubules the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.420 
we also see the seminar of tubules the
seminary's<00:01:41.400> tubules<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.710> small<00:01:44.009> tubes

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
seminary's tubules are the small tubes

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.450 
seminary's tubules are the small tubes
within<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.630> sperm<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.170> produced<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
within which the sperm is produced and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.210 
within which the sperm is produced and
the<00:01:47.700> firm<00:01:47.970> are<00:01:48.149> produced<00:01:48.600> by<00:01:48.990> permit<00:01:49.829> Oh<00:01:49.860> Jen
