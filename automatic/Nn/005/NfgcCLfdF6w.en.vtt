hibernation<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:42.659> takes<00:01:42.959> a<00:01:43.109> few<00:01:43.350> seconds<00:01:43.889> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
hibernation which takes a few seconds to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
hibernation which takes a few seconds to
resume<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.969> I'm<00:01:45.029> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.209> do<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> same<00:01:45.509> thing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
