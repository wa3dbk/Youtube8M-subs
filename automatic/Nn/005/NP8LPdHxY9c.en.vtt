00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
show you my strategy I've been using

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.729

it's a quite good strategy ask another

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.630 
it's a quite good strategy ask another
map<00:00:42.100> as<00:00:42.309> an<00:00:42.460> uh<00:00:42.719> shoot<00:00:43.719> Oh<00:00:44.289> throw<00:00:45.190> another<00:00:45.400> one

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
map as an uh shoot Oh throw another one

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.930 
map as an uh shoot Oh throw another one
and<00:00:45.790> then<00:00:45.910> we'll<00:00:46.090> get<00:00:46.270> on<00:00:46.420> my<00:00:46.630> way<00:00:47.880> strategy<00:00:48.880> is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
and then we'll get on my way strategy is

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.670 
and then we'll get on my way strategy is
quite<00:00:49.270> easy<00:00:49.600> you're<00:00:49.900> gonna<00:00:49.960> be<00:00:50.170> raped<00:00:50.380> trained

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
quite easy you're gonna be raped trained

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.479 
quite easy you're gonna be raped trained
in<00:00:50.890> this<00:00:51.040> garden<00:00:51.550> here

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
in this garden here

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.540 
in this garden here
yeah<00:00:54.489> there's<00:00:54.790> two<00:00:55.800> possible<00:00:56.800> places<00:00:57.280> where

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
yeah there's two possible places where

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.479 
yeah there's two possible places where
the<00:00:58.480> box<00:00:58.750> can<00:00:59.020> spawn<00:00:59.380> whereas<00:01:00.130> there's<00:01:00.370> only

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
the box can spawn whereas there's only

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.819 
the box can spawn whereas there's only
one<00:01:00.790> in<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.090> other<00:01:01.239> garden<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:01.920> there<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.540> two

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
one in the other garden and there is two

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.880 
one in the other garden and there is two
perks<00:01:05.829> slots<00:01:06.399> that<00:01:06.579> can<00:01:07.000> be<00:01:07.380> spawned<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.710> like

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
perks slots that can be spawned so like

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.649 
perks slots that can be spawned so like
you<00:01:09.040> could<00:01:09.189> have<00:01:09.310> two<00:01:09.490> perks<00:01:09.820> in<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.240> garden

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
you could have two perks in that garden

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.740 
you could have two perks in that garden
but<00:01:11.229> whereas<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.829> other<00:01:11.860> one<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.600> can

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
but whereas in the other one you can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
know I wouldn't suggest using the Raygun

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.100 
know I wouldn't suggest using the Raygun
it<00:01:36.520> makes<00:01:36.760> too<00:01:36.970> many<00:01:37.060> cruel<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.810> they<00:01:37.900> just

you're not going to be walking in this I
have<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.560> relativistic<00:01:45.240> punishment<00:01:46.240> device

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
have the relativistic punishment device

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.230 
have the relativistic punishment device
at<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.840> minute<00:01:47.110> all<00:01:48.010> right<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.909> other<00:01:48.939> way

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
at the minute all right the other way

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.690 
at the minute all right the other way
we'll<00:01:49.510> go<00:01:49.689> then<00:01:49.979> quite<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.010> few<00:01:51.159> crawlers<00:01:51.520> there

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
we'll go then quite a few crawlers there

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.789 
we'll go then quite a few crawlers there
the<00:01:52.119> relativistic<00:01:52.570> punishment<00:01:53.320> device<00:01:53.619> is

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
the relativistic punishment device is

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.679 
the relativistic punishment device is
okay<00:01:54.159> but<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.670> run<00:01:54.880> just<00:01:54.909> a<00:01:55.240> bit<00:01:55.390> too<00:01:55.509> slow

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
okay but you run just a bit too slow

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.920 
okay but you run just a bit too slow
over<00:01:55.979> nickel<00:01:56.979> ill<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:58.240> sledgehammer

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
over nickel ill and the sledgehammer

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.020 
over nickel ill and the sledgehammer
seemed<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.710> make<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.009> run<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.220> lot<00:02:00.430> faster<00:02:00.939> than

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
seemed to make you run a lot faster than

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.170 
seemed to make you run a lot faster than
you<00:02:01.180> do<00:02:01.330> with<00:02:01.479> most<00:02:01.689> LMGs<00:02:02.500> if<00:02:03.340> you're<00:02:03.850> playing

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
you do with most LMGs if you're playing

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.539 
you do with most LMGs if you're playing
on<00:02:04.360> new<00:02:04.509> town<00:02:04.780> first<00:02:05.229> time<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.740> get<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.009> LSAT

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
on new town first time you get the LSAT

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.289 
on new town first time you get the LSAT
it's<00:02:06.790> like<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.299> it's<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.200> new<00:02:09.000> LMG<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.209> has

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
it's like the it's the new LMG that has

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.839 
it's like the it's the new LMG that has
been<00:02:10.450> added<00:02:10.840> into<00:02:10.989> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
been added into it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.580 
been added into it
it's<00:02:12.849> not<00:02:13.239> very<00:02:13.269> good<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.319> target

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
it's not very good you get a target

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.559

but yeah it's quite simple tactic anyway
I<00:03:52.020> think<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.770> way<00:03:52.950> 35<00:03:53.580> is<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.940> top<00:03:54.710> 2004

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
I think the way 35 is in the top 2004

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.990 
I think the way 35 is in the top 2004

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
before the whole trainer sort of spawn I

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.000 
before the whole trainer sort of spawn I
should<00:05:01.430> really<00:05:01.850> let<00:05:02.510> every<00:05:02.840> zombie<00:05:03.260> spawn<00:05:03.650> and

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
should really let every zombie spawn and

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.830 
should really let every zombie spawn and
then<00:05:04.520> start<00:05:04.910> shooting<00:05:05.330> them<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:05.570> that<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:05.780> know

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840
