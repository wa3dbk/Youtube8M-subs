00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.359
 hello how about here I bring you this design 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.019
 inspired by rihanna she used these nails 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.840
 in the grammys this year and I loved them 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:34.500
 this very simple but beautiful thread 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.989
 red is classic never goes out of style and I 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.050
 they loved when I saw them here 6 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.270
 try this as you can see I stuck the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.969
 chips stiletto very well to my one natural 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.070
 and with this little scissors I'm going to cut them 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.020
 like to cut it better with a scissor that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 with a cut to you because you can see 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 better what is it that you are cutting as 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.219
 that you control a little more what you 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.350
 you take off and then with a file I'm going to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.090
 go to perfect the tip has 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.750
 to be well marked the square 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.140
 now the next band I'm going to put two 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.470
 Sometimes in natural girl obviously the nail 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.350
 I was ready and here I am going to use 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.680
 crystal acrylic of my line east 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.860
 2 ounce pots this brush I'm going 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.290
 to use is number 10 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.440
 I like to use this brush a lot because 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.390
 pick up the big legs dating me 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.550
 like to make the flat tip as they can 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.460
 see here and how I feel like I finish more 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.830
 fast when I use a larger brush 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.330
 Well the first pearlita we're going to 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.770
 put in the center sweeping down 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.200
 cleaning the sides 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.920
 and chip is much easier because 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.970
 you have your base below and nothing else 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.710
 expose the acrylic to the base as you see 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.960
 with the body of the brush 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.570
 barry the rest of the acrylic down 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 and now nothing else cleaning the edges and 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.770
 now in the cuticle area put 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.900
 attention in this part because they make me 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.289
 many questions as you see it apply 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.650
 carry from side to side and up towards 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.720
 down not pushing the acrylic towards the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.230
 cuticle they will be able to see it again in 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.530
 this nail as they saw this first pearl 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.870
 with the body down with the body 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.910
 of the brush 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.280
 I put it from side to side 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.760
 and mud down 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.920
 the brush is your shield let's put it 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.400
 so the brush does not allow the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.250
 acrylic 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.040
 go in front of the brush that always 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.129
 Be behind the brush so you do not 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.750
 touch the cuticle the cuticle area 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.599
 I put one more pearl in the center to 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.210
 reinforce the tension area cleaned the 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.150
 sides and ready 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.600
 Now that I finish all my nails 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.450
 my two hands with the machine 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.880
 with the electric file I'm going to seal the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.460
 Cuticle if you do not have an electric file 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.050
 no matter this can be done too 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.550
 with the line of hand but nothing else 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.670
 I show because they asked me 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.920
 show as slime stamp cuticle I'm going 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.340
 top down to remove remove the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.890
 excess acrylic and again there as 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.240
 I see I'm sealing off a little there the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.570
 banks shaping it and now with the 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.660
 lima 100-100 the side as you see 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.260
 first one side then the other and then the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.260
 tip 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.990
 the tip right straight so that we 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.000
 this square is well marked and now 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.760
 I give a little shape to the rest of the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.490
 nail already with the organic expansion and I 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.850
 love 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.800
 or the nail now let's remove the dust 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.420
 always from top to bottom so that 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.790
 do not leave the accumulated dust in the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.270
 cuticle as they see the alcohol that I use is 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.780
 70 percent 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.120
 When I do not have a cleaner , alcohol is 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.740
 perfectly fine as you could see 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.720
 now I prepare my cup as they see with 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.430
 Acetone is always good to have everything 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.459
 ready before you start to stop 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.579
 and so work faster really true for 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.610
 clean the edges 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.539
 This color is the red flag of Sanchez 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.759
 and I advise you to use enamel 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.340
 base that is the biggest little boat here 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.650
 I'm using the brush enamel because it's 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.680
 the only thing that was at hand but this 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.469
 color is the red flag I love this 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.199
 color as they see seal very well 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:45.419
 edges the tip wait for it to dry 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.819
 perfectly here I am cleaning a 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.479
 little acetone and the brochita this brochita 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.479
 I love 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.660
 wait for them to dry as you see here already 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.669
 they are dry until they look opaque you see in 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.000
 Mars is to say that they are already dry 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.150
 now we put the gel of his vision of my 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.310
 line this nail shape has fascinated me 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.810
 it has been much to the singer viana 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.389
 and the truth is that they look great if they have 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.430
 clients who like only 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.100
 square do not want to try the oval or 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.860
 stiletto this is a very good option 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.650
 give them make the nail look very pretty like 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.199
 you see this nail form is very easy 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.919
 I prefer to do it with 7 is not cultural 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:29.139
 like it comes out more perfect with chip and it's 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.380
 super easy then I hope you have them 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.919

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.560
