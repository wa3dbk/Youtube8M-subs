 there 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.780
 I did not know 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.310

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.670
 even for the race 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.790
 city 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.420
 place 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 the day of parkour 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.490
 for videos 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.790
 today 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.790
 there 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.319
 now I am saying that first the egg or 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.549
 the flour 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.549
 according to disco de chayanne 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.210
 life 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.650
 according to religion, first it was the 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.870
 animals and it's creative I do not think 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.960
 eggs for religion first they were 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.790
 it was life but for science first 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.010
 it was egg why because this is done 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.620
 based on cells and the egg is a 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.720
 cell then not all of us need a 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.970
 embryo I do not know 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.110
