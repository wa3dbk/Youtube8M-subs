00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.480
 Well I'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.480
 get rid of the swelling and your weight 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.500
 extra water 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.930
 I must confess that it is really simple 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.599
 to the point of being boring but 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.520
 you have two options you want something 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.919
 boring that works to lose the 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.130
 water weight or prefer to carry two 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.039
 kilos or more of water 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.710
 I already imagined it to go down 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.510
 quickly the water weight is necessary 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.180
 prove to your body that it is not 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.420
 necessary to retain water for a case 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.570
 of emergency to achieve it you must drink 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.720
 a lot of water you're probably thinking 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.600
 How can it be that I drink more water? 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.780
 help you lose the weight of water you should 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.430
 understand this your body is complex and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.649
 mode still works 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.650
 survival as he did a thousand years 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.439
 back when the water and the food 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.150
 they were scarce to protect your body 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.299
 He developed ways to help you 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.970
 survive carry body weight and weight 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.330
 of extra water are two of the strategies 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.840
 what uses good is very different today 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.570
 in day to what was before the food 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.030
 and water are no longer scarce so 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.479
 this protection mechanism is not 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.420
 updated unfortunately there's no 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.579
 nothing you can do about it but 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.480
 what you can do is cheat your 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.120
 body in regards to water 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.250
 by drinking a large amount of water or 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.130
 eat foods with high content of 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.380
 water like apples and watermelons your 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.410
 body thinks there is a lot of water and not 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.590
 there is a need to maintain it so the 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.360
 free from the body 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.730
 basically if you are going to drink more than 3 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.920
 liters of water a day along with eating 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.110
 some fruits with high content of 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.640
 water your body will release the weight in 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.479
 water you can lose 2 kilos in 3 to 4 days 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.280
