no surprise that the ps3 pc versions are
better<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> terms<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.840> quality<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> can

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
better in terms of quality which you can

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
better in terms of quality which you can
hardly<00:01:02.309> tell<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.850> comparing<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> ps3<00:01:03.960> however

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
controls is what this person wanted for
the<00:01:18.060> game<00:01:18.240> i<00:01:18.509> watch<00:01:19.110> closely<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the game i watch closely to see if the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
the game i watch closely to see if the
person<00:01:20.490> playing<00:01:20.670> use<00:01:21.030> any<00:01:21.240> touchscreen

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
person playing use any touchscreen

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.420 
person playing use any touchscreen
actions<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> looked<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.159> feature

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
actions but it looked like the feature

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.760 
actions but it looked like the feature
was<00:01:23.820> turned<00:01:24.090> off<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.930> sake<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.530> video

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
was turned off for the sake of the video

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
was turned off for the sake of the video
perhaps<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.759> wouldn't<00:01:26.939> want<00:01:27.210> hands<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
perhaps you wouldn't want hands and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.569 
perhaps you wouldn't want hands and
fingers<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.680> while<00:01:28.890> recording<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
fingers in the way in while recording I

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.550 
fingers in the way in while recording I
personally<00:01:30.450> wouldn't<00:01:30.630> care<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> ports

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
personally wouldn't care for the ports

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.649 
personally wouldn't care for the ports
to<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.920> touchscreen<00:01:32.520> controls<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.509> those

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
to have touchscreen controls I see those

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.630 
to have touchscreen controls I see those
mainly<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.320> exclusives<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.070> well<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:35.369> certain

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
mainly for exclusives as well as certain

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.730 
mainly for exclusives as well as certain
indie<00:01:36.000> titles<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:37.110> after<00:01:37.350> doing<00:01:37.470> some

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
indie titles but after doing some

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.499 
indie titles but after doing some
research<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.340> turns<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.240> game

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
research it turns out that this game

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
research it turns out that this game
does<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.009> touchscreen<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.159> well<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.579> rear

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
does have touchscreen as well as rear

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.240 
does have touchscreen as well as rear
pad<00:01:42.060> controls<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.810> access<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> map<00:01:43.590> may<00:01:43.979> lead

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
pad controls to access the map may lead

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
pad controls to access the map may lead
dashing<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:44.970> other<00:01:45.149> features<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.990> game

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
dashing and other features of the game

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710 
dashing and other features of the game
so<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:48.030> game<00:01:48.210> looks<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
