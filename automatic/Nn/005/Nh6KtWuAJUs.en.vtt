00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello here he is now with a something 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.030
 another video and this time I want you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.660
 a little yes maco show yourself 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.660
 written 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:24.260
 shoutcast 13 ambush otherwise 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:28.939
 So he wants me to do that 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:32.399
 it just makes shells and if we stop 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.100
 just are not as normal stop in the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.380
 stall are then it also makes shells 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.540
 but if we dance in the shadows right now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.540
 go ambush 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 already you ask yourself now why should 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.039
 I do not ambush in staff shares 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.370
 Now we come to one here 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.409
 a small bill so all values like 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.269
 Here you are looking at one 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.430
 I have made training dummy and I have 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.979
 Always on mean bible managed 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.030
 not just once mocked one 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:09.250
 makes couple times and nation cut 75,000 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.820
 Charlie makes a bet as 10,000 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 so hurt ambush in the set and 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.950
 costs just 35 energy and ambush 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.950
 almost twice as much 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.960
 and yes ambush makes stop in the dance 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.750
 100 damage now you ask yourself so 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.110
 why 130000 harm why dust off 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.259
 hurt more simply meant jansen 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.299
 drink his one news or be 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.069
 part and yes that he still a bit 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.170
 more harm and maybe you thought 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.940
 still on blogs etc you also have one 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 Important Factor Weiligmann everything 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.080
 you make reference to cvp and 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 an ambush in the shadow dance costs 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.160
 just 40 energy I have ten times 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.000
 just how much you hurt pro 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.769
 Making energy that is when assassinate 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.950
 2143 years simply died in harm 

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:09.160
 takes life showed through shared 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.010
 the energy shared and the ambush 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.640
 is that then 110,000 divided by 60 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.060
 that we are 1833 that is definitely 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.410
 less than rotten and at 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.810
 ambush in the dance is actually 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.780
 Of course, most of the time, 130,000 are 40,000 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.470
 3250 damage and that shows us that it 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.010
 in the eye or in general actually 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.500
 More worthwhile than an ambush 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.000
 to use 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.209
 that's how the macro looks in any case 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.460
 out is definitely still in the video 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.230
 description 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.000
 just written can just copy 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.830
 I can try it 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.600
 Unfortunately that may still have a mistake and 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.480
 Although when one because if not so 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.890
 you have used three to disappear 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.630
 seconds or physics and one 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.280
 improved step and improved 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.010
 time is still holding ambush 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.860
 used instead of around you is so 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.650
 that a little mistake if one 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.840
 knows how to fix this writes 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.220
 done me 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.080
 otherwise try it yourself 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.430
 and please remember that these values 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.800
 I took and one training 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.050
 Representatives were and would always be you 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.720
 still recommend always ambush as 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.330
 afford to pull and just pretend to me 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.510
 because ambush it is 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.340
 a pvp is pretty situation dependent 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.470
 what we use now but every case 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.480
 you can often use shells 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.420
 as most people use now 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.580
 and yes, if you liked the video 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.830
 then leave with your thumbs up there 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.330
 if you still have questions 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.090
 just ask me and i hope this 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.530
 video helped you 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.140
 and yes, if you liked it just 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.340
 leave an abo da or so until then 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.340
 should your - rp
