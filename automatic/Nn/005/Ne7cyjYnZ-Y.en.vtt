00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:14.699
 this we what we will do here 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:23.669
 each corresponds to a different area 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:25.890
 or a different space this is the case 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.659
 of the black in the part of the room 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 for example getting to the house reaches the 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.940
 room puts it there in the case of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
 red we are that includes the house in the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.140
 case of blue is inside the vehicle 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.629
 which we are going to try now as 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 example the vehicle of the king's house with 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.780
 an example of your creativity activate the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.460
 bluetooth phone wifi 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.370
 in this case what will make the steps 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.890
 of the phone and the quick registration of 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.480
 enamel and activate the applications that you 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.030
 you want me to ask for them as such because 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.469
 every time that for example every time 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 more comes with a configuration 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.010
 different 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.490
 although I tell you that for example you have to 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.479
 be to all our office but 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.369
 it really does not have to be 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.930
 obligation to the office as I can 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.820
 say fourth device in the room by 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.259
 example I can take the case of the negrito 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.750
 be here that is here he stuck it more 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.070
 disable wifi disables the data and what 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.360
 that makes me then put on 20 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.619
 it's probably completely to 2000 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.110
 so that nobody bothers me when I 'm 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.610
 sleeping will activate the most active one the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.399
 alarm and continued activating applications 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 9 for example let's select another 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.610
 in the case of was the house 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.510
 for the hard sound for and now not 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.980
 they have an application programmed by the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.350
 moment 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.060
 but for example I can program this 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.310
 that is sport that is for example for 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.440
 gym or reprogram one when it arrived 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.790
 the gym touched him against the bulk of the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.320
 gym and the bundle now by the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.390
 application that to maintain in what 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.250
 rhythm you're running if you're 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.690
 eating the sights of the tracks you are 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.100
 running then different applications 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:18.720
 of the telephone office programs 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.720
 I see here is active bluetooth 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.490
 turn on the wifi and open the calendar 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.490
 of the telephone 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.160
 you're watching me 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:45.400
 in daily life on the phone a 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.400
 thing is to work 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.980
 they will help you much more in the day to 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.960
 day the smart access is bought a 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.580
 Package come four are included 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.350
 inside the phones as it is done in 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.780
 this case the small thing also separated 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.490
 a packet of four each one ok me 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.860
 I can buy all four and set it 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.150
 no matter now do not ask this what 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.500
 between us no matter what 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.750
 phones would only have to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.220
 have nfc is not necessarily correct 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.570
 it does not have to be a phone exactly 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.570
 of that you do not just drop the 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.720
 application of turns marta is that is 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.880
 here 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.710
 elevates the application to be installed 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.570
 presented in the sister I also from 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.860
 sony and it does not matter if they have to be from 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.470
 teacher and it can be another some other 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.820
 company that has the nfc technology and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.060
 asked should the experts be used 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.060
 thanks to you
