00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.849
 Alas, just to affirm the panel 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.400
 donegan at night 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.690
 many people do not know how the panel cd 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.369
 However , here, this lighting was the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 I switched on the headlight button 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.500
 originally it is yellow with the panel 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 the car is all green I solved the bomb and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.510
 sells and this is now regulating 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.790
 height of headlamps that originally 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.969
 so green but it is with the lamp 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.890
 halogen lamp and on this 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.440
 lamp is a green cover that is 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.190
 just what gives the green tint 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.530
 the lighting only and this cover ends 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.510
 learning the intensity of the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.449
 elimination then becomes very weak 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.820
 also here on the control buttons 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 the air-conditioning defogger 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.310
 fog fog lamp flashes alert 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.070
 and locking the doors all these 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.189
 buttons here I took it in its original 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:22.409
 which I am led lamp and put it was 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.000
 the same intensity of the panel and the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.579
 board computer despite the banality 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.200
 a bit different but acceptable and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.430
 also works perfect eliminations and 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.939
 and that's why consumption is 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.939
 a little high 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.610
 the original radio then moved in lighting 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.490
 original and here is not going to give it to you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.200
 very well because it really is a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:58.000
 little weak which is the control 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:04.950
 fan and the archangel tea controls 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.950
 cold and wind direction controls 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:17.840
 I just thought to show what it's like 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.840
 98 embrace file panel
