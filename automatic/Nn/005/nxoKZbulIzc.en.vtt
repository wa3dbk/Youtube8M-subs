00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.580 
just going to add it with three cheese
things<00:04:13.629> this<00:04:14.629> is<00:04:14.840> what<00:04:15.019> will<00:04:15.170> actually<00:04:15.260> make

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
things this is what will actually make

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.039 
things this is what will actually make
the<00:04:15.920> cheese<00:04:16.190> stick<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.030> then<00:04:17.600> melt<00:04:17.870> again

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
the cheese stick and then melt again

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.939 
the cheese stick and then melt again
once<00:04:18.470> we've<00:04:18.739> eaten<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:24.320> on<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.560> heat<00:04:24.770> for

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
once we've eaten it on the heat for

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.300 
once we've eaten it on the heat for
about<00:04:25.160> one<00:04:25.639> minute

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
about one minute

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.800 
about one minute
and<00:04:28.310> I'll<00:04:28.430> take<00:04:28.639> this<00:04:28.760> blending<00:04:29.330> while<00:04:29.510> we<00:04:29.660> do

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
and I'll take this blending while we do

00:04:29.810 --> 00:05:36.629 
and I'll take this blending while we do
that<00:04:29.960> as<00:04:30.050> well

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.330 

and<00:05:37.639> finally<00:05:38.240> we<00:05:38.360> just<00:05:38.569> add<00:05:39.099> that<00:05:40.099> mixture

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
and finally we just add that mixture

00:05:40.340 --> 00:06:00.040 
and finally we just add that mixture
into<00:05:40.940> your<00:05:41.060> blender<00:05:41.210> as<00:05:41.539> well

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.719 

so<00:06:01.050> that's<00:06:01.379> the<00:06:01.620> finished<00:06:01.979> product<00:06:02.370> and<00:06:02.639> you

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
so that's the finished product and you

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.490 
so that's the finished product and you
just<00:06:02.909> pour<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.210> into<00:06:03.599> a<00:06:03.780> rectangle

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
just pour that into a rectangle

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.529 
just pour that into a rectangle
container<00:06:04.949> you<00:06:05.520> can<00:06:05.639> set<00:06:05.879> it<00:06:06.000> in<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.240> freezer

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
container you can set it in the freezer

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.040 
container you can set it in the freezer
quite<00:06:06.960> quickly<00:06:08.060> also<00:06:09.060> you<00:06:09.360> can<00:06:09.599> put<00:06:09.719> it<00:06:09.810> in<00:06:09.930> the

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
quite quickly also you can put it in the

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.200 
quite quickly also you can put it in the
refrigerator<00:06:11.009> but<00:06:11.219> I<00:06:11.280> usually<00:06:11.520> set<00:06:11.879> it<00:06:12.000> in<00:06:12.090> the

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
refrigerator but I usually set it in the

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.119 
refrigerator but I usually set it in the
freezer<00:06:12.479> and<00:06:12.659> then<00:06:12.870> pull<00:06:13.080> it<00:06:13.169> out<00:06:13.319> you<00:06:13.830> can

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
freezer and then pull it out you can

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.339 
freezer and then pull it out you can
freeze<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:14.849> to<00:06:15.210> pull<00:06:15.419> it<00:06:15.509> out<00:06:15.629> for<00:06:15.870> later<00:06:16.020> as

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
freeze it to pull it out for later as

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.249 
freeze it to pull it out for later as
well<00:06:16.530> that's<00:06:17.129> nice<00:06:17.400> it's<00:06:17.879> defrosted<00:06:18.259> before

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
well that's nice it's defrosted before

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.200 
well that's nice it's defrosted before
you're<00:06:19.409> able<00:06:19.530> to<00:06:19.710> slice<00:06:20.129> or<00:06:20.460> break<00:06:20.729> up<00:06:20.879> as<00:06:21.030> well

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
you're able to slice or break up as well

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.600 
you're able to slice or break up as well
okay<00:06:21.750> so<00:06:21.780> that's<00:06:22.229> what<00:06:22.409> it<00:06:22.530> comes<00:06:22.680> out<00:06:23.009> as<00:06:23.310> it

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
okay so that's what it comes out as it

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.999 
okay so that's what it comes out as it
comes<00:06:23.789> out<00:06:23.909> as<00:06:24.030> a<00:06:24.090> lot<00:06:24.389> but<00:06:25.319> you<00:06:25.560> can<00:06:25.770> actually

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
comes out as a lot but you can actually

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.550 
comes out as a lot but you can actually
I<00:06:26.520> like<00:06:27.000> to<00:06:27.120> show<00:06:27.389> you<00:06:27.449> but<00:06:28.169> you<00:06:28.229> can<00:06:28.409> have<00:06:28.530> a

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
I like to show you but you can have a

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.119 
I like to show you but you can have a
little<00:06:28.710> bit<00:06:29.009> later<00:06:29.810> you<00:06:30.810> can<00:06:30.960> slice<00:06:31.319> it<00:06:31.349> my

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
little bit later you can slice it my

00:06:32.129 --> 00:07:02.820 
little bit later you can slice it my
cheese<00:06:32.490> and<00:06:32.969> you<00:06:33.780> can<00:06:33.990> grate<00:06:34.259> that<00:06:34.289> too

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.890
