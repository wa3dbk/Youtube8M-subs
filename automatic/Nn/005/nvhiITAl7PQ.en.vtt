 at the e3 exhibition trump card 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.110
 Electronics Arts has become the fourth part 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.590
 battlefield to stand in publishing 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.260
 entrance showroom stood 64 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.720
 computer with demo versions above them 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.840
 towered two sets of screens for 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 commander mode on them developers 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 looked after your teams and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.280
 helped them to the best of their ability 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 the queue was moving fast game session for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.519
 leaves just over ten minutes on 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.309
 screens was shanghai where by the ocean 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:51.600
 The armies of China and America came together in a battle for 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.549
 key points in the middle of the skyscrapers in 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 the game will be shown international 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.320
 conflict in which in a certain 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.360
 degrees involved china in the game will be three 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 parties to the conflict we will remain 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.890
 american and russian army and in too 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 time we add chinese 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.119
 which means there will be a lot in the game 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.729
 New weapons and equipment 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.670
 In addition, we will change part of the weapon 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.200
 vehicles from russia and usa on the streets of shanghai 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
 winter heat 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.520
 the city has not changed much since kane 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.430
 and lynch &amp; dog days 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.980
 players run over the littered paper 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.960
 the streets and trying to navigate among 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.390
 smoke 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.810
 Contrasting light prevents but deep shadows 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.180
 tall buildings give excellent disguise 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 we want to keep the main thing than always 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.740
 there was a batllefield series with appliances from 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.690
 team game and quite worth it 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.270
 series but we make and change great 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.760
 and small include improved gameplay 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.100
 opportunities to play in the team all the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.960
 what has always been famous as a result we 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.810
 return commander mode is 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.970
 A great addition to the game compared to 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860
 battlefield 2 he has changed a lot 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.560
 now it's not just a fight of two 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.200
 commanders a big game of chess and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 the players below on the ground will help 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.190
 to your commander 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.760
 defeat the enemy nir battlefield very 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.760
 fragile 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.880
 a little tank will pass and fly in all directions 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.730
 concrete fragments and splashes gush 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.520
 fire cranes and explode vintage 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.700
 chinese statues adds it all 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.540
 feeling of real war but unlike 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.970
 other games 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.430
 here it is possible to destroy not only any 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.460
 small thing but the whole skyscrapers 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.030
 in days for this there is even a term 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.090
 for which Vanyushin united revolution 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.150
 and the demolition we are very busy 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.080
 levolution ideas all cards have very 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.600
 dynamic 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.330
 core so it doesn't just break 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.790
 all sorts of little things change the weather fall 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.080
 whole skyscrapers but that's what you saw 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.870
 in deme before e3 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.630
 and the player can interact with 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.920
 surroundings in many different ways 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.320
 for example, pressing buttons to 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.480
 take a ride in the elevator or shoot 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.600
 a fire extinguisher so that it explodes and 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.150
 filled the room with smoke and jump with 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.790
 roofs and jump from roofs too 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.860
 it is of course very important battlefield i 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.959
 did it found that I had either 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.370
 no parachute either he didn't open ok 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.709
 commander mode allows 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.410
 the player to show their leadership 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.739
 abilities using a camera with a view 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.560
 from above he assesses the situation and helps 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.590
 his as far as possible for example throws 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.660
 battlefield and cruise missiles in common 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.550
 outline this as a commander mode in 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.650
 second battlefield as 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.320
 commander you are directly connected to 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.910
 leaders circle you give them orders 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.860
 they in turn request support 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.860
 our goal is to give players 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.690
 the feeling of being supported but when 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.620
 this does not give the commander the opportunity 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.080
 spoil the game 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.810
 between him and the players going on 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.180
 intensive exchange of information is clear he 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.890
 can help players but can players 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.100
 in exchange to help the commander 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.140
 and how can they help him in several 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.990
 ways first grabbing 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.790
 checkpoints that he needs 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.370
 each captured. gives commander 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.989
 different tools at one point he and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.660
 for example gets the opportunity 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.490
 use helicopter players will get 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.770
 opportunity to be reborn right on his 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.990
 you can shoot from the board or 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.970
 to parachute 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.090
 another variation this tomahawk which you 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.380
 seen in q we captured the point and the commander 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.170
 can launch a rocket 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.300
 in a few minutes of the game to study 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.030
 battlefield 4 was thoroughly 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.730
 impossible but by the example of Shanghai 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.100
 cards can definitely say that 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.100
 the gameplay is at least very 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.310
 atmospheric help and destructible and 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.040
 abundance of technology and competently 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.020
 engineered battle dynamics 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.390
 voice communication we greatly improved then 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.120
 what was before we did not like the voice 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.650
 very important for us and as for 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.840
 observer mode then on 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.820
 press conferences we showed battles 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.880
 from the eyes of the players just through this 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.070
 interface is our goal here to give players 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.410
 opportunity to show off his game and 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.630
 we also use console capabilities 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.330
 new generation of recording gameplay and 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.060
 this is done including with the expectation of 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.919
 eSports up competitive game for 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.200
 we are also very important we give the tools 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.370
 but we cannot say in advance how 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.740
 players will react 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.820
 but in tournaments the observer mode can 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.400
 be very helpful 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.400
 graphics wins due to effects 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.400
 flame and smoke destruction and flying 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.030
 debris but will the game be just as beautiful 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.950
 look on old generation consoles 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.419
 the current generation don't think first 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.910
 turn difference between versions 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.820
 is that on new consoles 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.610
 can be 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.250
 play sixty three rivals with 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.530
 60 frames per second is very 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.960
 it changes everything very well, and besides we have 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.730
 there will be a lot of new drawing features 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.390
 which is not on the consoles of the former 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.580
 generations 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.490
 and what will look prettier 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.530
 battlefield 4 on new consoles or on 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.190
 computers with top graphics cards 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.600
 for example this is a very difficult question 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.120
 development is still underway and we have not seen 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.760
 final optimized version of the game 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.650
 on the console we are working on optimizing 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.400
 now collaborating with manufacturers 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.290
 consoles 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.810
 but on the other hand the recording industry 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.090
 develops very quickly we do not know 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.430
 groups will have some new video cards 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.270
 if anything we would like a game 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:41.040
 supported and will be released battlefield 4 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.040
 by November of this year 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.030
 freak me play
