here I might as well say this I got two
notches<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.259> pulley<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.509> can

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
notches in this pulley that is so I can

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.670 
notches in this pulley that is so I can
start<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.119> just<00:01:45.119> take<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> rope<00:01:48.590> put<00:01:49.590> in

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
start it I just take this rope put in

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.609 
start it I just take this rope put in
one<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> notches<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:51.409> wrap<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.439> around

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
one of the notches just wrap it around

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
one of the notches just wrap it around
the<00:01:52.890> pulley<00:01:54.229> about<00:01:55.229> three<00:01:55.500> times<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.909> start<00:01:57.180> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the pulley about three times to start it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.330 
the pulley about three times to start it
there's<00:01:58.110> something<00:01:58.350> wrong<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:58.860> charging

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
there's something wrong with my charging

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
there's something wrong with my charging
system<00:01:59.729> I<00:02:00.290> believe<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> battery's<00:02:01.950> not

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
system I believe it's the battery's not

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.300 
system I believe it's the battery's not
holding<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.549> charge<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> take<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
holding a charge but when I take the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.639 
holding a charge but when I take the
charging<00:02:05.790> wires<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.450> put<00:02:07.020> them<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> 12-volt

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
charging wires and put them to a 12-volt

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.249 
charging wires and put them to a 12-volt
light<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> motor<00:02:08.580> running<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:10.080> light

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
light with the motor running the light

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.260 
light with the motor running the light
comes<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.910> something<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
comes on so I think it's something the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.640 
comes on so I think it's something the
battery

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
battery

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.199

I don't<00:02:12.860> know<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:15.230> as<00:02:16.099> a<00:02:16.159> cub<00:02:16.549> cadet<00:02:16.879> front

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
I don't know but as a cub cadet front

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.210 
I don't know but as a cub cadet front
end<00:02:18.280> got<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.430> steering<00:02:19.819> shaft<00:02:19.849> here<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:21.189> had<00:02:22.189> a

going to call that these mufflers off of
a<00:02:32.930> 12-4<00:02:33.500> sprigs<00:02:35.049> two<00:02:36.049> of<00:02:36.170> them<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.379> hopefully

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
a 12-4 sprigs two of them I hopefully

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.050 
a 12-4 sprigs two of them I hopefully
because<00:02:36.950> it's<00:02:37.129> a<00:02:37.189> twin<00:02:39.519> this<00:02:40.519> is<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.760> battery

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
because it's a twin this is a battery
