00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.340
 you knew that cats love to play 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.340
 at night 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:15.580
 today we are going to talk about cats in the 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:18.340
 night or its night activity 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.290
 my cat is playing and running 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.290
 all night help 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.250
 surely if you have a cat you will know 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.920
 well, it's something everyday to see your cat 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.500
 run around the house when the 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.379
 night enter your room by the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.160
 night and attack from the feet chase 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:45.640
 imaginary prisoners that really do not 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.210
 they are since cats have a 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.560
 excellent night vision and can see 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:57.910
 until a hair fly in the air 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.260
 but your cat is not crazy is possessed 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.129
 by some entity 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.810
 simply his genetic inheritance does 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.530
 a nocturnal animal 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.439
 that in 90% of cases they sleep 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.110
 naps during the day and when the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.290
 night he meets all his 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.860
 senses alert 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.730
 not only roams the house but 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 he also exercises his body and his mind 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:33.600
 with the persecution games own of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.580
 the felines is in its nature and it's 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.580
 completely normal 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 If what we want is that our cat 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.830
 stay calmer at night to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.010
 so we can rest with more 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.090
 tranquility we have to provide 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.490
 fun and games during the day to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.710
 that he can spend energy and in the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.350
 night better fit our 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.229
 schedules 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.710
 it's not good either not to let him sleep 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.320
 during 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.310
 because like many humans the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.310
 cat needs his daily naps in 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.150
 where it replenishes energy 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.290
 they usually begin to wake up to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.099
 the afternoon 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.799
 and that's when we have to start 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.370
 play with them do it chase 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.310
 toy mice balls 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.060
 in the cat toy market 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.019
 we can find mice with string 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:45.280
 sticks that hang toys like mice 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:48.790
 birds but etcetera the idea is that the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.530
 Cat gets tired of playing and leaves 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.590
 adjusting to our schedules 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.290
 We can not expect your habits 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.310
 change the overnight 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.310
 will need time 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.090
 but sooner or later we can achieve it 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.489
 the game is not only important so that 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.210
 the cat will exercise and develop its 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.260
 mind and its agility 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.740
 but also strengthens the link with 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.820
 its owners is a very active 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:35.480
 important to them and the more we 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:38.730
 let's involve the love relationship 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.019
 will improve every day 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.019
 good night friends
