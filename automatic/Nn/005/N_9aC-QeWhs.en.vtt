00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 chapter 28 happened in those days 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.580
 that the Philistines gathered their strength 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.950
 to fight against israel and said maybe 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.830
 david understood what you have to leave 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.350
 with me to campaign you and your men and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 david answered here yes very well you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.300
 You will know what your servant Yaquis will do 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 to david therefore I will constitute you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.460
 guard of my person during all my 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.410
 already samuel had died and everything 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 Israel had regretted that they had 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 buried in his city branch and Saul had 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.969
 thrown from the earth to the enchantors 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.190
 and soothsayers gathered together as the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 Philistines and they came and camped in their 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.920
 nem and saul along with all israel and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.260
 they camped in Gilboa and when God still the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.170
 camp of the Philistines was afraid and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.079
 his heart was troubled greatly and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.329
 consulted Saul to Jehovah but Jehovah did not 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 answered neither by dreams nor by one nor 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.340
 by prophets 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.809
 then he still told his servants looking 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.239
 a woman who has a spirit of 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.030
 divination so that I go to her and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.310
 through her and I asked her servants 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 they replied that there is a woman here 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.440
 in indoor that has spirit of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.780
 divination and disguised saul and he put 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.240
 other dresses and he left with two men 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.490
 and they came to that woman by night and he 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.470
 he said I beg you to guess me it's because 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.200
 the spirit of divination and make me 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.110
 raise who I light and the woman 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.300
 he said here you know what has been done 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.060
 as he has cut off the earth from the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.800
 evocative and the fortune-tellers because 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.979
 you stumble my life to make me 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.710
 to die then I still swear by jehovah 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.159
 saying jehovah lives that no evil you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.429
 will come by this the woman then said to 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.020
 who will make you come and he answered make me 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.359
 come to samuel 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.789
 and seeing the woman to samuel cried out in 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.700
 speaker and that woman spoke to Saul 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.090
 saying why you cheated me because you 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.539
 you are still and the king told him do not fear that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.030
 you've seen and the woman responded to Saul I've 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.489
 seen gods rising from the earth he 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.830
 He told her what his form is and she 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.709
 answered an old man comes 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.989
 covered in a saul mantle then he 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.110
 he understood that he was samuel and humiliating the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.329
 face to land and he did great reverence and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.849
 samuel said to Saul because you have 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.400
 restless making me come and saul 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.829
 I answered, I am very distressed because 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.470
 Philistines fight against me and God has 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.170
 away from me and does not answer me anymore or 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.090
 by prophets nor by dreams 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.790
 this I have called you to declare me 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.130
 is what I have to do then 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.410
 samuel said and so you ask me 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.930
 if jehovah has departed from you and it is your 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.299
 enemy jehovah has done to you as he said 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.280
 average of me since jehovah has removed the 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.280
 kingdom of your hand and has given it to your 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.410
 fellow david like you do not see desist to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.650
 the voice of jehovah did not fulfill the ardor 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.319
 of 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.470
 with drama that's why jehovah has made you 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.000
 this today and jehovah will deliver to israel 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.939
 also with you in the hands of the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.610
 partiers and tomorrow you and be with me 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.290
 your children and jehovah will also deliver 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.010
 army of israel in the hand of the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.620
 Philistines then Saul fell ashore 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.930
 how great he was and he had great fear for 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.879
 the words of samuel and I was without 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.359
 forces because in all that day and 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.400
 that night he had not eaten bread 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:29.040
 then the woman came to Saul and seeing him 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.200
 greatly troubled he told him here 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.269
 that your servant has obeyed your voice and 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.730
 risked my life and I heard the 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.530
 words that you have told me I beg you 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.260
 so that you also hear the voice of your 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.239
 Servant I will put before you a mouthful 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.150
 of bread so that you eat so that 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.510
 build strength and follow your path and he 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.430
 He refused saying I will not eat but they persisted 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.150
 with him his servants together with the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.239
 woman and he disobeyed got up then 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.950
 from the floor and sat on a bed and 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.949
 that woman had in her house a 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.379
 fattened calf which he killed then and 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:07.349
 he took flour and the amazon and he took from it 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.810
 unleavened bread and brought it in front of 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.389
 Saul and his servants and after having 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.690
 eaten they got up and they left that 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.690
 night
