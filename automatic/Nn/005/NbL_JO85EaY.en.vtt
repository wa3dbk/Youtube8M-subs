 salt in the water inside the pan 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:58.500
 then we will keep 15-30 grams of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.759
 butter in the pan and we will keep the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.539
 our tall new wallet pan to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.499
 butter 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.250
 while our goal is engaged mischievous 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:13.900
 let's enjoy it to keep 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:18.100

 was in the hands to work the mass 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.650
 with hands since I trained but we go 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.190
 placing the mass is thus a surface 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.180
 baiano nizan and let's work the mass 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.180

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.040
 rested 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:55.090
 so let's inter 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:00.630
 each egg 1 is thus in the bowl with the mass 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.630
 and we will integrate to each egg the mass 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.290
 Let's mix it up, this is how I heard it. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.430

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.250
 the mass thus the hand in the investment 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.650
 big in the egg first or we will power 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:23.989
 have the second 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.989
 we give a mass attention so 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:34.710
 let's continue to integrate the games 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:37.740
 so to finish the games it has 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:46.620
 integrated the three games our mass is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:49.710
 Ready, it's got to be our car. 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.900
