00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
thing so there's no actual way to do

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.810 
thing so there's no actual way to do
these<00:00:49.989> except<00:00:50.410> just<00:00:50.590> running<00:00:50.949> straight<00:00:51.430> for

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
these except just running straight for

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.689 
the flag this is just a look at the even
individual<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.219> that's<00:00:54.340> probably<00:00:54.460> my

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
individual and that's probably my

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.549 
individual and that's probably my
favorite<00:00:55.059> one<00:00:55.180> so<00:00:55.600> pretty<00:00:56.170> much<00:00:56.289> how<00:00:56.469> do<00:00:56.530> you

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
favorite one so pretty much how do you

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.319 
favorite one so pretty much how do you
do<00:00:56.710> these<00:00:56.859> is<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.399> you<00:00:57.609> just<00:00:57.730> run<00:00:58.090> straight

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
do these is that you just run straight

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.020 
do these is that you just run straight
