00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and he's not done that was because I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
and he's not done that was because I
held<00:01:28.920> quite<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.159> few<00:01:29.340> footsteps<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.479> wasn't

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
to explain about they all know him again

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
to explain about they all know him again
able<00:01:45.299> say<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.710> teammate<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> front

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
able say you see one teammate in front

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.710

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
basically a fall in most cases and if

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.630

playing<00:01:53.939> cautiously<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.899> chances<00:01:55.350> are

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
playing cautiously the chances are

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520 
playing cautiously the chances are
you're<00:01:55.680> gonna<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> same<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:57.000> basically<00:01:57.600> by

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you're gonna do the same so basically by

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.709

that guy everyone note MF lose our team
a<00:02:00.810> day<00:02:00.960> off<00:02:01.219> chances<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.640> hall<00:02:02.759> teammate

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
a day off chances are the hall teammate

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179

would have followed them and that was
basically<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.880> thought<00:02:06.240> process<00:02:06.659> behind

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
