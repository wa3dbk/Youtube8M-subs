today<00:00:21.450> we're<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.690> to<00:00:21.750> talk<00:00:21.870> about<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.890> ops

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
today we're going to talk about the ops

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.170 
today we're going to talk about the ops
core<00:00:23.630> this<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:25.080> replica<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
core this is replica so we're going to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.300 
core this is replica so we're going to
compare<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> two<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:28.470> how<00:00:28.710> different<00:00:28.980> they

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
compare the two see how different they

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.560 
compare the two see how different they
are

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
are

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
are
and<00:00:30.810> then<00:00:31.680> we'll<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.040> there<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.430> let's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and then we'll go from there so let's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.119 
and then we'll go from there so let's
get<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.210> anyway<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.590> ops<00:00:34.830> core

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
get into it anyway this is the ops core

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.740 
get into it anyway this is the ops core
packaging<00:00:35.640> obviously<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.239> comes<00:00:36.330> in<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> box

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
packaging obviously it comes in a box

that operation manual yeah yeah this is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
that operation manual yeah yeah this is
probably<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> coolest<00:01:28.680> part<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.940> this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
probably the coolest part you get this

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.490 
probably the coolest part you get this
with<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.300> replica<00:01:30.660> tube<00:01:30.870> but<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.260> pads

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
with the replica tube but the pads

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.850 
with the replica tube but the pads
aren't<00:01:31.800> nearly<00:01:32.160> as<00:01:32.280> awesome<00:01:33.320> pads<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.530> here

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
aren't nearly as awesome pads in here

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.170 
aren't nearly as awesome pads in here
they're<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.370> cheap<00:01:38.370> I<00:01:38.550> guess<00:01:38.970> for

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
they're the kind of cheap I guess for

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.700 
they're the kind of cheap I guess for
lack<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.480> better<00:01:39.570> word<00:01:39.780> they're<00:01:40.380> they're

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
lack of a better word they're they're

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.510 
lack of a better word they're they're
not<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.510> soft<00:01:42.510> as<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.890> would<00:01:44.010> expect<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.400> to<00:01:44.430> be

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
not as soft as you would expect it to be

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.120 
not as soft as you would expect it to be
but<00:01:45.420> these<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.530> ones<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.830> are<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.010> the

but these the ones that are in the
helmet<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.480> more<00:01:48.750> give<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.710> write

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
fingers back up and you slowly see it

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.430 
fingers back up and you slowly see it
let<00:01:56.370> go<00:01:56.520> again<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:57.510> tons<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.810> extra<00:01:58.050> pads<00:01:58.260> in

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530 
once again the mount for the GoPro went
right<00:02:22.620> into<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.980> no<00:02:23.430> modification<00:02:24.210> I'll<00:02:24.390> go

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
right into it no modification I'll go

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.710 
right into it no modification I'll go
ahead<00:02:24.630> take<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:26.210> then<00:02:27.210> take<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.540> out

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
ahead take this out then take that out

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.230 
ahead take this out then take that out
you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.710> see<00:02:28.950> there's<00:02:29.130> no<00:02:29.430> modification<00:02:30.090> to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.120 
you can see there's no modification to
be<00:02:30.330> done<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> golf<00:02:31.680> score<00:02:31.920> just

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
be done to them on the golf score just

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.360 
be done to them on the golf score just
popped<00:02:32.370> right<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.760> there<00:02:32.940> no<00:02:33.210> issues<00:02:34.370> the

popped right in there no issues the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.510 
popped right in there no issues the
clasps<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:37.710> real<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.070> compared<00:02:38.460> the

clasps on the real one compared the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.730 
clasps on the real one compared the
other<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:38.820> they<00:02:39.780> feel<00:02:39.960> about<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> same<00:02:40.500> but

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
other one they feel about the same but

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.650 
other one they feel about the same but
it's<00:02:40.860> about<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.070> same<00:02:41.250> grade<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:42.209> plastic

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it's about the same grade the plastic

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.570 
it's about the same grade the plastic
really<00:02:42.870> isn't<00:02:43.020> much<00:02:43.260> different<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:44.160> it's

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
really isn't much different it's it's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.430 
really isn't much different it's it's
plastic<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.570> adjustments<00:02:46.080> are<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.230> same

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
plastic the adjustments are the same

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.800 
plastic the adjustments are the same
same<00:02:46.890> headlock<00:02:47.310> system<00:02:47.730> pulled<00:02:48.030> down<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.690> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
same headlock system pulled down and it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.810 
same headlock system pulled down and it
tightens<00:02:48.959> right<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:50.340> pull<00:02:50.520> up<00:02:50.640> pull

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
tightens right up so you pull up pull

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.210 
tightens right up so you pull up pull
down<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.180> adjust<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.860> like<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> was<00:02:53.040> saying

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
down and adjust to you like I was saying

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.640 
down and adjust to you like I was saying
earlier<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.940> padding<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.810> real<00:02:54.990> one<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.560> a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
earlier the padding in the real one is a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.910 
earlier the padding in the real one is a
lot<00:02:55.950> nicer<00:02:57.050> it's<00:02:58.050> like<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.350> memory<00:02:58.590> foam<00:02:58.709> was

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
lot nicer it's like that memory foam was

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.650 
lot nicer it's like that memory foam was
talking<00:02:59.160> about<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.910> tightening<00:03:00.240> system<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.630> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
talking about the tightening system is a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.960 
talking about the tightening system is a
lot<00:03:00.840> better<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.980> headlock<00:03:02.340> it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
lot better in this the the headlock it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.240 
lot better in this the the headlock it's
a<00:03:03.030> lot<00:03:03.180> better<00:03:03.390> than<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.470> replica<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.130> go

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
a lot better than in the replica so go

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.070 
a lot better than in the replica so go
figure<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.550> mean<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.209> replica<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.840> 50

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
figure I mean it's a replica for 50

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.270 
figure I mean it's a replica for 50
bucks<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:07.350> had<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> cut<00:03:07.740> corners<00:03:08.040> I

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
bucks they had to cut corners I

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.940 
bucks they had to cut corners I
understand<00:03:08.640> where<00:03:08.820> they<00:03:08.910> did<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:10.200> think

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
understand where they did it and think

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.070 
understand where they did it and think
the<00:03:11.130> plastic<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:11.820> feels<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.239> little<00:03:12.269> bit<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the plastic just feels a little bit a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.759 
the plastic just feels a little bit a
little<00:03:14.010> bit<00:03:14.130> thicker<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.000> base<00:03:15.150> jump<00:03:15.769> like

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
little bit thicker on the base jump like

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.020 
little bit thicker on the base jump like
I<00:03:16.860> said<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> base<00:03:17.430> jump<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.910> can

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
I said this is the base jump as you can

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.460 
I said this is the base jump as you can
tell<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.420> not<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> ballistic<00:03:19.140> version

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
tell this is not the ballistic version

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.380 
tell this is not the ballistic version
I'm<00:03:19.950> not<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.220> crazy<00:03:20.340> gonna<00:03:20.730> spend<00:03:20.880> 900<00:03:21.269> bucks

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
I'm not so crazy gonna spend 900 bucks

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.940 
I'm not so crazy gonna spend 900 bucks
on<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.920> ballistic<00:03:22.920> helmet<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.670> airsoft<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.950> but

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
on a ballistic helmet for airsoft so but

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.320 
on a ballistic helmet for airsoft so but
basically<00:03:26.220> that's<00:03:26.340> where<00:03:26.580> there's<00:03:26.820> guys<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
basically that's where there's guys I

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.000 
basically that's where there's guys I
mean<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:28.320> pretty<00:03:28.590> damn<00:03:28.739> close<00:03:28.920> to

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
mean it's it's pretty damn close to

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.310 
mean it's it's pretty damn close to
replicas<00:03:29.640> there's<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.600> couple<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.930> things<00:03:31.110> that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
replicas there's a couple of things that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.470 
replicas there's a couple of things that
stand<00:03:31.650> out<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:32.340> say<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.150> isn't<00:03:33.330> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
stand out that say this isn't the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.570 
stand out that say this isn't the
replica<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.200> real<00:03:34.320> deal

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
replica this is the real deal

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.539 
replica this is the real deal
besides<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.300> sticker<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.810> inside

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549

padding<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.730> head<00:03:38.880> lock<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> lot<00:03:39.540> nicer<00:03:40.160> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
padding the head lock is a lot nicer it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.180 
padding the head lock is a lot nicer it
