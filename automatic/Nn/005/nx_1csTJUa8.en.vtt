get<00:01:57.610> much<00:01:57.700> better<00:01:57.729> not<00:01:58.119> really<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.439> as<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.130> see

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
get much better not really so as you see

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.760 
get much better not really so as you see
look<00:02:00.549> at<00:02:00.609> the<00:02:00.700> match<00:02:00.880> that's<00:02:01.180> they're<00:02:01.770> pretty

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
look at the match that's they're pretty

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.359 
look at the match that's they're pretty
much<00:02:03.450> dominated<00:02:04.450> them<00:02:04.780> although<00:02:05.619> perhaps<00:02:06.009> a

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
much dominated them although perhaps a

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.679 
much dominated them although perhaps a
session<00:02:06.579> should<00:02:06.939> have<00:02:07.060> gone<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.240> bit<00:02:07.329> more<00:02:07.600> in

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
session should have gone a bit more in

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.560 
session should have gone a bit more in
my<00:02:07.780> favor<00:02:07.990> but<00:02:08.910> doesn't<00:02:09.910> really<00:02:09.940> matter<00:02:10.270> i<00:02:10.390> got

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
my favor but doesn't really matter i got

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.530 
my favor but doesn't really matter i got
the<00:02:10.660> tuna<00:02:10.959> one<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.410> then<00:02:12.310> now<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.150> have<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the tuna one and then now we have the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.149 
the tuna one and then now we have the
league<00:02:13.780> cup<00:02:14.019> match<00:02:14.230> against<00:02:14.769> lane<00:02:15.010> Orion

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
league cup match against lane Orion

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.410 
league cup match against lane Orion
the<00:02:17.159> one<00:02:17.280> thing<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.610> didn't<00:02:17.879> really<00:02:18.000> want<00:02:18.299> to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the one thing I didn't really want to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.180 
the one thing I didn't really want to
call<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.959> match<00:02:19.200> was<00:02:19.500> extra<00:02:19.980> time

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
call out this match was extra time

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.830 
call out this match was extra time
because<00:02:20.220> my<00:02:20.909> players<00:02:21.239> are<00:02:21.269> already<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.629> little

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
because my players are already a little

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.440 
because my players are already a little
bit<00:02:22.019> tired<00:02:22.230> from<00:02:22.470> playing<00:02:22.879> on<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.030> Saturday

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
bit tired from playing on the Saturday

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.000 
bit tired from playing on the Saturday
and<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.989> was<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.349> Wednesday<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> think

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and this was like the Wednesday I think

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.619 
and this was like the Wednesday I think
and<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.640> didn't<00:02:29.940> want<00:02:30.180> an<00:02:30.269> extra<00:02:30.510> time

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
and so I just didn't want an extra time

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.660 
and so I just didn't want an extra time
so<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.989> bought<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.799> my<00:02:31.890> full<00:02:32.099> strength<00:02:32.280> team

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
so I bought on my full strength team

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.380 
so I bought on my full strength team
with<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.060> hope<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:34.079> know<00:02:35.239> getting<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
with the hope of you know getting the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.530 
with the hope of you know getting the
job<00:02:36.629> done<00:02:36.659> basically<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.970> as<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.390> not

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
job done basically and as you see not

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.240 
job done basically and as you see not
many<00:02:39.629> chances<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.349> then<00:02:40.500> Taylor<00:02:40.920> gets

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
many chances and then Taylor gets

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.280 
many chances and then Taylor gets
injured<00:02:41.760> her<00:02:41.909> which<00:02:42.060> was<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.329> very

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
injured her which was a very

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.649 
injured her which was a very
disappointing<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.190> sort<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.659> disrupted

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
disappointing in that sort of disrupted

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.000 
disappointing in that sort of disrupted

after that and had a good couple of

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.300 
after that and had a good couple of
chances<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:58.410> there<00:02:58.620> didn't<00:02:59.099> quite

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
chances like that one there didn't quite

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.649 
chances like that one there didn't quite
get<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.730> off<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.459> can<00:03:02.609> see<00:03:02.640> here<00:03:03.150> i<00:03:03.359> go

a penalty in the 89th minute that's

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.449 
a penalty in the 89th minute that's
pretty<00:03:10.140> good<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:10.709> i<00:03:10.739> wasn't<00:03:11.129> too<00:03:11.250> bothered

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
pretty good it but i wasn't too bothered

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.759 
pretty good it but i wasn't too bothered
if<00:03:11.970> i<00:03:12.299> went<00:03:12.480> out<00:03:12.690> i<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:13.200> didn't<00:03:13.409> really<00:03:13.560> want

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
if i went out i just didn't really want

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.520 
if i went out i just didn't really want
an<00:03:13.829> extra<00:03:14.040> time<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:15.379> didn't<00:03:16.379> want<00:03:16.500> to

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
an extra time but I didn't want to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.460 
an extra time but I didn't want to
actually<00:03:16.650> well<00:03:16.980> Malik<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.519> but<00:03:18.030> never<00:03:18.299> mind

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
actually well Malik up but never mind

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.720 
actually well Malik up but never mind
actually<00:03:19.470> wait<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.680> minute<00:03:19.950> note<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.400> keeper

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
actually wait a minute note the keeper

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.620 
actually wait a minute note the keeper
same<00:03:21.000> set<00:03:21.329> so<00:03:21.930> yeah<00:03:22.769> we<00:03:23.099> do<00:03:23.280> head<00:03:23.549> into<00:03:24.030> extra

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
same set so yeah we do head into extra

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.680 
same set so yeah we do head into extra
time<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.669> then<00:03:26.669> it<00:03:27.150> was<00:03:27.269> actually<00:03:27.569> really

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
time and then it was actually really

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.900 
time and then it was actually really
good<00:03:27.870> save<00:03:28.139> there<00:03:28.169> I<00:03:28.620> figured<00:03:29.549> there<00:03:29.730> was

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
good save there I figured there was

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.270 
good save there I figured there was
always<00:03:30.359> go<00:03:30.569> left<00:03:30.840> ai<00:03:31.139> I<00:03:31.470> don't<00:03:31.680> know<00:03:31.769> why<00:03:31.950> they

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
always go left ai I don't know why they

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.250 
always go left ai I don't know why they
do<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.730> go<00:03:32.819> on<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.000> left<00:03:33.150> hand<00:03:33.299> side<00:03:33.389> but

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
do like to go on the left hand side but

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.110 
do like to go on the left hand side but
not<00:03:34.620> many<00:03:34.799> chances<00:03:35.069> in<00:03:35.340> extra<00:03:35.639> time<00:03:35.669> it's

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
not many chances in extra time it's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.520 
not many chances in extra time it's
pretty<00:03:36.329> poor<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:38.269> just<00:03:39.269> no<00:03:39.419> real<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:40.290> really

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
pretty poor and just no real not really

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.280 
pretty poor and just no real not really
clinical<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.160> from<00:03:41.370> both<00:03:41.519> teams<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.290> it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
clinical know from both teams and it

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.250 
clinical know from both teams and it
actually<00:03:43.530> ends<00:03:44.250> up<00:03:44.340> going<00:03:44.699> to<00:03:45.090> penalties<00:03:45.629> as

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
actually ends up going to penalties as

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.569 
actually ends up going to penalties as
well<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:49.319> went<00:03:49.500> all<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.889> way<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
well so it went all the way to the

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.599 
well so it went all the way to the
apparently<00:03:50.940> ruat<00:03:51.709> as<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.949> see<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.459> know<00:03:53.579> a

I didn't really create many chances and

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.270 
I didn't really create many chances and
I<00:06:25.509> hear<00:06:26.509> start<00:06:26.810> over<00:06:26.930> than<00:06:27.110> 42<00:06:27.680> thinking<00:06:28.099> that

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
I hear start over than 42 thinking that

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.209 
I hear start over than 42 thinking that
um<00:06:29.139> against<00:06:30.139> mankind<00:06:30.469> was<00:06:30.740> still<00:06:30.919> going<00:06:31.069> to<00:06:31.129> be

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
um against mankind was still going to be

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.020 
um against mankind was still going to be
an<00:06:31.310> income<00:06:31.639> and<00:06:31.849> then<00:06:32.000> it<00:06:32.750> went<00:06:32.930> we<00:06:33.530> bought<00:06:34.030> my

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
an income and then it went we bought my

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.519 
an income and then it went we bought my
graph<00:06:35.240> and<00:06:35.449> bolder<00:06:35.690> in<00:06:35.779> there<00:06:35.960> in<00:06:36.139> defensive

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
graph and bolder in there in defensive

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:37.839 
graph and bolder in there in defensive
midfield<00:06:36.860> and<00:06:37.099> therefore<00:06:37.430> that<00:06:37.550> would<00:06:37.699> work

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
midfield and therefore that would work

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.570 
midfield and therefore that would work
quite<00:06:38.090> well<00:06:38.120> but<00:06:38.449> we<00:06:39.379> didn't<00:06:39.680> create<00:06:39.949> really

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
quite well but we didn't create really

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.999 
quite well but we didn't create really
many<00:06:41.090> chances<00:06:41.360> at<00:06:41.599> also<00:06:42.199> fought<00:06:42.439> okay<00:06:42.710> change

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
many chances at also fought okay change

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.029 
many chances at also fought okay change
at<00:06:43.159> halftime<00:06:43.900> so<00:06:44.900> changed<00:06:45.259> I<00:06:45.319> think<00:06:45.560> to<00:06:45.680> a<00:06:45.710> four

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 
at halftime so changed I think to a four

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.519 
at halftime so changed I think to a four
four<00:06:46.279> two<00:06:46.490> and<00:06:46.729> then<00:06:47.509> I<00:06:47.539> end<00:06:47.900> up<00:06:47.990> suing<00:06:48.169> a

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 
four two and then I end up suing a

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:49.689 
four two and then I end up suing a
couple<00:06:48.830> of<00:06:48.919> a<00:06:48.979> plate<00:06:49.159> and<00:06:49.190> it<00:06:49.370> gets<00:06:49.490> back<00:06:49.669> to

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
couple of a plate and it gets back to

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.040 
couple of a plate and it gets back to
fall<00:06:50.060> until<00:06:50.270> two<00:06:50.539> anyway<00:06:51.400> but<00:06:52.810> real<00:06:53.810> like<00:06:54.020> a

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
fall until two anyway but real like a

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.959 
fall until two anyway but real like a

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090

goal<00:06:59.360> nice<00:07:00.169> effort<00:07:00.500> here<00:07:00.919> but<00:07:01.360> not<00:07:02.360> quite<00:07:02.599> good
