00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
way that I know of but that's pretty

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.370

instead of you know just a regular I

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.270 
instead of you know just a regular I
guess<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.350> can<00:04:08.470> take<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:08.770> part<00:04:09.100> off<00:04:09.220> and

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
guess you can take this part off and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.080 
guess you can take this part off and
just<00:04:09.700> have<00:04:10.690> them<00:04:11.550> basically<00:04:12.550> just<00:04:12.820> have<00:04:12.970> them
