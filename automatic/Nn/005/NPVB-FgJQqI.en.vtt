00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.970
 story and that will be eaten at the beginning of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.520
 Winter 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.810
 always the same thing a good earth 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.550
 sure worked well that's how we 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.679
 let's have to line up there for 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.979
 support her 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.409
 sowing you can notice this 

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:41.800
 line there which is also also a 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.300
 chicory that has more than two to three 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.449
 weeks there maybe go a little bit 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.499
 too early we can still week 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:54.339
 it's chicory sugar-bread water 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:56.819
 always the same operation realizes small 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:01.690
 flailing linke have something but 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:05.050
 very low depth of order the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.020
 two centimeters here are two lines 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.640
 realize we're going gets in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 so of course we love each other 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.560
 here 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.039
 so its mass is wide we do not have too much 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.200
 of seeds one seed every 3 4 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:31.700
 centimes was then we started it 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:36.670
 the bride and groom are gently covered 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.850
 but really very little very little land 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.060
 understand the fine earth we put 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.060
 above 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:53.030
 good actually a good little watering 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:58.750
 so it's a chicory and so to eat 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.340
 in preparation salad and it will be 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.330
 will start eating it around the month of 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.619
 November 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.950
 Here sugar loaf shape of 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.519
 tube species the salad and very and 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.480
 very stuck together 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.480
 the leaves are stuck between 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.130
 they vertically and what is well 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.030
 it is that in the east of Algeria it is very 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.069
 hardly and so we can eat it 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.680
 almost the end of the score 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.410
 of winter so you see I realize 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.620
 also my youth radish seeds 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.639
 a few radishes mounted here to do 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.019
 seeds 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.019
