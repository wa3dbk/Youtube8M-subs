00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620 
we're going to review it today so the
Tiran<00:00:22.560> groundside<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.220> basically<00:00:23.789> mass

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
Tiran groundside this basically mass

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.179 
Tiran groundside this basically mass
production<00:00:25.109> bad<00:00:25.920> guy<00:00:26.250> from<00:00:27.180> gonna<00:00:27.510> double<00:00:27.930> oh

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
production bad guy from gonna double oh

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
production bad guy from gonna double oh
it's<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.490> little<00:00:29.820> bit<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.330> Zaku<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
it's a little bit like the Zaku and that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.459 
it's a little bit like the Zaku and that
has<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> model<00:00:32.070> i<00:00:32.189> see<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.390> there<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
has a model i see that in there at the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.549 
has a model i see that in there at the
same<00:00:34.590> time<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:36.239> really<00:00:36.600> reminds<00:00:37.110> me<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
same time it just really reminds me of a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.030 
same time it just really reminds me of a
mobile<00:00:37.890> suit<00:00:38.100> leo<00:00:39.469> probably<00:00:40.469> cuz<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.739> green

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
mobile suit leo probably cuz it's green

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360 
mobile suit leo probably cuz it's green
and<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.640> simplistic<00:00:42.860> honestly<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.070> as

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and very simplistic honestly I think as

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
and very simplistic honestly I think as
aku<00:00:44.789> could<00:00:45.000> take<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.780> ground

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
aku could take it to your and ground

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.590 
aku could take it to your and ground
type<00:00:46.350> any<00:00:46.559> day<00:00:47.600> heck<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.590> quite<00:00:49.950> possible

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
type any day heck it's quite possible

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.170 
type any day heck it's quite possible
the<00:00:51.600> Robotech<00:00:52.230> destroyed<00:00:52.980> could<00:00:53.760> take<00:00:54.000> its

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the Robotech destroyed could take its

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.959 
the Robotech destroyed could take its
ear<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.570> ground<00:00:54.750> type<00:00:55.020> any<00:00:55.230> day<00:00:55.579> but<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ear and ground type any day but I'm just

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.410 
ear and ground type any day but I'm just
saying<00:00:57.800> it's<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:59.160> pretty<00:00:59.460> simplistic<00:00:59.940> on

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
saying it's it's pretty simplistic on

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
saying it's it's pretty simplistic on
them<00:01:00.539> double<00:01:00.809> O<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.109> totally<00:01:01.920> different<00:01:02.070> from

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
them double O is totally different from

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
them double O is totally different from
any<00:01:02.520> other<00:01:02.579> gundam<00:01:02.969> series<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.799> honestly<00:01:04.799> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
any other gundam series so honestly I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
any other gundam series so honestly I
lien<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.460> xeon<00:01:05.820> would<00:01:06.119> bat<00:01:06.330> an<00:01:06.360> eye<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
lien think xeon would bat an eye at this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.370 
lien think xeon would bat an eye at this
is<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.240> yeah<00:01:09.240> i<00:01:09.270> mean<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.780> looks<00:01:09.990> xeon

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
is they would yeah i mean it looks xeon

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490 
is they would yeah i mean it looks xeon
but<00:01:10.740> i<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:10.950> never<00:01:11.869> give<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> Zeon

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
but i would never give it to Zeon

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.460 
but i would never give it to Zeon
because<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:14.970> too<00:01:15.360> simplistic<00:01:15.840> it's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
because it's just too simplistic it's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.789 
because it's just too simplistic it's
got<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> chain<00:01:16.920> gun<00:01:17.360> that's<00:01:18.360> what's<00:01:18.570> cold<00:01:18.869> goes

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
got a chain gun that's what's cold goes

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
got a chain gun that's what's cold goes
on<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.250> harm<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.729> go<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.000> either<00:01:21.180> arm<00:01:21.780> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
on so harm it can go on either arm this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.170 
on so harm it can go on either arm this

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
open hands well of course this is a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.940 
open hands well of course this is a
Japanese<00:03:06.599> figure<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.109> we<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.349> two<00:03:07.560> closed

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
Japanese figure so we have two closed

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.089 
Japanese figure so we have two closed
hands<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.299> got<00:03:09.480> her<00:03:09.569> gun<00:03:09.780> hands<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.950> see

hands but we got her gun hands you see

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.020 
hands but we got her gun hands you see
that<00:03:11.280> he<00:03:11.670> has<00:03:11.819> two<00:03:12.209> gun<00:03:12.450> hands<00:03:12.689> and<00:03:12.900> for<00:03:13.349> what

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
that he has two gun hands and for what

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.750 
that he has two gun hands and for what
this<00:03:15.170> yeah<00:03:16.170> right<00:03:16.799> maybe<00:03:17.639> if<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:19.519> stick<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.549> in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this yeah right maybe if we stick it in

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.670 
this yeah right maybe if we stick it in
his<00:03:20.910> hand<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.389> but<00:03:21.840> we<00:03:21.930> all<00:03:22.079> know<00:03:22.349> from

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
his hand like that but we all know from

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.250 
his hand like that but we all know from
the<00:03:22.769> picture<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.730> goes<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.180> his<00:03:24.299> arm<00:03:24.599> so

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
the picture that it goes in his arm so

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.789 
the picture that it goes in his arm so
why<00:03:26.250> would<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.609> do<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:28.049> he<00:03:28.139> has<00:03:28.290> two<00:03:28.530> gun

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
why would you do that so he has two gun

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.129 
why would you do that so he has two gun
hands<00:03:29.159> with<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.699> extra<00:03:30.299> trigger<00:03:30.690> finger

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
hands with this extra trigger finger

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.289 
hands with this extra trigger finger
that<00:03:31.680> actually<00:03:31.949> gets<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.849> way<00:03:33.060> when

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
that actually gets in the way when

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.119 
that actually gets in the way when
you're<00:03:33.449> trying<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.780> put<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:33.959> melee<00:03:34.379> weapon<00:03:34.799> in

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
you're trying to put the melee weapon in

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.960 
you're trying to put the melee weapon in
you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.239> see<00:03:36.449> the<00:03:36.629> trigger<00:03:37.349> finger<00:03:37.709> later

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
you can see the trigger finger later

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.729 
you can see the trigger finger later
this<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:40.430> it's<00:03:41.430> not<00:03:41.639> a<00:03:41.669> big<00:03:42.000> deal<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.690> it's<00:03:43.590> an

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
this and it's not a big deal but it's an

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.689 
this and it's not a big deal but it's an
oversight<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:45.299> be<00:03:45.449> sure<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:46.919> band<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.400> just

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
oversight to be sure the band I just

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.839 
oversight to be sure the band I just
should<00:03:47.909> have<00:03:47.940> caught<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.829> think<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.729> gotta

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
should have caught I think so you gotta

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.990 
should have caught I think so you gotta
push<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.659> little<00:03:51.810> trigger<00:03:52.139> finger<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.680> there

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
push the little trigger finger in there

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.229 
push the little trigger finger in there
so<00:03:54.000> we'll<00:03:54.209> stay<00:03:54.829> that's<00:03:55.829> my<00:03:56.069> my<00:03:56.459> only<00:03:56.639> downside

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
so we'll stay that's my my only downside

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.689 
so we'll stay that's my my only downside
with<00:03:57.389> this<00:03:57.540> mobile<00:03:57.870> suit<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.859> head<00:03:59.069> does<00:03:59.310> not

with this mobile suit the head does not

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.409 
with this mobile suit the head does not
turn<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:01.109> backpack<00:04:01.590> does<00:04:01.799> not<00:04:01.979> come<00:04:02.159> off<00:04:02.419> the

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
turn the backpack does not come off the

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.920 
turn the backpack does not come off the
shield's<00:04:03.810> turn<00:04:04.159> most<00:04:05.159> of<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.430> way<00:04:05.579> actually

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
shield's turn most of the way actually

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.550 
shield's turn most of the way actually
360<00:04:06.930> degrees<00:04:07.379> if<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:08.069> do<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.370> right<00:04:08.519> arm<00:04:09.560> 360

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
360 degrees if you do it right arm 360

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.180 
360 degrees if you do it right arm 360
degrees<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:12.079> middle<00:04:13.079> arm<00:04:13.319> joint<00:04:13.590> has<00:04:13.889> one<00:04:14.099> of

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
degrees the middle arm joint has one of

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.370 
degrees the middle arm joint has one of
those<00:04:14.280> double<00:04:14.669> joints<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.870> lots<00:04:16.199> of

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
those double joints in it so lots of

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.620 
those double joints in it so lots of
flexibility<00:04:17.010> there<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.940> hands<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.389> ball

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
flexibility there the hands on a ball

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.319 
flexibility there the hands on a ball
joint<00:04:18.659> to<00:04:19.340> doesn't<00:04:20.340> just<00:04:20.489> go<00:04:20.609> ants<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.090> ball

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
joint to doesn't just go ants on a ball

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.330 
joint to doesn't just go ants on a ball
joint<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.930> turns<00:04:22.139> 360<00:04:22.830> degrees<00:04:23.310> and
