00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 Hello, today I want to give 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:23.390
 your attention knife boxing which i 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:28.170
 received by mail this already learned knife 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 kerambit but kerambit knife is a knife with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.460
 curved blade and sharpening as a rule 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.670
 from the inside 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.530
 usually these knives for life serve for 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.530
 serves for delivering secant strikes 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.539
 used in the Malayan archipelago then 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.079
 have a filipino take this knife I'll put in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.210
 every hand and with the help of these knives he 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.070
 climbs a palm tree behind coconuts then 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.700
 prayed for bananas instruction 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.320
 The instruction of this knife is interesting because 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.049
 his blade is curved 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.909
 his blade is curved and here it is 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.040
 ring on the back of the handles in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.320
 which can insert index 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.600
 finger, that is, when holding back like this 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.600
 there now 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:39.290
 but either a little finger with such a grip 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.910
 Well, but usually this kerambit is kept 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.870
 reverse grip and technology is calculated in 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.790
 mostly on a sekan blow and relocating 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.510
 well that can cut muscles or 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.820
 tendons 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.640
 tendon that is basically 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.880
 holding kerabit keep from knife like this 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.700
 thats what i can and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.229
 and my hands are free I can grab 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.620
 his opponent and well as they say 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.010
 threateningly and with this knife faction 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.280
 I think this is a powerful weapon that is 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.050
 principle i can hold it in my hand and when 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 this 5 cm of course well, so at least 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.160
 while holding some item here 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.310
 but that is, it will not drop anything but 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.310
 some kind of such here 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:48.970
 auxiliary weapons 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.970
 Well, but in principle, in principle, the thickness 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.970
 blade 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.970
 4 millimeters at the beginning is mixing 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.049
 already in the thinnest that is almost chesky 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.879
 a zero well here as it can be very 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.769
 on the inside and here it is 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:19.440
 such a hook is also pretty sharp 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:26.879
 but here is a wooden handle 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:36.420
 full length of the knife full length of the knife 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:43.239
 together with the handle 17 centimeters 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:45.519
 17 centimeters here but in principle here 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.709
 as such the length is not very worried about us and 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:53.140
 how much since it's crooked well here 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.549
 so here's an interesting knife 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.569
 let's see how he will cut like him 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.569
 will cut zdarovki 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.660
 they are so at least two pretty 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:18.769
 blunt molts pretty blunt 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:24.110
 Some but of course we will fix here 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:29.240
 here are some other hieroglyphs now from 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:34.310
 I can focus who knows what they are 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.660
 denote i don't know thats the same 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.660
 same hieroglyphs and on 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:44.540
 and we need here they need made of leather 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:49.760
 pretty good quality if such here 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:54.979
 rivet only thing only 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.310
 that in no way can this knife be well 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.950
 he does not have any clips anything I think that 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.200
 think of something that can be ironed 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.940
 his waistband and at least do here 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.410
 this hole so you can hang it 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.160
 there are years should background keeps 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.770
 great here but surely upset you 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.940
 that there is no clip to hang 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.750
 his belt stopper 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:22.300
 Well, somehow so all thanks for all 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.300
 attention all bye bye
