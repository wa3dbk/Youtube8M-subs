00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.439
 of information and we will also use 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.150
 this Tuesday video for the tutorial and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.470
 to explain some ways 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.750
 different we have of you from 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.519
 pigment in the eyes and in the rest of the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.550
 face so if you want to see how what 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.080
 I make you see in this video I'm going 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.090
 to count several ways to use the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.920
 pigments of different shapes in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.690
 face but let's start first with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.420
 the eye makeup we are going to prepare 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.309
 the eyelids with a pre-base the first 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 as we use pigment 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.030
 to use is going to be the basic this is a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 metal pigment make up store ' and has 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
 a color like old gold and we 're going to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.210
 apply to strokes all over the eyelid 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.730
 mobile and we blur we read the cut of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.199
 the banana if it creates a little complicated 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 the application of this product you can 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.579
 apply the typical glue tweeter that is a 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 prime specific for pigments that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 they are going very well we are going to mark the banana and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.339
 blur the cut with a brown shadow 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.740
 mate 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.530
 and we are going to apply a clear pigment 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.479
 a more subtle way to give it a little 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.479
 of lighting to cut the banana 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.729
 going up to the lacrimal and I warn you 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.859
 in advance that the pigments are 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.899
 shades with a very gray color gives a 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.700
 very curly finish then the deposit 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.039
 of makeup is going to have this used 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.619
 to give intensity in the external part 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.719
 in the external ub I will apply a 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.399
 black pigment and this same pigment what 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.859
 I'm going to use mixing it with make up plan 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.630
 friol and to create the eyeliner and what 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.959
 I will apply right up to the edge of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.399
 eyelashes up to just the limit of the eye and 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.060
 this is going to be the second form of 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.229
 use of the pigment added with a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.790
 product as the make up blend for 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.680
 create an eyeliner effect 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.020
 and we are going to blur the external part 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.150
 before continuing with the bottom 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.520
 of the makeup I'm going to apply a 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.010
 concealer to clean the lower area 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.800
 of the eye this will help us to create a 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.900
 polished finish and on the line 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.400
 lower I will do exactly what 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.380
 same as the top line I'm going to create 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.840
 the line of eyeliner with the mixture of 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.770
 pigment with the cable and I will add 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.650
 touches of gold pigment shadow 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.270
 'old I'm going to use the pigment again 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.830
 clearly we have used to apply the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.930
 banana to blur them and I'm going to 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.580
 Apply in the lacrimal area to 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.620
 open the look both up and down 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.959
 and I'm going to blur it well 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.209
 we emphasize the look applying a cold 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.090
 black on the top and bottom line of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.830
 water to intensify we trace the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.810
 tabs and we apply our mask 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.420
 favorite of tabs one of two layers 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.670
 I'm going to apply false eyelashes but 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.709
 before applying them I will do the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.870
 eyebrows to see how about the balance and 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.489
 then apply the eyebrows on the eyebrows 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.069
 as always is the option that you 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.769
 you need both intense or so light 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.709
 as you want, let's define a bit the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.799
 eyebrow applying the corrector right on the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.700
 bottom line flush for as I say 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.290
 leave a more polished finish we apply 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.450
 the eyelashes this is totally optional 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.250
 As always, I apply the lashes 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.640
 you have to apply it if you do not want to but 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.049
 It gives a much more dramatic effect to the look 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.120
 we go to the face we are going to apply a 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.489
 first we are going to do with our fingers in 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.349
 hands to warm it up and apply 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.480
 directly on the base that normally 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.220
 let's use and using the routine that 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.260
 we normally use the one that best 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.230
 go for your face your type of skin the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.349
 coverage the base that you apply 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.629
 and let's move on to apply a bit of 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.640
 loose powders to seal all the 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.470
 corrector and the base and applies what 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.849
 you need using the powders that you 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.370
 go well and in areas where 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.010
 you need in my case I'm going to go back 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.950
 volume to the face contouring and to 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.870
 that to use the harpo kit if you want 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.910
 make a specific control video 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.500
 near lighting give liters towards 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.720
 up and leave a comment and I will 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.150
 in this case apply a blush 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.400
 cream colored earth and we will apply 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.370
 the other way of using the pigment that is 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.019
 as an illuminator and we go for the last 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.150
 way of using the pigment I will 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.739
 use a champagne pigment and the same 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.230
 product that used previously of 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.450
 I'm going to create a paste to apply 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.370
 by all lips and once it dries 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.039
 will create a fixed base of brightness 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.289
 under any lip that does not go 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.600
 do not lose it if it's not sticky with a 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.680
 gloss is great good girls I hope that 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.570
