this page the purpose of this video so
just<00:01:14.939> press<00:01:15.090> next<00:01:15.689> ok<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.920> where<00:01:17.159> we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
just press next ok and this is where we

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.980 
just press next ok and this is where we
need<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> put<00:01:17.460> some<00:01:17.580> information<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.119> ok<00:01:18.900> I'm

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
need to put some information in ok I'm

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.999 
need to put some information in ok I'm
going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> change<00:01:19.320> unit<00:01:19.590> measurement<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
going to change unit measurement to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
going to change unit measurement to
millimeters<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> need<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.810> now

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
millimeters and what I need to do is now

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
millimeters and what I need to do is now
measure<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> label<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> correct

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
measure the label to get the correct

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.999 
measure the label to get the correct
sizes<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.150> region<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> screen

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
sizes so the region on the screen

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
sizes so the region on the screen
corresponds<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.490> label<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> printer

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
corresponds to the label in the printer

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.950 
corresponds to the label in the printer
so<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> dimensions<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.750> hand

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
so if you have the dimensions at hand

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.109 
so if you have the dimensions at hand
that's<00:01:34.229> great<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> do

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
that's great if not all you need to do

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.899 
that's great if not all you need to do
is<00:01:36.180> measure<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.470> make<00:01:38.250> sure<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.640> actually

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
is measure it but make sure to actually

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.810 
is measure it but make sure to actually
measure<00:01:39.090> label<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> backing<00:01:40.560> paper

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
measure label and not the backing paper

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.630 
measure label and not the backing paper
ok<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:41.880> give<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> moment<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:43.159> make<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.399> about

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
ok so give me a moment I make it about

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
ok so give me a moment I make it about
38<00:01:45.240> millimeters<00:01:45.720> by<00:01:46.590> 2<00:01:47.299> 15.5<00:01:48.299> okay<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.799> only

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
38 millimeters by 2 15.5 okay we only

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.679 
38 millimeters by 2 15.5 okay we only
really<00:01:50.399> need<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.670> change<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:50.970> margin<00:01:51.420> staff

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
really need to change this margin staff

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
really need to change this margin staff
if<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.530> actually<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.950> comes<00:01:53.310> printing

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
if when we actually do comes printing

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
if when we actually do comes printing
the<00:01:53.759> label<00:01:54.030> after<00:01:54.119> calibration<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:55.170> still<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the label after calibration it's still a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
the label after calibration it's still a
little<00:01:55.500> bit<00:01:55.619> off<00:01:55.770> center<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.340> cut<00:01:56.880> off

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
little bit off center a bit cut off

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
little bit off center a bit cut off
maybe<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> top<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> bottom<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
maybe at the top of the bottom but I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.639 
maybe at the top of the bottom but I
think<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> should<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.090> fine<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
think it should be fine for now and the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.249 
think it should be fine for now and the
row<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.159> labels<00:02:02.579> were<00:02:02.700> using<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:04.110> one

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
row of labels were using is just one

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.940 
row of labels were using is just one
column<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.710> row<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.310> that's<00:02:05.670> great<00:02:05.909> done<00:02:06.950> okay

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
column one row so that's great done okay

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.760 
column one row so that's great done okay
so<00:02:08.009> let's<00:02:08.369> start<00:02:08.610> designing<00:02:08.970> our<00:02:09.149> label<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
so let's start designing our label I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.350 
so let's start designing our label I
feel<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.979> making<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.370> label<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> food

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
feel like making a label for a food

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.160 
feel like making a label for a food
product

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

so<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.069> make<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:15.090> some<00:02:15.450> big

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so I'm going to make one for some big

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.890 
so I'm going to make one for some big
wall<00:02:16.230> tarts<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.030> put<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
wall tarts so we put that in there the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.630 
wall tarts so we put that in there the
text<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.200> fixed<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.130> won't<00:02:20.280> change

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640

this<00:02:21.510> area<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.110> field<00:02:22.319> will<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.500> constant<00:02:23.040> on

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
this area this field will be constant on

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.449 
this area this field will be constant on
the<00:02:23.280> labels<00:02:24.349> okay<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:25.980> also<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.370> the

only fonts that will come as standard

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.150 
only fonts that will come as standard
save<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.030> are<00:02:48.120> these<00:02:48.300> everyone's<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.709> for

save to it are these everyone's so for
the<00:02:50.370> purpose<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:50.910> let's<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:51.209> leave<00:02:51.420> it

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
the purpose of this let's just leave it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.600 
the purpose of this let's just leave it
like<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.690> keep<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.410> font<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.920> let's<00:02:53.430> make<00:02:53.580> a

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
like this keep the font so let's make a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.729 
like this keep the font so let's make a
little<00:02:53.760> bit<00:02:53.910> bigger<00:02:54.000> system<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> title<00:02:55.319> okay

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and okay right we also have the option

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.600 
and okay right we also have the option
I'll<00:03:01.799> just<00:03:01.980> show<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.130> what<00:03:02.280> looks<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:02.459> at

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
I'll just show you what looks like at

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.410 
I'll just show you what looks like at
the<00:03:02.670> moment<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:06.000> at<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.209> moment

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
the moment so this is it at the moment

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.600 
the moment so this is it at the moment
let's<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.170> down<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> little<00:03:07.590> bit<00:03:07.769> Jim<00:03:08.220> when

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
let's get down a little bit Jim when

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.080 
let's get down a little bit Jim when
it's<00:03:08.700> bright<00:03:09.000> red<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:10.170> means<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:11.069> text<00:03:11.850> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
it's bright red that means the text is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.620 
it's bright red that means the text is
still<00:03:12.209> too<00:03:12.569> big<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.110> fit<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.530> label<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.630> it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
still too big to fit on the label and it

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.330 
still too big to fit on the label and it
won't<00:03:15.870> print<00:03:16.459> okay<00:03:17.459> there<00:03:17.790> we<00:03:17.850> go

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
won't print okay there we go

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.220 
won't print okay there we go
think<00:03:20.340> how<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:21.239> doesn't<00:03:21.420> need<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.630> be<00:03:21.720> plural

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
think how that doesn't need to be plural

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.530 
think how that doesn't need to be plural
and<00:03:22.440> we're<00:03:23.220> also<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.549> option<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
and we're also this option just in the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.449 
and we're also this option just in the
font<00:03:24.870> hair<00:03:25.109> where<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.470> says<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.799> verse<00:03:25.859> if<00:03:26.400> you

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
font hair where it says in verse if you

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.000 
font hair where it says in verse if you
press<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.269> will<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.900> should<00:03:28.769> expect

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
press this it will I should expect

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.390 
press this it will I should expect
invert<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.549> colors<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.690> looks<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:30.989> this

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
invert the colors so it looks like this

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.860 
invert the colors so it looks like this
it's<00:03:32.400> can<00:03:32.670> be<00:03:32.760> useful<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> purpose

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
it's can be useful but for the purpose

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.840 
it's can be useful but for the purpose
of<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.470> don't<00:03:34.890> think<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.160> necessary<00:03:35.579> we

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
of this I don't think it's necessary we

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.390 
of this I don't think it's necessary we
also<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:37.200> some<00:03:37.410> options<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.040> down<00:03:38.160> here

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
also have some options up and down here

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.509 
also have some options up and down here
where<00:03:39.329> we<00:03:39.359> can<00:03:39.540> justify<00:03:40.019> things<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.220> we<00:03:41.370> can

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
where we can justify things so we can

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.880 
where we can justify things so we can
put<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.760> center<00:03:42.239> oh<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:43.170> just<00:03:43.200> justifies<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
put the center oh it just justifies it

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.740 
put the center oh it just justifies it
relative<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.340> up<00:03:44.549> stuff<00:03:44.940> where<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.150> young<00:03:45.269> label

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
relative to up stuff where a young label

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.380 
relative to up stuff where a young label
so<00:03:46.709> yeah<00:03:47.100> can't<00:03:47.609> redo<00:03:47.850> much<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.120> these<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.329> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
so yeah can't redo much of these in the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.990 
so yeah can't redo much of these in the
moment<00:03:48.690> we<00:03:49.620> also<00:03:49.799> have<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.220> option<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.640> rotate

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
moment we also have the option to rotate

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.479 
moment we also have the option to rotate
it<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:52.140> say<00:03:52.560> maybe<00:03:52.859> we<00:03:52.980> can't<00:03:53.190> fit<00:03:53.400> the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
it so say maybe we can't fit the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.190 
it so say maybe we can't fit the
information<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.209> way<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.810> we<00:03:54.900> need<00:03:55.049> to

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
information on this way and we need to

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.229 
information on this way and we need to
go<00:03:55.290> along<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.709> other<00:03:55.829> way<00:03:56.040> we<00:03:56.760> can<00:03:56.880> do<00:03:57.030> that

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
go along the other way we can do that

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.979 
go along the other way we can do that
which<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.810> fine<00:03:58.579> but<00:03:59.579> yeah<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.819> think<00:03:59.989> just

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
which is fine but yeah I think just

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.819 
which is fine but yeah I think just
leave<00:04:01.170> like<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:01.470> for<00:04:01.680> now<00:04:02.390> okay<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:04.650> think

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
leave like this for now okay and I think

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.949 
leave like this for now okay and I think
we<00:04:04.980> should<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:05.190> another<00:04:05.250> text<00:04:05.609> box<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.810> we

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
we should put another text box in so we

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.800 
we should put another text box in so we
can<00:04:07.109> click<00:04:07.829> on<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:07.980> drop<00:04:08.220> down<00:04:08.250> as<00:04:08.609> well<00:04:08.850> we

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
can click on the drop down as well we

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.809 
can click on the drop down as well we
can<00:04:09.989> choose<00:04:10.260> these<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.769> variable<00:04:11.190> text<00:04:11.400> so

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
can choose these the variable text so

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.220 
can choose these the variable text so
it's<00:04:12.180> just<00:04:12.299> a<00:04:12.389> little<00:04:12.569> shortcut<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.019> get<00:04:13.109> to

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
it's just a little shortcut to get to

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.770 
it's just a little shortcut to get to
them<00:04:13.380> but<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.340> think<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:15.090> for<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.329> field<00:04:15.600> at

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
them but I think just for this field at

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.659 
them but I think just for this field at
least<00:04:15.989> we<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:16.919> leave<00:04:17.039> it's<00:04:17.190> fixed<00:04:17.489> text

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
least we can just leave it's fixed text

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.300 
least we can just leave it's fixed text
so<00:04:18.630> let's<00:04:19.019> put<00:04:19.380> some<00:04:19.590> allergy<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.639> for

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
so let's put some allergy and for

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.940 
so let's put some allergy and for
here<00:04:23.639> so<00:04:24.639> it<00:04:24.850> contains<00:04:25.440> as<00:04:26.440> far<00:04:26.710> as<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:26.889> know

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
here so it contains as far as I know

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.290 
here so it contains as far as I know
eggs<00:04:28.980> milk<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.360> Alan's<00:04:32.130> great<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.370> for<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
eggs milk and Alan's great and for the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.810 
eggs milk and Alan's great and for the
sake<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.650> just<00:04:35.650> because<00:04:35.800> we<00:04:35.919> can<00:04:36.160> let's<00:04:36.669> change

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
sake of just because we can let's change

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.770 
sake of just because we can let's change
the<00:04:37.000> font<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.960> ever<00:04:38.169> CG<00:04:39.150> triumvirate<00:04:40.150> which

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
the font to is ever CG triumvirate which

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.730 
the font to is ever CG triumvirate which
is<00:04:40.960> quite<00:04:41.169> nice<00:04:41.320> one

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
is quite nice one

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.450 
is quite nice one
okay<00:04:43.889> great<00:04:45.360> bit<00:04:46.360> too<00:04:46.570> big<00:04:47.010> let's<00:04:48.010> scale<00:04:48.340> up

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
okay great bit too big let's scale up

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.560 
okay great bit too big let's scale up
that<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.639> little<00:04:48.880> bit<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:50.430> think<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:52.120> important

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
that a little bit I think it's important

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.240 
that a little bit I think it's important
knowledge<00:04:52.720> information<00:04:53.260> symbol<00:04:53.590> that's<00:04:53.980> fine

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
knowledge information symbol that's fine

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.830 
knowledge information symbol that's fine
right<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.680> finally<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:56.919> want<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.790> include<00:04:58.510> some

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
right and finally I want to include some

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.200 
right and finally I want to include some
variable<00:04:59.230> text<00:04:59.440> for<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.370> best<00:05:00.760> before<00:05:01.000> date

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
variable text for the best before date

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.370 
variable text for the best before date

fine I'll go over these other ones in

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.840 
fine I'll go over these other ones in
the<00:05:20.320> future<00:05:20.620> video<00:05:20.889> they're<00:05:21.580> all<00:05:21.669> pretty

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
the future video they're all pretty

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.780 
the future video they're all pretty
useful<00:05:22.680> okay<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:23.889> we've<00:05:24.340> got<00:05:24.490> lots<00:05:24.639> of

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
useful okay and we've got lots of

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.240 
useful okay and we've got lots of
options<00:05:24.910> for<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.870> format<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.710> date<00:05:26.950> I

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
options for the format of the date I

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.820 
options for the format of the date I
think<00:05:28.000> for<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.180> purpose<00:05:28.540> of<00:05:28.660> this<00:05:28.840> we<00:05:29.680> don't

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
think for the purpose of this we don't

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.159 
think for the purpose of this we don't
need<00:05:30.070> four<00:05:30.340> digits<00:05:30.760> in<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:30.970> year's<00:05:31.240> columns

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
need four digits in the year's columns

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.409 
need four digits in the year's columns
that's<00:05:32.440> fine<00:05:32.850> offset<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:33.910> date<00:05:34.090> by<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.240> couple

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
that's fine offset the date by a couple

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.180 
that's fine offset the date by a couple
of<00:05:34.540> days<00:05:34.720> because<00:05:35.080> I<00:05:35.260> like<00:05:35.470> my<00:05:35.620> bed<00:05:35.860> quarters

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
of days because I like my bed quarters

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.540 
of days because I like my bed quarters
nice<00:05:36.400> fresh<00:05:36.789> and<00:05:38.039> preview<00:05:39.039> well<00:05:39.190> look<00:05:39.400> like

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
nice fresh and preview well look like

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.050 
nice fresh and preview well look like
here<00:05:39.900> go<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:40.960> next<00:05:41.560> and<00:05:41.800> we<00:05:42.460> have<00:05:42.640> the<00:05:42.760> option

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
here go to next and we have the option

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.960 
here go to next and we have the option
of<00:05:43.120> putting<00:05:43.270> a<00:05:43.479> prefix<00:05:43.930> or<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.200> suffix<00:05:44.380> M<00:05:45.010> for

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
of putting a prefix or a suffix M for

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.700 
of putting a prefix or a suffix M for
the<00:05:46.030> purpose<00:05:46.330> of<00:05:46.419> this<00:05:46.600> I<00:05:46.840> think<00:05:46.930> having<00:05:47.620> a

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
the purpose of this I think having a

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.040 
the purpose of this I think having a
prefix<00:05:48.100> of<00:05:48.250> best-before<00:05:48.760> would<00:05:49.270> probably<00:05:49.900> be

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
prefix of best-before would probably be

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.200 
prefix of best-before would probably be
a<00:05:50.229> pretty<00:05:50.620> smile<00:05:51.010> I<00:05:51.039> there<00:05:51.400> when<00:05:52.060> you<00:05:52.120> put

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
a pretty smile I there when you put

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.670 
a pretty smile I there when you put
space<00:05:52.539> in<00:05:53.400> okay<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.640> there<00:05:54.850> we<00:05:54.910> go<00:05:55.090> and<00:05:55.560> if<00:05:56.560> we

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
space in okay and there we go and if we

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.010 
space in okay and there we go and if we
go<00:05:56.800> into<00:05:56.979> here<00:05:57.340> we<00:05:57.940> can<00:05:58.120> then<00:05:58.270> edit<00:05:58.450> it<00:05:58.720> we<00:05:58.870> can

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
go into here we can then edit it we can

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.800 
go into here we can then edit it we can
maybe<00:05:59.140> offset<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.710> by<00:05:59.860> let's<00:06:00.250> say<00:06:00.450> example<00:06:01.450> you

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
maybe offset it by let's say example you

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.930 
maybe offset it by let's say example you
know<00:06:01.870> three<00:06:02.229> days<00:06:02.380> and<00:06:02.800> you<00:06:03.490> can<00:06:03.700> see<00:06:03.850> it's
