00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.339 

and<00:03:57.239> yeah<00:03:58.270> so<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.599> just<00:03:58.840> think<00:03:58.959> these<00:03:59.140> things

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
and yeah so I just think these things

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.260 
and yeah so I just think these things
are<00:03:59.500> completely<00:03:59.680> bitching<00:04:00.459> we've<00:04:01.120> got<00:04:01.239> a

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
are completely bitching we've got a

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.650 
are completely bitching we've got a
really<00:04:01.540> cool<00:04:01.840> tone<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.800> then<00:04:03.730> they<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:04.300> I

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
really cool tone and then they just I

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.270 
really cool tone and then they just I
don't<00:04:04.989> know<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:05.200> its<00:04:05.349> own<00:04:05.500> entity

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
don't know it's its own entity

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.460 
don't know it's its own entity
I'm<00:04:07.060> glad<00:04:07.300> I<00:04:07.360> thought<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.900> stick<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.260> time

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
I'm glad I thought to stick the time

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.920 
I'm glad I thought to stick the time
bomb<00:04:08.739> on<00:04:08.950> there<00:04:09.190> because<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.520> really<00:04:09.690> lets<00:04:10.690> it

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
bomb on there because it really lets it

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.970 
bomb on there because it really lets it
hang<00:04:11.170> if<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.650> needs<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:12.660> King<00:04:13.660> B<00:04:13.810> guitars<00:04:14.200> relic
