00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.900 
planetary we're young embarking on a
crucial<00:03:29.890> training<00:03:30.220> flight

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.550 

almost<00:03:33.630> feels<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:33.990> you're<00:03:34.170> part<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
almost feels like you're part of the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:43.089 
almost feels like you're part of the
original<00:03:35.010> Star<00:03:35.310> Wars<00:03:35.340> doesn't<00:03:36.090> it

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.160 

mixing<00:03:43.879> a<00:03:43.939> little<00:03:44.060> bit<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.390> reality<00:03:44.930> with

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
mixing a little bit of the reality with

00:03:45.170 --> 00:04:04.569 
mixing a little bit of the reality with
the<00:03:45.939> the<00:03:46.939> CG<00:03:47.450> that's<00:03:48.110> great<00:04:02.260> yeah<00:04:03.340> no<00:04:04.340> we're

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
the the CG that's great yeah no we're

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.270 
the the CG that's great yeah no we're
doing<00:04:04.909> it<00:04:05.060> we<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:09.709> got<00:04:09.829> a<00:04:09.859> part<00:04:10.129> in<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
doing it we you got a part in the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.770 
doing it we you got a part in the
commentary<00:04:10.730> on<00:04:10.879> these<00:04:11.120> videos<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.670> just<00:04:13.780> suck

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
commentary on these videos I just suck

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.990 
commentary on these videos I just suck
at<00:04:14.959> talking<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:16.269> well<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:18.260> can<00:04:18.850> see<00:04:19.850> if

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
at talking and well you can see if

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.759 
at talking and well you can see if
that's<00:04:20.150> pretty<00:04:20.419> obvious<00:04:20.840> when<00:04:21.019> we<00:04:21.049> watch<00:04:21.560> his

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
that's pretty obvious when we watch his

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.210 
that's pretty obvious when we watch his
videos<00:04:25.690> we<00:04:26.690> let's<00:04:27.380> beat<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.680> cool<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.130> then

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
videos we let's beat the cool and then

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.280 
videos we let's beat the cool and then
go<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.550> right

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.780 

well<00:04:35.920> we're<00:04:36.070> making<00:04:36.340> a<00:04:36.400> sharp<00:04:36.670> left<00:04:38.670> all<00:04:39.670> right

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
well we're making a sharp left all right

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.100 
well we're making a sharp left all right
over<00:04:40.090> my<00:04:40.210> ass<00:04:42.180> hard<00:04:43.180> when<00:04:43.360> you're<00:04:43.510> doing<00:04:43.720> one

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
over my ass hard when you're doing one

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.530 
over my ass hard when you're doing one
hand<00:04:44.410> dude

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
hand dude

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.840 
hand dude
but<00:04:46.540> anyway<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.530> kind<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.770> an<00:04:47.860> idea<00:04:48.190> what<00:04:48.730> it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
but anyway it's kind of an idea what it

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.730 
but anyway it's kind of an idea what it
looks<00:04:49.120> like<00:04:51.270> kind<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.330> comparable<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:53.080> the

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
looks like kind of comparable to the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.620 
looks like kind of comparable to the
PlayStation<00:04:54.370> some<00:04:54.850> parts<00:04:55.120> look<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.480> little

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
PlayStation some parts look a little

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.380 
PlayStation some parts look a little
better<00:04:55.780> some<00:04:56.230> parts<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.620> little<00:04:56.860> worse<00:04:57.010> but

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
better some parts a little worse but

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.840 
better some parts a little worse but
anyway<00:04:58.980> put<00:04:59.980> up<00:05:00.070> another<00:05:00.310> bid<00:05:00.490> here<00:05:00.670> pretty

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
anyway put up another bid here pretty

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.020
