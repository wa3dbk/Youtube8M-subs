god that's horrible that's scary ok and
a<00:04:27.100> discussion<00:04:27.460> by<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.880> way<00:04:28.060> Joseph<00:04:28.389> Smith<00:04:28.810> was

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
a discussion by the way Joseph Smith was

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.020 
a discussion by the way Joseph Smith was
polygamists<00:04:29.530> but<00:04:30.160> I've<00:04:30.430> been<00:04:30.639> looking<00:04:30.880> for

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
polygamists but I've been looking for

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.060 
polygamists but I've been looking for
high<00:04:31.180> quality<00:04:31.210> counter<00:04:32.139> Mormon<00:04:32.470> apologetics

high quality counter Mormon apologetics

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.830 
high quality counter Mormon apologetics
