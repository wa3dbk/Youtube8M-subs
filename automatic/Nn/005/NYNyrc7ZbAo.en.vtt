00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
rub ice cream in a circular motion on

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.240 
rub ice cream in a circular motion on
the<00:00:32.669> disc<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.480> many<00:00:34.100> scientific<00:00:35.100> studies

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the disc now many scientific studies

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880 
the disc now many scientific studies
have<00:00:35.760> shown<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.110> rubbing<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> ice<00:00:37.440> cream<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
have shown that rubbing the ice cream in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.680 
have shown that rubbing the ice cream in
a<00:00:37.980> circular<00:00:38.250> motion<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.850> disc<00:00:39.149> will

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a circular motion on the disc will

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.750 
a circular motion on the disc will
actually<00:00:40.110> fill<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.980> impurities<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
actually fill in all impurities and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually fill in all impurities and
scratches<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> disc<00:00:42.809> well<00:00:43.649> let's<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
scratches on the disc well let's do a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.260 
scratches on the disc well let's do a
demo<00:00:45.890> now<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.160> take<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.670> ice<00:00:47.940> cream

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
to rub it in a nice circular motion

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.819 
to rub it in a nice circular motion
don't<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.320> that'll<00:00:55.710> just

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
don't go up and down that'll just

like that you're going to want to rub it
in<00:00:59.940> nice<00:01:00.449> circular<00:01:00.930> motion<00:01:01.469> for

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
in nice circular motion for

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.590 
in nice circular motion for
approximately<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.850> three<00:01:03.090> minutes<00:01:03.920> and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
approximately two to three minutes and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.429 
approximately two to three minutes and
then<00:01:06.600> after<00:01:07.320> rubbing<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.770> ice<00:01:07.950> cream<00:01:09.439> you're

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
then after rubbing an ice cream you're

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.859 
then after rubbing an ice cream you're
going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> take<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.549> freezer
