00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.660
 very good all my name is frames and 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.729
 Welcome to the call of duty cost today 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.610
 touch stories to not sleep part 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.700
 number 2 the first part you loved the 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.349
 truth is that there was a lot of jiji haha ​​in the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.450
 video not everything is very agree all 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.820
 with the same opinion all giving me the 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.040
 reason and it is something that I really 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.600
 was quite surprised so one watching 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.510
 the success of the first part I bring you 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.790
 the second part is a series where more 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.790
 or less say that they have done with the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.439
 caloric because they have changed so much and the 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.969
 why that change has not been good no 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.679
 because it is true that many people 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.059
 could change the call of duty and have it 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.239
 changed or is not the same as always 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.039
 they have changed it and my way of seeing what 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.260
 they have done wrong, not because you already know that 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.199
 this channel has always always always been 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.179
 focused on the rush in the rap in running 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.829
 run run and not stop hence the slogan 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.690
 that had the channel there the motto that 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.350
 has the channel in fact did not have if not 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.149
 has that is never stop at all the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.800
 battlefield as in the call of duty as 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.559
 the titan falls and in the end I get it to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.050
 upload when you go out for pc the game 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.000
 Finally, the channel will always be centered 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.300
 in that not in running running and not 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.980
 for 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.710
 never not here the camper is 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.630
 completely forbidden and is the subject 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.700
 main of this series not the camper 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.470
 ism the maps of camper ism health 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.660
 and all those kinds of things that they have done 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.970
 not in this new call of duty so 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.140
 good today I have an awesome song 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.480
 to talk about something that to me 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.400
 love because what I like the most 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.020
 youtube what I like the call of 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.900
 duty what I like most about the first 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.400
 person shooters are the mounts 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.320
 mounts is my thing my zinc leave what 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.950
 more I prefer not what I like the most 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.350
 that I enjoy the most what my eyes want 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.750
 not see every day and is the subject not 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.310
 the assemblies and as you see in this channel 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.540
 since it is the call of duty goes 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.390
 the assemblies has not been something so 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.310
 frequent not before we have warfare 3 in 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.500
 the black ops 2 in the black ops 1 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.450
 I proposed to myself I said today I'm going to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.340
 take out a montage I will upload a day 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.850
 touch said it on twitter and so what 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.220
 I did I took 15 14 clips and I went up a 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.250
 detail a date you already know consists of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.470
 start the day play whatever it is not and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.980
 take out clips and the clips that you take out 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.099
 on that day then v6 sunday touch 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.409
 in fact in 24 hours and it's something that I already 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.440
 I say modern warfare 3 plates 2 black ops 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.569
 1 If I proposed it, what did it happen? 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.220
 in the caloric or what has happened that is 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.069
 going because I can not do that no 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.599
 is you also bother me and I 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.090
 personally it bothers me because 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.160
 montages as I say is what is mine is it's 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.260
 my friend is not something I want to do is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.239
 something that I enjoy is something that both 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.510
 I enjoy seeing how doing as 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.400
 dt all that and for me the mounts is what 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.190
 better that is the subject is the word is the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.440
 topic of today and the caloric because it has not 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.510
 allowed that not before speaking a 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 little bit of youtube had my mounts 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.099
 a tremendous audience climbed aoptix 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.079
 they went up I know I do not know how many the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.790
 People always giving likes to people 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.980
 always apro is supporting the videos 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.190
 enjoying the flirtations with the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.319
 montages and since I got the first 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.940
 assembly of each one say if the second and 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.760
 the third one because the hearing in has not 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.549
 been like that, not because the assemblies are 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.129
 bad but partly because the clips have 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.190
 downgraded the clips that by the way 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.660
 I went up a montage undo high with shock and 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.190
 people people flip people 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.740
 loved go clips I do not know that I do not know 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.320
 how many I say I was thinking 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.270
 I say but that go clips of that uncle but 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.370
 yes this compared to the black ops 2 with 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.680
 the modern warfare 3 is nothing or if 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.080
 you compare a call of duty assembly 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.910
 goes mine the touch the dual touch that 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.640
 is a member of any assembly of mine what 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.270
 compare with the previous ones that I have in 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.670
 the channel are nothing or that is the levels 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.320
 of the clips are not at all similar 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.850
 us so much that what I did 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.370
 what we could and something came out 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.500
 cool you have to admit it but it's not 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.540
 enough and that many of you what 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.280
 you know many of you you notice and I 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.220
 I see it in the comments I see it in the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.260
 likes and I see it rightly I do not know because 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.120
 it's true because it has logical clips 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.500
 they are not so good with which to people 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.020
 it's not that he likes the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.120
 montages of the call of duty goes not yesterday 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.870
 for example upload a new assembly in my 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.730
 opinion was flippant and brutal and very 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.010
 level that I had in the white potosí 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.049
 in modern warfare 3 and people what 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.910
 he acknowledged he did not see it makes wafers go 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.790
 clips gave young battle has me 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.370
 surprised good music good I do not know what 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.170
 comments that I received before not but 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.880
 to receive those comments you have to 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.800
 be lucky to be very lucky and 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.590
 get some pretty pretty clips thing 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.730
 that in the black ops 2 early rises posters 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.210
 it was not luck simply 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.670
 was to meet respawn know spots 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.200
 and shoot well and have a tad of 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.550
 luck is clear that the people that you 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.920
 I touched in bad it was 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.200
 clueless or for any reason not 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.850
 they would have you or because you would have 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.480
 against spies in the air that those others 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.980
 themes 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.410
 there are no cons in this call of duty 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.960
 there is no spy plane with which to make 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.210
 clicks is it is difficult not if apart from that 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.210
 the maps are great if they take away the 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.510
 spy plane take away the contras pía and 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.550
 they take away the blackbird murube sat 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.200
 it happens that it makes some good clips because it is 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.940
 which is difficult or is difficult to 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.770
 cojones let's go I said we're not going to soften 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.470
 words is very difficult to have to 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.200
 have already tell you enough luck not so 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.170
 which is an issue that has bothered me 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.720
 enormously because they have taken away the 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.010
 part that I liked the most I have removed 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.530
 what he loved that are the assemblies 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.540
 and it's something that teams that are not going to 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.580
 recover not because they are not they are not 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.120
 able to cut the maps are not 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.010
 able to put them responsible or that 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.120
 everything is grasped 3t wings and the arms are 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.800
 great because all land war 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.120
 nine against nine all over the world and you 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.850
 finished not with that we solved the issue 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.830
 because people who do not roam and play 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.220
 well on land, the truth is 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.540
 that is enjoyed very much but good 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.730
 that's the subject of today's kids today 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.440
 I wanted to talk and touch a little bit a topic 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.960
 that for me the subject of 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.330
 the mounts something that I love something 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.280
 that they have taken me for that reason not for 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.310
 the reasons that said maps 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.230
 big bad respawn there's no beat there's no 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.390
 spy plane no counter spy you die 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.980
 two bullets and that's complicated 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.870
 but I hope it's good 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.480
 enjoy video kids we'll see you in 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.190
 the next stories to sleep part 3 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.690
 I imagine that had the week 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.220
 comes when I come up with the subject that 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.440
 There are many topics but if you have me 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.650
 to happen not so a greeting and up 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.650
 then
