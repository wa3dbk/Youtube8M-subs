just because it looks I didn't even care

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.180 
just because it looks I didn't even care
how<00:01:55.660> it<00:01:55.810> drove<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.170> just<00:01:56.350> adored<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.950> way<00:01:57.070> it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
how it drove I just adored the way it

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.920 
how it drove I just adored the way it
looked<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.390> wanted<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.690> for<00:01:58.810> that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
rear-wheel drive car and the different

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.449 
rear-wheel drive car and the different
handling<00:03:41.470> dynamics<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:42.010> come<00:03:42.250> with<00:03:42.430> that

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
handling dynamics that come with that

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.940 
handling dynamics that come with that
and<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.390> additional<00:03:43.720> driver<00:03:44.080> challenges

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
and the additional driver challenges

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.320 
and the additional driver challenges
that<00:03:45.070> come<00:03:45.280> with<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.459> instead<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:45.940> all-wheel

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
that come with that instead of all-wheel

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.170 
that come with that instead of all-wheel
drive<00:03:46.570> which<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.900> easy<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.470> safe<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.820> I

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
drive which is easy and safe and so I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.120 
drive which is easy and safe and so I
mentioned<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.840> s2000<00:03:50.470> how<00:03:50.560> much<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.800> love<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
mentioned the s2000 how much I love the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.400 
mentioned the s2000 how much I love the
s2000<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:51.850> why<00:03:52.000> did<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.239> just<00:03:52.390> buy<00:03:52.540> an<00:03:52.600> s2000

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
s2000 so why did I just buy an s2000

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.160 
s2000 so why did I just buy an s2000
years<00:03:54.040> ago<00:03:54.430> instead<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.600> why<00:03:55.750> don't<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:56.020> buy

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
years ago instead and why don't I buy

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.040 
years ago instead and why don't I buy
the<00:03:56.230> Mustang<00:03:56.709> GT<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:58.540> was<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.900> this

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
the Mustang GT and one was that this

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.870 
the Mustang GT and one was that this
gets<00:03:59.290> better<00:03:59.470> gas<00:03:59.770> mileage<00:03:59.830> which<00:04:00.520> is<00:04:00.670> always

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
gets better gas mileage which is always

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.570 
gets better gas mileage which is always
a<00:04:01.060> consideration<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.930> daily<00:04:02.260> driver

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
a consideration in a daily driver

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.160 
a consideration in a daily driver
another<00:04:03.580> reason<00:04:04.060> why<00:04:04.239> is<00:04:04.300> because<00:04:04.600> this<00:04:05.020> is

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
another reason why is because this is

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.890 
another reason why is because this is
more<00:04:05.410> practical<00:04:05.650> this<00:04:06.280> has

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
more practical this has

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.319 
more practical this has
a<00:04:06.989> usable<00:04:07.470> backseat<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.280> s2000<00:04:09.030> doesn't

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
a usable backseat that the s2000 doesn't

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.140 
a usable backseat that the s2000 doesn't
have<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:10.069> also<00:04:11.069> I'm<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.549> know<00:04:11.670> very

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
have and also I'm you know very

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.539 
have and also I'm you know very
interested<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.200> safety<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.860> car<00:04:14.129> and

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
interested in the safety of a car and

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.249 
interested in the safety of a car and
things<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.150> so<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.659> fact<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.079> this

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
things like that so the fact that this

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.740 
things like that so the fact that this
has<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:17.250> know<00:04:17.370> it's<00:04:17.549> engineered<00:04:18.150> by<00:04:18.269> Subaru

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
has you know it's engineered by Subaru

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.629 
has you know it's engineered by Subaru
which<00:04:18.930> means<00:04:19.139> it<00:04:19.199> has<00:04:19.320> super<00:04:19.739> reliability<00:04:20.519> it

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
which means it has super reliability it

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.090 
which means it has super reliability it
has<00:04:20.820> Subaru<00:04:21.299> safety<00:04:21.930> with<00:04:22.079> all<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.800> airbags

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
just you know being 10 years new where

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.760 
just you know being 10 years new where
it's<00:04:27.449> going<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.750> hold<00:04:27.900> up<00:04:28.080> better<00:04:28.289> in<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.500> crash

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
it's going to hold up better in a crash

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.689 
it's going to hold up better in a crash
than<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.840> 10<00:04:30.840> year<00:04:31.020> old<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.500> know<00:04:31.620> s2000<00:04:32.550> will

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.249 
good as the v10 does so the saying this
new<00:06:51.210> r8<00:06:51.449> is<00:06:51.569> just<00:06:51.690> going<00:06:51.780> to<00:06:51.840> be<00:06:51.960> a<00:06:51.990> smaller

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
new r8 is just going to be a smaller

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.230 
new r8 is just going to be a smaller
more<00:06:52.530> lightweight<00:06:52.830> version<00:06:53.520> of<00:06:53.639> the<00:06:53.789> car<00:06:54.000> and

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
more lightweight version of the car and

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.029 
more lightweight version of the car and
so<00:06:54.750> that<00:06:54.900> way<00:06:55.080> they'll<00:06:55.380> stop<00:06:55.590> at<00:06:55.770> our<00:06:55.889> gas

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
so that way they'll stop at our gas

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:57.290 
so that way they'll stop at our gas
mileage<00:06:56.580> but<00:06:56.729> they<00:06:56.819> can<00:06:56.940> still<00:06:57.030> keep<00:06:57.240> the

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
mileage but they can still keep the

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.920 
mileage but they can still keep the
awesome<00:06:57.690> engines<00:06:58.080> so<00:06:58.680> looking<00:06:59.310> forward<00:06:59.550> to

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
awesome engines so looking forward to

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.450 
awesome engines so looking forward to
the<00:07:00.930> final<00:07:01.259> design<00:07:01.560> for<00:07:01.590> that<00:07:01.860> I'm<00:07:02.130> sure<00:07:02.159> it's

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
the final design for that I'm sure it's

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.950 
the final design for that I'm sure it's
going<00:07:02.550> to<00:07:02.610> look<00:07:02.789> epic<00:07:03.180> it's<00:07:03.630> probably<00:07:03.870> going

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
going to look epic it's probably going

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.050 
going to look epic it's probably going
to<00:07:04.050> share<00:07:04.169> a<00:07:04.199> lot<00:07:04.409> of<00:07:04.440> the<00:07:05.340> same<00:07:05.580> engineering
