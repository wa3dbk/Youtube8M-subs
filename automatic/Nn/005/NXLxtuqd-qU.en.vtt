00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 I develop games with bare bottom 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.609
 photokina 2008 and the regulars' table 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:14.499
 really important cowardly department store yes super so we are who satisfied everything 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.239
 In time mobility gives that a bit hectic 

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.359
 have been 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.640
 everything worked fine 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.369
 and he was very nice and they also did what they could do today 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.909
 one more product 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.689
 Superlative he came from Sarah Chang kai-chen did everything super 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.689
 there's a report because everything knows it exactly and 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.370
 the whole thing works 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.040
 yes what we have here at the photokina our main product that way 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 imagine this is our 18 to 72 millimeter lens 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.380
 all men that so-called travel around 1 another iron in the eastern port 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.930
 Round brings to the market this will all 15 questions focal length range 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.740
 Have a sponsor 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.080
 «The only one worldwide» 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.210
 that's the absolute world record 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.870
 under additional the lens with image stabilization in it 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.630
 So that's it 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.930
 I think something percent 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 suddenly 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.610
 Topphoff to have the market alone I am sure I shut up 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.390
 Südzucker called ccs-technik brands like the Andes near 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.479
 in principle everywhere is less than the world record less sunny boy than 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.430
 actually just around 4% interest 15 times the zoom range, there is nowhere else 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.880
 the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.980
 and we are right here now 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.860
 for our beautiful caught the offensive defense 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.490
 yes there is now a bit of simulated what that means at all think 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.119
 I close 2 percent 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.470
 For a long time, the peak times resulted in the problem we have 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.040
 the picture blurs 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.200
 yes that is the vibration that you usually also in the hand 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.060
 according to Malle Percent, the picture is finally over 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.100
 Percent and gets and that we avoid with our image stabilizer 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.600
 but I see that every year should not be new 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.390
 Interestingly turned off with the buttons »says something really exciting 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.240
 happened here 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.299
 so m 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.470
 this unity on the day of the report will lead us to show the people 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.719
 Here you can with picture stabilizer so the mighty 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.719
 Turn on serving what the comrades is out kicking the camera 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.760
 «I say it can be done right Dr 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.210
 The popular now simulates 8 percent in an extreme way 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.469
 the percent 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.309
 Percent the vibration is so extreme you will usually never have 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.819
 after that, but six o'clock in the morning, marches are also a mine 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.719
 and now the album "Band of the Best Stuff we Saw series" 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.599
 and then you just look like beer and will be the picture but then you broke in 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.149
 a wall off 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.319
 while keeping it on the market so also in the duty 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.429
 that's what she wants 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.329
 Seabass the image stabilizer 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.269
 but balanced 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.349
 Lars Bube Action «mittelstandsbauchs» 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.249
 that would have also without presence 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.559
 what do you want more 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.609
 exactly introduce the chefs 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.739
 yes, but the Werder-defense and unreal 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.739
 to explain to acquaintances 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.259
 Basically, this situation favors that percent of the picture here 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.030
 it is static so that's completely normal behavior 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.409
 Norway 27 for example would be 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.849
 Annual car increases 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.219
 as soon as a vibration comes into play 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.619
 the object is of course back and forth 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.309
 thereby 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:23.519
 the beam of light will give the lucky side percent and who that 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.519
 basically the market 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.389
 the image stabilizer just does the following, we see that in the middle 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.779
 orange 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:34.919
 Element here 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.370
 The image stabilizer makes the following earthquake easy way into the 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.269
 opposite way to go the set direction 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.269
 so that he gets the beam back to the point exactly 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.329
 put resistant from approx 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.169
 be compensated 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.169
 Porsche is fighting 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.319
 yes that was pretty good here in the graphics 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.319
 the external officiate 2 before the Russians so the two 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.879
 NRW can capture Robben &amp; Co's attorneys' train or vibrations 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.379
 and employees 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.690
 These in turn control Beatrice's three-axis spray system 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.489
 there is simply introduced to electricity this stream of controls then becomes 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.099
 Isfort element 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.709
 he thinks that the moving elements sit there we stay tuned 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.830
 and they're practically already on the go 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.900
 there and everything given 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.900
 controlled important percent on that the whole on 3 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.439
 that is it now 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.439
 so played against each other 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 Bests 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.439
 he therefore very much liked this friction 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.059
 that is not more than that 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:49.090
 Photo SW 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.509
 that's why the sidewalk is very fast 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.550
 drive it 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.240
 for all the work 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 has met 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.770
 we do not give a nakedness 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.990
 Card Guard 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.699
 absolutely wait 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.699
 that's exactly what's going on all the time 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.490
 You could actually be Japan 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.490
 it is also in 2 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.360
 splendid shipment 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.169
 Excel "At the moment we have Elvis on the new it is 270 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.520
 that has always been 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.669
 until now have selected 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.439
 We always gladly welcome the author 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.439
 Time so that we have a typical in practice situations 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.169
 Gorelik light is so tiny that it's only 15 seconds past 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.850
 that one time it is a shrine of the picture that stabilizes the picture 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.849
 and here's the screen is was turned on 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
 FC Heidenheim active rank 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.349
 maybe he is right 1 no 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.860
 we have done that and after the backlog we have everything usable in the 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.279
 Situation Room only 1 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.999
 per situation in the country Taleb Rifai percentage range is important to us 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:31.199
 History because the relatives or word is very strong 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.279
 it is a 2 1 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:38.409
 Basically, the hamburger is getting smarter 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.279
 completely off 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.050
 it was specially on 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.580
 only a few have given 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.139
 At the rear, Takyi Naki is different 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.810
 so here still so subject matter images that also so far Lazio is still 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.009
 take years without a marketing situation 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.520
 and just stabilized the picture 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 a very nice picture here also Basel that is of course annoying 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.360
 He did not name one 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.659
 Aareal Bank also water because it was 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.499
 that is very nice that he is really a very nice mood 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.080
 It was Klaus Sturm 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.199
 And you can finally see it from the sixth victory and you're over 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:14.809
 that's it 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:15.939
 already madness 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:18.939
 Fearing for her own has the first win after a good one 

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:23.199
 So I am myself 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.909
 enthusiastic photographer 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.599
 I have to say the area partly right 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:31.599
 Constance 

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:37.259
 a good sound 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:40.259
 you learned earlier 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:43.680
 the majority out 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.069
 I think about the currently rampant type
