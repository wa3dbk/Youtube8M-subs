00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.099 

one<00:00:34.820> of<00:00:34.909> our<00:00:34.999> big<00:00:35.179> design<00:00:35.510> goals<00:00:35.749> for<00:00:35.929> years

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
Baird judgment is actually kind of

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.100 
Baird judgment is actually kind of
unique<00:01:14.209> in<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.539> gears<00:01:14.750> of<00:01:14.840> war<00:01:14.929> franchise

unique in the gears of war franchise

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.380 
unique in the gears of war franchise
because<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.830> has<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.250> different<00:01:16.970> style<00:01:17.030> of

because it has a different style of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.029 
because it has a different style of
gameplay<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:17.990> not<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.289> sort<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.530> scripted

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
gameplay it's not the sort of scripted

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.859 
gameplay it's not the sort of scripted
cinematic<00:01:19.610> way<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:19.909> we<00:01:20.000> played<00:01:20.240> gig<00:01:20.479> one<00:01:20.720> two

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
cinematic way that we played gig one two

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.139 
cinematic way that we played gig one two
and<00:01:20.990> three<00:01:21.229> there's<00:01:21.649> a<00:01:21.740> lot<00:01:21.890> more<00:01:21.920> open<00:01:22.549> and

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
and three there's a lot more open and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.760 
and three there's a lot more open and
it's<00:01:23.509> actually<00:01:23.630> because<00:01:24.049> of<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:24.289> openness

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's actually because of this openness

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.350 
it's actually because of this openness
it's<00:01:24.950> got<00:01:25.039> a<00:01:25.069> really<00:01:25.340> high<00:01:25.580> replayability<00:01:26.090> as

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
it's got a really high replayability as

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.449 
it's got a really high replayability as
well<00:01:26.539> and<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:27.259> a<00:01:27.440> it's<00:01:27.709> a<00:01:27.830> twist<00:01:28.159> on<00:01:28.340> the
