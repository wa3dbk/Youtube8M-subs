throughout the game I thought at times
Dallas<00:02:09.989> played<00:02:10.170> way<00:02:10.440> better<00:02:10.470> than<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> Giants

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
Dallas played way better than the Giants

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.570 
Dallas played way better than the Giants
and<00:02:11.489> way<00:02:11.970> worse<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.840> Giants

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
and way worse the Giants

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.360 
and way worse the Giants
to<00:02:13.640> consistent<00:02:14.240> kept<00:02:14.690> attacking<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.410> ended

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
