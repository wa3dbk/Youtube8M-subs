00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 and 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.520
 no 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.470
 it's up to all these fishermen to 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.270
 a new video 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.000
 so this is going to be a video 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.200
 explanatory on what to do in the winter we go 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.720
 say between the closing of the pike and 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 the opening of the trout and a video on 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.430
 will tell our projects in 2014 on our 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.020
 chain so we start with what to do 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.309
 between the opening of the group years to the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.760
 pike closure the virtuous to 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.620
 trout 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.970
 so for me what has to do is to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.180
 prepare your say it's cannes for the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.450
 28 or new york of the project it was said in 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.650
 these boxes give up their missing go 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.610
 see on the internet a little bit 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.610
 novelties all that 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.690
 for lungs mines and oils and 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.970
 a little bit of oil 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.910

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.100
 white with a simple technique 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.590
 which is to take a simple accent 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.990
 number 10 under when you see a little 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.860
 bigger if you tick if you are 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.390
 only who is really big fish 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.320
 for I just what you can 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 fell on a map know that with a 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.490
 olivette sliding 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.190
 so I'm coming to a video that made 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 there is a lot of time this video is 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.170
 a channel but it works everywhere 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 finally by nodding years lived lived 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.350
 lamarche stone from everywhere so this 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.090

 a little bit and enemies all this is 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.759
 so here we will talk about our 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.200
 projects a lot of projects in 2014 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.280
 of one we will try to do a series 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.620
 that will apply to May 13 dedicated series 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.980
 to predators we will try to do 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.430
 we'll try to find others 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.980
 people 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.840

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.980

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.650
 problem you see even moment nothing 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.410
 but only on youtube and rumes 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.510
 would give the email address after we go 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.830
 do a contest not having what we 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.040
 can call it a fishing contest between 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.560
 we therefore a contest in two pairs 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.030
 teams of four teams of two so 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.770
 we will be hoping 8 hoping 8 to fish 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.010
 or there in a small pond and that that's a 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.840
 good video on his title that fun what 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.980
 that changes 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.459
 after the opening of the trout 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.010
 plugged gaps we have this to see more than 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.260
 explanatory videos too that's going to be 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.400
 well we have them before detailing all 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.099
 our videos 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.890
 better to do more tutorials what 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.390
 especially after that we will make a big 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.980
 video about horse fishing 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.010
 so here on this video you are 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.079
 will explain all the fishing from sprint a to z 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.069
 so the techniques the canes he 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:29.340
 fly fly or ask them 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.000

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.879
 abaca natural baits death on normani at 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.819
 alive we really will show everything and 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:42.329
 after as usual and videos 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:46.290
 his obsession with normal fishing so if 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.510
 I could hide cases that their name goes fast 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.840
 does I show you the rumors that we 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.319
 are thrown away so I bought myself 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:00.420
 rieffel fairy chad berkeley in cm very 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:04.290
 good there after for plague hide his cow 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.530
 who laughs the unknown time that makes these 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.530
 results 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:17.789
 after we have smaller size have 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.910
 rated ilex surduts of Chad media in the 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.580
 years 2.8 inches very good time we go 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.320
 to pass as worried as I believe 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.620
 I'm not sure I think that worry 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.680
 because you will not say fulfilling group 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.470
 there we see maybe not very well but 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.930
 I think it's quality and price 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.460
 in swimmers I let go of 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.810

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.789
