basically<00:01:53.159> ensures<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.180> embossing

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
basically ensures that the embossing

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.840 
basically ensures that the embossing
powder<00:01:54.869> only<00:01:55.350> sticks<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> your<00:01:56.009> Versamark<00:01:56.640> ink

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
powder only sticks to your Versamark ink

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550 
powder only sticks to your Versamark ink
so<00:01:57.420> i'll<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.689> ahead<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.899> rub<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.530> over

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so i'll go ahead and rub that all over

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.179 
so i'll go ahead and rub that all over
the<00:01:58.920> tag<00:02:00.079> to<00:02:01.079> begin<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> pretty

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the tag to begin with this is a pretty

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.560 
the tag to begin with this is a pretty
important<00:02:02.670> step<00:02:02.909> when<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.210> using<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
important step when you're using a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.810 
important step when you're using a
background<00:02:04.110> stamp<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.710> emboss<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.250> just

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
background stamp to emboss with just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.039 
background stamp to emboss with just
because<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.509> nice<00:02:06.719> clean

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
because you want to have nice clean

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.240 
because you want to have nice clean
lines<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> don't<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> have

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
lines and you don't want to have

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
lines and you don't want to have
embossing<00:02:08.550> powder<00:02:08.879> everywhere<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
embossing powder everywhere so I like to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.949 
embossing powder everywhere so I like to
lay<00:02:10.770> my<00:02:11.069> background<00:02:11.670> stamps<00:02:12.150> flat<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.629> my<00:02:12.660> work

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
lay my background stamps flat on my work

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.700 
lay my background stamps flat on my work
surface<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.500> don't

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
surface I don't

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.950 
surface I don't
have<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> block<00:02:14.160> big<00:02:14.490> enough<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.600> apply

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
have a block big enough so I just apply

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.400 
have a block big enough so I just apply
the<00:02:16.020> ink<00:02:16.440> directly<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.300> stamp<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.380> I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the ink directly to the stamp and then I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.970 
the ink directly to the stamp and then I
will<00:02:19.740> lay<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.310> tag<00:02:20.940> face<00:02:21.840> down<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.500> top<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
will lay the tag face down on top of the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.030 
will lay the tag face down on top of the
stamp<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:24.120> which<00:02:24.420> point<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.870> will<00:02:24.900> use<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.560> piece

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
stamp at which point I will use a piece

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.220 
stamp at which point I will use a piece
of<00:02:26.070> scratch<00:02:26.490> paper<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:27.000> my<00:02:27.180> hand<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.720> make<00:02:28.110> sure

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
of scratch paper in my hand to make sure

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.080 
of scratch paper in my hand to make sure
I<00:02:28.290> get<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.470> nice<00:02:28.680> even<00:02:28.890> impression<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:29.820> if<00:02:29.970> you

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
I get a nice even impression but if you

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.610 
I get a nice even impression but if you
have<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> brayer<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> perfect<00:02:31.440> time

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
have a brayer this is the perfect time

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.950 
have a brayer this is the perfect time
to<00:02:31.860> use<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.310> don't<00:02:32.520> have<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.330> just

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
to use it I don't have one so I just

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.810 
to use it I don't have one so I just
make<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.440> you'll<00:02:35.010> also<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.670> make<00:02:35.760> sure

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
make do you'll also want to make sure

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.030 
make do you'll also want to make sure
that<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.270> give<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:37.080> good<00:02:37.470> bit<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> pressure

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that you give a good bit of pressure

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.910 
that you give a good bit of pressure
around<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.760> reinforcer<00:02:39.540> because<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:40.860> a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
around that reinforcer because it's a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.080 
around that reinforcer because it's a
little<00:02:41.130> bit<00:02:41.220> thicker<00:02:41.460> than<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.700> rest<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
little bit thicker than the rest of the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
little bit thicker than the rest of the
tag<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.900> don't<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.250> little

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
tag and if you don't it can get a little

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.340 
tag and if you don't it can get a little
monkey<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:44.940> area<00:02:45.210> won't<00:02:45.600> pick<00:02:45.810> up<00:02:45.960> the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
monkey in that area won't pick up the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.230 
monkey in that area won't pick up the
ink<00:02:47.160> as<00:02:47.370> well<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.850> just<00:02:47.970> want<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.150> make

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
ink as well so you just want to make

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.620 
ink as well so you just want to make
sure<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.690> give<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> little<00:02:49.800> extra

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
sure that you give it a little extra

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.230 
sure that you give it a little extra
attention<00:02:51.630> there<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.700> I'm<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.120> my

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
attention there and I'm going to get my

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120 
attention there and I'm going to get my
bossing<00:02:54.630> powder<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.350> i'm<00:02:55.530> using<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
bossing powder for this i'm using the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.760 
bossing powder for this i'm using the
recollections<00:02:56.970> tinsel<00:02:57.930> gold<00:02:58.320> embossing

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
recollections tinsel gold embossing

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.460 
recollections tinsel gold embossing
powder<00:02:59.160> it's<00:02:59.820> great<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.390> kind<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.020> glittery

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
powder it's great it's kind of glittery

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.710 
powder it's great it's kind of glittery
but<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.760> better<00:03:02.970> than<00:03:03.060> any<00:03:03.360> glitter

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
but it's better than any glitter

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360 
but it's better than any glitter
embossing<00:03:03.930> powder<00:03:04.470> I've<00:03:04.590> ever<00:03:04.770> used<00:03:05.100> because

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
embossing powder I've ever used because

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.810 
embossing powder I've ever used because
it<00:03:05.580> actually<00:03:05.760> stays<00:03:06.270> on<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.800> guess<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
it actually stays on it I guess the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.040 
it actually stays on it I guess the
ratio<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.210> different<00:03:09.660> there's<00:03:09.810> more

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
ratio is different there's more

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.720 
ratio is different there's more
embossing<00:03:10.260> powder<00:03:10.680> than<00:03:10.920> glitter<00:03:11.160> maybe<00:03:11.430> so

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
embossing powder than glitter maybe so

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.580 
embossing powder than glitter maybe so
it<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.210> really<00:03:12.630> doesn't<00:03:13.020> flake<00:03:13.380> off

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it it really doesn't flake off

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.040 
it it really doesn't flake off
everywhere<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.610> keeps<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.540> my<00:03:15.720> shimmery

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
everywhere and it keeps that my shimmery

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.590 
everywhere and it keeps that my shimmery
look<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.460> just<00:03:17.760> store<00:03:18.150> mine<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.480> these

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
look to it I just store mine in these

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.820 
look to it I just store mine in these
little<00:03:18.750> Tupperware<00:03:19.200> containers<00:03:19.650> with<00:03:19.800> a

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
little Tupperware containers with a

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.400 
little Tupperware containers with a
plastic<00:03:20.100> spoon<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:21.450> ones<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.840> use<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
plastic spoon the ones that I use the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.320 
plastic spoon the ones that I use the
most<00:03:22.560> frequently<00:03:23.250> not<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.030> my<00:03:24.150> embossing

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
most frequently not all of my embossing

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.450 
most frequently not all of my embossing
powder<00:03:24.690> stored<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.170> way<00:03:25.320> but<00:03:25.920> since<00:03:26.310> I've

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
powder stored this way but since I've

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.760 
powder stored this way but since I've
been<00:03:26.790> making<00:03:26.940> all<00:03:27.180> these<00:03:27.360> tags<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.620> makes

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
been making all these tags it just makes

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.870 
been making all these tags it just makes
it<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:28.950> much<00:03:29.100> easier<00:03:29.190> because<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.760> just

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
it so much easier because you can just

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.570 
it so much easier because you can just
flick<00:03:30.480> any<00:03:30.720> excess<00:03:31.230> off<00:03:31.440> right<00:03:31.770> back<00:03:32.130> into<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
flick any excess off right back into the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.070 
flick any excess off right back into the
container<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.630> don't<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.930> worry

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
container and you don't have to worry

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.350 
container and you don't have to worry
about<00:03:34.200> trying<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.500> get<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.740> back<00:03:34.920> into<00:03:35.100> its

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
about trying to get it back into its

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.780 
about trying to get it back into its
original<00:03:36.360> packaging<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.770> now<00:03:38.100> I'm<00:03:38.220> going<00:03:38.580> to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
original packaging so now I'm going to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.300 
original packaging so now I'm going to
heat<00:03:39.270> set<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.740> if<00:03:40.830> you're<00:03:40.950> unfamiliar

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
heat set this so if you're unfamiliar

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.650 
heat set this so if you're unfamiliar
with<00:03:41.370> embossing<00:03:41.760> you'll<00:03:42.060> need<00:03:42.210> some<00:03:42.390> sort<00:03:42.570> of

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
with embossing you'll need some sort of

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.560 
with embossing you'll need some sort of
heat<00:03:42.990> tool<00:03:43.640> Ranger<00:03:44.640> makes<00:03:44.850> one<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.180> one's<00:03:45.390> by

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
heat tool Ranger makes one this one's by

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.960 
heat tool Ranger makes one this one's by
Milwaukee<00:03:46.070> I'm<00:03:47.070> pretty<00:03:47.580> sure<00:03:47.670> they're<00:03:47.790> still

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
Milwaukee I'm pretty sure they're still

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.880 
Milwaukee I'm pretty sure they're still
available<00:03:48.120> I've<00:03:48.750> seen<00:03:49.020> like<00:03:49.530> Jennifer

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
available I've seen like Jennifer

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.080 
available I've seen like Jennifer
McGuire<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.430> people<00:03:50.700> use<00:03:50.880> this

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
McGuire and so I people use this

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.520 
McGuire and so I people use this
particular<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:51.690> I've<00:03:51.900> had<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.230> since<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.500> was

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
particular one I've had this since I was

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.340 
particular one I've had this since I was
about<00:03:52.680> seven<00:03:53.100> years<00:03:53.220> old<00:03:53.490> so<00:03:54.350> that's

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
about seven years old so that's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.410 
about seven years old so that's
testament<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.250> lasts<00:03:56.580> for<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.790> very<00:03:56.820> long

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
testament that it lasts for a very long

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
testament that it lasts for a very long
time<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:59.300> I<00:04:00.300> did<00:04:00.720> not<00:04:00.870> fast<00:04:01.110> forward<00:04:01.350> this

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
time and I did not fast forward this

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.840 
time and I did not fast forward this
part<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:01.800> you're<00:04:01.920> going<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.100> see<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.430> real<00:04:02.610> time

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
part so you're going to see in real time

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.900 
part so you're going to see in real time
how<00:04:02.880> long<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.240> takes<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.660> emboss<00:04:04.020> it<00:04:04.640> also<00:04:05.640> will

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
how long it takes to emboss it also will

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.790 
how long it takes to emboss it also will
very<00:04:06.360> clearly<00:04:06.930> let<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.320> know<00:04:07.470> when<00:04:07.680> it's

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
very clearly let you know when it's

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.230 
very clearly let you know when it's
ready<00:04:08.040> because<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.580> will<00:04:08.700> completely<00:04:09.000> change

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
ready because it will completely change

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.410 
ready because it will completely change
color<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.310> almost<00:04:11.310> lighten<00:04:11.820> up<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.210> if<00:04:12.330> you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
color and almost lighten up and if you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.870 
color and almost lighten up and if you
see<00:04:12.630> any<00:04:12.840> patches<00:04:13.230> where<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.250> color<00:04:14.490> is<00:04:14.700> not

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
see any patches where the color is not

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.820 
see any patches where the color is not
the<00:04:15.030> same<00:04:15.270> it's<00:04:15.600> probably<00:04:16.200> not<00:04:16.500> fully

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
the same it's probably not fully

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.560 
the same it's probably not fully
embossed<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.430> just<00:04:17.640> want<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.850> go<00:04:17.970> back<00:04:18.120> over<00:04:18.359> it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
embossed I just want to go back over it

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.200 
embossed I just want to go back over it
also<00:04:19.500> sometimes<00:04:19.830> when<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.130> emboss<00:04:20.460> it<00:04:20.760> can

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
also sometimes when you emboss it can

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.060 
also sometimes when you emboss it can
warp<00:04:21.630> your<00:04:21.900> paper<00:04:22.140> if<00:04:22.380> you're<00:04:22.500> using<00:04:22.650> thin

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
warp your paper if you're using thin

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.860 
warp your paper if you're using thin
paper<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:24.030> doesn't<00:04:24.300> really<00:04:24.390> happen<00:04:24.600> with<00:04:24.810> a

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
paper it doesn't really happen with a

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.659 
paper it doesn't really happen with a
shipping<00:04:25.080> tag<00:04:25.380> because<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.770> thick<00:04:26.070> but<00:04:26.640> a

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
shipping tag because it's thick but a

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.590 
shipping tag because it's thick but a
way<00:04:26.910> to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
way to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.480 
way to
alleviate<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.170> problem<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.770> just<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:29.130> apply

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
alleviate that problem is just to apply

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.870 
alleviate that problem is just to apply
some<00:04:29.790> heat<00:04:29.820> from<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.300> back<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.320> UM<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:32.550> the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
some heat from the back of the UM on the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.460 
some heat from the back of the UM on the
back<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.240> paper<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:34.110> will<00:04:34.230> kind<00:04:34.350> of

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
back of the paper and it will kind of

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.440 
back of the paper and it will kind of
warp<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.460> back<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.760> other<00:04:35.850> way<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.150> you'll

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
warp it back the other way and you'll

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.840 
warp it back the other way and you'll
end<00:04:36.570> up<00:04:36.690> back<00:04:36.930> at<00:04:36.960> square<00:04:37.260> one<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:38.190> that's<00:04:38.640> kind

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
end up back at square one so that's kind

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.760 
end up back at square one so that's kind
of<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:39.000> good<00:04:39.210> tool<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:40.230> also<00:04:40.500> want<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> make

sure that this dries from and dries
cools<00:04:43.560> down<00:04:43.860> because<00:04:44.670> if<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:44.940> touch<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.420> while

the washi tape to reveal the area that

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
is not embossed because that's what I'm

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.220 
is not embossed because that's what I'm
going<00:05:47.850> to<00:05:47.970> be<00:05:48.030> doing<00:05:48.150> my<00:05:48.330> stamping<00:05:48.720> you<00:05:49.050> could

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
going to be doing my stamping you could

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.160 
going to be doing my stamping you could
do<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:50.070> stamping<00:05:50.550> first<00:05:50.910> then<00:05:51.750> apply<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
do the stamping first then apply the

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.410 
do the stamping first then apply the
washi<00:05:52.470> tape<00:05:52.830> over<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.400> stamp<00:05:53.670> where<00:05:54.300> you

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
washi tape over the stamp where you

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.470 
washi tape over the stamp where you
stand<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:54.870> then<00:05:55.230> um<00:05:55.650> do<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.280> embossing<00:05:56.610> but<00:05:57.270> I

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
stand and then um do the embossing but I

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.600 
stand and then um do the embossing but I
tend<00:05:57.780> to<00:05:57.870> do<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.140> this<00:05:58.320> way<00:05:58.530> because<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.310> can<00:05:59.460> do

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
tend to do it this way because I can do

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.930 
tend to do it this way because I can do
multiple<00:05:59.820> at<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.270> time<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:01.670> just<00:06:02.670> find<00:06:02.850> that

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
multiple at a time and I just find that

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.490 
multiple at a time and I just find that
it's<00:06:03.120> easier<00:06:03.480> to<00:06:03.630> get<00:06:03.720> straight<00:06:04.140> and<00:06:04.380> that

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
it's easier to get straight and that

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.630 
it's easier to get straight and that
kind<00:06:04.710> of<00:06:04.740> stuff<00:06:04.830> if<00:06:05.010> I<00:06:05.130> do<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.340> this<00:06:05.460> way

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
kind of stuff if I do it this way

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.700 
kind of stuff if I do it this way
because<00:06:05.970> you<00:06:06.210> think<00:06:06.390> some<00:06:06.540> stays<00:06:06.810> on<00:06:07.050> ink<00:06:07.380> to

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
because you think some stays on ink to

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.890 
because you think some stays on ink to
stamp<00:06:08.430> this<00:06:08.790> it's<00:06:09.030> one<00:06:09.180> of<00:06:09.240> my<00:06:09.330> favorite<00:06:09.660> black

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.520 
stamp this it's one of my favorite black
inks<00:06:10.410> it's<00:06:11.310> really<00:06:11.670> great<00:06:11.880> for<00:06:11.990> solid<00:06:12.990> images

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
inks it's really great for solid images

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.910 
inks it's really great for solid images
I<00:06:13.800> tend<00:06:14.340> to<00:06:14.400> use<00:06:14.540> versafine<00:06:15.540> black<00:06:16.110> ink<00:06:16.650> for

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
I tend to use versafine black ink for

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.910 
I tend to use versafine black ink for
sentiments<00:06:17.550> that<00:06:17.670> are<00:06:17.940> on<00:06:18.240> a<00:06:18.300> smaller<00:06:19.260> font<00:06:19.680> or

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
sentiments that are on a smaller font or

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.250 
sentiments that are on a smaller font or
a<00:06:19.950> more<00:06:20.100> intricate<00:06:20.640> font<00:06:20.880> it<00:06:21.180> tends<00:06:21.930> to<00:06:22.080> do

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
a more intricate font it tends to do

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.340 
a more intricate font it tends to do
better<00:06:22.440> but<00:06:23.070> I<00:06:23.130> like<00:06:23.520> the<00:06:23.550> richness<00:06:24.510> of<00:06:24.840> the

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
better but I like the richness of the

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.910 
better but I like the richness of the
stays<00:06:25.800> on<00:06:26.010> black<00:06:26.400> with<00:06:27.150> this<00:06:27.480> um<00:06:27.920> stamp

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
stays on black with this um stamp

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.250 
stays on black with this um stamp
because<00:06:29.070> of<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:29.490> the<00:06:30.210> type<00:06:30.420> is<00:06:30.570> little<00:06:30.780> bolder

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
because of the the type is little bolder

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.010 
because of the the type is little bolder
