00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.379
 then our first development 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 our secret laboratory engine 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.480
 internal combustion which works on 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.949
 water and partial on gasoline 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.949
 mean engine husqvarna chainsaw 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.220
 carburetor cleaned improver cleaned 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:33.719
 exhaust gases from silencers fall into 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.040
 the pipe which leads the capacity which 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:43.160
 water and gas will be poured from here 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.190
 bottom pipe they get here and here 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.270
 then boil exhaust gas 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.760
 mixed exhaust fused mixed 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:00.530
 gasoline with water vapor falls again 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:05.630
 inside this pipe and get into the cylinder 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 add some air combustible mixture 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.860
 work on a full cycle I want to draw 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.049
 attention that the exhaust becomes 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.049
 almost pure hot steam 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.810
 actually all try and even here in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.939
 the reactor 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.479
 this in general, then we call the reactor 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.890
 here still inside this pipe is 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.979
 can the type of such rod that there 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.750
 the purpose here is now explain already 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.750
 we will not try 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:59.130
 water can take a sip 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:59.130
 for the lame and brazenly score good 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:16.140
 I think enough about how it 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:19.810
 a proportion of 20 percent well still sometimes 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.799
 You can use this kind of grid for 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:28.209
 washing dishes to bubbles 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:30.670
 gas were smaller here we we 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.140
 specially left it to 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.579
 show in the bank 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.760
 of course it's all right to do 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.590
 Her nose can be seen that there is something 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.280
 happens 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.280
 artificially happening 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.780
 a couple of drops of gas at the start is not 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.780
 overdo 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.069
 drove in our urban 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.329
 double 3 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.840
 in fact, that's all here and gas tank 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:25.520
 it is shown that we have no gas tank 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.100
 off the fuel supply off just 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.410
 I want to draw the attention of our scientists 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:35.180
 instead of the text amber dog breeding plants 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.430
 tried to study this phenomenon build 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.380
 such an engine and stop fooling us 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.650
 we can ride on the water very much 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.650
 easily
