00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 Today we change the hydro position at 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.890
 bmw e46 it is best if you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.910
 could go on stage but also 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.530
 make a jack 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.639
 We now have a stage too 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.110
 start with that first 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 time to get rid of underbody protection 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.190
 As you can see the hydro bearings are sitting here 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.350
 at the end of the calendar for that then has to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 then the small auxiliary frame also 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:53.190
 away and thus from march on so as 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.690
 Next comes this auxiliary frame 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.940
 This is stuck with three screws 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.550
 made once here on the other 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.840
 side and front in the middle the for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:14.490
 could take the impact wrench or 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:16.320
 a ratchet and now last but not least 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.750
 before you then use a puller, the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.460
 stock remove only can the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.290
 both screws directly in the warehouse and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.299
 then it could already fold down here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.049
 can you see how beautiful now 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.030
 broken the stock is completely the same and 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.869
 Now we are putting a big one here 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.570
 pull it off 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.299
 You can do it with a flex, for example 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.710
 flexing or even trying as and as 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.030
 but pulling is difficult because she 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.220
 actually always quite firmly baked 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 please note before you get it now 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 subtracts exactly the position as it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.649
 it's about in it later 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 can do it again on the same day 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.689
 best you mark yourselves now the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.549
 position of that of the camp that is 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.930
 we have such a notch here 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.710
 worked in and then there must be that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.670
 New camps also sit again 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.120
 next comes the now 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.239
 The puller on it looks very nice 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:29.290
 the center is that the spine also in the middle 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:34.020
 the spigot comes on and 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.020
 then pull the stock down 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.050
 so the new warehouse is looking forward to it 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.980
 of course it still has to push 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.900
 be lubricated 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.220
 important is please used 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.720
 Lubricant which is again 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.020
 does not volatilize any oil or 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.180
 any fats but butter or 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.730
 Slip cream we use here now 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:12.350
 butter that I even a good times here 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:17.500
 on the tap on the extend on it and 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.500
 then directly into the camp purely 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.820
 Now it is important that then only the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.190
 mark with the notch in the new one 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.760
 stock matches again then sat 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.100
 it on 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:41.780
 And a bit of pressure then goes 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.310
 just easy on it after it 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.310
 now pushed back on it comes 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.000
 just back to his old one 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.000
 position 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:23.540
 and you pull the whole thing afterwards 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:24.650
 solid people, that's what you do naturally 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.830
 on both sides 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.320
 even if you broke 1 because anyway 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.470
 the craft or the strength of the 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.580
 stock year decreases with time 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.260
 After that the help comes again 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.270
 on it the cover and the whole 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.710
 history already eaten if you like that 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 I really liked it then 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.680
 Of course, as always, have a comment 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.180
 a thumbs up who we are now 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.980
 does not know now presses up here 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.360
 yellow eyes her button comes left 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.070
 now to our last video the 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.920
 strangely, venting on the change 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.900
 bmw six cylinder engines petrol and 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.460
 right to the video capable foil all 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.840
 you need now or need this 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.400
 Generally for your vehicle needs 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.260
 you can find it by clicking on the bottom now 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.919
 brake disc pushes until next time 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.919
 servus and looks
