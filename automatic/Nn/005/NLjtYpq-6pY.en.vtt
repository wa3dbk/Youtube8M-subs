I<00:00:00.089> started<00:00:00.900> thinking<00:00:01.290> about<00:00:01.589> medicine<00:00:02.280> when<00:00:03.149> I

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
I started thinking about medicine when I

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.809 
I started thinking about medicine when I
was<00:00:03.480> in<00:00:03.780> high<00:00:04.049> school<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.620> my<00:00:05.310> parents<00:00:05.520> are

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
was in high school and my parents are

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.089 
was in high school and my parents are

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
teachers so working in an academic

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.640 
teachers so working in an academic
center<00:00:08.760> comes<00:00:09.480> easy<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.990> me<00:00:10.139> because<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.500> think

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
center comes easy to me because I think

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.039 
center comes easy to me because I think
I<00:00:10.950> grew<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.639> teaching<00:00:12.420> environment

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
but I started to really think about

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.500 
but I started to really think about
medicine<00:00:15.960> as<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> high<00:00:17.010> school<00:00:17.340> junior<00:00:18.150> and
