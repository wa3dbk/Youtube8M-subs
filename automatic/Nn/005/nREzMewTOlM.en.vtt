you did you did a sort of dive on with a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:26.080 
you did you did a sort of dive on with a
harmonic<00:00:17.690> yeah<00:00:22.010> toll<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.280> all<00:00:23.520> like<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.860> yeah

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
harmonic yeah toll it all like you yeah

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
harmonic yeah toll it all like you yeah

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.979 
you know note value span or whatever you
want<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.040> say<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.940> had<00:01:00.210> no<00:01:00.420> clue<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.780> he<00:01:00.840> was

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180 
kind of things you know that type of
artificial<00:01:07.050> harmonic<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.979> course

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
artificial harmonic and of course

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.120 
artificial harmonic and of course
everybody<00:01:08.580> knows<00:01:09.620> but<00:01:10.620> I<00:01:10.680> never<00:01:10.860> knew<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that you could play him anywhere so I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.670 
that you could play him anywhere so I
mean<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:17.540> get<00:01:18.540> really

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
mean you can get really

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
mean you can get really
I<00:01:19.710> ones<00:01:20.550> down<00:01:20.760> there<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.510> hard

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
I ones down there but it's kind of hard

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
I ones down there but it's kind of hard
to<00:01:22.050> pull<00:01:22.230> off<00:01:23.090> no<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:25.230> use<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.530> thumb<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to pull off no I just use my thumb to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.970 
to pull off no I just use my thumb to
block<00:01:26.850> things<00:01:27.120> done<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.890> then

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
block things done you know and then

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.600 
block things done you know and then
there's<00:01:32.190> this<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.730> like

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.999

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
not one you got them all over really so

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:51.520 
not one you got them all over really so
with<00:01:40.579> a<00:01:40.840> again<00:01:42.009> beast<00:01:43.009> in<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.280> Harlem<00:01:44.409> its
