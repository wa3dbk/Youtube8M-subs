but as you can see it pulls a nice
little<00:01:17.250> line<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:21.440> that's<00:01:22.440> how<00:01:22.620> I<00:01:22.650> make<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
little line and that's how I make the

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.150

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the hair will actually start to create

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.690 
the hair will actually start to create
an<00:01:29.880> appearance<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.690> volume<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:33.300> can

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700
