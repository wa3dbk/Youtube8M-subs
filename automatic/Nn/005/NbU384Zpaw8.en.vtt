00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello it's welcome in recipes 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.110
 roulettes the recipe of the day 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.110
 m 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.360
 the black tapenade for 6 people 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.219
 we need 250 g of black olives 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
 pitted six anchovy fillets 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.680
 oil 3 teaspoons of 4 to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.660
 vinegar 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.550
 a clove of garlic and 10 centiliters 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.310
 of olive oil the tapenade one can the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.419
 do it either at the mortar when one is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.589
 a little lazy like me in the mixer 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.410
 learn mix more or less about the texture 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.510
 that we prefer and I just started with 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.490
 because it is the only ingredient that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.760
 is not entirely true i'm going to the dg 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.760
 so do not succeed little germain 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.740
 then it becomes very complicated there 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.910
 must put everything in the mixer to by 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.140
 the olive oil that we will add years 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.140
 philippe during salix 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.240
 and now everything is the tube of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.240
 the summer we will mix 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.890

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.780

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.300
 pot and I present it with breadsticks 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.000
