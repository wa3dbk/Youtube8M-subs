00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.100
 hello and welcome to radio 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.309
 fortuna with a little between 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.720
 broadcast between the home games and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.910
 Although for a given reason we are here 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.670
 with erwin jimmy hoffer and find us 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.090
 on the new hochkönigs fanbank the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.739
 will soon be used 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.599
 Erwin Jimmy is not coincidental 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.130
 but because he is one of the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.770
 Austrian player is in the team and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.970
 the sponsor of this fanbank 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.079
 Provision also comes from 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.530
 Austria if it were the 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.930
 tourism region hochkönig but here come 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:50.930
 welcome later for the first time 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:52.430
 as always very well and yes me 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.770
 think we just want to have 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.330
 weekend after sat specially you 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.110
 personally it goes after the winning goal 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.920
 probably very good 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.270
 but we do not want to talk about that now 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.590
 current situation or the games speak 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.239
 that is already discussed enough 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.340
 Just as basic as you are 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.229
 austrians landed in rheinland 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.240
 stranded however you say so 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.119
 I want to like it here meanwhile 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.299
 yes I am actually very late 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.549
 joined the team is there was 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.840
 already championship beginning but yes me 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.189
 I am very good of the team 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.899
 been recorded and I feel 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.420
 really very well here 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.840
 and yes I just want the team 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 and we only have the club to help us 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.249
 very very very hard away so much 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.569
 with from the city or focuses 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.389
 Everything is really up in your life 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.829
 football and on the fortuna sure me 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:43.159
 We think we are all very focused 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.649
 stick to the training stick to me 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.969
 on the games but I believe everyone 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.819
 everyone gets from the city too 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.679
 a little something with but as I said 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.240
 believe it is not comparable 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.399
 with austria i think so berger 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.920
 that so we have here in Dusseldorf 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.130
 not really that mountain 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.659
 you're coming from 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.560
 Austria there are many mountains 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.660
 You also come to ski yourself very much 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.700
 very little to actually I can at 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.270
 I can ski I can snowboard 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.400
 but i believe the days what i do 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.480
 I spend my free time at home 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.310
 family 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.270
 but as I said both can be because 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.980
 as known that the fortuna in 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.840
 Austria, you could say clearly now 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.520
 Everyone knows about Fortuna Dusseldorf 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.370
 old times or maybe 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.800
 even the second bundesliga in 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.600
 Austria also follows yes I believe 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.580
 most certainly the second league in 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.560
 germany the complete second league 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.980
 is also persecuted in Austria 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.140
 the mood worked out in here 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.290
 Germany is in the second league and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.020
 I'm with the spectator 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.600
 unimaginable if you do not know 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.030
 and yes, I think you recognize photo synonymous 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.940
 in Austria not only because you are here 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.910
 but basically also plays 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.830
 basically, I believe that very big 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.110
 Club it is believed I want the times above 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.320
 with actually and I believe that 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.880
 you just know in austria tell me 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.770
 if you are here now on the fanbank 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.270
 Above all , we know the players 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.580
 from the top of the press tribune 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.260
 one is already very very close and 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.700
 Personally, I always remember 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.590
 a little bit difficult to imagine how 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.920
 you really keep the overview 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.390
 if you're only as at eye level believes 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.190
 but still that's the fans here 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.870
 because that's because you just 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.510
 is closer or what is it 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.970
 difference to above what do you mean me 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.140
 believe this is everyone wants further times 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.780
 sit on this bench dar 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.870
 I think that now say five meters 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.100
 next to the line and believed 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.630
 already different feeling 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.180
 then you always get already 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.620
 a little bit more like that 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.670
 actually the players of Spielfeld like that 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.280
 witness 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.060
 and I think everyone has to 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.709
 have seen once 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.840
 the tempo is probably too 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.160
 much higher if you are so close to it 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.540
 if you have the distance from the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.450
 stand so then you can see how fast 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.000
 I really appreciate it 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.140
 Well 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.610
 Now , of course, the question is how come 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.470
 the fans here on this bench 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.600
 to sit 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.200
 Do you know what you have to do for me yes 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.350
 I heard that one on the one 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.160
 internet site on high king points go 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.950
 that is exactly what this kingdom stands for 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.639
 and then there are questions or a question 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.719
 and you have to answer that and 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:42.009
 yes I think that's just going to get busy 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:45.479
 if several correct answer at the moment 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.860
 is the question where the region is king 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.169
 her name is what she named 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.389
 is one can almost think of myself 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.069
 I got on it, too 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.449
 Let's leave it and enjoy 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.759
 that's a bit of a lookout 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.020
 really very very close to it I have to 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.699
 already say I'm curious we will 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.620
 then sometimes a few fans certainly 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.699
 in front of the camera here ask the game 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.499
 We've been there for a while 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.449
 curious what they say thanks 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.819
 jimmy hoffer and 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.020
 all the best for the next games we 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.310
 hope you keep on doing well 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.310
 actually think
