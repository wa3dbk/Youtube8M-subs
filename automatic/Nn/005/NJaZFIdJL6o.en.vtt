 full heat and good girls as well as 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.060
 they read with these two products we are going to 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.450
 make our new base and 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.000
 revolutionary since this is the secret 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.550
 of the new bases girls you do not have for 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.060
 what to pay more will they ask me about 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.600
 that if it feels greasy it really does not 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.340
 feels greasy girls for nothing follows 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.500
 having the same consistency is not 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.930
 so much oil that you are going to use and right now 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 they will see in the application and good 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.740
 girls to start I'm going to clean my 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.500
 face so they see that I do not bring anything from 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.620
 makeup or anything like it and 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.849
 I'm cleaning with a towel Lanz 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.309
 bout and wet 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.550
 since I do not use any chemicals in my 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:45.459
 face now I'm going to apply three droplets of 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.029
 oil and I'm going to apply it in all my 

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:51.789
 face so that it gets on your forehead and 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:54.399
 everything all everything that is my face also 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.639
 the area of ​​the dark circles so that 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:05:00.759
 increase and do not cut in my makeup 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.979
 later in this area because of my age and 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.199
 I also recommend that if you are going to 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.529
 do eyebrows first because 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.319
 it is very difficult with the skin as fatty 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.709
 quote draw the eyebrows so do that 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.839
 kind 

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:16.330
 first they put their eyebrows and then they 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.159
 they put the oil ok 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.469
 once I put the humberto oil 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.169
 also with what I left over my lips 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.740
 in this way I do not need to use any 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.740
 balm 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.509
 if you use a thick olive oil or 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:35.349
 of almonds with a wet napkin 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.210
 remove the excess so taps now 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.310
 I'm going to apply first in my zone t ya 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.710
 which is the greasiest area and it's going to 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.710
 control fat for a longer time 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.900
 now I'm going to apply my base of 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.870
 makeup I'm using this which is the 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.330
 fit me mate de maybelline and I'll 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.479
 apply all over my face in a way 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.689
 uniform and good so little by little I'm going 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.039
 fading with my brush and good 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.529
 girls, I'm going to apply the 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.749
 outline and I will blur it in a 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.210
 normal as in my corrector 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.979
 after the proofreader I will apply a 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.569
