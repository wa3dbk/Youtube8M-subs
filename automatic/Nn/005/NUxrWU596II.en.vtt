00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
welcoming it more friendly I guess I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.789 
welcoming it more friendly I guess I
don't<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.329> happy<00:01:45.720> cheerful<00:01:46.590> like

human<00:01:47.280> voice<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.570> better<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.439> opinion
