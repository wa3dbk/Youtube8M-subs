00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.960
 let's start the process of 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.529
 Soot combustion in the filter 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.529
 exhaust gases 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.830
 we prepare everything 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.190
 the computer with the diagnosis being 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.190
 connected to the car 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.430
 the motor 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.310
 ignition with this protective plate for 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 that does not pass the heat towards these parts 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.820
 of the cane 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.610
 and this process 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 this process you have to accelerate the car to 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.489
 butt goes up to about four thousand 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.430
 revolutions 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.040
 I'm going to use the support brick 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.390
 to hold the accelerator pedal 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.930
 tight to football let's check your 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.930
 functioning 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.770
 perfect 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.100
 the multiplex or ready connected to 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100
 car 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:14.390
 km of coaching 313 1998 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.259
 good engine temperature a little more 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.340
 of 80 degrees has to catch minimum 90 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.340
 let's go wait a bit 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.979
 Well, we are warned about the protection 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.480
 that we have to use in the escape of 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.260
 engine in the exhaust manifold 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.240
 here seeing that it is prepared is 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.380
 find the vehicle outdoors 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.149
 yes, practically 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 the area in front and behind is clear 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.250
 of the vehicle is also open on 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.100
 hood upright yes 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.550
 the heating plate has been assembled 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.170
 exactly as you have already shown 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.130
 there are people of immediate proximity 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.939
 the engine compartment not 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.460
 good preconditions to operate 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.840
 the engine idling stopped vehicle 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.670
 conditioned and disconnected 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.580
 disconnect consumers 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.590
 the parking brake okay 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 levers extra function but one point 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.730
 dead and the liquid temperature the 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.350
 end between 90 and 110 degrees now 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.450
 same brand 84 degrees 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.760
 we have to wait for what 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.760
 the temperature reaches its 90 degrees 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.480
 well already marked 90 degrees we can 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.480
 continue 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.069
 disconnect him on 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.180
 one minute countdown 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.560
 with being on 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.560
 return to china 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.650
 well here indicates course of the process 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.330
 of soot combustion in the filter 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.130
 exhaust gases start the engine done 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.660
 and start the combustion process of 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.630
 today in the exhaust base filter with 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.010
 the key f 3 100 and keep it pressed to 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.260
 stop the city pedal during 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.460
 approximately 15 minutes 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.290
 indication the regulation of the number of 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.670
 engine revs is done at 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.500
 from approximately 4,000 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.720
 speed through the unit 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.940
 control 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.680
 the engine stops automatically when 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.190
 finish the combustion process of 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.920
 soot in the scales filter 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.400
 well 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.760
 we give c3 perfect and accelerate the 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.760
 consumption 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.010
 observe 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.099
 the fan is full 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.190
 go bob this meter 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.010
 move the whole car 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.330
 has now stabilized at four thousand 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.330
 revolutions 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.370
 but no 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.649
 I eat well 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.650
 all right 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.650
 yes perenco 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.860
 the engine stops 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.820
 waka looks red 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.820
 heat comes off 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.470
 we give you effects 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:58.940
 disconnect the ignition 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.940
 we are on 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.210
 yes 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.920
 plus 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.630
 10 seconds 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.990
 with we are again 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.480
 the operation is already finished with 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.710
 success 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.040
 Now you have to be careful not to 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.940
 burn off the sheet heat and leaks 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.740
 perform a visual ball control 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.370
 Engine in the area of ​​the exhaust manifold 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:40.510
 in terms of thermal incidents a 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.250
 visual control on the back 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.220
 and replacement to the consumption indication 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.510
 of fuel by the way 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.510
 As consumption puts 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:58.450
 3 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.450
 and this is all more process completed 

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.520
 let's take a look at the engine 

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:11.350
 it was a warmth that gives pleasure now 

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.350
 in winter it is appreciated 

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:16.629
 Well, that's all
