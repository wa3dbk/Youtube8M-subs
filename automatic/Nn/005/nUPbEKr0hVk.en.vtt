00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 Y 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.060
 the content of youtube missing 90 in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 a new video and good friends in this 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.570
 occasion we have a tweet of cydia the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 which I had not previously reviewed 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.140
 in the channel and that recently had a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.940
 update which I thought was very 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.279
 interesting and I also found it very 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.470
 good to share with you this is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.710
 call action menu that in this case be 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.970
 plus pack and in its latest version and good 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.650
 we're going to give a little about what 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.450
 this tweet is good and so that 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.850
 they work on it I have focused more than 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.440
 nothing what is text and functions that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 we can do while we write text 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 as you can see here we have it all 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.840
 something like that I select for example this 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.380
 I can browse appears several 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 functions in this case I have what they are 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.910
 this that is shown by icons but 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.620
 Several functions appear to be able to 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.150
 do with this text to modify a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.440
 little about the configuration after 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.790
 that we installed it we have a menu 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 within the sequence adjustment menu 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.000
 hand and good action here we go since 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 there is the option to activate it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.630
 disable it extended support 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 use and know this case I'm going to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.290
 disable and good actions that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.590
 we want them to appear in this case of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.289
 do not copy everything call history this one 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.940
 locate look for the plane and good these 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.280
 functions that we will see and the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.780
 system actions we are going to return 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.070
 the text to show them a little 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.030
 about what exactly it does 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 this tweet 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.280
 If I select for example this that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.650
 part of text gives me not sanction all 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 copy copy everything do it by voice and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.280
 if I give this part to give me the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.520
 option to send to past and pass is a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.560
 page where we can send this stuff 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.530
 that we copy and good if for example I 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.430
 I want to copy it, I'm going to copy it and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.220
 Then I want it 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.160
 put here in this part as you can see 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.660
 - functions such as history 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.750
 history here we will look like everything 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.280
 last the last things that we have 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.990
 copied to the clipboard and we can 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.310
 teach that what we want to create in 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.470
 this case has exonere I'm like 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.150
 can see and nothing else sticks which 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.190
 it seems to me a very excellent function and 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.750
 order we can add favorites here in 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.250
 this section legality we can add what 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.690
 which is today's date if the cousin go to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 see that the date and time will appear 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.560
 at this moment I'm recording this 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.630
 other video are very interesting that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 we have is also in this case if I go to 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 press this text as you can see in 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.630
 this part gives us the option to search and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.489
 if we want to look for those of the rest 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 look for it in wikipedia in dictionary 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.489
 translate it and well just look for what 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.900
 which makes me very interesting and another 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.700
 which I also liked very much that if 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.190
 we select a text for example in 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.230
 this case to select this our 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.120
 option to tweet directly 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.850
 from here as you can see, they are from 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.320
 tweet and we just oppress that and not 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.610
 knows our twitter client and I think 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.980
 that this works with several clients of 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.989
 twitter to schools as you can see they are 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.030
 very good functions the truth for what 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.590
 what is text editing and selecting 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.930
 and all of that seemed very interesting to me 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.940
 share it with you now we are going to 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.170
 see how we're going to install it it seems we have 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.250
 to enter Syria as always and 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.810
 wait for it to finish loading 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.489
 let's speed up after it's over 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.140
 load only the selection of 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.420
 search as you can see it here and search 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.000
 action menu the pack hits and has a 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.049
 cost of 2 dollars with 99 cents but 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.370
 remember that the inscription is from 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.590
 some repositories where they can 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.810
 download this for we have generates 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.610
 no cost and if you believe this evil 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.260
 worthwhile and want to support the 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.030
 developer can already make the purchase 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.320
 of this explain the truth seems very 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.970
 good the functions that it includes us 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.709
