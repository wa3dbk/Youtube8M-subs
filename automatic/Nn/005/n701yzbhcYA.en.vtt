00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
is the optiplex XE to running a Windows

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.499 
is the optiplex XE to running a Windows
Embedded<00:00:13.650> eight<00:00:14.070> standard<00:00:14.610> image<00:00:15.089> that's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Embedded eight standard image that's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.420 
Embedded eight standard image that's
been<00:00:15.719> created<00:00:16.699> so<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.000> bear<00:00:18.830> image<00:00:19.830> that's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
been created so it's a bear image that's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.700 
been created so it's a bear image that's
had<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.119> splash<00:00:21.660> screen<00:00:21.689> stripped<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
had the splash screen stripped out of it

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.099 
had the splash screen stripped out of it
so<00:00:22.890> there's<00:00:23.070> no<00:00:23.189> windows<00:00:23.689> logo<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.990> you'd

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
so there's no windows logo that you'd

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
so there's no windows logo that you'd
ordinarily<00:00:25.350> see<00:00:25.890> that's<00:00:26.310> why<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:26.640> seeing

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
ordinarily see that's why we're seeing

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
ordinarily see that's why we're seeing
this<00:00:27.840> black<00:00:28.230> screen<00:00:28.619> right<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.039> front<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.310> us

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
this black screen right in front of us

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.040 
this black screen right in front of us
as<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> system<00:00:30.929> boots<00:00:31.640> once<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.850> gets<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.719> the

as a system boots once it gets to the
desktop<00:00:34.559> we've<00:00:35.250> created<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:36.230> West<00:00:37.230> 8<00:00:37.500> evil<00:00:38.399> user

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
desktop we've created a West 8 evil user

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.030 
desktop we've created a West 8 evil user
that<00:00:40.649> will<00:00:41.489> launch<00:00:41.940> into<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.930> desktop<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.890> has

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that will launch into a desktop that has

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.200 
that will launch into a desktop that has
a<00:00:44.070> massively<00:00:45.000> reduced<00:00:46.550> tile<00:00:47.550> outlook<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
a massively reduced tile outlook so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.410 
a massively reduced tile outlook so
you'll<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> only<00:00:50.850> thing<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.270> our

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you'll see that the only thing on our

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.770 
you'll see that the only thing on our
desktop<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:53.039> tile<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.879> internet<00:00:54.300> explorer

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
desktop is a tile for internet explorer

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.410 
desktop is a tile for internet explorer
a<00:00:55.110> towel<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.739> file<00:00:56.160> explorer<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> tile<00:00:57.120> for

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
a towel for file explorer and a tile for

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.279 
a towel for file explorer and a tile for
the<00:00:57.449> desktop<00:00:58.579> if<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.940> look<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:00.960> closer

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the desktop if we look a little closer

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.850 
the desktop if we look a little closer
at<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.710> apps<00:01:02.270> so<00:01:03.270> we'll<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.680> apps

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
at the apps so we'll see that the apps

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.500 
at the apps so we'll see that the apps
are<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:05.960> reduced<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.670> really<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.619> bare

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
are also reduced so just really the bare

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.109 
are also reduced so just really the bare
minimum<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.140> no<00:01:13.350> pad<00:01:13.880> some<00:01:14.880> remote

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
minimum we have no pad some remote
