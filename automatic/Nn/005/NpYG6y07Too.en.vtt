gigabyte 7200 rpm hard drive which is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.640 
gigabyte 7200 rpm hard drive which is
great<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.390> taking<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> look<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.409> thing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
great now taking a look at this thing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
great now taking a look at this thing
you'll<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.060> said<00:01:12.210> earlier

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you'll see here like I said earlier

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.090 
you'll see here like I said earlier
there's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> lot<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.619> stuff<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there's a lot of good stuff on this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
there's a lot of good stuff on this
computers<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.790> nice<00:01:14.880> display<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.479> in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
computers got really nice display but in

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.820 
computers got really nice display but in
the<00:01:15.930> back<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.290> you're<00:01:16.380> gonna<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.740> have

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the back here you're gonna see you have

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.859 
the back here you're gonna see you have
a<00:01:16.860> lot<00:01:17.100> more<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.270> main<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
a lot more and the main one I want to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.149 
a lot more and the main one I want to
talk<00:01:19.049> about<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
talk about is this one right here the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
talk about is this one right here the
display<00:01:20.610> port<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.350> can

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
display port because with that you can

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
display port because with that you can
actually<00:01:22.710> add<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.549> many<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.090> monitors<00:01:24.570> do

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
actually add so many more monitors do

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.300 
actually add so many more monitors do
you<00:01:24.750> wanted<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> hook<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.799> multiple

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you wanted to hook this up to multiple

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
you wanted to hook this up to multiple
outs<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.570> video<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> could<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
outs for for video you could it's like a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
outs for for video you could it's like a
really<00:01:28.979> powerful<00:01:29.220> HDMI<00:01:29.759> T<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.060> split

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
really powerful HDMI T you can split

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.630 
really powerful HDMI T you can split
into<00:01:31.049> multiples<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.310> cool<00:01:32.490> now

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
into multiples which is really cool now

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.560 
into multiples which is really cool now
another<00:01:32.850> thing<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:33.060> important<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> note

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
another thing that's important to note

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.569 
another thing that's important to note
is<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> USB<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.280> 4

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
is there are a lot of USB is we have 4

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.760 
is there are a lot of USB is we have 4
USB<00:01:35.729> s<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.450> there's<00:01:36.780> seven<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.439> total

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
USB s right here there's seven in total

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.749 
USB s right here there's seven in total
because<00:01:37.829> there's<00:01:38.040> some<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> side<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
because there's some on the side so

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.370 
because there's some on the side so
that's<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> USB<00:01:39.509> connectivity<00:01:39.930> you

also have a 10 100 or 1000 Gigabit
Ethernet<00:01:46.170> port<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.950> very<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:47.700> fast<00:01:47.880> ethernet

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Ethernet port so very very fast ethernet

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.270 
Ethernet port so very very fast ethernet
it's<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.780> regular<00:01:48.869> 10<00:01:49.170> 100<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.680> 10<00:01:49.890> 100

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it's not your regular 10 100 it's 10 100

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's not your regular 10 100 it's 10 100
1000<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.000> gigabit<00:01:51.509> which<00:01:51.630> means<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.869> can
