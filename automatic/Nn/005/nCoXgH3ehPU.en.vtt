 to get along 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.769
 or you too that already has a cat but 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.210
 won a dog and the cat is not 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.490
 accepting very well 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.769

 to be able to do both if they do it well 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.129
 that is important first exists 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.680
 all the coexistence you need to leave 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.649
 the two lived together knowing each other 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.809
 It is best to start from this and you 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 a little more confidence in the other to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.579
 from the time of coexistence that the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 two had advantage nothing you are putting 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.230
 the cat or dog in the house with the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.300
 who had been for a long time and want 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.359
 Let the two get together right away. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 another tip does not tolerate at all 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.710
 any manifestation of aggression 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.479
 in some of the parts of the cat with 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.909
 aggression to dog or dog 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 aggression the cat does not tolerate and fight 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.700
 with the page and initiate this intolerance 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 implies that you are the owner and you 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.229
 will not let one party believe another 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 page you can not tolerate these 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.640
 parts of which are basically 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.820
 manifestations of aggression one with the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.579
 others touch something else never force them 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.200
 two to live together with what you 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.869
 you can not force it it has to be a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.689
 something that comes spontaneously in the sand 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.210
 the two coexist in already implemented this 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.369
 You too important tip to leave 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.799
 the two have a faster coexistence 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.770
 a convivial most others put 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.659
 they to eat closer one of the uses 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.220
 of the Flemish stood next to him 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.750
 obviously will not lay the foundation of a 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.850
 side or one or the other just puts 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.369
 close understood a way that the two 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.170
 They can see for up and they have 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.450
 in the case a better coexistence then 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520
 Are you hungry for the one and the wedge? 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 use at a certain distance that will not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.810
 Obviously it affects each other rather than 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.940
 you visualize that the two are 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.560
 seeing is like this 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.600
 the two learned to have more time 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.390
 along when you feel a mild to 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.880
 approaching the cat with the dog or 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.580
 with the cat dog you notice that the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.680
 Praise you two 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.080
 but that little sign that is happy 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.150
 but that affection in the cat dog is 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.610
 important that you express 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.380
 feeling of joy when you 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.540
 visualize the two together so they 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.190
 are more easily understood than 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.890
 two can not live together that the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.810
 owner is from tv sheet do not force the two 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.820
 they lived together let's let it be 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.920
 a spontaneous thing the lady of eating 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.050
 even though you should leave the two more 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 next in a way that is visualized more 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 if you notice in any way whatsoever 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.690
 aggressiveness of one of the pages you 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.970
 immediately takes it and let it 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.820
 happen with time, even ok 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.070
 do not leave the 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.770
 your puppy or the dog . 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.150
 your cat next to each other were 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.640
 in the church at some distance 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.220
 their dormitory where they can stay 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.200
 even because they have to live together first 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.910
 for them to get used to one with 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.100
 the others there is nothing that time does not 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.010
 It turns out you've been sleeping since 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.840
 It was only a short distance away that it was 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.730
 google this line goes to live with 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.920
 to be very important a tip like that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.739
 is that it can also be useful but it depends 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.200
 much of the animals leaves the type of 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.390
 band some towels in continuous of your 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.520
 Of course I go with a 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.610
 Your dog on both sides is 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.709
 so they are basically feeling the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.600
 smell of the other and is obviously more 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.120
 easy for the two to have a 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.090
 but remember again that nothing that time 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.950
 new then you have to have patience 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.110
 really because cattle and dogs are 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.970
 things a little different 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.970
 you have to let them 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.830
 together and they learn to dial 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.660
 the others, after all, if you have 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.959
 a part that is with her a long time 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.360
 years or months ago and really a 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.450
 little strange to them they have to live 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.760
 right in front of a cat a dog in your 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.470
 territory but make sure you 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.470
 caring for that care 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.959
 obviously you will see that both 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.030
 the parties are obviously there coexisting 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.959
 I hope I have left some 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.269
 tips for you serves 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.949

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.710
 I also have a dog cat here 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.870
 in the house and these are the tips that 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.750
 helped me to make both of them as 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.240
 live together ok then this is a tip 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.759
 for yourself that you are also asking 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.250
