00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 maybe also have other blogs 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.740
 seen or maybe on youtube 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.900
 namely the ego that will look at 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 how much your face is actually worth and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.260
 I mean in terms of makeup 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.910
 So what makeup applied to you in 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.740
 the mood hour of make-up and I will add that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.300
 add each other and then you know how much 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.640
 your family is worth it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.410
 well i just did that i do the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 video go and record that script until 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.010
 my just put up with my 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 daily look so not an almost thought 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 that I would see how much it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.489
 actually costs so maybe that is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.530
 nice for you too to see what 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.530
 I actually use that and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.930
 for me, I think it's pretty shocking 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.030
 to see because hear how much it all 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.710
 It costs a lot, I think 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.950
 and that's what you're looking too pretty 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.489
 so yeah let's start okay go there 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.570
 we then 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.579
 First of all, I have the foundation 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 applied and this is the hero that mix 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 very a foundation of bourjois and this one 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 I actually use foundation for years 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.760
 I really like it in this one 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.330
 foundation brush 14 euros 50 so that she 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.650
 this product what I used enjoyed 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.010
 and then I also have a powder 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.240
 use that is the mac prep and prime 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 transparent powder 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.930
 and this takes a look 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.030
 21 euros 50 and this is just mattling 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.220
 powder that just make your face very beautiful 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.280
 mat making sure you have makeup 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 just stays in place 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.310
 I have signed and build my leg 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.020
 I did that with the wank of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.270
 pencil of the hema that I really already have one 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.189
 very long time and I believe that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.900
 this costs two euros so that is not the case 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.250
 very expensive 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.829
 then i have an eye shadow base 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.659
 adapted from essence de out still 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.649
 eyeshadow base 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.009
 and this costs 2 euros 50 so that we tasty 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.009
 cheap 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.250
 well then with the then slightly more expensive 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.329
 because I started working with my 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.670
 eye shadow 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.979
 I used naked pallet naked for that 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.659
 2 pallet is really my favorite 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.420
 palette eyeshadow palette have a whole 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.159
 basic eye shadow made for almost two 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.819
 I used colors 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.459
 that is this color that is the color ties 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.530
 that they are very nice matte color and this one 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.819
 highlight and that is bodycon 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.170
 and those are actually the only two 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.000
 colors i use this for this 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.620
 eye look but of course i need it 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.120
 whole palette and it costs 36 euros 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.060
 I bought one online and this is 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.849
 a liquid eyeliner pen from zoeva and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.930
 this costs 5 euros 50 he is really super 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.640
 black 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.349
 and very nice to have a very thin line with 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.720
 because I worked very precisely 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.730
 he can really very tight dude ice cream 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.599
 just want very nice and neither 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.340
 very expensive so 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.739
 I used one of mascara 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.319
 catrice and this is the glamor doll feel 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.360
 your mascara and I think that's a whole one 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.290
 nice mascara and I don't remember 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.140
 exactly how that 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.560
 and full of those costs but I thought it was 399 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.049
 so 4 euros then continue with my face 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.480
