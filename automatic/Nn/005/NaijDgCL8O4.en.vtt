we're going to be taking a look at the
actual<00:01:29.020> functions<00:01:29.590> on<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.860> keyboard<00:01:30.280> such<00:01:30.729> as

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
deplane cause and volume controls now I

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.180 
deplane cause and volume controls now I
can't<00:01:34.209> use<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.690> plain<00:01:34.899> pause<00:01:35.140> since<00:01:35.739> the<00:01:35.979> fact

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
can't use the plain pause since the fact

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.120 
can't use the plain pause since the fact
that<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:37.140> plain<00:01:38.140> pause<00:01:38.349> controlled<00:01:38.890> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
that the plain pause controlled the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.040 
that the plain pause controlled the
screen<00:01:39.489> recorder<00:01:39.849> so<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.599> can<00:01:40.660> see<00:01:40.750> it's

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
screen recorder so as you can see it's

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.600 
screen recorder so as you can see it's
fully<00:01:41.289> functioning<00:01:41.890> with<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.280> volume

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
fully functioning with the volume

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.460 
fully functioning with the volume
controls<00:01:43.000> as<00:01:43.239> long<00:01:43.959> with<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:45.209> the<00:01:46.209> music<00:01:46.899> with

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
controls as long with the the music with

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.190 
controls as long with the the music with
the<00:01:47.970> buttons<00:01:48.970> now<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.660> a<00:01:49.690> Mac<00:01:50.020> computer

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
the buttons now this is a Mac computer

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.109 
the buttons now this is a Mac computer
and<00:01:50.739> with<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.280> windows<00:01:51.610> you're<00:01:51.789> going<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.030> get

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
and with the windows you're going to get

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.580 
and with the windows you're going to get
definitely<00:01:52.569> way<00:01:53.140> more<00:01:54.179> features<00:01:55.179> now<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:56.259> f11

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
definitely way more features now the f11

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.160 
definitely way more features now the f11
does<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.280> window<00:01:57.610> switch<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.209> I<00:01:58.690> find<00:01:59.020> that

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
does that window switch and I find that

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.510 
does that window switch and I find that
could<00:01:59.590> be<00:01:59.709> useful<00:01:59.890> in<00:02:00.220> case<00:02:00.369> you're

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
could be useful in case you're

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.020 
could be useful in case you're
