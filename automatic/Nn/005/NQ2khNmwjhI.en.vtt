once<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.330> lets<00:02:14.510> go<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:14.900> magnet<00:02:15.260> part<00:02:15.470> but<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
once it lets go the magnet part but the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.410 
once it lets go the magnet part but the
the<00:02:16.250> reason<00:02:16.430> why<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.849> happened<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.269> because

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the reason why that happened is because

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.780 
the reason why that happened is because
if<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.319> see<00:02:18.500> I've<00:02:18.680> got<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.040> kind<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.430> coming

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
if you see I've got it kind of coming

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.390 
if you see I've got it kind of coming
through<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.090> wall<00:02:20.269> there<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:22.160> there's<00:02:22.340> a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
through the wall there so there's a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.940 
through the wall there so there's a
little<00:02:22.550> tension<00:02:22.910> from<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.450> cord<00:02:23.960> in<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.740> back

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
little tension from the cord in the back

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.740 
little tension from the cord in the back
of<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> drywall<00:02:25.730> if<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.420> had<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.720> coming

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
of the drywall if I had it coming

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.350 
of the drywall if I had it coming
forward<00:02:27.440> there'd<00:02:27.680> be<00:02:28.100> no<00:02:28.250> problem<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.940> tried

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
forward there'd be no problem so I tried

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.000 
forward there'd be no problem so I tried
loosen<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.690> tension<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.230> bit<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.650> seems<00:02:30.890> to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
loosen the tension a bit and it seems to

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.000 
loosen the tension a bit and it seems to
have<00:02:31.220> solved<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.610> problem<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:33.350> vortec<00:02:33.800> I've

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
have solved the problem the vortec I've

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.300 
have solved the problem the vortec I've
gone<00:02:34.940> through<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.480> manual<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.920> just

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
gone through the manual and it's just

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.600 
gone through the manual and it's just
really<00:02:37.540> simple<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.570> use<00:02:38.720> I've<00:02:39.620> got<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.040> set<00:02:40.310> on

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
really simple to use I've got it set on

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.580 
really simple to use I've got it set on
a<00:02:40.780> nutrient<00:02:41.780> export<00:02:42.380> /<00:02:43.360> random<00:02:44.360> mode<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:45.560> can

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
a nutrient export / random mode you can

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.620 
a nutrient export / random mode you can
kind<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.070> mix<00:02:46.250> certain<00:02:46.790> modes<00:02:47.000> together<00:02:47.390> on

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
kind of mix certain modes together on

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.980 
kind of mix certain modes together on
some<00:02:47.870> settings<00:02:48.430> here<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.600> don't<00:02:50.900> know

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
some settings here is the I don't know

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.150 
some settings here is the I don't know
if<00:02:51.140> you'll<00:02:51.230> be<00:02:51.350> able<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.530> see<00:02:51.710> this<00:02:51.830> kind<00:02:52.040> of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
if you'll be able to see this kind of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.310 
if you'll be able to see this kind of
dark<00:02:52.400> down<00:02:52.580> there<00:02:52.640> there's<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.630> driver<00:02:54.020> right

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
dark down there there's the driver right

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.199 
dark down there there's the driver right
there<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.930> got<00:02:57.560> night<00:02:58.040> mode<00:02:58.340> which<00:02:59.000> I've

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
there it's got night mode which I've

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.840 
there it's got night mode which I've
programmed<00:02:59.510> in<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.440> took<00:03:00.650> me<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:01.250> don't<00:03:01.700> know<00:03:01.790> 20

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
programmed in it took me I don't know 20

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.699 
programmed in it took me I don't know 20
seconds<00:03:02.570> after<00:03:02.810> reading<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.140> instructions

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
seconds after reading the instructions

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.670 
seconds after reading the instructions
to<00:03:03.830> do<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:05.420> really<00:03:05.780> easy<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.320> use<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
to do that it's really easy to use the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.100 
to do that it's really easy to use the
only<00:03:06.920> thing<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:08.360> different<00:03:08.810> about<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
only thing I like different about the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.530 
only thing I like different about the
driver<00:03:09.410> if<00:03:09.620> there<00:03:09.770> was<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.330> readout<00:03:11.330> that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
driver if there was like a readout that

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.449 
driver if there was like a readout that
actually<00:03:11.959> told<00:03:12.170> me<00:03:12.410> what<00:03:12.590> mode<00:03:12.830> i<00:03:12.860> was<00:03:13.160> in<00:03:13.280> its

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
actually told me what mode i was in its

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.479 
actually told me what mode i was in its
kind<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:14.030> finicky<00:03:14.959> having<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.620> look<00:03:16.040> back<00:03:16.280> at

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
kind of a finicky having to look back at

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.850 
kind of a finicky having to look back at
this<00:03:16.670> screen<00:03:16.970> PDF<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.080> find<00:03:18.320> out<00:03:18.470> what<00:03:18.650> modem

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
this screen PDF to find out what modem

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.120 
this screen PDF to find out what modem
in<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.959> if<00:03:21.110> you're<00:03:21.230> going<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.500> get<00:03:21.650> one<00:03:21.890> and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
in so if you're going to get one and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.890 
in so if you're going to get one and
play<00:03:22.280> with<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.670> suggest<00:03:23.270> if<00:03:23.570> you<00:03:23.750> have<00:03:23.870> a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
play with it I suggest if you have a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.500 
play with it I suggest if you have a
printer<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.530> be<00:03:25.010> nice<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.220> just<00:03:26.090> print<00:03:26.300> out

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
printer and be nice to just print out

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.810 
printer and be nice to just print out
the<00:03:26.630> instructions<00:03:26.989> on<00:03:27.500> how<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:28.100> do<00:03:28.550> all<00:03:28.670> the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
the instructions on how to do all the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.400 
the instructions on how to do all the
different<00:03:29.150> options<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.810> then<00:03:30.020> you<00:03:30.200> can

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
different options and then you can

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.320 
different options and then you can
easily<00:03:31.280> look<00:03:31.430> at<00:03:31.610> them<00:03:31.760> instead<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.060> having<00:03:32.239> to

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
easily look at them instead of having to

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.810 
easily look at them instead of having to
walk<00:03:32.480> back<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.750> forth<00:03:32.930> from<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.290> computer

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
walk back and forth from the computer

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.020 
walk back and forth from the computer
but<00:03:34.820> it<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.630> just<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:36.049> great<00:03:36.470> tool<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:37.130> can

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
but it is just a great tool I can

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.820 
but it is just a great tool I can
honestly<00:03:38.690> say<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:40.720> it's<00:03:41.720> made<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.380> tank<00:03:42.680> a

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
honestly say that it's made the tank a

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.400 
honestly say that it's made the tank a
lot<00:03:43.070> healthier<00:03:43.370> I've<00:03:44.030> got<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.330> lot<00:03:44.840> less<00:03:45.110> dead

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
lot healthier I've got a lot less dead

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.000 
lot healthier I've got a lot less dead
spots<00:03:45.799> I<00:03:46.040> don't<00:03:46.250> have<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:46.870> red<00:03:47.870> hair<00:03:48.560> algae

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
spots I don't have that red hair algae

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.949 
spots I don't have that red hair algae
stuff<00:03:49.310> growing<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.120> sand<00:03:50.420> bed<00:03:50.630> because<00:03:50.930> I

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
stuff growing on the sand bed because I

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.940 
stuff growing on the sand bed because I
don't<00:03:51.230> have<00:03:51.410> any<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.799> try<00:03:52.010> two<00:03:52.070> spots<00:03:52.489> anymore

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
don't have any to try two spots anymore

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.789 
don't have any to try two spots anymore
maybe<00:03:54.950> one<00:03:55.250> or<00:03:55.370> two<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:55.760> just<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:57.230> pump<00:03:57.500> has

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
maybe one or two but just the pump has

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.820 
maybe one or two but just the pump has
such<00:03:58.100> a<00:03:58.130> good<00:03:58.459> undertow<00:03:59.420> sucking<00:04:00.380> up<00:04:00.530> here

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
such a good undertow sucking up here

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.680 
such a good undertow sucking up here
which<00:04:00.980> means<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.430> spots<00:04:01.730> not<00:04:01.970> dead<00:04:02.239> and

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
which means this spots not dead and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.780 
which means this spots not dead and
blowing<00:04:03.049> over<00:04:03.230> here<00:04:03.709> which<00:04:04.100> means<00:04:04.280> this<00:04:04.519> bot

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
blowing over here which means this bot

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.300 
blowing over here which means this bot
did<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.110> great<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.920> takes<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.190> lot

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310
