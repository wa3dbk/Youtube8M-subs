00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.670
 hello dear spectator of the user so magath 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.160
 has asked me how dangerous because the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.289
 Most june delivers roma god i 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 but would like the answer which you have 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.450
 but the comment itself 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.500
 written how pitiful 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.430
 I get nobody is very many 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.690
 Comments 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.460
 That's why I only have to go again 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.719
 comment itself but write that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.690
 Do not just make me one 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.000
 bad people okay just about that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.489
 question to answer if because go knows 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.760
 is dangerous or it is important to me 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.480
 super what ever play the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.940
 Manipulation is every organism 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.239
 As you know, there are failures 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.039
 and her cell has a scent care and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.580
 in this is the chromosome 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.180
 world the genetic code so the dna 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.890
 that makes us what we are 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.650
 are in a way every summer the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.350
 chromosome with but we recognize one 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.090
 very long strand 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:30.810
 this is full of bio info in front of the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.299
 playing with a gene manipulation is 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.340
 the researchers made a code there 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.340
 Fragment easy to install 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.790
 but what does that only bring? 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.860
 nucleus controls by means of the chromosome 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.900
 everything 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.510
 in this cell so control the thought 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.940
 That must explain certain enzymes 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.720
 you create this dna strand macro too 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.880
 to save 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.070
 and from this a bit 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.150
 take out information in quasi-form 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.550
 a small rna beach afterwards 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.630
 the dna closes again as us 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.550
 will not win 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.520
 that's a biological one 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.770
 rock groups of these pirated leaves 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.720
 the cell nucleus and is in the cell of 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.209
 a lego song recorded for that 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.790
 ribosome, this rna is sort of a kind 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.030
 order to look over it was what it was 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.070
 has to do out of this and poses 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.840
 so certain photogenic as that makes 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.610
 ribosom it's just there and boiled 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.350
 to make it and what are and without 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.209
 be used force that is that 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.950
 this is the only way out of this income 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.950
 So you have, for example, in his 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.000
 son the information blue eyes 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.370
 saved because here this information 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.050
 out of the cell core circles out here 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.540
 People have taken a merger 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.310
 the ribosome produces which proteins 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.860
 who are responsible for that 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.450
 people but also has been so easy 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.989
 but now back to 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.810
 to grab 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.820
 what good is it for researchers to do this? 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.709
 artificial gene information on the spot in 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.709
 have installed this cell nucleus in case 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.880
 from genmais contains the information 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.120
 the built-in was nothing more than 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.340
 Produce poison so that arises 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.900
 almost the information but also 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.180
 the white helps a little bit more 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.519
 is therefore all possible to poison 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.190
 produce which a certain caterpillar 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.430
 attacks most of the time always clatters and 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.530
 the robots from stern and never again in 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.549
 experience a beautiful butterfly 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.190
 many small-minded and can be 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.670
 other politicians are the csu cdu 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.670
 now here 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.660
 Basically, the corn is not 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.360
 poisonous he is poison producing 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.530
 why was other know us completely 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:04:00.019
 but now it is killing people 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:02.390
 maybe not immediately but it wants that 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.239
 bees and other insects or 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.430
 crawl beetle with and bring the now 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.700
 not exactly unnecessary for the environment 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.830
 and what in turn are long term 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.590
 consider effects on the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.380
 environment has and also on humans there 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:31.310
 are the experts and the researchers 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:34.010
 agree namely and this statement means 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.160
 now nothing more than that 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.510
 on a scale of it happens 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.460
 nothing at all up to all 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.860
 Organisms on this planet 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.389
 blur 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:55.760
 there is a value about borja where there 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:59.030
 The person pink risk can be approximately 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.940
 so too is the accumulation of allergy 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.710
 people are still behind allagui 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.389
 you got on an allergy too 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.740
 that is the reason for family cameroon and 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.620
 other substances in ours 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.510
 next ones are in there and there is always 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.720
 but no matter with this video 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.720
 wanted 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.930
 With this video I just wanted you 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.930
 explain a little bit what needs to be done and 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.340
 So the debate is coming now 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.030
 apparently again high or will be back 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.030
 discreet 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:47.260
 Now I want with my chromosomes 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.260
 yes, anyway
