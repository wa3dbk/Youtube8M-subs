00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
visuals for the particular 3d you know

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.759 
visuals for the particular 3d you know
for<00:03:45.729> the<00:03:45.790> 3ds<00:03:46.060> unit<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:46.959> also<00:03:47.139> to<00:03:47.319> get<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.739> the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
for the 3ds unit but also to get the the

for the 3ds unit but also to get the the
3d<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.669> angles<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.359> pop<00:03:49.569> so<00:03:50.169> I

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
3d and the angles to really pop so I

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.110

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
got the game with friends that don't

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.850 
got the game with friends that don't
have<00:06:34.540> it<00:06:34.690> so<00:06:35.200> how<00:06:35.350> does<00:06:35.410> that<00:06:35.590> going<00:06:35.770> to<00:06:35.830> work

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
have it so how does that going to work

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.220 
have it so how does that going to work
so<00:06:36.580> basically<00:06:37.060> you<00:06:37.390> under<00:06:37.600> the<00:06:37.690> download<00:06:38.050> play

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
so basically you under the download play

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.800 
so basically you under the download play
option<00:06:38.440> menu<00:06:38.770> or<00:06:39.160> menu<00:06:39.430> option<00:06:39.790> and<00:06:39.970> then<00:06:40.060> it's

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
option menu or menu option and then it's

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.640 
option menu or menu option and then it's
really<00:06:41.050> simple<00:06:41.230> so<00:06:41.440> I

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
really simple so I

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.200
