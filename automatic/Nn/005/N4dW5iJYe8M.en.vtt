00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
dogs well the first thing that probably

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.410 
dogs well the first thing that probably
comes<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.560> mind<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.010> weight<00:00:26.340> loss<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:27.240> like

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
comes to mind is weight loss just like

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.630 
comes to mind is weight loss just like
us<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.380> start<00:00:28.769> working<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.400> weights

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
us if we start working out with weights

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.120 
us if we start working out with weights
whether<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.689> lifting<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.560> walking<00:00:32.009> with

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
whether it be lifting or walking with

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
whether it be lifting or walking with
leg<00:00:32.430> weights<00:00:32.669> we're<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.510> build<00:00:33.750> lean

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
leg weights we're going to build lean

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.979 
leg weights we're going to build lean
muscle<00:00:34.770> mass<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.280> get<00:00:35.460> our<00:00:35.610> metabolism<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.660> be

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
muscle mass and get our metabolism to be

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
muscle mass and get our metabolism to be
healthy<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.620> active<00:00:37.770> same<00:00:38.579> thing<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.000> our

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090

before you leave for work try a weighted

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.310 
before you leave for work try a weighted
vest<00:00:49.710> maybe<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.280> only<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.809> time<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.079> 10

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
vest maybe you only have time for a 10

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
vest maybe you only have time for a 10
minute<00:00:52.559> walk<00:00:52.590> when<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> need<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> 30

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
minute walk when really you need a 30

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.330 
minute walk when really you need a 30

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
minute jog throw on a weighted vest and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.810 
minute jog throw on a weighted vest and
that<00:00:56.489> dog<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.210> tired<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.489> lastly<00:00:59.489> but

that dog will get tired and lastly but

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.970 
that dog will get tired and lastly but
maybe<00:01:00.210> most<00:01:00.539> importantly<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> dog

that's aggression or nervous anxiety

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.469 
that's aggression or nervous anxiety
that<00:01:07.260> cause<00:01:07.470> destructive<00:01:08.220> behavior<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.299> your

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that cause destructive behavior at your

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
that cause destructive behavior at your
home<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.930> weighted<00:01:10.619> vest<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.520> them

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
home a weighted vest can really get them

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.820 
home a weighted vest can really get them
tired<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:13.170> them<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> right

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
tired out and get them in the right

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.850 
tired out and get them in the right
frame<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> mind<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> they<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:16.110> better<00:01:16.380> behaved

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
frame of mind so they are better behaved

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
frame of mind so they are better behaved
and<00:01:17.130> curbed<00:01:17.520> whatever<00:01:18.210> behavioral<00:01:18.840> issue

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and curbed whatever behavioral issue

and curbed whatever behavioral issue
you're<00:01:19.229> having<00:01:19.430> how<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.759> use<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.360> weighted

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you're having how do we use a weighted

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.130 
you're having how do we use a weighted
vest<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.080> dogs<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.770> easy<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.020> start<00:01:25.020> off

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
vest for dogs so easy you can start off

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
vest for dogs so easy you can start off
by<00:01:25.170> putting<00:01:25.590> 10<00:01:26.369> percent<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.150> dog's<00:01:27.420> body

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
by putting 10 percent of your dog's body

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
by putting 10 percent of your dog's body
weight<00:01:28.110> into<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:30.329> vest<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> 60

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
weight into the vest so if you have a 60

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.179 
weight into the vest so if you have a 60
pound<00:01:32.220> dog<00:01:32.579> start<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:34.049> 6<00:01:34.500> pounds
