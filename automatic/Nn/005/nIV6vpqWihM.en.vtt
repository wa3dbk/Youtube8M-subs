LNG's<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:20.760> talking<00:00:21.119> about<00:00:21.210> suppressor<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
LNG's I'm talking about suppressor the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920 
LNG's I'm talking about suppressor the
suppressor<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:24.300> little<00:00:24.539> bit<00:00:24.630> unreliable

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
suppressor is a little bit unreliable

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
suppressor is a little bit unreliable
because<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.039> all<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.550> puts<00:00:26.910> weight<00:00:27.240> on

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
because first of all it puts weight on

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.990 
because first of all it puts weight on
the<00:00:27.689> tip<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.930> your<00:00:28.140> weapon<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.220> hip<00:00:29.699> fire

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the tip of your weapon so hip fire

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.049 
the tip of your weapon so hip fire
accuracy<00:00:30.359> will<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:31.050> reduced<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.940> when<00:00:32.940> you're

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
accuracy will be reduced and when you're

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.150 
accuracy will be reduced and when you're
shooting<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.750> aiming<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> sights<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
hip the bullet drop of start sooner

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.799 
hip the bullet drop of start sooner
which<00:00:39.960> means<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.040> enemy<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:42.000> 20

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.230 
the head even if you're using a
suppressor<00:01:03.960> will<00:01:04.500> deal<00:01:04.799> huge<00:01:05.430> amount<00:01:06.030> of

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
suppressor will deal huge amount of

suppressor the other huge advantage

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.929 
suppressor the other huge advantage
gives<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.280> concealed<00:01:11.700> from

they<00:01:27.659> were<00:01:27.720> capturing<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> delta<00:01:28.710> flag<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
they were capturing the delta flag and I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
they were capturing the delta flag and I
wanted<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> spawn<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:29.939> immediately<00:01:30.180> but

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
wanted to spawn there immediately but

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.569 
wanted to spawn there immediately but
now<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> got<00:01:31.590> killed<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.070> had<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> time<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
now I got killed I had the time to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.390 
now I got killed I had the time to
remove<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> foregrip<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.530> switch<00:01:34.950> from

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
remove the foregrip and it switch from

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
remove the foregrip and it switch from
claymore<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.060> c4<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.740> reason<00:01:38.189> why<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
claymore to c4 and the reason why I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.920 
claymore to c4 and the reason why I
remove<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> foregrip<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:39.720> when<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
remove the foregrip is because when you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
remove the foregrip is because when you
combine<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> foregrip<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> suppressor<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
combine a foregrip with a suppressor it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.980 
combine a foregrip with a suppressor it
will<00:01:42.570> give<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> name<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> curacy<00:01:44.070> penalty

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
will give you a name the curacy penalty

stacking attachments was not cool and
that<00:01:53.340> kinda<00:01:53.640> defeats<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> purpose<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that kinda defeats the purpose of

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
huge huge opportunity to kill multiple

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.270 
huge huge opportunity to kill multiple
enemies<00:03:09.269> look<00:03:09.930> just<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.470> see<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.100> saw

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
enemies look just like you see you saw

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.070 
enemies look just like you see you saw
before<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.640> feel<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.060> four<00:03:12.480> or<00:03:12.600> five<00:03:12.630> guys

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
before I feel like four or five guys

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.440 
before I feel like four or five guys
they<00:03:13.800> were<00:03:13.860> they<00:03:14.430> never<00:03:14.700> knew<00:03:14.940> where<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.150> was

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
they were they never knew where I was

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.420 
they were they never knew where I was
and<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.989> was<00:03:16.140> always<00:03:16.410> moving<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.190> changing

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
and I was always moving and changing

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.569 
and I was always moving and changing
positions<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.720> using<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.140> suppressor

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
positions so using the suppressor

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.100 
positions so using the suppressor
definitely<00:03:20.579> gives<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> huge<00:03:21.360> advantage<00:03:21.540> if

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
definitely gives you a huge advantage if

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.650 
definitely gives you a huge advantage if
you<00:03:22.620> are<00:03:22.769> playing<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.250> an<00:03:23.430> LNG<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.329> cool

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
you are playing with an LNG on a cool

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
they are not dynamic at all because they

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.990
