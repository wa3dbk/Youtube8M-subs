up after a researcher or Pokemon the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
up after a researcher or Pokemon the
choice<00:01:29.759> item<00:01:30.180> our<00:01:30.420> Pokemon<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.380> will

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
choice item our Pokemon will get will

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
choice item our Pokemon will get will
not<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.369> choice<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:33.540> will<00:01:33.659> roll<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> dice

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
not be our choice we will roll the dice

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.289 
not be our choice we will roll the dice
to<00:01:34.560> determine<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:35.220> item<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> Pokemon<00:01:36.060> gets

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
to determine which item the Pokemon gets

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.450 
to determine which item the Pokemon gets
so<00:01:36.900> not<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> our<00:01:37.710> Pokemon<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.310> be

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so not all of our Pokemon would be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.030 
so not all of our Pokemon would be
necessarily<00:01:39.119> getting<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.140> benefit<00:01:40.680> from<00:01:40.860> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
necessarily getting a benefit from this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.810 
necessarily getting a benefit from this
item<00:01:41.810> example<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.619> slow<00:01:43.979> poke<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.430> like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
item example a really slow poke one like

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.210 
item example a really slow poke one like
nosepass<00:01:45.329> could<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:46.020> handed<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> choice<00:01:46.799> scarf

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
nosepass could be handed a choice scarf

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
nosepass could be handed a choice scarf
since<00:01:47.939> he's<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.390> slow<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
since he's really slow in with it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
since he's really slow in with it
wouldn't<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.280> help<00:01:50.490> him<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.909> all

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210

wouldn't really help him out at all

we<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.810> thought<00:01:57.960> making<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.409> mandatory<00:01:58.740> for

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
we just thought making a mandatory for

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.590 
we just thought making a mandatory for
having<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> Pokemon<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> hold<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.240> choice<00:02:00.420> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
having the Pokemon to hold a choice I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
having the Pokemon to hold a choice I
would<00:02:00.630> make<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> interesting<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:01.979> won't

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
would make it interesting and we won't

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.590 
would make it interesting and we won't

causes you guys can choose to play by

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.089 
causes you guys can choose to play by
one<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.810> these<00:02:10.899> rules<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.409> that<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:11.830> black

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
one of these rules is that if you black

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.339 
one of these rules is that if you black
out<00:02:12.280> he'd<00:02:12.879> usually<00:02:13.120> be<00:02:13.480> considered<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.140> game

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
out he'd usually be considered a game

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.050 
out he'd usually be considered a game
over<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.430> would<00:02:15.519> be<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.790> end<00:02:15.909> of<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
over and that would be the end of the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.119 
over and that would be the end of the
lock<00:02:16.209> challenge<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:17.290> if<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:17.530> have<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.709> Pokemon

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
lock challenge but if you have a Pokemon

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.190 
lock challenge but if you have a Pokemon
you<00:02:18.250> can<00:02:18.400> use<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.730> PC<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.599> can<00:02:19.750> continue

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
you can use in the PC you can continue

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.199 
you can use in the PC you can continue
if<00:02:20.379> you'd<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.769> another<00:02:21.459> optional<00:02:21.849> rule<00:02:22.060> is

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
if you'd like another optional rule is

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.880 
if you'd like another optional rule is
that<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.450> can<00:02:22.599> have<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.810> battle<00:02:23.140> style<00:02:23.319> onset

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
that you can have the battle style onset

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.289 
that you can have the battle style onset
if<00:02:24.370> you've<00:02:24.459> got<00:02:24.640> no<00:02:24.730> idea<00:02:24.940> what<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.180> means

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
if you've got no idea what that means

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.150 
if you've got no idea what that means
basically<00:02:25.900> if<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.560> take<00:02:26.680> care<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.920> trainers

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
basically if you take care of trainers

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.710 
basically if you take care of trainers
pokémon<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.760> their<00:02:27.879> bets<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.150> another<00:02:28.540> one

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
pokémon in their bets and another one

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.240 
pokémon in their bets and another one
you<00:02:28.989> don't<00:02:29.110> get<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.440> option<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.739> switch<00:02:29.980> out

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
you don't get the option to switch out

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.280 
you don't get the option to switch out
you'll<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.000> hard<00:02:31.269> switch<00:02:31.599> if<00:02:32.019> you're

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
you'll have the hard switch if you're

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.690 
you'll have the hard switch if you're
matched<00:02:32.470> up<00:02:32.680> as<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.830> Pokemon<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.310> don't<00:02:33.489> like

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
matched up as a Pokemon you don't like

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.610 
matched up as a Pokemon you don't like
that's<00:02:34.269> making<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.840> more<00:02:34.959> challenging

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
that's making it more challenging

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.380 
that's making it more challenging
I'd<00:02:35.920> recommend<00:02:36.280> always<00:02:36.579> following<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.180> rule

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
I'd recommend always following this rule

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.149 
I'd recommend always following this rule
because<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.140> really<00:02:38.530> does<00:02:38.739> make<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.010> difference

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
because it really does make a difference

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.430 
because it really does make a difference
the<00:02:40.030> best<00:02:40.209> example<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.720> give<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.200> guess

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
the best example I can give you I guess

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.229 
the best example I can give you I guess
is<00:02:41.620> my<00:02:41.799> Pokemon<00:02:42.190> X<00:02:42.340> egg<00:02:42.519> lock<00:02:42.730> when<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.940> had<00:02:43.150> to

shove it in bowel entry character in a

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.069 
shove it in bowel entry character in a
Pokemon<00:02:45.549> then<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:45.910> send<00:02:46.150> in<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.359> door<00:02:46.569> duel<00:02:46.780> I

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
Pokemon then they send in a door duel I

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.569 
Pokemon then they send in a door duel I
go<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.500> switch<00:02:47.709> my<00:02:47.829> shut<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.129> eyes<00:02:48.280> into<00:02:48.549> a

go to switch my shut that eyes into a

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
barren Pokemon that would deal with the
