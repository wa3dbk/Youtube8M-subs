now<00:00:17.230> there<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:17.500> a<00:00:17.529> difference<00:00:17.980> between<00:00:18.130> the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
now there is a difference between the

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.580 
now there is a difference between the
hard<00:00:18.700> ballistic<00:00:19.270> and<00:00:19.420> soft<00:00:19.720> ballistic<00:00:20.259> but

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
hard ballistic and soft ballistic but

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.470 
hard ballistic and soft ballistic but
this<00:00:20.770> particular<00:00:21.099> soft<00:00:21.550> ballistic<00:00:22.119> is<00:00:22.240> more

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
this particular soft ballistic is more

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.510 
this particular soft ballistic is more
like<00:00:22.720> a<00:00:22.750> bullet<00:00:23.140> resistance<00:00:23.860> which<00:00:24.099> slows

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
like a bullet resistance which slows

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.690 
like a bullet resistance which slows
down<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:25.470> speed<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:26.800> bullet<00:00:26.950> as<00:00:27.279> soon<00:00:27.550> as

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
down the speed of the bullet as soon as

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.569 
down the speed of the bullet as soon as
it<00:00:27.849> hit<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.119> plane<00:00:28.540> so<00:00:29.169> say<00:00:29.380> can<00:00:29.710> we<00:00:29.919> come<00:00:30.550> up

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
it hit the plane so say can we come up

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.690 
it hit the plane so say can we come up
with<00:00:30.849> a<00:00:30.880> ballistic<00:00:31.149> vest<00:00:31.689> with<00:00:32.140> some<00:00:32.410> natural

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
with a ballistic vest with some natural

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.720 
with a ballistic vest with some natural
fiber<00:00:33.700> in<00:00:33.970> it<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.270> bling<00:00:34.780> which<00:00:35.680> will<00:00:35.920> add<00:00:36.190> some

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
fiber in it a bling which will add some

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.810 
fiber in it a bling which will add some
comfort<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.480> other<00:00:38.370> properties<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.700> the

existing ballistic the object of the
ballistic<00:00:42.820> vest<00:00:43.179> is<00:00:43.390> first<00:00:43.629> of<00:00:43.750> all<00:00:43.839> to<00:00:44.019> stop

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
ballistic vest is first of all to stop

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.130 
ballistic vest is first of all to stop
penetration<00:00:45.269> so<00:00:46.269> you<00:00:46.600> don't<00:00:46.780> want<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:46.960> draw

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
penetration so you don't want to draw

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.220 
penetration so you don't want to draw
blood<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:48.460> more<00:00:48.699> importantly<00:00:49.210> also<00:00:49.719> you

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
blood but more importantly also you

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.500 
blood but more importantly also you
don't<00:00:50.440> want<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:51.039> have<00:00:51.309> what<00:00:51.519> they<00:00:51.609> call<00:00:51.850> blanks

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
don't want to have what they call blanks

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.779 
don't want to have what they call blanks
or<00:00:52.690> injury<00:00:53.109> at<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.320> back<00:00:53.469> so<00:00:54.339> in<00:00:54.429> other<00:00:54.550> words

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
or injury at the back so in other words

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.090 
or injury at the back so in other words
the<00:00:55.719> bullet<00:00:55.989> doesn't<00:00:56.199> actually<00:00:56.499> go<00:00:56.859> through

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
the bullet doesn't actually go through

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.549 
the bullet doesn't actually go through
the<00:00:57.339> fabrics<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.539> has<00:00:58.749> such<00:00:58.989> an<00:00:59.140> impact

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
the fabrics but it has such an impact

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.470 
the fabrics but it has such an impact
that<00:00:59.649> it<00:00:59.890> mush<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.339> up<00:01:00.489> your<00:01:00.670> insides<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.359> you

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
that it mush is up your insides and you

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.540 
that it mush is up your insides and you
actually<00:01:01.780> bleed<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.199> death<00:01:02.230> internally<00:01:02.559> so

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
actually bleed to death internally so

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.799 
actually bleed to death internally so
you've<00:01:03.730> got<00:01:03.819> two<00:01:03.999> problems<00:01:04.269> you've<00:01:04.600> got<00:01:04.690> to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
you've got two problems you've got to

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.350 
you've got two problems you've got to
solve<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.890> object<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.490> adding<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.909> wall<00:01:07.090> is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
solve the object of adding the wall is

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.050 
solve the object of adding the wall is
not<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:08.409> stop<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.770> bullet<00:01:09.070> but<00:01:09.550> to<00:01:09.700> make<00:01:09.909> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
not to stop the bullet but to make the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.149 
not to stop the bullet but to make the
Kevlar<00:01:10.420> work<00:01:10.659> more<00:01:10.900> efficiently<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.890> can

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
Kevlar work more efficiently so you can

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.649 
Kevlar work more efficiently so you can
actually<00:01:12.310> sort<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:12.729> see<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:12.970> that's<00:01:13.330> what<00:01:13.450> it

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
actually sort of see that that's what it

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.390 
actually sort of see that that's what it
started<00:01:14.110> off<00:01:14.260> looking<00:01:14.470> like<00:01:14.680> there's<00:01:15.220> the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
started off looking like there's the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.000 
started off looking like there's the
front<00:01:15.580> of<00:01:15.730> it<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.050> that's<00:01:17.050> what<00:01:17.440> are<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.770> ends

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
front of it and that's what are the ends

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.220 
front of it and that's what are the ends
up<00:01:18.400> looking<00:01:18.730> like<00:01:18.940> it<00:01:19.330> can<00:01:19.510> see<00:01:19.750> here<00:01:20.050> the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
up looking like it can see here the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.590 
up looking like it can see here the
crisscross<00:01:20.910> striations<00:01:21.910> where<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.390> actually

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
crisscross striations where it actually

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.140 
crisscross striations where it actually
got<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.050> imprint<00:01:23.440> of<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.980> fabric<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:24.760> down

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
got the imprint of the fabric and down

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.510 
got the imprint of the fabric and down
the<00:01:25.360> edge<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:25.930> see<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.740> striations

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
the edge you can see the striations

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.930 
the edge you can see the striations
where<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:28.060> bullet<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.810> has<00:01:29.140> pushed<00:01:29.530> through

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
where the bullet is has pushed through

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.730 
where the bullet is has pushed through
multiple<00:01:30.940> layers<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.990> certainly<00:01:32.320> formed

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
multiple layers and it certainly formed

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.340 
multiple layers and it certainly formed
into<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.040> nice<00:01:33.310> mushroom<00:01:34.030> shape<00:01:34.390> up<00:01:34.870> till<00:01:35.140> now

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
into a nice mushroom shape up till now

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.420 
into a nice mushroom shape up till now
only<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:37.000> vest<00:01:37.300> were<00:01:37.570> tested<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:39.130> dry

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
only this vest were tested for the dry

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.680 
only this vest were tested for the dry
conditions<00:01:40.060> but<00:01:43.830> since<00:01:44.830> last<00:01:45.340> two<00:01:45.610> years<00:01:45.910> the

government and all the defense industry

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.220 
government and all the defense industry
they're<00:01:48.970> saying<00:01:49.240> we<00:01:49.360> are<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.540> taste<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.020> waste

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
they're saying we are to taste the waste

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.410 
they're saying we are to taste the waste
in<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.710> wet<00:01:50.890> condition<00:01:51.400> as<00:01:51.520> well<00:01:51.790> if<00:01:52.120> you<00:01:52.270> got

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
in the wet condition as well if you got

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.330 
in the wet condition as well if you got
a<00:01:52.450> Kevlar<00:01:52.870> vest<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.260> if<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.160> weight

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
a Kevlar vest and if it in the weight

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.480 
a Kevlar vest and if it in the weight
then<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.330> will<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.440> can<00:01:56.620> easily<00:01:57.040> pass<00:01:57.280> but

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
then it will it can easily pass but

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.460 
then it will it can easily pass but
there<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.700> no<00:01:57.820> frictional<00:01:58.390> force<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:59.050> not

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
there is no frictional force that not

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.840 
there is no frictional force that not
enough<00:01:59.710> frictional<00:02:00.040> force<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.520> stop<00:02:00.820> the

enough frictional force to stop the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.480 
enough frictional force to stop the
bullet<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.170> more<00:02:02.470> interactive<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.280> water

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
bullet so it more interactive the water
