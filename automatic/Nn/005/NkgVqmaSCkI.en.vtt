00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
go into it it's going to say change

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
go into it it's going to say change
window<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.060> keyboard<00:01:51.570> animation<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.920> is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
window or keyboard animation and this is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.440 
window or keyboard animation and this is
pretty<00:01:53.220> cool<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> change<00:01:54.299> the

pretty cool so if you want to change the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.910 
pretty cool so if you want to change the
window<00:01:54.689> animation<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> these

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
window animation you have all of these

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
window animation you have all of these
different<00:01:56.270> things<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.509> let's<00:01:57.750> say<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
different things so let's say we want to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.639 
different things so let's say we want to
change<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.710> bouncy<00:01:59.460> and<00:02:00.229> then<00:02:01.229> let's<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.500> ahead

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
change it bouncy and then let's go ahead

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.840 
change it bouncy and then let's go ahead
and<00:02:01.740> change<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> keyboard<00:02:02.280> animation<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.500> UM

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
and change the keyboard animation to UM

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.130 
and change the keyboard animation to UM
photon<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.390> let's<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.630> ahead<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> apply

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
photon and then let's go ahead and apply

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.290 
photon and then let's go ahead and apply
it<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> then<00:02:07.920> reboot<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:09.090> pretty

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it and then reboot and that's pretty

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.999 
it and then reboot and that's pretty
much<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.780> build<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.289> framework<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
much going to build up the framework and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.600 
much going to build up the framework and
then

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
then

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.310 
then
boot<00:02:11.760> our<00:02:12.000> device<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.570> now<00:02:12.600> be<00:02:12.870> back<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.260> guys

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
phone is rebooted hopefully those

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.680 
phone is rebooted hopefully those
animations<00:02:17.310> will<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.970> set<00:02:18.240> its<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.540> ahead

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
animations will now be set its go ahead

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.540 
animations will now be set its go ahead
and<00:02:18.780> unlock<00:02:19.110> our<00:02:19.320> device<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.190> see

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and unlock our device and you can see

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.120 
and unlock our device and you can see
now<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.760> sort<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.480> bouncy<00:02:22.350> animations<00:02:22.980> to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
now that sort of a bouncy animations to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.630 
now that sort of a bouncy animations to
go<00:02:23.310> into<00:02:23.430> um<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:24.840> think<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:25.950> only<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> window

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
go into um I think it's only the window

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.430 
go into um I think it's only the window
animation<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.870> transition

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
animation so if it's just a transition

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.870 
animation so if it's just a transition
that<00:02:28.560> it's<00:02:28.710> not<00:02:28.830> going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.160> do<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> ba<00:02:29.580> let's<00:02:29.700> go

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
that it's not going to do a ba let's go

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.970 
that it's not going to do a ba let's go
ahead<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.060> unlock<00:02:30.360> our<00:02:30.570> device<00:02:30.810> again<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.710> as

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
ahead and unlock our device again and as

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.620 
ahead and unlock our device again and as
you<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.250> see<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.670> sort<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.060> bouncy

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
you can see it's sort of like a bouncy

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.600 
you can see it's sort of like a bouncy
animation<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:34.770> really<00:02:35.190> cool<00:02:35.580> actually

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
animation so that's really cool actually

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.020 
animation so that's really cool actually
I<00:02:36.680> really<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.130> go<00:02:38.520> ahead<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.820> try<00:02:39.000> that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
I really like that go ahead and try that

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.260 
I really like that go ahead and try that
one<00:02:39.360> more<00:02:39.390> time<00:02:40.160> unlock<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.550> does<00:02:41.910> just

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
one more time unlock it and does just

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.699 
one more time unlock it and does just
like<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.840> course<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.110> can<00:02:43.260> edit<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
like that and of course you can edit the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.070 
like that and of course you can edit the
speed<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.490> transition<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.390> developer

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
speed of that transition in developer

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.900 
speed of that transition in developer
options<00:02:46.470> if<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.860> ever<00:02:47.010> wanted<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.400> go<00:02:47.580> slower

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
options if you ever wanted to go slower

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.540 
options if you ever wanted to go slower
and<00:02:48.240> also<00:02:48.930> what<00:02:49.770> they<00:02:49.950> added<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.370> the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
and also what they added just the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.340 
and also what they added just the
keyboard<00:02:50.970> animation<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.780> let's<00:02:52.110> go<00:02:52.200> ahead<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
keyboard animation so let's go ahead and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.800 
keyboard animation so let's go ahead and
go<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.500> messaging<00:02:53.130> let's<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.150> New<00:02:54.330> let's<00:02:54.660> go

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
go to messaging let's go to New let's go

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.330 
go to messaging let's go to New let's go
right<00:02:55.050> up<00:02:55.200> here<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.560> can<00:02:55.830> actually<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
right up here you can actually see the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
right up here you can actually see the
animation<00:02:56.610> right<00:02:56.880> there<00:02:57.090> go<00:02:57.690> ahead<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.840> type

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
animation right there go ahead and type

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.199 
animation right there go ahead and type
around<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.590> then<00:02:58.680> when<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.860> click<00:02:58.980> home<00:02:59.370> you

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
around and then when you click home you

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.370 
around and then when you click home you
can<00:03:00.360> see<00:03:00.510> there<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.959> sort<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.200> does<00:03:01.350> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
can see there that it sort of does a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.620 
can see there that it sort of does a
really<00:03:01.650> cool<00:03:02.000> animation<00:03:03.000> downwards<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
really cool animation downwards and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.000 
really cool animation downwards and
that's<00:03:03.780> really<00:03:03.930> cool<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> go<00:03:04.680> back<00:03:04.830> in

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that's really cool so if you go back in

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
that's really cool so if you go back in
here<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.239> sort<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.570> flows<00:03:06.780> out<00:03:07.020> right

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
here it just sort of flows out right

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.040 
here it just sort of flows out right
like<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.800> that's<00:03:07.950> pretty<00:03:08.489> cool<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.090> like

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
like that and that's pretty cool I like

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.080 
like that and that's pretty cool I like
that<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.260> lot<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> wide<00:03:11.580> variety<00:03:11.820> of

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
that a lot so you have a wide variety of

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.660 
that a lot so you have a wide variety of
transitions<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.140> animations<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:14.280> customize

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
transitions and animations to customize
