 loved to paint on decorative face 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.270

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.310
 office to ip address ow nose and mustache then 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.090
 could well have swept away traces 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.080
 put in place and wash well 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.820
 today's children are much more fortunate 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.960
 Sofia tell me please do you like drawings 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.270
 and who do you love that you can draw 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.780
 like this, modern children can now 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.540
 do this 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.640
 openly and professionally face painting it 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.510
 skim cosmetic paint on 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.820
 water based 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.100
 it's as thin as powder but not 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.690
 bold in quality of safety it 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.550
 an analogue of conventional cosmetics 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.379
 Kristina Melnikova and a year ago 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.190
 offered to work aqua make-up artists 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.440
 children's cafe 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.869
 there was no experience with this girl 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.649
 but already had the skills of a hairdresser 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.560
 makeup artist 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.380
 nail designers and everything turned out 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.390
 brush the most mundane say 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.380
 some use ordinary for 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:22.210
 drawing they are softer i use 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.200
 harder vordta tougher and he 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.610
 it will be better to draw a line for 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.340
 smooth transitions better to use 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.380
 sponge in the mask now and which will be 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.070
 to draw kristina there are such 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.549
 transitions 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.430
 drawing complex mannequin 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.910
 classmate Katerina 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.530
 was one of my sister's house and or a 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.110
 topped the world wall so that she 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.830
 came up with various vivid images for 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.820
 guests but the most decided on this 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.310
 what did you think that this is for kids sets 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.860
 for lifting there are crayons especially love them 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.650
 children who do not sit in one place but 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.950
 and the result is less spectacular their 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.479
 can be used as 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.820
 contour yes let 's say such a flower 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.940
 then you can paint over the helmets 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.130
 the threshold of the case start with a white draw 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.260
 akvagrimu hard for me but that's good 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 the result comes with the experience of Christina 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.390
 remembers the busiest day 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.150
 work 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.520
 September 1 when painted with 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.860
 partner about 70 people 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.350
 we had one mommy with her 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.620
 the child who walked us every 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.180
 weekends and when cotton last 1 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.760
 September we had the last worker 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.989
 day and she was so upset that we already 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.690
 all shut down 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.400
 and finally, the analogue asked us 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.390
 it painted here in such beautiful 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.430
 patterns 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.100
 that is, it was practically all of them 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.980
 face painted a lot of sparkles all 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.380
 It was brightly distracted from the face of the future 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.660
 mom draws on her round belly 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.060
 everything from butterflies to mouth-watering vegetables and 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.640
 fruit berries to cool toon 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.860
 more often this is the case for photo sessions but 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.500
 psychologists see this as another 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.350
 favor when drawing is drawn only 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.680
 as if there are two spaces then 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.630
 what's inside is what's outside and it's such 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.850
 here can be some kind of emotional 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.650
 sensual dance or what that such a 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.090
 tandem in which a pregnant can 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.220
 transform yourself a little by 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.709
 colors yes and maybe more 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.480
 relax but most of all emotions 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.519
 face drawings are burning 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.970
 children next children's holidays already 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.680
 rush, use this practice yellow 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.060
 come on 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.310
 I go with whom they want to become 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.650
 Irina Bernikova already spends holidays 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.380
 five years came to this area completely 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.360
 another area of ​​jurisprudence too 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.360
 it became boring for a woman to sit in the office 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.760
 I feel the year I myself want butterflies 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.239
 to fly 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:03.049
 drew. chased the same case without 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:10.430
 this web of Akis we also 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:11.420
 possesses washington 's forever gives 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.280
 children choose an image 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.280
 most frequent orders from boys 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.970
 spiderman pirate girls butterfly 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.919
 Princess 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.370
 but it’s impossible to work with children 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.410
 template boys they look such 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.840
 cartoons that even unknown to me 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.940
 for example, here 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.800
 I had the first impression 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.160
 uncertainty is like a boy to me 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.400
 said 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.800
 draw me dumb write well to 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.139
 get out of this situation how is he 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.330
 looked at divided by force and right there at 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.520
 we have three questions worth daw 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.830
 after drawing the behavior of children 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.040
 changing like a wave of a magic wand 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.760
 and this is a fact of reason and here lies in 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.430
 psychology 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.130
 Well, like if he feel 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.199
 this anger maybe there is some not 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.330
 I know the ban on the manifestation of anger in 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.419
 boy or girl thanks to such 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.770
 Here are the masks from the colors on the face, he can this 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.450
 anger somehow vymes 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.790
 that is just a parent you might think 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.669
 how does he relate in general when his 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.800
 the child but now shows negative 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.570
 feelings if there is a strict ban u can 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.880
 be 100 this time catch by the way 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.039
 the face painting is washed off easily with warm water and 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.990
 soap paint hypoallergenic 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.620
 so fit even for the most 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.620
 little ones 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.700
 well it 's time to look at the tigress 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.860
 to make the mask play even more beautiful we add 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.240
 sequins it's time to show katik as 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.240
 changed her appearance 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.259
 I think the next holidays are 14 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.599
 February 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:55.050
 I think that Kristina me something else 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:57.059
 visit the era of black and white 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.309
 television in cameras used 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:01.469
 red filters because of what is red 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:04.110
 lipstick made the lips on the screen pale 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:06.779
 so announcer and actresses on television 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.279
 asked for green blush and lipstick and 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:15.319
 it looked like this you and your life 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.319
 you more bright colors yet
