00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that's on the climate control and it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.480 
that's on the climate control and it
tells<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:19.260> sorts<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.680> stuff<00:00:19.890> about<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.279> car

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
that I know first thing I do is start

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.000 
that I know first thing I do is start
the<00:00:35.850> car

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.970 

all<00:00:43.550> right<00:00:43.960> now<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.170> car<00:00:45.350> is<00:00:45.470> running<00:00:45.620> or

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
all right now that the car is running or

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.440 
all right now that the car is running or
you<00:00:46.220> can<00:00:46.370> do<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.760> on<00:00:46.880> position<00:00:47.120> but

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
you can do this in the on position but

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.979 
you can do this in the on position but
it's<00:00:48.230> not<00:00:48.320> gonna<00:00:48.470> be<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.650> whole<00:00:48.800> lot<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.070> guess

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.520 

now<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.649> do<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.420> hold<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.899> button<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
now we do is you hold the off button and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.740 
now we do is you hold the off button and
the<00:00:58.920> temperature<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.550> button<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.510> same

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the temperature up button at the same

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640 
the temperature up button at the same
time<00:01:01.050> watch<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> screen

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.070 

there<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.340> go<00:01:06.670> now<00:01:07.090> we're<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.480> diagnostic

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
there you go now we're in the diagnostic

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.370 
there you go now we're in the diagnostic
mode<00:01:08.230> to<00:01:08.470> his<00:01:08.560> little<00:01:08.800> check<00:01:09.450> okay<00:01:10.480> now<00:01:11.140> use

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
mode to his little check okay now use

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.950 
mode to his little check okay now use
the<00:01:11.530> fan<00:01:11.770> up<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.250> down<00:01:12.400> buttons<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:13.660> scroll

the fan up and down buttons to scroll

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.680 
the fan up and down buttons to scroll
through<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.350> codes<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:15.310> tells<00:01:15.640> us<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.420> there

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
through the codes it tells us that there

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.090 
through the codes it tells us that there
is<00:01:16.720> from<00:01:17.260> 0<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:18.760> 38<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.780> doesn't<00:01:20.140> list<00:01:20.380> with<00:01:21.070> all

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
is from 0 to 38 it doesn't list with all

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.010 
is from 0 to 38 it doesn't list with all
these<00:01:21.310> do<00:01:21.550> it<00:01:21.700> only<00:01:21.850> lists<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.270> handful<00:01:22.690> of<00:01:22.750> them

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
these do it only lists a handful of them

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.300 
these do it only lists a handful of them
now<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.350> one<00:01:23.560> I'm<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.710> first<00:01:24.040> one<00:01:24.100> going<00:01:24.250> to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.550 

vehicle<00:02:42.730> speed<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.360> 14<00:02:43.840> let's<00:02:44.080> check<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.440> out

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:30.240 

well<00:02:49.560> let's<00:02:49.739> see<00:02:49.830> if<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:49.980> works

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.820 

seems<00:03:31.250> pretty<00:03:31.430> accurate<00:03:31.730> compared<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
seems pretty accurate compared to the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.339 
seems pretty accurate compared to the
long<00:03:33.830> one<00:03:34.720> there<00:03:35.720> are<00:03:35.780> things<00:03:35.959> I'm<00:03:36.080> working<00:03:36.230> on

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
long one there are things I'm working on

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.199 
long one there are things I'm working on
now<00:03:39.349> to<00:03:39.409> get<00:03:40.190> out<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:40.489> mode<00:03:40.700> so<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.090> you

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
now to get out of this mode so that you

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.640

can<00:03:41.360> use<00:03:41.480> your<00:03:41.569> heater<00:03:41.810> AC<00:03:42.019> while<00:03:42.470> you're

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
can use your heater AC while you're

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.149 
can use your heater AC while you're
driving

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
driving

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.850 
driving

back
I<00:03:47.819> remember<00:03:48.510> there's<00:03:48.659> a<00:03:48.750> lot<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:48.989> codes<00:03:49.200> in

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
I remember there's a lot of codes in

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.880 
I remember there's a lot of codes in
there<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.819> lot<00:03:50.819> of<00:03:50.909> stuff<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.769> heating<00:03:52.769> and

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
there a lot of stuff for the heating and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.649 
there a lot of stuff for the heating and
air-conditioning<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.760> walls<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.480> know<00:03:54.569> I'm

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
air-conditioning and walls you know I'm

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.910 
air-conditioning and walls you know I'm
just<00:03:54.780> Diagnostics<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.590> rest<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.830> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
just Diagnostics for the rest of the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.149 
just Diagnostics for the rest of the
cars<00:03:56.129> so<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.549> careful<00:03:56.819> what<00:03:56.909> you<00:03:56.940> mess<00:03:57.150> with

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
cars so be careful what you mess with

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.089 
cars so be careful what you mess with
this<00:03:59.159> I<00:03:59.370> know<00:03:59.430> works<00:03:59.849> for<00:04:00.560> 94<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.650> 96

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
this I know works for 94 to 96

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.990 
this I know works for 94 to 96
Roadmasters<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:03.230> think<00:04:04.400> earlier<00:04:05.400> once<00:04:05.730> with

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
Roadmasters I think earlier once with

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.449 
Roadmasters I think earlier once with
the<00:04:06.090> climate<00:04:06.420> control<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:07.590> does<00:04:07.799> similar<00:04:08.310> all

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
the climate control it does similar all

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.039 
the climate control it does similar all
the<00:04:08.610> numbers<00:04:09.000> might<00:04:09.180> be<00:04:09.330> different<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.900> I

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
the numbers might be different and I

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.330 
the numbers might be different and I
think<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.379> buttons<00:04:10.709> are<00:04:10.860> in<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> different

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
think the buttons are in a different

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:25.600 
think the buttons are in a different
order<00:04:11.489> but<00:04:14.390> that's<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.949> little<00:04:16.949> trick

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.669
