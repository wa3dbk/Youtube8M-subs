this<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.610> one<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.709> retractable<00:03:24.709> ones<00:03:25.100> and

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
this is one of the retractable ones and

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.360 
this is one of the retractable ones and
nude<00:03:26.959> pink<00:03:27.320> as<00:03:27.560> well<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:30.680> happens<00:03:31.100> every

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
nude pink as well and this happens every

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.280 
nude pink as well and this happens every
time<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.850> use<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.840> breaks<00:03:33.110> off<00:03:35.019> it's<00:03:36.019> so

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
time I use it it breaks off it's so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.479 
time I use it it breaks off it's so
creamy<00:03:36.670> which<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.850> great<00:03:38.120> but<00:03:39.160> it's<00:03:40.160> kind<00:03:40.430> of

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
creamy which is great but it's kind of

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.509 
creamy which is great but it's kind of
hard<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.850> work<00:03:41.120> with<00:03:41.330> it's<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.200> one<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.370> it's

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
hard to work with it's this one so it's

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.470 
hard to work with it's this one so it's
just<00:03:43.760> like<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:45.130> it's<00:03:46.130> not<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.400> nude<00:03:46.790> pink<00:03:47.120> it's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
just like a it's not a nude pink it's

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.750 
just like a it's not a nude pink it's
more<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.880> darker<00:03:53.600> pink<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.920> my<00:03:55.250> lips<00:03:55.489> but

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760
