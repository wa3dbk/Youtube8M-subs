more<00:02:00.350> cushiony<00:02:00.829> and<00:02:00.979> they<00:02:01.250> are<00:02:01.399> available

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
more cushiony and they are available

heated<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.270> some<00:02:02.509> models<00:02:02.840> but<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.409> color

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
heated in some models but the color

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.260 
heated in some models but the color
scheme<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.189> think<00:02:04.700> could<00:02:04.789> be<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.909> little<00:02:05.090> bit

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
scheme I think could be a little bit

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.630 
scheme I think could be a little bit
brighter<00:02:05.509> but<00:02:05.869> that's<00:02:06.170> just<00:02:06.259> my<00:02:06.439> opinion<00:02:06.640> well

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
brighter but that's just my opinion well

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.210 
brighter but that's just my opinion well
something<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.479> like<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.560> optional

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
something I like is the optional

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.330 
something I like is the optional
