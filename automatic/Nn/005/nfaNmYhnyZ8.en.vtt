guy I think they're called the X pattern
unbelted<00:00:50.280> tires<00:00:50.870> there<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> three

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
unbelted tires there is a three

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
unbelted tires there is a three
millimeter<00:00:52.620> offset<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> front<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> then

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
millimeter offset on the front and then

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
millimeter offset on the front and then
the<00:00:54.840> six<00:00:55.170> has<00:00:55.469> or<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.250> rear<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> six

I<00:02:17.180> guess<00:02:17.390> that's<00:02:17.599> kind<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.900> good<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.650> certain

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
I guess that's kind of good to a certain

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.990 
I guess that's kind of good to a certain
extent<00:02:19.430> nice<00:02:20.180> foam<00:02:20.420> bumper<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.930> front

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
extent nice foam bumper on the front

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.900 
extent nice foam bumper on the front
overall<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> nice<00:02:23.510> build<00:02:23.989> quality<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
overall a nice build quality on the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.400 
overall a nice build quality on the
underside<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.660> chassis<00:02:27.110> you'll<00:02:27.230> see

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
underside of the chassis you'll see

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.040 
underside of the chassis you'll see
right<00:02:27.590> there<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.209> hole<00:02:29.450> cut<00:02:30.020> on

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
right there you have the hole cut on

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.540 
right there you have the hole cut on
right<00:02:30.260> there<00:02:30.410> for<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.650> motor<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.250> cutout

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
right there for the motor and the cutout

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.610 
right there for the motor and the cutout
right<00:02:31.580> there<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.150> rear<00:02:32.330> diff<00:02:32.569> so<00:02:33.350> nothing

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
right there for the rear diff so nothing

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.880 
right there for the rear diff so nothing
gets<00:02:33.770> caught<00:02:34.010> underneath<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:36.200> far<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.709> the

gets caught underneath as far as the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.940 
gets caught underneath as far as the
battery<00:02:37.280> tray<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:39.140> course<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.590> does<00:02:39.709> come<00:02:39.920> with

nickel metal hydride I did plug it in i
charged<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:49.310> it's<00:02:49.819> really<00:02:50.300> slow<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.100> opted

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
charged it and it's really slow so opted

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.210 
charged it and it's really slow so opted

right<00:03:25.760> there

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
right there

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.840

I<00:03:26.359> had<00:03:26.810> this<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.140> third<00:03:27.410> channel<00:03:27.850> on/off

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
I had this have a third channel on/off

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.640 
I had this have a third channel on/off
and<00:03:28.880> then<00:03:29.359> in<00:03:29.660> here<00:03:29.989> it's<00:03:30.109> kind<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.320> weird<00:03:30.500> it

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
and then in here it's kind of weird it

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.319 
and then in here it's kind of weird it
has<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.769> France<00:03:31.250> mode<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:32.000> guess<00:03:32.810> if<00:03:33.019> you're<00:03:33.230> in

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
has a France mode I guess if you're in

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.990 
has a France mode I guess if you're in
France<00:03:35.329> you<00:03:35.840> can<00:03:36.109> set<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.829> something<00:03:37.430> so

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
France you can set it to something so

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.509 
France you can set it to something so
anyways<00:03:38.930> that's<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.350> remote<00:03:39.560> pretty<00:03:40.010> you

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
anyways that's the remote pretty you

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.789 
anyways that's the remote pretty you
know<00:03:40.549> offset<00:03:42.549> little<00:03:43.549> steering<00:03:43.760> wheel<00:03:44.000> there

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
know offset little steering wheel there

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.009 
know offset little steering wheel there
anyways<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:46.820> does<00:03:46.940> come<00:03:47.150> with<00:03:47.269> some<00:03:47.329> parts

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
anyways it does come with some parts

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.720 
anyways it does come with some parts
trees<00:03:48.320> here<00:03:48.560> not<00:03:48.769> sure<00:03:48.799> exactly<00:03:49.250> what<00:03:49.459> those

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
trees here not sure exactly what those

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.920 
trees here not sure exactly what those
are<00:03:50.530> tool<00:03:51.530> bag<00:03:51.829> and<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.540> does<00:03:53.660> give<00:03:53.900> me

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
are tool bag and then it does give me

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.180 
are tool bag and then it does give me
some<00:03:54.320> looks<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.070> hub<00:03:55.280> carriers<00:03:55.780> possibly<00:03:56.780> a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
some looks like hub carriers possibly a

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.729 
some looks like hub carriers possibly a

shock tower and some seat hubs for the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.280 
shock tower and some seat hubs for the
front<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:02.090> not<00:04:02.269> too<00:04:02.450> bad

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
front so not too bad

already<00:04:16.030> pretty<00:04:17.030> much<00:04:17.120> discarded<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.109> anyways

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
already pretty much discarded so anyways

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.039 
already pretty much discarded so anyways
that<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.609> did<00:04:19.820> pick<00:04:20.000> up<00:04:20.150> already<00:04:20.720> some

pretty cool HPI marks on the center
we're<00:04:53.330> monstera<00:04:53.750> marks<00:04:54.169> hopefully<00:04:54.530> my<00:04:54.710> camera

will focus six millimeter right there so

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.200 
will focus six millimeter right there so
that's<00:04:57.560> kind<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:57.860> cool<00:04:58.039> I<00:04:58.340> was<00:04:58.699> kind<00:04:58.939> of<00:04:59.000> trying

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
that's kind of cool I was kind of trying

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.700 
that's kind of cool I was kind of trying
to<00:04:59.240> figure<00:04:59.419> out<00:04:59.539> how<00:04:59.780> they<00:05:00.080> marked<00:05:00.379> them<00:05:00.530> and

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
to figure out how they marked them and

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.029 
to figure out how they marked them and
that's<00:05:00.830> how<00:05:00.979> they<00:05:01.039> did<00:05:01.159> it<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:01.840> anyways<00:05:02.840> as<00:05:03.680> far

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
that's how they did it so anyways as far

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.959 
that's how they did it so anyways as far
as<00:05:04.159> issues<00:05:04.639> I've<00:05:04.819> had<00:05:05.090> so<00:05:05.629> far<00:05:05.659> out<00:05:06.169> of<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.349> box

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
as issues I've had so far out of the box

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.879 
as issues I've had so far out of the box
the<00:05:07.969> radio<00:05:08.300> was<00:05:08.539> not<00:05:08.719> bound<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.469> the<00:05:10.370> car<00:05:10.580> and

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
the radio was not bound to the car and

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.219 
the radio was not bound to the car and
therefore<00:05:12.889> I<00:05:12.919> could<00:05:13.009> not<00:05:13.219> program<00:05:13.969> the<00:05:14.979> castle

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
therefore I could not program the castle

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.700 
therefore I could not program the castle
ESC<00:05:18.229> it<00:05:18.469> calls<00:05:19.159> for<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.490> know<00:05:19.610> full<00:05:19.849> throttle

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
ESC it calls for you know full throttle

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.189 
ESC it calls for you know full throttle
back<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:22.029> full<00:05:23.029> reverse<00:05:23.389> and<00:05:23.719> then<00:05:23.840> back<00:05:24.050> to

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
back to full reverse and then back to

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:24.760 
back to full reverse and then back to
neutral

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
neutral

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.279 
neutral
so<00:05:25.400> since<00:05:25.759> the<00:05:25.879> radio<00:05:26.210> wasn't<00:05:26.569> bound<00:05:26.719> it<00:05:27.050> would

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
so since the radio wasn't bound it would

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.830 
so since the radio wasn't bound it would
not<00:05:27.500> program<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.430> ESC<00:05:28.789> lots<00:05:29.509> of<00:05:29.659> issues

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
not program the ESC lots of issues

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.839 
not program the ESC lots of issues
finally<00:05:30.409> figured<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.770> all<00:05:30.889> out<00:05:30.949> the<00:05:31.729> other

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
finally figured it all out the other

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.269 
finally figured it all out the other
thing<00:05:32.090> is<00:05:32.300> there's<00:05:32.930> no<00:05:32.990> on/off<00:05:33.349> switch<00:05:33.830> on<00:05:34.039> the

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
thing is there's no on/off switch on the

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.649 
thing is there's no on/off switch on the
ESC<00:05:34.759> you<00:05:35.509> plug<00:05:35.810> it<00:05:35.960> in<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.379> it's<00:05:37.009> on<00:05:37.659> first

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
ESC you plug it in and it's on first

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.119 
ESC you plug it in and it's on first
time<00:05:38.810> I've<00:05:38.990> ever<00:05:39.110> had<00:05:39.319> a<00:05:39.379> car<00:05:39.680> that<00:05:39.710> didn't

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
time I've ever had a car that didn't

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.209 
time I've ever had a car that didn't
have<00:05:40.219> an<00:05:40.310> on/off<00:05:40.610> switch<00:05:40.639> but<00:05:41.469> anyways<00:05:42.469> got<00:05:43.129> it

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
have an on/off switch but anyways got it

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.950 
have an on/off switch but anyways got it
all<00:05:43.339> up<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.610> running<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:44.240> kind<00:05:44.659> of<00:05:44.719> didn't<00:05:44.930> have

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960
