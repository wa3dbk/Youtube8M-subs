00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
only one that bounces up and down okay I

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.959 
only one that bounces up and down okay I
have<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> here

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.509 

this<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.960> what<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.260> actually<00:01:00.379> looks<00:01:00.559> like

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.249 

frame<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.699> instructions<00:01:05.420> aren't<00:01:05.630> very<00:01:05.900> easy

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
frame the instructions aren't very easy

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.010 
frame the instructions aren't very easy
to<00:01:07.119> understand<00:01:08.470> so<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.310> how<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:11.020> that's

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020

to understand so this is how here that's
how<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.619> looks<00:01:12.799> like<00:01:12.979> after<00:01:13.190> you've

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
how it looks like after you've

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.600 
how it looks like after you've
constructed<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:15.549> underneath<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:18.460> just<00:01:19.460> got

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
constructed it underneath it just got

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:35.830 
constructed it underneath it just got
the<00:01:19.729> clips<00:01:28.600> okay<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:29.960> comes<00:01:30.289> right<00:01:30.500> off<00:01:34.840> this

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
the clips okay this comes right off this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:54.039 
the clips okay this comes right off this
way

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:08.859 

it's<00:01:54.590> got<00:01:54.770> music<00:01:55.479> volume<00:02:07.720> okay

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
it's got music volume okay

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and that's the power button and to

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.960 
and that's the power button and to
bounce<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.299> you<00:02:14.780> push<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.830> low<00:02:16.370> button<00:02:16.760> it

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
bounce it you push the low button it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.750 
bounce it you push the low button it
just<00:02:17.030> bounces<00:02:17.860> up<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.040> down<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:25.519> need<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
just bounces up and down you need a

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.030 
just bounces up and down you need a
person<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.569> there<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.049> know<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.349> see<00:02:27.950> it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
person in there you know the see it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:42.940 
person in there you know the see it
bounce

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:54.000 

and<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:44.090> there's<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.390> heartbeat<00:02:44.690> mode<00:02:51.760> which

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
and then there's a heartbeat mode which

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:07.270 
and then there's a heartbeat mode which
bounces<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> heartbeat

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:16.190 

if<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.400> listen<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:14.630> yes<00:03:15.630> that's<00:03:15.930> what<00:03:16.140> it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
if you listen to it yes that's what it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.580 
if you listen to it yes that's what it
sounds<00:03:16.470> like

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.860 

and<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.580> structure<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.210> got<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:24.450> one

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
and so the structure you got this one

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.080 
and so the structure you got this one
piece<00:03:25.140> here<00:03:25.530> another<00:03:26.310> piece<00:03:26.610> here<00:03:26.880> then<00:03:26.970> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
piece here another piece here then it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.560 
piece here another piece here then it
goes<00:03:27.210> under<00:03:27.510> here<00:03:28.370> I'm<00:03:29.370> not<00:03:29.520> gonna<00:03:29.670> rebuild<00:03:30.390> it

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
goes under here I'm not gonna rebuild it

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.270 
goes under here I'm not gonna rebuild it
I<00:03:30.750> don't<00:03:31.140> take<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.410> apart<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.710> have<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.130> mounted

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
I don't take it apart I have it mounted

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.010 
I don't take it apart I have it mounted
here<00:03:32.760> as<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.090> see<00:03:35.330> not<00:03:36.330> adhere<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.840> a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
here as you can see not adhere to a

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.200 
here as you can see not adhere to a
table

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
table

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.690 
table
so<00:03:39.210> it's<00:03:39.390> sturdy<00:03:40.790> again<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:41.940> comes<00:03:42.210> off<00:03:42.420> yeah

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
so it's sturdy again this comes off yeah

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.630 
so it's sturdy again this comes off yeah
this<00:03:44.700> thing<00:03:44.910> here<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:47.220> hook<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:47.790> guy<00:03:49.640> in

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
this thing here you hook this guy in

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.150 
this thing here you hook this guy in
there<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.160> she<00:03:53.490> comes<00:03:54.240> off<00:03:54.920> actually<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.040> I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
there so she comes off actually this I

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.910 
there so she comes off actually this I
could<00:03:56.310> take<00:03:56.460> off<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:58.140> see<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.530> comes<00:03:58.710> right

could take off you see it comes right
off<00:04:00.500> this<00:04:01.500> bouncer<00:04:02.250> just<00:04:02.460> process<00:04:02.850> up<00:04:02.970> and

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
off this bouncer just process up and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.930 
off this bouncer just process up and
down<00:04:03.300> inside<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:05.630> weighted<00:04:06.630> piece<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.320> metal

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
down inside is a weighted piece of metal

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.160 
down inside is a weighted piece of metal
with<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:08.970> coil<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.310> electro-man<00:04:11.310> again<00:04:11.580> just

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
with a coil and electro-man again just

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.660 
with a coil and electro-man again just
electromagnet<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.410> just<00:04:13.710> bounces<00:04:14.250> up

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
electromagnet that just bounces up

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.020 
electromagnet that just bounces up
enough<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.650> haven't<00:04:16.980> wired<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.640> takes<00:04:17.880> up

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
enough and I haven't wired it takes up

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.000 
enough and I haven't wired it takes up
it<00:04:18.390> takes<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.780> three<00:04:19.820> C<00:04:20.820> batteries<00:04:22.010> you're

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
it takes a three C batteries you're

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.550 
it takes a three C batteries you're
gonna<00:04:23.100> need<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.460> buy<00:04:23.640> three<00:04:24.030> C<00:04:24.560> batteries

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
gonna need to buy three C batteries

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.130 
gonna need to buy three C batteries
alkaline<00:04:26.130> overall<00:04:26.610> rechargeable<00:04:27.270> I've<00:04:27.750> used
