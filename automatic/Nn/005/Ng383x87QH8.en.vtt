00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
good consistency not too watery because

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.270 
good consistency not too watery because
then<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.209> have<00:04:08.239> too<00:04:08.510> much<00:04:08.629> honey<00:04:08.870> not<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.950> sit

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
then you have too much honey not to sit

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.530 
then you have too much honey not to sit
because<00:04:10.549> then<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:10.879> have<00:04:10.909> too<00:04:11.150> much<00:04:11.299> mustard

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
because then you have too much mustard

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.140 
because then you have too much mustard
so<00:04:11.959> you<00:04:12.470> just<00:04:12.620> want<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:12.859> make<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.189> a<00:04:13.489> good
