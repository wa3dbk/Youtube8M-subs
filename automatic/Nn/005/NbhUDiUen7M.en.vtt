or at least there used to be I really
don't<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.140> they've<00:01:07.590> changed<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.220> much

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
don't know if they've changed that much

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.139 
don't know if they've changed that much
over<00:01:08.670> time<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.460> lot<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.759> people<00:01:11.880> who

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
over time but I know a lot of people who

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.149 
over time but I know a lot of people who
like<00:01:12.390> Dragon<00:01:12.720> Ball<00:01:12.840> Z<00:01:12.869> hate<00:01:13.259> naruto<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> vice

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
like Dragon Ball Z hate naruto and vice

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
like Dragon Ball Z hate naruto and vice
versa<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.960> small

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
versa and there was really a small

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.260 
versa and there was really a small
minority<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.860> people<00:01:17.040> who<00:01:17.340> could<00:01:17.729> tolerate

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
minority of people who could tolerate

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.990 
minority of people who could tolerate
both<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.770> i<00:01:20.189> guess<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.759> may<00:01:20.880> not

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
both of them but I i guess that may not

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
both of them but I i guess that may not
really<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> case<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.659> much<00:01:22.020> anymore<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.530> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
really be the case as much anymore but I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
really be the case as much anymore but I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
know that's how it used to be and I was

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.120 
know that's how it used to be and I was

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
of that situation if they had made like

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.460 
of that situation if they had made like
a<00:04:36.630> naruto<00:04:37.350> kai<00:04:37.920> of<00:04:38.340> sorts<00:04:38.760> with<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:40.440> know

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
it less than 100 episodes I think about

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.250 
it less than 100 episodes I think about

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
battle we were about to do so that way i

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.380 
battle we were about to do so that way i
would<00:07:01.370> have<00:07:01.490> enough<00:07:01.700> to<00:07:01.790> at<00:07:01.910> least<00:07:02.000> talk<00:07:02.330> about

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390 
would have enough to at least talk about

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.050 
would have enough to at least talk about
it<00:07:02.720> but<00:07:03.260> i<00:07:03.320> really<00:07:03.980> didn't<00:07:04.520> feel<00:07:04.760> like<00:07:04.820> doing

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
it but i really didn't feel like doing

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.000 
it but i really didn't feel like doing
that<00:07:05.210> I<00:07:05.270> thought<00:07:05.480> that<00:07:05.600> would<00:07:05.720> be<00:07:05.870> I<00:07:06.230> don't

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.010 
that I thought that would be I don't

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.800 
that I thought that would be I don't
know<00:07:07.160> cheating<00:07:07.580> almost<00:07:07.880> but<00:07:08.270> which<00:07:08.570> then

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
know cheating almost but which then

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.390 
know cheating almost but which then
again<00:07:09.020> it's<00:07:09.350> sort<00:07:09.620> of<00:07:09.710> cheating<00:07:09.980> if<00:07:10.160> I<00:07:10.220> just

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
again it's sort of cheating if I just

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.980 
again it's sort of cheating if I just
play<00:07:10.580> the<00:07:10.700> game<00:07:10.850> to<00:07:11.000> learn<00:07:11.120> the<00:07:11.300> story<00:07:11.540> but<00:07:11.780> in

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
play the game to learn the story but in

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.780 
play the game to learn the story but in
a<00:07:12.350> way<00:07:12.470> it's<00:07:12.650> not<00:07:12.830> at<00:07:13.010> least<00:07:13.190> I<00:07:13.310> had<00:07:13.550> to<00:07:13.670> do

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790 
a way it's not at least I had to do

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.240 
a way it's not at least I had to do
something<00:07:13.820> to<00:07:14.450> learn<00:07:14.540> the<00:07:14.750> story<00:07:15.020> but<00:07:15.710> um

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
something to learn the story but um

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.130 
something to learn the story but um
that's<00:07:17.150> really<00:07:17.420> about<00:07:17.510> all<00:07:17.600> I<00:07:17.720> can<00:07:17.810> think<00:07:17.930> of

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
that's really about all I can think of

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.020
