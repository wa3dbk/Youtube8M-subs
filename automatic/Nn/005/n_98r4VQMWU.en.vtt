00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 in the previous episode a probe for 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.470
 see the ghosts that nonsense 60 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.470
 days 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:37.010
 you hear what that music is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:37.010
 buried alive and you what a pokemon 6 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.039
 yes this is the last place we have left 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.020
 of the whole island 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.789
 if the ghost wanted us to find 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 something about sina par island and be 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.350
 here and if there are traces of activity of 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.039
 type spectrum the hound move the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.039
 they will never find 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.240
 it would seem a diary July 5 we have 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.720
 discovered a new pokémon in the depths 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.520
 of the jungle July 10th we have 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:30.780
 baptized the new arcane species in 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 what do I have some militant 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.050
 I think I know a way out of 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.760
 great here because you know I think it arrived 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.750
 the moment I tell you something that 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.520
 what are terribly claustrophobic 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.590
 come on, don't be narrow streets 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:08.020
 get me out of this place 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:08.320
 ok ok but I can assure you nothing where 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.320
 we are 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.910
 I tried to tell you this normally 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.920
 we would be materialized near a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.720
 pokémon center but the spectra 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.910
 interfere with psychic powers dia 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.670
 the casam we could be anywhere waiting 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.770
 this is game we are at the national park 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.460
 at the bottom he captured my first 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.550
 beat 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.040
 I don't like pokemon, the beetle 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.210
 teacher of the mystic arts is afraid of 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.210
 some butterflies 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.770
 who is afraid of some butterfly 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:50.110
 now they do not count only are banti di 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:53.950
 eight giants from Perugia were the blades at 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.430
 place of hands instead of hands 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.150
 tested you are waiting for blades that maybe 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.150
 they would make us comfortable 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:12.359
 you have a pokémon that knows true cut 9 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.920
 September the DNA of the new species has 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.920
 revolutionized the department of 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.409
 cloning seems extraordinarily 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:25.040
 adaptable enough to allow the 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:28.670
 experimentation on human subjects 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.670
 pikachu lights up the room 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:37.319
 this explains many things 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.730
 in the end I caught you you know you armor 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.150
 released in the sky 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.150
 look at the flight does not seem to work 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.579
 I can say that this thing makes no sense 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.919
 how can our weight not hold 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.180
 ask yourself questions on the ground are those 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.670
 ruins of alpo 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.550
 then why did you bring me here and 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.700
 listen well you hear something not 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.160
 here are these are radio frequencies that 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.570
 they only exist here once they succeeded 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.960
 to tell me too I am through the poc e 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.000
 gear 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.250
 but since I came back to life 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.410
 I feel something has changed, too 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.140
 natural is similar to the music of the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.459
 cemetery I think there is a connection 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.710
 worth trying 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.630
 here the energies are concentrated I will use 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.400
 the inner eye to see a dylan 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.400
 don't disturb me in the process 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.260
 worth trying 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.840
 now I will exclude you and leave you here a 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.090
 talk alone in the ruins and more 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:50.130
 frightening of the world as it falls 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:55.980
 night can not happen nothing sica two 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:59.490
 manipulation returns February 6th 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.530
 genetics of the host organism 151 a 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.020
 human female crossed with 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.800
 miu has finally produced results 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.919
 appreciable to the new species of crossing 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:17.760
 perfect between human pokémon we gave 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:21.569
 the youtube youtube name is too much 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:35.639
 powerful and cruel 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:43.679
 yes, forgive me, made me now that I am 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:49.800
 I knew it as a guest, but what happened 

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:52.319
 of 150 pre-creatures have a 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.209
 unstable genetic code and am 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:57.029
 regressed an invertebrate form of life 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:06:02.599
 lower than the continuous search of 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:02.599
 an identity is to be considered aggressive 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.650
 that music what it means 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:37.150
 I know north 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.150
 test 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.080
 aimo that takes you you were following you 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.039
 true the heralds of the afterlife mean the 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.220
 not at 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:57.449
 yes because I had a vision you will succeed 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.099
 to put in place the world i 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.639
 messengers will guide you in this 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.889
 mission 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.569
 I saw a bright future in which 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.780
 everyone celebrated me as a teacher of 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.879
 psycho type then it is perfect 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.169
 what is the gold problem in that future 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.169
 you're not there
