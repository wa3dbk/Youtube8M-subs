the<00:00:08.490> idea<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:09.030> most<00:00:09.240> repairs<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:10.860> do

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
the idea with most repairs is to just do

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.789 
the idea with most repairs is to just do
enough<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.700> prevent<00:00:12.000> from<00:00:12.120> getting<00:00:12.269> worse<00:00:12.799> so

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
enough to prevent from getting worse so

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.320 
enough to prevent from getting worse so
if<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.070> want<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:14.429> some<00:00:14.670> document<00:00:15.059> repair

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
tape and we're just going to cover the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.870 
tape and we're just going to cover the
tear<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> inside<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.670> does<00:00:20.850> not

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
tear on the inside so that it does not

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.029 
tear on the inside so that it does not
continue<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:21.840> worse<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.800> cover

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
continue to get worse or just to cover

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
continue to get worse or just to cover
up<00:00:23.160> entire<00:00:24.080> document<00:00:25.080> pair<00:00:25.260> tape<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:26.750> acid

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.830 

this<00:01:20.610> particular<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.270> goes<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.720> way

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this particular one goes all the way

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.460 
this particular one goes all the way
into<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.580> gutter<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.900> see<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> we're

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
into the gutter you see this and we're

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.040 
into the gutter you see this and we're
going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.490> real<00:01:29.670> nice<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> flat

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
going to do that it's real nice and flat

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.310 
going to do that it's real nice and flat
I'm<00:01:32.230> going<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.470> pose<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.100> cover<00:01:33.310> on<00:01:33.550> top<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.880> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.290 

obviously<00:01:38.320> this<00:01:38.920> part<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.910> go<00:01:40.030> down<00:01:40.270> a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
obviously this part is to go down a

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.680 
obviously this part is to go down a
little<00:01:40.420> further<00:01:41.460> apart<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:42.820> not<00:01:42.970> part<00:01:43.570> we

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
little further apart so you not part we

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.140 
little further apart so you not part we
can<00:01:43.840> tack<00:01:44.080> down<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.530> little<00:01:44.710> piece<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.240> PVA

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
can tack down a little piece of PVA

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.120 
can tack down a little piece of PVA
extra<00:01:49.150> off<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:52.560> works<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.740> same<00:01:53.950> if

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
extra off of that works the same if

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.760 
extra off of that works the same if
you're<00:01:54.250> doing<00:01:54.400> an<00:01:54.580> internal<00:01:54.970> page<00:01:58.770> there

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
you're doing an internal page there

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.310 
you're doing an internal page there
that's<00:02:00.220> nice<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.730> flat<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.990> we're<00:02:02.170> going<00:02:02.260> to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
that's nice and flat now we're going to

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.500 
that's nice and flat now we're going to
take<00:02:02.500> care<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.770> later

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
take care of later

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:16.050 
take care of later
now<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:14.610> destroying<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.850> there<00:02:15.970> we

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
now this see this destroying it there we

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.110 
now this see this destroying it there we
go

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
go

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.720 
go
it's<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.210> little<00:02:19.390> nice<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.490> disappeared<00:02:21.490> now

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
it's a little nice and disappeared now

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.250 
it's a little nice and disappeared now
that<00:02:21.970> okay<00:02:23.280> tape<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.810> translucent<00:02:25.810> not

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
that okay tape is translucent not

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.370 
that okay tape is translucent not
transparent<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.900> furnished<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.080> and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
transparent so it furnished that and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.120 
transparent so it furnished that and
heat<00:02:30.450> from<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.690> bone<00:02:32.050> folder<00:02:32.410> it's<00:02:32.860> going<00:02:32.950> to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
heat from the bone folder it's going to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.650 
heat from the bone folder it's going to
make<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.610> come<00:02:34.120> much<00:02:34.390> more<00:02:34.600> translucent

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
make that come much more translucent

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.440 
make that come much more translucent
eventually<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.780> can<00:02:38.050> be<00:02:38.320> reversed<00:02:40.560> not<00:02:41.560> sure

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
eventually this can be reversed not sure

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.190 
eventually this can be reversed not sure
the<00:02:43.450> chemical<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:45.600> spirits<00:02:46.600> or<00:02:46.720> something<00:02:47.050> may

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the chemical is spirits or something may

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.280 
the chemical is spirits or something may
become<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:47.880> all<00:02:48.880> fixed<00:02:49.510> now<00:02:49.720> we're<00:02:50.170> just

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
become it's all fixed now we're just

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.830 
become it's all fixed now we're just
going<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.730> fix<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.420> bit

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
now if the extra really don't want a lot

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.809 
now if the extra really don't want a lot
we<00:03:23.780> just<00:03:23.810> want<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.349> little<00:03:30.340> piece<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.400> one<00:03:31.670> all

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
we just want a little piece of one all

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:42.860 
we just want a little piece of one all
of<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:33.280> around

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.240 

and<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.020> doesn't<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.410> enough<00:03:44.440> glue<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.100> it

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
and it doesn't have enough glue that it

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.080 
and it doesn't have enough glue that it
sticks<00:03:46.120> out<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.330> other<00:03:46.569> side<00:03:47.580> just<00:03:48.630> fine<00:03:51.090> here

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
sticks out the other side just fine here

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.810 
sticks out the other side just fine here
we<00:03:52.209> are<00:03:52.240> okay
