interesting<00:00:00.480> that<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.989> art<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.800> atheists

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
interesting that the art and atheists

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.190 
interesting that the art and atheists
Richard<00:00:02.669> Dawkins<00:00:02.909> says<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.840> point<00:00:04.049> of

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
Richard Dawkins says that the point of

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.410 
Richard Dawkins says that the point of
evolution<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.310> produce<00:00:05.520> objects<00:00:06.299> which

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
evolution is to produce objects which

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.220 
evolution is to produce objects which
have<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.839> appearance<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.560> being<00:00:07.770> designed

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
have the appearance of being designed

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.629 
have the appearance of being designed
he's<00:00:10.230> an<00:00:10.380> atheist<00:00:10.530> isn't<00:00:11.219> believe<00:00:11.370> they<00:00:11.490> were

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
he's an atheist isn't believe they were

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.799 
he's an atheist isn't believe they were
designed<00:00:11.849> but<00:00:12.240> he<00:00:12.300> says<00:00:12.450> they<00:00:12.570> had<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
designed but he says they had the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.509 
designed but he says they had the
appearance<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.380> being<00:00:13.559> designed<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.160> I'd<00:00:14.219> say

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
appearance of being designed but I'd say

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.039 
appearance of being designed but I'd say
they<00:00:15.030> look<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.420> they're<00:00:15.599> being<00:00:15.750> designed

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
they look like they're being designed

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.380 
they look like they're being designed
because<00:00:16.289> they<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.920> been<00:00:17.160> designed<00:00:17.520> that's

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
because they have been designed that's

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.740 
because they have been designed that's
pretty<00:00:18.570> logical<00:00:20.240> now<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> said<00:00:21.660> about

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
pretty logical now what I said about

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.720 
pretty logical now what I said about

the discovery was regarded as so

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.350 
the discovery was regarded as so
important<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.520> won<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> Nobel<00:01:24.420> Prize

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
here's a top view of it and every

here's a top view of it and every
rotation<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.860> produces<00:02:08.399> three<00:02:08.759> ATP<00:02:09.539> molecules

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
rotation it produces three ATP molecules

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.740 
rotation it produces three ATP molecules
but<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.680> molecule<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.700> vital<00:02:14.210> for<00:02:14.240> life<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
but this molecule is vital for life and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.470 
but this molecule is vital for life and
yet<00:02:14.810> it's<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.640> incredibly<00:02:16.640> complicated<00:02:17.000> motor

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
yet it's a incredibly complicated motor

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.810 
yet it's a incredibly complicated motor
you<00:02:18.140> couldn't<00:02:18.440> have<00:02:18.620> life<00:02:18.920> unless<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.580> had

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
you couldn't have life unless you had

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.520 
you couldn't have life unless you had
this<00:02:20.210> motor<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.870> produce<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.380> energy

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
this motor to produce the energy

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.380 
this motor to produce the energy
currency<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.340> looks<00:02:25.520> like<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:25.820> life<00:02:26.090> this

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
currency so it looks like this life this

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.060 
currency so it looks like this life this
motor<00:02:26.750> must<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.230> been<00:02:27.350> there<00:02:27.650> right<00:02:27.920> from

motor must have been there right from
the<00:02:28.220> beginning<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.960> I'd<00:02:29.960> say<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.440> because

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
the beginning and I'd say that because

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.460 
the beginning and I'd say that because
this<00:02:31.520> motor<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.180> much<00:02:32.750> better<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.440> much

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
this motor is so much better so much

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.590 
this motor is so much better so much

tinier more efficient than any motor we

I'm here and by the whip light movement
that<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.220> motor<00:03:13.489> generates<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.510> germ<00:03:14.959> can

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
that the motor generates the germ can

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.509 
that the motor generates the germ can

propel itself through the liquid it's in

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.520 
propel itself through the liquid it's in

so it's amazingly complex things even in

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.560 
so it's amazingly complex things even in
a<00:03:21.620> simple<00:03:21.980> cell<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.340> look<00:03:22.519> at<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:22.700> more<00:03:23.299> deeply
