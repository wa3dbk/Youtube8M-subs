hi<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:01.429> this<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.879> little<00:00:03.600> toy<00:00:03.810> car<00:00:04.230> I

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hi guys this is the little toy car I

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.550 
hi guys this is the little toy car I
converted<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.580> rubberband<00:00:06.450> power<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.440> other

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
converted to rubberband power the other

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:17.720 
converted to rubberband power the other
day<00:00:15.650> it's<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.890> got<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> rubber<00:00:17.250> band<00:00:17.520> that

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
day it's just got a rubber band that

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.040 
day it's just got a rubber band that
goes<00:00:17.880> around<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.300> back<00:00:18.420> axle<00:00:20.539> that<00:00:21.539> winds<00:00:21.960> up

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
goes around the back axle that winds up

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.910 
goes around the back axle that winds up
when<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.350> push<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> back<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:24.560> unwinds<00:00:25.560> itself

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
when you push it back and unwinds itself

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.790 
when you push it back and unwinds itself
to<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.250> forwards<00:00:26.960> or<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> other<00:00:28.349> way<00:00:30.800> I'm

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to go forwards or the other way I'm

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.240 
to go forwards or the other way I'm
going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.989> is<00:00:33.989> take<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.530> solar

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
going to do is take this solar

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.690 
going to do is take this solar
fluttering<00:00:35.880> dragonfly<00:00:36.840> apart<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
fluttering dragonfly apart to get the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.090 
fluttering dragonfly apart to get the
electric<00:00:39.120> motor<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.829> solar

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
electric motor out of it and the solar

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
electric motor out of it and the solar
panel<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:43.309> convert<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> solar<00:00:44.940> power<00:00:45.920> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
panel and convert it to solar power so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.360 
panel and convert it to solar power so
first<00:00:47.219> thing<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.789> get<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:49.100> motor<00:00:50.100> out

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
first thing I'll do is get the motor out

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:04.700 
first thing I'll do is get the motor out
of<00:00:50.399> here<00:01:01.969> right<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.239> worm<00:01:03.750> gear<00:01:04.170> fits<00:01:04.530> on

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of here right that worm gear fits on

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.450 
of here right that worm gear fits on
that<00:01:04.890> motor<00:01:05.129> nicely<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:08.210> need<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.510> though<00:01:09.720> is

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
that motor nicely I need to do though is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.780 
that motor nicely I need to do though is
put<00:01:11.460> some<00:01:11.670> spacers<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> axle<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
put some spacers on the axle so that it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550 
put some spacers on the axle so that it
can't<00:01:15.030> slide<00:01:15.420> backwards<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.049> forwards<00:01:16.409> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
can't slide backwards and forwards like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.830 
can't slide backwards and forwards like
this<00:01:16.830> or<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.610> will<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.759> missing<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.750> worm<00:01:18.960> gear

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
this or it will be missing the worm gear

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.600 
this or it will be missing the worm gear
so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> cut<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.470> small<00:01:22.770> spaces<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so I need to cut some small spaces to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570 
so I need to cut some small spaces to
hold<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.060> place<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:26.070> I'll<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.369> hot<00:01:26.549> glue

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
hold it in place then I'll just hot glue

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.190 
hold it in place then I'll just hot glue
that<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.090> place

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.140 

I've<00:01:34.200> extended<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.830> wires<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.730> can<00:01:35.970> put

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
I've extended the wires so we can put

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.280 
I've extended the wires so we can put
the<00:01:36.390> solar<00:01:37.380> cell<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:38.040> top<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> car<00:01:39.290> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the solar cell on top of the car and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.810 
the solar cell on top of the car and
that<00:01:40.350> should<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:43.040> need<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> nice<00:01:44.280> big<00:01:44.550> lump

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that should be it need a nice big lump

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.010 
that should be it need a nice big lump
of<00:01:44.940> hot<00:01:45.180> glue<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.260> in<00:01:46.380> there<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:48.020> just

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of hot glue now to go in there I just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:02:16.990 
of hot glue now to go in there I just
saw<00:01:49.620> this<00:01:49.970> piece<00:01:50.970> off

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.820 

so<00:02:18.000> did<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.269> wires<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.780> check<00:02:19.260> tips<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
so did the wires on check tips going the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.670 
so did the wires on check tips going the
right<00:02:19.980> way<00:02:20.569> put<00:02:21.569> some<00:02:21.750> hot<00:02:21.930> glue<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.319> there<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
right way put some hot glue in there to

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.880 
right way put some hot glue in there to
hold<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.010> wires<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.550> place<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.269> don't

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
hold the wires in place so I don't

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.020 
hold the wires in place so I don't
stress<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.099> terminals<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:26.760> all<00:02:28.190> now<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.220> now

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
stress the terminals at all now I now

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.440 
stress the terminals at all now I now
all<00:02:30.330> I'll<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.019> get<00:02:31.349> some<00:02:32.000> blue<00:02:33.000> tack<00:02:33.269> I

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
all I'll do is get some blue tack I

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.990 
all I'll do is get some blue tack I
think<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:36.170> stick<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.410> there<00:02:37.730> right<00:02:38.730> that's

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
think and stick it on there right that's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.619 
think and stick it on there right that's
a<00:02:39.120> little<00:02:39.269> bit<00:02:39.450> disappointing<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:41.879> working

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
a little bit disappointing it is working

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.130 
a little bit disappointing it is working
but<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.410> underpowered<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.959> really<00:02:45.959> need<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
but it's underpowered I really need a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.059 
but it's underpowered I really need a
bigger<00:02:46.440> gear<00:02:46.829> on<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.190> back<00:02:48.150> axle<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.890> can

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
bigger gear on that back axle it can

00:02:50.069 --> 00:03:01.430 
bigger gear on that back axle it can
only<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:51.180> about<00:02:51.540> move<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.290> really<00:02:52.650> crawls

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:24.000 

all<00:03:02.440> right<00:03:02.709> maybe<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.190> doesn't

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.240 

you

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.940 

well<00:03:33.090> there's<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.450> coincidence<00:03:34.080> just<00:03:34.680> been<00:03:34.830> out

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
well there's a coincidence just been out

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.710 
well there's a coincidence just been out
for<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> cup<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.430> coffee<00:03:35.580> come<00:03:36.270> home<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.630> a

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
for a cup of coffee come home and a

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:49.520 
for a cup of coffee come home and a
postman's<00:03:37.170> been<00:03:38.330> packaged<00:03:39.330> for<00:03:39.660> me<00:03:48.290> got<00:03:49.290> some

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
postman's been packaged for me got some

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.930 
postman's been packaged for me got some
gear<00:03:49.740> wheels<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:52.220> little<00:03:53.220> bit<00:03:53.340> bigger<00:03:53.580> than<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
gear wheels a little bit bigger than the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.640 
gear wheels a little bit bigger than the
ones<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.390> was<00:03:54.570> just<00:03:54.840> using<00:03:59.000> and<00:04:00.000> some<00:04:00.300> more<00:04:00.650> worm

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
ones I was just using and some more worm

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.730 
ones I was just using and some more worm
gears<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:06.020> we<00:04:07.020> might<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:07.260> try<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.709> little

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
gears so we might just try a little

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.949 
gears so we might just try a little
modification<00:04:08.160> see<00:04:09.090> if<00:04:09.180> those<00:04:09.360> gears<00:04:09.690> are<00:04:09.930> a

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
modification see if those gears are a

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.949 
modification see if those gears are a
little<00:04:10.140> bit<00:04:10.260> bigger<00:04:10.500> well<00:04:11.660> fixed<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:12.840> I've

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
little bit bigger well fixed it I've

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.820 
little bit bigger well fixed it I've
changed<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.500> gearing<00:04:13.770> again<00:04:15.830> unfortunately

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830

somebody's<00:04:17.280> house<00:04:17.519> alarms<00:04:18.030> going<00:04:18.209> off

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
somebody's house alarms going off

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.120 
somebody's house alarms going off
outside<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.290> we<00:04:19.410> got<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.650> put<00:04:19.799> up<00:04:19.830> with<00:04:19.890> that

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
outside so we got to put up with that

00:04:20.130 --> 00:05:46.310 
outside so we got to put up with that
noise

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.860 

so<00:05:47.320> I<00:05:47.380> did<00:05:47.560> away<00:05:47.770> with<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:48.130> worm<00:05:48.370> gear<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.740> now

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
so I did away with the worm gear so now

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.830 
so I did away with the worm gear so now
you've<00:05:52.870> just<00:05:53.110> got<00:05:53.260> a<00:05:53.290> couple<00:05:53.440> of<00:05:53.620> ordinary

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.710 

cogs<00:05:59.850> matching<00:06:00.850> up<00:06:00.940> at<00:06:01.120> each<00:06:01.240> other

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
cogs matching up at each other

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.240 
cogs matching up at each other
your<00:06:01.870> interpreters<00:06:02.290> they're<00:06:02.440> not<00:06:02.560> quite<00:06:02.920> the

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
your interpreters they're not quite the

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.930 
your interpreters they're not quite the
right<00:06:03.430> size<00:06:03.760> I've<00:06:04.120> had<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:04.420> tilt<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:06.250> motor<00:06:06.490> to

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
right size I've had to tilt the motor to

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.080 
right size I've had to tilt the motor to
make<00:06:07.120> it<00:06:07.300> fit

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.180 

but<00:06:14.660> that<00:06:14.810> seems<00:06:15.080> to<00:06:15.139> be<00:06:15.199> a<00:06:15.290> better<00:06:15.500> gearing

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
but that seems to be a better gearing

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.080 
but that seems to be a better gearing
ratio<00:06:17.050> for<00:06:18.050> that<00:06:18.199> amount<00:06:18.410> of<00:06:18.650> power<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:19.250> those

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
ratio for that amount of power and those

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:31.550 
ratio for that amount of power and those
size<00:06:20.389> wheels

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.409 

it's<00:06:32.560> picking<00:06:32.830> up<00:06:32.889> enough<00:06:33.190> power<00:06:33.580> with<00:06:34.210> the

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
it's picking up enough power with the

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.610 
it's picking up enough power with the
cell<00:06:34.870> laying<00:06:35.169> flat<00:06:36.990> that's<00:06:37.990> obviously<00:06:38.500> an

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
cell laying flat that's obviously an

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.069 
cell laying flat that's obviously an
improvement
