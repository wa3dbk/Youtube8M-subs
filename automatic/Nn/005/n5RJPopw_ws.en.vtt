00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
out and it will catch the seat so you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.120 
out and it will catch the seat so you
don't<00:02:21.070> want<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.370> drinking<00:02:21.820> seats<00:02:23.010> when<00:02:24.010> you

buy<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.460> choke<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:26.290> usually<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.890> have<00:02:27.280> this

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
buy you to choke now usually I have this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.700 
buy you to choke now usually I have this
and<00:02:27.970> I'll<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.360> put<00:02:28.570> this<00:02:28.750> right<00:02:28.990> over<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.470> and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
and I'll just put this right over it and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.860 
and I'll just put this right over it and
let<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.400> drop<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.120> that's<00:02:31.330> probably<00:02:31.660> what

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
let it drop in so that's probably what

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.740 
let it drop in so that's probably what
i'll<00:02:31.900> do<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.380> minute<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.180> probably<00:02:34.180> use<00:02:34.570> about

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
i'll do in a minute I probably use about

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.440
