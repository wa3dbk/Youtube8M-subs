00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:12.270
 good afternoon will say all the bumps can become 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.519
 wonderful day without miracles 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:19.340
 get up there not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.330
 for people if bed 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.330
 Little 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.900
 marina 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.090
 hello guys let's begin our lesson 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.790
 mathematics 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.790
 today i will tell you about the numerical lane 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.950
 grow there 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.260
 numeric trees and today you have to 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.640
 correctly place the apples on these 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:55.660
 trees and how is it all about 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.239
 number of apples in quantity and apples 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.210
 the more the better but it 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.030
 in ordinary apples so she numeric alley 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.050
 it is important that the number of apples matches 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.400
 figure to the apple on it is clear what figure 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.030
 so much apple and 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:19.690
 just so danish paper they are not 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 present days i won't go there mu 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:32.280
 alley we have drawn well friends 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:38.610
 start the way 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:44.450
 and this tree 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.450
 one but it's just 1m go ahead and 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:02:02.360
 25 and 2 apples you ask 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:08.280
 forgiveness 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:12.660
 aye yes professor tsyfirkin parcel of 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.190
 math kingdom ok thanks 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.640
 great don't worry i myself her and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.640
 will take 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.300
 8 apples seven 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:41.630
 one more yes throw apples 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:44.760
 let's play better 9 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.480
 this is 8 one more 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.250
 oh what don't look look interesting with 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.610
 each new one apple 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.019
 one thinks one apple 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.650
 one more less 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.519
 especially since they are not real I do not wish 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.150
 There is a count I want to always play if 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.680
 always play will not learn anything 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.239
 candles and me learn 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.239
 I don't want to study better I will fly to space 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.920
 would you think that's better see just 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.920
 2 din 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.860
 it turned out great my friends 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.370
 look what doctor plus sent us 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.970
 from the kingdom of math boxes and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.630
 number 9 and headquarters is a box of chocolates and 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.650
 mathematically and my themed mean 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.410
 not real quite present and very 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.840
 even tasty me with these sweets 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:07.400
 treated when I was visiting the kingdom 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:12.050
 mathematicians first consider them and then 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.980
 eat oh 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.609
 empty what are you and what are you and nothing 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.790
 understand 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.990
 could not the doctor plus forget to put 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:27.020
 candy so what's with candy then i 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:33.560
 actually there should be 9 candies here 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:36.440
 I am written on the box 9th what is who 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:47.060
 it scattered all the apples and so 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:52.090
 hurricane passed well yes hurricane watering where 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.919
 number and apple numbers are all clear 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.500
 know friends when on numeric or 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.010
 disarray then in royal mathematics 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.800
 various incidents may occur 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.630
 can for example rise a storm or all 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.450
 the clock will show different times 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.660
 some things may disappear altogether 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:17.320
 box of sweets who sent 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:19.540
 docker prius and where aesthetics and 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.390
 and what does it mean and in 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.810
 the kingdom of mathematics is all about numbers 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.530
 9 disappeared, of course, including 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:33.180
 math sweets are you here 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:36.700
 drawn figure 9 ha in the box 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:42.120
 couscous anya i know what to do what what 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.120
 all nine apples must be returned to the tree 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.960
 and now we can calculate it is possible and it means 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:57.810
 well how sick how much do you have 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:06:00.300
 turned out now open the box can 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:10.610
 be math candy back on 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:12.860
 place let's see hopefully more 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.930
 no hurricane will threaten 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.810
 math alley 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:23.490
 no, it will not be because no 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:26.069
 hurricane it was a ball ball coxy it 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.909
 just a toy and he himself is in nothing 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:32.819
 guilty and that's who played this ball I 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:36.360
 only played more I play during 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:46.590
 the lesson will not I understood how important it is exactly 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:53.210
 perform all tasks of the order number 1toy 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:57.150
 apples on i should be 1 to 9 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:07:00.930
 overall on the numerical lane itâ€™s important that 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:05.129
 the number of apples coincided with the number on 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.560
 apple tree well that's fine i think you guys 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:13.460
 also understood this but now it's time for us 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:18.229
 say goodbye to the meeting 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.229
 all the best you learn math 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.169
 or
