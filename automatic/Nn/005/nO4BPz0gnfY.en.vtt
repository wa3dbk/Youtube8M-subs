00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.270
 hello friends how are ours that are 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.000
 of the best and welcome to a new and 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.730
 from minecraft in which I bring you one 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.770
 we have called hamster and fix and signs 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.930
 this monkey is added then these hamster 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.430
 that we can see here on the screen this 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.570
 when I saw the mod I was very thankful 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.829
 to the image that I saw there were many 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.989
 hamsters seychelles softball there are 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.970
 many different colors and then I said 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.280
 publicly not bring them this way that 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.050
 well you see looks good and good this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.460
 hamster was just hiding what can we 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.640
 raise our heads and we can 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.830
 appreciate the view from here with seeing it 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.600
 the tail moves very gracefully and 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.370
 they are just pets 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.500
 new that the mod adds that then 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.520
 I really think it's worth it 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.710
 have this mode because you can have 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.180
 several hamsters in your house and it is 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.220
 fun not because it has a good design 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.370
 and besides tenderness you do not put it 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.330
 hospitalized are very tiny and 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.790
 funny then the first thing that 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.890
 we need is to find a hamster here 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.590
 we have about 80,000 hamsters then 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.570
 Well with that we have no problem then 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.189
 the second thing we need is to have the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.360
 food for hamsters and food for 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.409
 hamsters aircraft already with seeds 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.150
 normal with watermelon seeds and 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.070
 melon seeds 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.350
 that is good you understand me with 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.450
 these 13 minutes have the food for 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.830
 hamsters gentlemen and here is then 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.380
 more or less we're going to need some 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 how many is this because he is right clicking 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.520
 hamster so to adopt it for 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.770
 do your thing and there will be times 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.080
 first it will not work in this as 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.540
 is not the fifth fourth attempt or that already 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.400
 wanted as you can see it makes sound every 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.860
 Once the food comes out here, notes 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 musicals and their cheeks fill up if 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.400
 you can see the other hamsters 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.980
 They have skinny cheeks and it is well here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.160
 chubby little hamsters then 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.619
 this one is pretty fun there is already 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.560
 all are full all hamsters 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.080
 they were fears of the universe I will be the king of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.350
 the hamsters with her we have many 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.400
 hamsters with the father endows 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.990
 then since they have their hamsters 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.750
 gentlemen then they will be watching 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.240
 so very tenderly as you can see and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.760
 now we can use what would be the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.620
 paper and then the paper what do they want 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.150
 the paper or they want for you to click 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.010
 right the hamster and they raise the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.690
 head but they have to have a sheet of 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.210
 paper if the system does not work 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.370
 right click 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.440
 without anything else be for the hamster or is it going 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.140
 to sit down but with the sheet of paper already 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.200
 go up to your house then we have 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.030
 what is the hamster ball that 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.490
 kraft is already navas with good crystals 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.620
 with pieces of glass around in shape 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.300
 of o and we're going to have what it would be 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.010
 the little hamster pellet and we can use them 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.240
 of different colors simply 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.490
 adding the color that we 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.200
 we want in the center not then then 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.840
 let's say we want a little ball of 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.850
 Yellow because we and they click 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.710
 right james taylor dent close on the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.740
 little ball and they manage to be able to push and 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.420
 good is for them to have fun or if they 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.620
 they want to remove the ball they do not give 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.150
 Right click you have to click 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.210
 right but with the sheet of paper 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.190
 then go we have nothing what would be a 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.950
 water block for hamsters then to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.330
 see if it fits then then as 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.170
 can see is simply so that the 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.209
 hamster drink water 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.370
 The gentlemen are then hydrated 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.890
 confuses the constants that bring the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.390
 instinct managua and well this kind of 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.890
 things that make hamsters practical 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.959
 inside bridge in the closed can 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.280

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.920
 food for hamsters drink for 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.980
 hamsters can have fun with your ball 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.330
 for hamsters and various things not and what 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.560
 you can make your partner the 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.930
 partner with this sheet of paper 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.290

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.569
 as well they also separate from handy 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.280

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.060
 interesting then over here we have 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.130

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.670
 can be tender and move the 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.440
