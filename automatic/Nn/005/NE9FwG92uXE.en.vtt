00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 hi dear subscribers today i want 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:13.040
 talk about how we move north 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.040
 low which is not suitable admins did 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:23.519
 This is done with the help of the command that I 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:26.000
 then I will tell you so and the plugin plugin 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.400
 through what is done 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.180
 plugin plugin it is so well well shorter obviously 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.180
 I decided to want to search here for example you 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 will find you come out yourself you give 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:55.289
 this is all he came to rest rest like this you will find 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 its all on the internet myself I think here 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.530
 especially not figs think at all like 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.100
 install just give yourself 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.840
 permission for this on this command and all 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:16.020
 so show you need need need need 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:21.700
 it should be on the neck itself is not a 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:26.909
 so bad wished the whole section 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:31.110
 therefore chill-out is forbidden 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:36.100
 bans and admin but they take through 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:41.850
 wand gif and breaks anyway so 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.850
 what we need we need to allocate a plot 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.229
 something like this is just like a normal gene 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.229
 allocate 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:09.710
 so now see the shelves all lost 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.550
 programs right so the same 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.600
 done with water 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.850
 1101 see 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:24.080
 11 is for the sake of the block replace to replace 11 de 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.830
 block 0 also go block but 0 as you know 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.290
 what is this set 0 erase everything right but 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.410
 it is the one that is erased here 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.480
 set before him that is and put sue 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.060
 here they do not know there 12 sand to zero 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.810
 all that is in this marked 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:51.380
 region is removed with this idi 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:54.370
 Well for example, I do not know there is not put 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:59.870
 will until everything is clear and simple and 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:03.080
 Also in this in this team there is 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.890
 Such a trick that not only si wash 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:16.519
 but you can change the blocks, that is, we write 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:17.160
 100 no and 112 for a block of sand on on on 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.650
 on on 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.480
 155 that is, we replace this with quartz 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.090
 plot 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:30.660
 located there also means sand 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:37.020
 this sand is replaced by quad send 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.020
 all that was sand was all you see 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:47.830
 the class is this program team umba 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.760
 This is from me the last 10 mass 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:57.090
 just the same I do not know show him with 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.090
 water the same note 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.690
 replace 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:17.160
 91 block 1 blockade of water at 0 sit water 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:22.320
 so what else is there to show in general 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:26.000
