00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 nice that you have switched back on 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.150
 at paco I'm in the new one now 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.940
 church yes why does not need to go 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 but I have one again today 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.630
 Turkish recipe for you and that is 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.100
 that men certainly know many of them 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.240
 Ever vacation in Turkey 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 that is always there for 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.660
 So most of the time the breakfast is always like that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.039
 a mix of tomatoes and eggs 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.009
 delicious tastes take so delicious 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.590
 should it necessarily so try this 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 is definitely something 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.380
 breakfast table I think not missing 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.910
 should and a little Turkish flair 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.920
 who wants to bring in that should 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.170
 Definitely try and we will come 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.090
 now also directly ingredients so this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.550
 recipe is for about three to four 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.530
 people and we still need it 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 pointed paprika two pieces a number 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.120
 used various committees the sweet 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.469
 How should I market you? 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 actually with every turk or at 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.969
 Any well stocked supermarket like 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.260
 get market purchase or edeka series 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.789
 then we need another half 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.760
 tomatoes you can even take two 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.010
 no problem then we need one more 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.040
 on the one you ever have a bit 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.240
 So you can not cut cubes 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.580
 we need some butter around 1 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.250
 tablespoon and we just go to it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.710
 Add the onion and give it there 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.259
 a little bit of olive oil about this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.650
 two generous tablespoons I would 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.600
 By the way, then I say by the way 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.049
 no gas would have more but an electric 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 so sad about it but then serve 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.670
 me those onions with the butter and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.549
 to the olive oil on the highest 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.869
 level and after we did that 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.380
 seems to me down the whole step 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.090
 four 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.710
 Now we take care of the pointed 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.509
 paprika and fast as the on the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.079
 great super baku baking cooking 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.060
 good for tray too small pieces and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.430
 of course, then they give to the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 onions I've already said 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.030
 down to level four if not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.990
 then it seems like school is down here 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.909
 now the idea of rubbing tomatoes is yes 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.060
 a strange method works 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.399
 great then you have tomatoes right away and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.280
 there we also give a generous 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.560
 tablespoon of the paprika market with 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.379
 and if we did that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.870
 Of course, we go all the way to where 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.870
 of course with the onions yes 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.310
 and if you just did that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 mix everything together well 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.510
 you can turn up a bit 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 But I would not be able to level 5 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.450
 you already do it now 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.489
 because there are already directly 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.470
 over to the eggs we go now 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.269
 with and now important is there 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.599
 that 's just a bit easy for her 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.620
 choose and not have so much because then have 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.379
 Of course you only have one later 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.660
 you should not have that kind of light so short 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.830
 mix and then stop for two minutes 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.530
 let and of course not allowed 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.680
 forget salt and pepper completely 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.730
 important so that's it there we have ours 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.709
 management 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.650
 i always say call men but it is 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.510

 in this new dreamlike kitchen 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.230
 I think we can conjure up some and 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.819
