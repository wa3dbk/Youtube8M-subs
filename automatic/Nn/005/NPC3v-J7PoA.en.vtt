00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.000 
website and they came the other day and
I<00:00:30.340> should<00:00:31.150> have<00:00:31.540> opened<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.410> lot<00:00:32.619> earlier

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
because I didn't realize that they were

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.840 
because I didn't realize that they were
already<00:00:35.950> been<00:00:36.160> sprouted<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.350> packet<00:00:38.850> so

them to shrivel up I'm going to put them
the<00:01:02.800> flat<00:01:03.070> side<00:01:03.370> down<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:06.010> only

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
the flat side down and this is only

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.399 
the flat side down and this is only
going<00:01:06.400> off<00:01:06.610> one<00:01:06.970> source<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.750> information<00:01:07.900> on

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
progress because his have already grown

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.250 
progress because his have already grown
out<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.680> soil<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.780> shell<00:03:32.110> was
