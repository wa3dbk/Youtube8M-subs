00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.120
 after a lot of people have 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.190
 enjoyed this 208 in the lounge 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.690
 international automobile and few 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.600
 days of being presented for the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.490
 press we are testing this 208 that is 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.349
 for peugeot is one of his releases 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.779
 most important of the last 15 years 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.300
 in its exterior design what else it calls 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.249
 the attention is the aggressive trunk with 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.439
 some headlights that really fits very 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.350
 well in the posterior sector the optics 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.210
 they also have their nice design now 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.810
 in the interior it also comes with many 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.990
 news 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.000
 I tell you how I inside as a car 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.430
 totally new also the design 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.160
 interior calls a lot of attention like this 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.890
 as it also does it out 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.510
 everything in which the driver is 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.080
 immediately in front of his eyes we 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.510
 We are referring to a flyer that does not 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.570
 it's totally circular but it's more 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.330
 well oval and smaller in diameter than 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.970
 the conventional that configuration of 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.250
 flyer has a reason and that is that the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.270
 board is located to a position 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.799
 strange and novel the 208 comes with two 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.369
 1.5 engines of 90 horses and 1.6 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.979
 of 115 both the pears and a single box 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.140
 of changes that is of 5 manual gears if 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.049
 well it's not a sports car 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.090
 it's worth bringing it to this area and 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.189
 try this engine that until three o'clock 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.719
 first marches the marches we can 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.719
 using this layout behaves very well 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.320
 in this path there are a couple of forks 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.590
 that allow us to check how double a 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.590
 car 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.380
 a case in 208 to be a car a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.420
 very short wheelbase at the time 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 of bending really behaved very but 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.720
 very well 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.959
 when braking we find one of 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.489
 its weak points and it has enough 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.019
 relationship with the fact that behind me 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.909
 incorporation to the disc but they are of 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.849
 drum and surprised because this is the 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.370
 top-of- range version is the selector not 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.799
 it only has long travel but that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.210
 also the box and a pretty relationship 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.950
 long 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.070
 draws attention in a car 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.690
 segment sees this touch screen from 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.340
 which can be handled not only the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.730
 audio equipment but see certain 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.280
 statistics path parameters 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.310
 of trips that we are making other 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.860
 characteristic of the 208 is this broad of 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.740
 panoramic fact that although you can not 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.620
 open completely if it occupies all the 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.750
 top surface of the vehicle 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.850
 Regarding the 207 compact we are going to 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 find that this car is a little 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.040
 bigger inside grew a little 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.450
 its wheelbase but the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.810
 passengers sitting in the sector 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.510
 Later van is a little bit more uncomfortable 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.540
 that in that version in the 208 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.800
 we also find an air conditioner 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.740
 bizona something very good also for a 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.600
 auto of this price range and also 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.790
 parking sensors not only 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.920
 front but also rear by 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.320
 at least in this top-of-the- range version 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.690
 what really grew is the space 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.030
 of cargo in the trunk in this version of 5 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.730
 doors the only one that brings the 208 by 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.090
 now since he has 318 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.849
 liters of capacity against the 245 that 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.069
 was bringing the 207 company also with this 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.739
 body in terms of consumption data 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.879
 at 100 kilometers per hour or so to 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:04.269
 about two thousand 800 rpm develops up to 15 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.280
 kilometers per liter instead of 130 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:10.000
 kilometers per hour at a rate of three 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.810
 1,900 rpm runs up to 11 kilometers 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.810
 per liter 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.480
 johan sur contame outside opinion 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.170
 of the car of the engines that has 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.730
 good prices this car in the points 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.890
 strong they have are obviously the 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.810
 Design both outside and inside 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.120
 it's a car that I like a lot and I think 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.330
 that's why it 's selling too much 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.940
 perhaps the price-product ratio is not 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.580
 the best there are products like athletes 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.650
 that out there is more equipped in what 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.020
 it's security because in equipment 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.650
 comfort this 208 is very complete the 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.650
 version that we tested with the happy 1.6 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:59.500
 backcourt that comes with were the 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.320
 seats worth 130 thousand 133 thousand pesos but 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.280
 percent 13,000 can be bought in 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.160
 1.5 allure 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.420
 berni spinelli what did you think of the car 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.150
 manage that you were in the author 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.520
 they were at the racetrack they tried it 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.120
 they braked accelerated we tried it and what 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.030
 we tested exhaustively as I said 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.710
 I really like the design on the outside 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:28.350
 yes I think it finds a weak point to the 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:29.669
 not have esp think that people would 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.280
 will surely incorporate later 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.740
 the car has had a spectacular gait 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.600
 the city behaves very well 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.540
 curvones in the machines the forks 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.640
 little girls that has this autonomous follows 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.050
 some point for the criticized the 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.140
 gear lever actuation 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.270
 that a quite long journey and for 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.600
 there would have been good 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.430
 better yes yes yes for disc brakes 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.590
 butt out there and fernando a little 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.450
 there is a weak point but the car 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.260
 design I thought was spectacular and the 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.700
 to walk excellent to me I loved something that 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.010
 out there we do not agree with all the 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.620
 steering position of this steering wheel of 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.140
 diameter the little boy under gives me a 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.030
 management position very similar to that of 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.950
 a race car in many conditions 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.120
 and I really thought a design 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:22.010
 very cute exterior the interior too 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.890
 it sounds to me that it is to that computer 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.230
 I board those screen pieces that have 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.540
 there should be retractable should it be 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.460
 go down but hey it's also a matter 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.320
 of costs we are talking about a car 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.180
 range entry although this has a lot 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.060
 equipment exactly that segment 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.900
 minus segment b the most populated where 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.910
 more cars are sold and in the first the 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.100
 first in the first weeks of 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.140
 sales at dealers 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.790
 for example in July he sold 2,300 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.570
 units was the sixth best-selling car 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.520
 even almost matching the 207 compact 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.470
 that are obviously living together and that 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.450
 is located by price a bit more 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.950
 down that this new good product does not 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.990
 does nothing more than reaffirm these 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.430
 numbers that I just said diego and I do not 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.110
 I want to climb on any horse when 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.330
 We tried the car and I said it here in a 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.500
 any engine will have said u and what 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.920
 he paid but I this boy 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.500
 no no no 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.690
 the smell the touch that one has to see 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.340
 a car and saying this is going to turn 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.230
 in a success and says that it is 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.970
 becoming a sales success 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.730
 surely deservedly though we are 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.520
 saying that the price is not just 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.440
 the most beneficial factor of ceuta and 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.750
 although we are also saying that no 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.760
 incorporates esp but it probably does 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.760
 in the coming years
