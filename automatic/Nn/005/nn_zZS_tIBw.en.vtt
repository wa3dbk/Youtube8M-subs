allow<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.710> ink<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.160> dry<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.700> remember<00:02:38.360> that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
allow the ink to dry and remember that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.000 
allow the ink to dry and remember that
the<00:02:38.600> morning<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.260> lot<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.860> you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
the morning that you a lot and that you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.370 
the morning that you a lot and that you
place<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.910> course<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.570> ink<00:02:41.780> will<00:02:41.960> take<00:02:42.140> longer

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
place of course the ink will take longer

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.780 
place of course the ink will take longer
and<00:02:42.590> I'm<00:02:42.710> going<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.920> make<00:02:43.160> sure<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.520> this<00:02:43.610> is

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and I'm going to make sure that this is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.660 
and I'm going to make sure that this is
dry<00:02:44.030> then<00:02:44.690> take<00:02:44.930> your<00:02:45.080> paper<00:02:45.290> towel<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.920> just

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
dry then take your paper towel and just

00:02:46.670 --> 00:03:00.380 
dry then take your paper towel and just
buff<00:02:47.060> off<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:50.890> extra<00:02:51.890> e

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.699 

and<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.480> course<00:03:01.689> what<00:03:01.870> happens<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.530> ink

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
and of course what happens is the ink

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.270 
and of course what happens is the ink
doesn't<00:03:02.980> stick<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.400> wherever<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.819> wax<00:03:04.000> was

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.760 

I<00:03:09.569> don't<00:03:10.569> know<00:03:10.660> if<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.840> can<00:03:11.050> see<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.440> very

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
I don't know if you can see that very

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.480 
I don't know if you can see that very
well<00:03:12.010> but<00:03:12.550> there<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.910> have<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.180> finished<00:03:13.510> piece

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
well but there you have a finished piece

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.070 
well but there you have a finished piece
so<00:03:15.490> here's<00:03:15.790> what<00:03:16.000> our<00:03:16.120> project<00:03:16.360> looks<00:03:16.810> like

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
so here's what our project looks like

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.890 
so here's what our project looks like
all<00:03:17.590> completed<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.430> buffed<00:03:19.240> office<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
all completed and buffed office is a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.510 
all completed and buffed office is a
little<00:03:20.140> closed<00:03:20.319> review<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.130> can<00:03:21.310> see

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
little closed review so that you can see

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.059 
little closed review so that you can see
it<00:03:21.610> now<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.819> want<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> show<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.360> two<00:03:22.630> variations

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
it now I want to show you two variations

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.190 
it now I want to show you two variations
using<00:03:24.069> this<00:03:24.190> same<00:03:24.430> technique<00:03:24.940> now<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.900> first

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
using this same technique now the first

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.729 
using this same technique now the first
one<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.910> did<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.020> took<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.500> top

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
one what I did is that I took the top

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.280 
one what I did is that I took the top
note<00:03:30.010> bigshot<00:03:30.520> die<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.600> took<00:03:31.870> out<00:03:32.020> a<00:03:32.050> piece

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
note bigshot die and we took out a piece

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.210 
note bigshot die and we took out a piece
of<00:03:32.640> wax<00:03:33.640> paper<00:03:34.080> crumple<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.170> up<00:03:35.290> did<00:03:35.650> exactly

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
of wax paper crumple it up did exactly

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.479 
of wax paper crumple it up did exactly
the<00:03:36.340> same<00:03:36.580> that<00:03:36.760> we<00:03:36.910> did<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:38.200> was<00:03:38.489> what

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
the same that we did and this was what

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.240 
the same that we did and this was what
we<00:03:39.610> come<00:03:39.819> up<00:03:39.970> with<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:41.890> see<00:03:42.070> that

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
we come up with and you can see that

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.030 
we come up with and you can see that
this<00:03:42.370> has<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.640> nice<00:03:43.200> here's<00:03:44.200> here<00:03:44.590> was<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.860> wax

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
this has a nice here's here was the wax

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800 
this has a nice here's here was the wax
paper<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.730> we<00:03:46.120> got<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.300> little<00:03:46.510> bit<00:03:46.720> of

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
paper and we got a little bit of

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.570 
paper and we got a little bit of
residual<00:03:47.290> some<00:03:47.530> from<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.769> outside<00:03:48.160> edge<00:03:48.340> but

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
residual some from the outside edge but

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.520 
residual some from the outside edge but
this<00:03:48.730> gives<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.090> nice<00:03:49.239> shape<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.290> nice

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
this gives a nice shape and a nice

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.949 
this gives a nice shape and a nice
different<00:03:50.980> texture<00:03:51.430> than<00:03:51.640> we<00:03:52.239> had<00:03:52.480> before

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
different texture than we had before

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.080 
different texture than we had before
now<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.800> third<00:03:54.000> variation<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:56.880> took<00:03:57.880> these

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
now a third variation then I took these

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.710 
now a third variation then I took these
stars

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
stars

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.320 
stars
number<00:03:59.500> two<00:03:59.709> die<00:04:00.030> Big<00:04:01.030> Shot<00:04:01.269> die<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.959> we<00:04:03.330> punch

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
number two die Big Shot die and we punch

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.500 
number two die Big Shot die and we punch
the<00:04:04.540> shapes<00:04:04.810> out<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.350> wax<00:04:06.220> paper<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:07.120> of

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the shapes out of the wax paper and of

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.850 
the shapes out of the wax paper and of
course<00:04:07.690> then<00:04:07.840> we<00:04:07.959> crumpled<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.440> up<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.680> we

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
course then we crumpled it up and we

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.440 
course then we crumpled it up and we
earned<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:10.860> that's<00:04:11.860> what<00:04:12.250> we<00:04:12.400> got<00:04:12.610> with

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
earned it and that's what we got with

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.300 
earned it and that's what we got with
that<00:04:13.750> one<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.410> can<00:04:14.560> see<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:15.070> gives

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
that one and you can see that that gives

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.060 
that one and you can see that that gives
an<00:04:15.489> entirely<00:04:15.970> different<00:04:16.890> texture<00:04:17.890> and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
an entirely different texture and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.580 
an entirely different texture and
background<00:04:19.000> so<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.750> three<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.169> them<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.350> we

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
background so the three of them that we

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:29.159 
background so the three of them that we
created<00:04:21.070> today<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.570> can<00:04:28.750> see<00:04:28.960> very

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
created today and you can see very

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.500 
created today and you can see very
different<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.340> feelings<00:04:30.550> very<00:04:31.030> different

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
different the feelings very different

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.690 
different the feelings very different
looks<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.500> backgrounds<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.310> we<00:04:33.460> would

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
looks to the backgrounds that we would

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.230 
looks to the backgrounds that we would
create<00:04:33.940> using<00:04:34.570> this<00:04:34.780> wax<00:04:35.410> paper<00:04:35.740> resist<00:04:36.310> so

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
create using this wax paper resist so
