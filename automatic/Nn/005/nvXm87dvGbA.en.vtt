to<00:01:48.119> throw<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:48.659> robots<00:01:48.960> up<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> air<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
to throw some robots up in the air this

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
to throw some robots up in the air this
is<00:01:49.860> obviously<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.369> robot<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.030> should<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.360> be

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
is obviously a robot that should not be

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.569 
is obviously a robot that should not be
left<00:01:51.960> alone<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.439> kids<00:01:52.679> absolutely<00:01:53.460> not

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
getting f's we're here robo sumo I know

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.210 
getting f's we're here robo sumo I know
it's<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.780> little<00:02:20.930> different<00:02:21.260> because<00:02:21.709> these

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
it's a little different because these

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.370 
it's a little different because these
robots<00:02:22.730> aren't<00:02:22.970> very<00:02:23.180> fast<00:02:23.660> what<00:02:24.080> does<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.260> do

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
robots aren't very fast what does it do

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.050 
robots aren't very fast what does it do
it<00:02:24.590> finds<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.160> pushes<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.580> opponent<00:02:25.940> off<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
sumo ring I hope we're trying to do here

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.580 
sumo ring I hope we're trying to do here
is<00:02:31.970> trying<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.360> navigate<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:33.019> course<00:02:33.080> and

is trying to navigate this course and

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.559 
is trying to navigate this course and
autonomously<00:02:34.220> find<00:02:34.580> these<00:02:34.940> codes<00:02:35.209> along<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
autonomously find these codes along the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.330 
autonomously find these codes along the
way<00:02:35.720> they're<00:02:36.079> just<00:02:36.260> starting<00:02:36.380> cone<00:02:36.709> here<00:02:37.160> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
way they're just starting cone here and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.100 
way they're just starting cone here and
there's<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.700> finished<00:02:38.000> cone<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.420> there<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
there's a finished cone up there the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.050 
there's a finished cone up there the
real<00:02:39.319> challenge<00:02:39.349> it's<00:02:40.069> going<00:02:40.489> from<00:02:40.819> point<00:02:40.970> A

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
real challenge it's going from point A

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.390 
real challenge it's going from point A
