of this boot is 102 millimeters wide

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.080 
of this boot is 102 millimeters wide
which<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.110> average<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:42.030> very

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090

plastic<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.920> stretched<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

about<00:00:47.879> 10<00:00:48.149> 6<00:00:48.510> mil<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.590> wider<00:00:49.890> feet

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
about 10 6 mil so if you have wider feet

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.639 
about 10 6 mil so if you have wider feet
these<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:51.510> pretty<00:00:51.690> comfortable<00:00:52.170> boots<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
these are pretty comfortable boots and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.310 
these are pretty comfortable boots and
even<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.969> wide<00:00:54.180> feet<00:00:54.570> most

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
even if you have not so wide feet most

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.410 
even if you have not so wide feet most
people<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.250> almost<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> custom<00:00:57.210> fit

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
people you get almost like a custom fit

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.229 
people you get almost like a custom fit
out<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> boot<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.120> because<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
out of this boot because of because of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.689 
out of this boot because of because of
the<00:01:00.390> live<00:01:00.629> fit<00:01:00.989> being<00:01:01.320> able<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.770> shrink<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the live fit being able to shrink and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
the live fit being able to shrink and
grow<00:01:02.730> based<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.930> wide<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.320> foot<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
grow based on how wide your foot is the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
grow based on how wide your foot is the
other<00:01:05.400> things<00:01:06.090> about<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.450> boot<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.140> can

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
other things about this boot that can

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
other things about this boot that can
forget<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> mention<00:01:08.040> obviously<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.240> two

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
forget to mention obviously there's two

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.920 
forget to mention obviously there's two
big<00:01:09.689> buckles<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.409> opposed<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.810> purpose<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
big buckles as opposed to for purpose of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.039 
big buckles as opposed to for purpose of
that<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.770> basically<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.850> less<00:01:15.689> stuff<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that is is basically just less stuff to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
that is is basically just less stuff to
click<00:01:16.470> down<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.030> bit

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
click down also it's a little bit

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.149 
click down also it's a little bit
lighter<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.439> buckles<00:01:19.770> instead<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
lighter to have two buckles instead of

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.700 
lighter to have two buckles instead of
four<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.640> also<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.720> buckles<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.409> super

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
four and also these buckles are super

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.510 
four and also these buckles are super
wide<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.729> spreads<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> pressure<00:01:24.600> out

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
wide so it it spreads the pressure out

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
wide so it it spreads the pressure out
along<00:01:26.720> greater<00:01:27.720> surface<00:01:27.960> area<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.560> hopefully

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
along greater surface area so hopefully

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
along greater surface area so hopefully
you<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.100> fewer<00:01:29.430> pressure<00:01:29.700> points<00:01:30.150> when<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you get fewer pressure points when you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.899 
you get fewer pressure points when you
put<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.049> boot<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.670> thick

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
put this boot on it's got a really thick

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
put this boot on it's got a really thick
power<00:01:33.119> strap<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> 50<00:01:34.950> millimeter

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
power strap this this is a 50 millimeter

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.399 
power strap this this is a 50 millimeter
power<00:01:35.579> strap<00:01:35.939> which<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> crank<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.380> down

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
power strap which when you crank it down

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
power strap which when you crank it down
this<00:01:38.310> power<00:01:38.549> strap<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.970> probably<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.360> be

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
this power strap is probably gonna be

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.609 
this power strap is probably gonna be
better<00:01:39.600> than<00:01:39.720> either<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.229> buckles

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
better than either of these buckles

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
better than either of these buckles
believe<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:44.159> has<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.909> atomic

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
believe it or not and it has the atomic

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920 
believe it or not and it has the atomic
asymmetrical<00:01:46.590> sport<00:01:46.950> liner<00:01:47.189> which<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
asymmetrical sport liner which is the

second death liner that they make its
heat<00:01:51.990> moldable<00:01:52.320> obviously<00:01:53.390> it's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
heat moldable obviously it's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910 
heat moldable obviously it's
ergonomically<00:01:55.110> designed<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
ergonomically designed it's just a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789 
ergonomically designed it's just a
comfortable<00:01:56.280> liner<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:57.600> boot<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.560> would

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
comfortable liner this boot we would

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.510 
comfortable liner this boot we would
probably<00:01:59.640> recommend<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.439> skiers<00:02:02.009> but

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
probably recommend to good skiers but

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
probably recommend to good skiers but
good<00:02:02.700> skiers<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> high<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.810> comfort

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
good skiers to have a high on comfort

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.990 
good skiers to have a high on comfort
because<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> comfortable<00:02:05.610> first

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
because it really is a comfortable first

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.389 
because it really is a comfortable first
and<00:02:06.180> foremost<00:02:06.710> even<00:02:07.710> though<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.950> does<00:02:08.129> have
