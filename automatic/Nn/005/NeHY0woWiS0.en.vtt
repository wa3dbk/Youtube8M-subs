 any other 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.390
 but unfortunately now such an opportunity 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.000
 I don't have Russian localization 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.360
 and I begin to offer just vip 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.070
 advantages that make this weapon 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.880
 so attractive to all players 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.900
 crossfire quick hands predator reflexes 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.760

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.660
 all characters 20 percent data 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.840
 bonuses are summed up with all your 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.270
 clips and if you compare vip with the original 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.820
 there technically obtain such 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.620
 here are the benefits first is speed 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.200
 hitting second is speed 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.820
 movement in the third is the range 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.580
 more just a shovel 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 Well, in the fourth it is certainly her 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.140
 appearance 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.120
 but I would like to see in practice 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.799
 advantage vip kukri now 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.049
 storyboard I actually you and 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.780
 demonstrate how kukri 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.780
 the hunter is faster than its original 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.520
 and now this moment is clearly visible 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.130
 vip kukri advantage here is no longer 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.430
 argue I suggest you go to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.430
 damage 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.569
 what is the time for summing up kukri 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.569
 the hunter would not like these 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.720
 external data such a deadly power 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.489
 if someone might not like and in 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.380
 at the end I would like to say for those 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.920

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.140
