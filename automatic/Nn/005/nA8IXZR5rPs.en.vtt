one use bolts so we ensure that on did
we<00:00:56.059> get<00:00:56.179> proper<00:00:56.570> torque<00:00:56.809> specs<00:00:57.140> by<00:00:57.350> reusing<00:00:57.739> by

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
we get proper torque specs by reusing by

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.979 
we get proper torque specs by reusing by
using<00:00:58.460> brand<00:00:58.699> new<00:00:58.879> bolts<00:00:59.210> when<00:00:59.359> we<00:00:59.449> reassemble

the<00:01:00.079> engines<00:01:00.469> in<00:01:00.760> addition<00:01:01.760> we<00:01:01.999> replace<00:01:02.300> the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
the engines in addition we replace the

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.669 
the engines in addition we replace the
freeze<00:01:02.719> plugs<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.230> side<00:01:03.410> of<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.559> engine

here and the cam seal here in the back

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.920 
here and the cam seal here in the back
one<00:01:09.439> thing<00:01:09.650> that<00:01:09.860> makes<00:01:10.040> our<00:01:10.930> rebuilds

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
one thing that makes our rebuilds

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.929 
one thing that makes our rebuilds
different<00:01:12.290> than<00:01:12.439> a<00:01:12.680> than<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.549> original

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
different than a than the original

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.120 
different than a than the original
engines<00:01:14.240> was<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.020> use<00:01:15.259> a<00:01:15.530> specially

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
engines was that we use a specially

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.359 
engines was that we use a specially
designed<00:01:16.450> cylinder<00:01:17.450> flange<00:01:17.799> we<00:01:18.799> when<00:01:19.220> we

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
designed cylinder flange we when we

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.780 
designed cylinder flange we when we
receive<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:20.090> block<00:01:20.930> back<00:01:21.229> we<00:01:22.570> cut<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.750> original

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
receive a block back we cut the original

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.420 
receive a block back we cut the original
cylinder<00:01:25.790> sleeve<00:01:26.630> out<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.680> engine<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.369> we

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
cylinder sleeve out of the engine and we

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.679 
cylinder sleeve out of the engine and we
reinstall<00:01:29.030> these<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:29.960> these<00:01:30.200> have<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.220> flange

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
reinstall these now these have a flange

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.440 
reinstall these now these have a flange
what<00:01:32.689> this<00:01:32.899> prevents<00:01:33.469> first<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.159> all<00:01:34.280> is<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
what this prevents first of all is the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.209 
what this prevents first of all is the
flange<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:38.630> sleeve<00:01:38.930> from<00:01:39.680> sliding<00:01:40.070> down

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
flange is the sleeve from sliding down

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.850 
flange is the sleeve from sliding down
into<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.850> cylinder<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:42.350> other<00:01:42.530> thing<00:01:42.829> that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
into the cylinder the other thing that

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.490 
into the cylinder the other thing that
happens<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:44.119> then<00:01:44.450> seals<00:01:44.899> against

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
happens is that this then seals against

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.410 
happens is that this then seals against
the<00:01:45.590> head<00:01:45.829> in<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.310> head<00:01:46.460> gasket<00:01:47.000> this

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
the head in the head gasket this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.630 
the head in the head gasket this
prevents<00:01:47.810> any<00:01:47.899> exhaust<00:01:48.530> gases<00:01:49.310> from<00:01:49.340> escaping

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
prevents any exhaust gases from escaping

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.620 
prevents any exhaust gases from escaping
over<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.509> edge<00:01:50.659> in<00:01:50.990> down<00:01:51.259> between<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
over the edge in down between the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.880 
over the edge in down between the
cylinder<00:01:53.630> sleeve<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.380> inside<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
cylinder sleeve and the inside of the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.300 
cylinder sleeve and the inside of the
block<00:01:55.659> another<00:01:56.659> thing<00:01:57.020> makes<00:01:57.350> our<00:01:57.680> engines

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
block another thing makes our engines

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.940 
block another thing makes our engines
different<00:01:58.789> is<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.869> we<00:02:00.200> have<00:02:00.289> also<00:02:00.469> had

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
different is that we have also had

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.969 
different is that we have also had
manufactured<00:02:01.460> for<00:02:01.820> us<00:02:01.909> special<00:02:02.810> cam<00:02:03.439> bearings

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
manufactured for us special cam bearings

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.719 
manufactured for us special cam bearings
and<00:02:04.250> these<00:02:04.820> cam<00:02:05.149> bearings<00:02:05.600> have<00:02:06.729> additional

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
and these cam bearings have additional

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.770 
and these cam bearings have additional
oil<00:02:07.869> ports<00:02:08.869> here<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.910> allow<00:02:10.910> for<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.330> better

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
oil ports here that allow for a better

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.479 
oil ports here that allow for a better
lubrication<00:02:12.019> on<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.800> front<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.129> engine

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
lubrication on the front of the engine

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.210 
lubrication on the front of the engine
here<00:02:14.269> where<00:02:14.930> all<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.200> timing<00:02:15.739> components

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
here where all the timing components

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.020 
here where all the timing components
a little<00:02:16.490> more<00:02:16.640> strain<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
a little more strain on the on the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.330 
a little more strain on the on the
camshaft<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.050> helps<00:02:21.530> insure<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:21.920> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
camshaft so this helps insure that the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.790 
camshaft so this helps insure that the
camshaft<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.390> properly<00:02:23.780> lubricated<00:02:24.260> when

what<00:02:27.590> we<00:02:27.740> do<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.160> we<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.790> deck<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.300> blocks<00:02:29.650> here

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
what we do is we we deck the blocks here

imagine<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.270> head<00:02:32.420> removed<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.110> what<00:02:33.770> we<00:02:33.890> do

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
imagine the head removed and what we do

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.490 
imagine the head removed and what we do
is<00:02:34.250> ensure<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.090> top<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.930> block<00:02:36.170> in

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
is ensure that the top of the block in

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.270 
is ensure that the top of the block in
is<00:02:36.710> then<00:02:36.950> parallel<00:02:37.340> with<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.920> saddles<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.130> the
