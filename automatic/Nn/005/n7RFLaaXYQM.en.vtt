 then he passed with a gradient brush 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.890

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.299

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.299
 eye to create depth 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.910
 I take gold cream with a brush from 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.650
 nuance and I apply it in the fold 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.989
 inner eye to give a 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.360
 beautiful reflection then I take the house 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:11.810
 the shock and the obligation in the internal rhyme 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:15.530

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.140
 I'm going to fade the lower rhyme and then 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.120
 took silver brown again and 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.069
 connects the lower part of the eye 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.170
 the upper part traces one 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.419
 very beautiful eyeliner line 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.049
 intense gloss using the eyeliner 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.049
 graphic 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:57.590
 then I say the eyelashes and apply the mascara 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:04.850
 shock to have maximum volume 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:07.220
 very black eyelashes this is the result 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.650
 final make up eyes 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.930
 you see that it has a shine that it seems 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.050
 a very wet effect 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.470
 particular use the dust 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.790
 tanning to create some 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.209
 contouring then pull out well 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.209
 cheekbones 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.500
 after which I use the maxxi fard effect 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.500
 silk in color no 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.759
 and illuminates the means as using not 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.639
 the over illuminating nor really enough 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.009
 really very little and with a brush 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.449
 discharge I go to illuminate also the arch 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:51.449
 cupid 's nose with the little finger 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:54.240
 light the inside corner with a pencil 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.400
 professional lips lipsticks arm the 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.419
 outline of my lips and leave 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.419
 also to fill 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.199
 if you want you can keep the effect 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.259
 opaque or as I did go 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:26.870
 above with the start list necks over kloss 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.870
 in brilliant in cherry color 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.590
 this is therefore my proposal for a 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.660
 very bright and second festive make-up 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.410

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.050
 for a Christmas dinner the enamel that 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:57.180
 I wear is the gloss gel polish effect 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.830
 in the red lacquer I hope
