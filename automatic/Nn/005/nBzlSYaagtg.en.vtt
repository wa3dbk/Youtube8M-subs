 play today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.410
 new tutorial on dying light that will 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.020
 concern today the fact of obtaining 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.640
 holding alienware in the game die he 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.310
 is then to do this it is enough 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.810
 to go to that address shown here that 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.610
 I will put in the description of the 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.840
 video 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.820
 then if you have an alienware account 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.829
 you can connect to it otherwise you 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.620
 are going to be invited to you go your 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.810
 steam account 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:46.280
 if you have the game on steam on ps3 or 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:48.470
 on xbox on ps4 forgiveness or on an xbox 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.970
 one is possible too that you 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.350
 can and link your account and after I 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.670
 know more if it's mandatory to create 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.290
 an alienware account or not in any case 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.820
 I do them once you have 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.110
 done to that you will have done this 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.570
 account creation you log in 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.700
 that your alienware account you click 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.020
 here admitted to the day light group who 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.119
 will allow you to exchange with 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.409
 other alienware people on on 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.990
 day night which can be interesting 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.100
 for you and then you click here 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.259
 on get who then in your mails so 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.310
 mail that you will inform 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.819
 normally by making your account 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.590
 alienware 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.179
 you will receive therefore animate the who 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.920
 will confirm that creating your 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.249
 account and an email that will send you the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.340
 code 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.869
 at 2 the code you need 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.369
 so once you have this frame 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.409
 you copy it or the collar is here it 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.420
 are the instructions then I'm not going 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.409
 you translate things can not 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.600
 very complicated but I will show you 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.399
 how do we do once you 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 have copied the code from your 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.979
 mail you go in steam 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.429
 then in steam you go from there 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.749
 activate a product on steam so there 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.130
 you do next do you do I'm 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.319
 okay then here you paste your 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.060
 code 1 you validate that will tell you that 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.740
 it has added etc. 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.990
 and when you go go in your 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.789
 library you will be able to see here 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.209
 that I have it is considered a 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.350
 dlc 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:05.270
 I have the dlc to alienware outfit 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.390
 and I will show you where are they 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 are then found when you launch the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.000
 play light 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.920
 so it's really not very complicated 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 it gives no access to hyper things 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.760
 exaggerated we'll say but it allows you 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.610
 to have a slightly different outfit from 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.510
 those of your friends and it can be 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.220
 it's not nice anyway I 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.900
 think it's nice so for 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.610
 actually get your outfit 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.840
 it's like other outfits 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.489
 you win during the game you have to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.060
 go through the player's hideout so by 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.700
 two bags of the hideout the plant of the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.310
 player I 'll show you that soon 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.890
 that the game will have to charge and my part in 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.800
 course hoping that I will not be very 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:54.010
 far from one of his hideouts 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.180
 here we will continue and then 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.950
 here is my opportunity to tell you 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.269
 also during loading that there is 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.299
 other videos at all in this 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.690
 particular playlist to win one of 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.690
 news to new weapons and there are 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.370
 also my entire playlist of any 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.110
 the adventurous that I still do with a 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.850
 friend to me that you can also go 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.980
 see and it will do me that I will be happy 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.080
 if you take a look at his videos and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.670
 that you leave me comments 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:25.769
 so here you go in the plant of 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.239
 player and you will have in your outfit 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.799
 downloadable outfit and you'll have the 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.549
 alienware outfit that looks like that 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.480
 so after I do not know where is that 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.160
 you 're in the game but I'm going 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.079
 enjoy to show you what there is 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.400
 also as another outfit outside of this 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.959
 which is downloadable 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.700
 when we unlock that's the clothes 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.350
 basic people who post the tower 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.980
 she held athletes 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.280
 there is the tracer and to the scout the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.700
 surviving the headhunter and the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.400
 heavy weight 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.079
 So here I am, I put the black workshop 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.799
 outfit so you leave you there if she 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.750
 is not selected 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.400
 so what are you doing so here I 'm going 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.790
 change me but normally you know 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.190
 how to do 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.230
 you put on the alienware outfit and 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.840
 you make spaces and that goes space 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.450
 between and forgiveness and it will equip 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.400
 workshops here and then 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.160
 you can see when I walk a 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.720
 little bit that we maintained the outfit 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.010
 camouflage and that's it so it's just 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.590
 it's just like that it's all stupid 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.870
 it's very simple to do no 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.100
 of particular difficulties after 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.420
 is there one thing or others that you 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.250
 do not understand because on the site is 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.060
 in English or if there are things that 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.950
 you did not work they 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.230
 not hesitate to put a comment or 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.660
 me tweets and also because I'm not 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.460
 badly twitter and / or so to me 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.860
 ask via my facebook page 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:50.080
 so I would respond as quickly 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.690
 as quickly as possible for 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.830
 me to do it but since I am 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.770
 many normally connected that 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.110
 should not pose a lot of 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.260
 problems for me to answer you 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.800

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.110
 video will have you will have interested you and 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.020
