00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
something maybe it's just not the right

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
something maybe it's just not the right
hue<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.270> something<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.719> my<00:01:30.840> skin<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
is a beautiful lipstick but I thought I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.830 
is a beautiful lipstick but I thought I
might<00:01:35.219> come<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.770> show<00:01:37.939> how<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.179> looks<00:01:39.420> on
