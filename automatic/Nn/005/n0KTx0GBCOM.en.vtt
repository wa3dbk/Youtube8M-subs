00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.950 
bat and going around the world and
collecting<00:02:25.970> those<00:02:26.060> things<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.510> pretty<00:02:26.720> fun

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
collecting those things is pretty fun

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.560 
collecting those things is pretty fun
and<00:02:27.140> everyone's<00:02:28.010> while<00:02:28.160> your<00:02:28.400> sim<00:02:28.700> will<00:02:29.060> not

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
and everyone's while your sim will not

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.840 
and everyone's while your sim will not
quite<00:02:30.200> get<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> cast<00:02:30.800> right<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.340> fall<00:02:31.520> flat

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
quite get the cast right and fall flat

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.360 
quite get the cast right and fall flat
on<00:02:31.910> his<00:02:32.120> face<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:33.350> that's<00:02:33.530> we're<00:02:33.770> keeping<00:02:34.100> sort

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
on his face so that's we're keeping sort

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.470 
on his face so that's we're keeping sort
of<00:02:34.460> that<00:02:34.550> humor<00:02:34.820> around<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.330> well<00:02:36.190> we<00:02:37.190> have<00:02:37.480> we

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
of that humor around as well we have we

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.820 
of that humor around as well we have we
believe<00:02:38.780> we've<00:02:38.990> tried<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.320> keep<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.650> focus

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
believe we've tried to keep the focus

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.590 
believe we've tried to keep the focus
even<00:02:40.340> though<00:02:40.520> we<00:02:40.670> have<00:02:40.880> an<00:02:41.030> open<00:02:41.240> world<00:02:41.390> now

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
even though we have an open world now

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.730 
even though we have an open world now
we've<00:02:41.810> been<00:02:42.080> trying<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.380> keep<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> focus

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
we've been trying to keep the focus

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.890 
we've been trying to keep the focus
still<00:02:42.920> on<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.459> know<00:02:43.550> getting<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.880> home<00:02:44.090> you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
still on you know getting the home you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140 
still on you know getting the home you
know<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.140> seems<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.760> establish<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.060> we

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
know it seems to establish so that we

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.060 
know it seems to establish so that we
have<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.390> lot<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.750> features<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.920> you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
have a lot of the features that that you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.040 
have a lot of the features that that you
guys<00:02:49.220> are<00:02:49.340> expecting<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.880> see<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.540> and

guys are expecting to see there and and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.780 
guys are expecting to see there and and
have<00:02:51.290> new<00:02:51.590> objects<00:02:51.980> interactions<00:02:52.520> i<00:02:52.550> want<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
have new objects interactions i want to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.910 
have new objects interactions i want to
give<00:02:53.240> everything<00:02:53.630> away<00:02:53.870> because<00:02:54.260> there's

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
give everything away because there's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.770 
give everything away because there's
still<00:02:55.100> stuff<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:56.360> you're<00:02:56.450> gonna<00:02:56.570> find

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
still stuff that that you're gonna find

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.240 
still stuff that that you're gonna find
surprising<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.500> i<00:02:57.530> think<00:02:57.709> that's<00:02:57.860> what<00:02:58.100> makes

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
surprising and i think that's what makes

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.760 
surprising and i think that's what makes
the<00:02:58.400> sims<00:02:58.870> quite<00:02:59.870> addictive<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:00.530> finding

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
the sims quite addictive it's finding

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.640 
the sims quite addictive it's finding
those<00:03:00.860> surprising<00:03:01.400> things<00:03:01.580> along<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.030> way

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
those surprising things along the way

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.780 
those surprising things along the way
another<00:03:03.650> thing<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:03.980> i<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.070> enjoy<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
another thing that i really enjoy is the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.570 
another thing that i really enjoy is the
the<00:03:05.480> camera<00:03:05.870> phone<00:03:06.080> all<00:03:06.800> sims<00:03:07.130> have<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> little

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
the camera phone all sims have a little

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.040 
the camera phone all sims have a little
cell<00:03:07.760> phone<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.180> got<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.300> camera<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.810> they<00:03:08.900> can

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
cell phone it's got a camera so they can

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.970 
cell phone it's got a camera so they can
take<00:03:09.170> pictures<00:03:09.530> all<00:03:09.680> around<00:03:09.709> the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
take pictures all around the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.440 
take pictures all around the
neighborhood<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.730> hang<00:03:10.940> up<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.150> their<00:03:11.269> house

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
neighborhood to hang up in their house

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.699 
neighborhood to hang up in their house
or<00:03:11.720> they<00:03:11.780> can<00:03:11.989> actually<00:03:12.110> go<00:03:12.320> back<00:03:12.440> home<00:03:12.590> and

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
or they can actually go back home and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.020 
or they can actually go back home and
paint<00:03:12.920> them<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:13.280> they've<00:03:13.400> kind<00:03:13.610> of<00:03:13.670> memorized

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
paint them so they've kind of memorized

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.400 
paint them so they've kind of memorized
the<00:03:14.150> scene<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.540> go<00:03:14.630> paint<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.900> picture<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.290> it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
the scene and go paint a picture of it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.960 
the scene and go paint a picture of it
so<00:03:16.070> that's<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.400> some<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.760> really<00:03:16.880> cool

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
so that's just some of the really cool

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.720 
so that's just some of the really cool
stuff<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.390> like<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.100> sims<00:03:19.280> 3<00:03:19.519> we've

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
stuff I like so in the sims 3 we've

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.330 
stuff I like so in the sims 3 we've
actually<00:03:20.420> taken<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:21.050> one<00:03:21.709> meter<00:03:21.920> grid<00:03:22.190> you

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
actually taken that one meter grid you

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.790 
actually taken that one meter grid you
have<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.820> broken<00:03:23.720> up<00:03:23.840> into<00:03:24.019> quarters<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:24.739> you

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
have and broken up into quarters so you

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.940 
have and broken up into quarters so you
can<00:03:25.190> move<00:03:25.280> things<00:03:25.489> at<00:03:25.670> half<00:03:25.820> resolution<00:03:26.950> so

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
can move things at half resolution so

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.990 
can move things at half resolution so
that<00:03:27.980> means<00:03:28.310> if<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.489> have<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.640> three<00:03:28.820> tile

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
that means if you have a three tile

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.090 
that means if you have a three tile
couch<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.660> can<00:03:29.690> position<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.410> tile<00:03:30.709> TV<00:03:31.010> in

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
couch you can position a to tile TV in

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.300 
couch you can position a to tile TV in
front<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.459> perfectly<00:03:31.820> consent<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.330> them<00:03:33.310> in

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
front of it perfectly consent of them in

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.830 
front of it perfectly consent of them in
addition<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:34.940> we<00:03:35.209> let<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.480> rotate

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
addition to that we let you rotate

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.930 
addition to that we let you rotate
objects<00:03:36.320> at<00:03:36.530> 45<00:03:37.010> degree<00:03:37.220> angles<00:03:37.519> now<00:03:37.640> instead

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
objects at 45 degree angles now instead

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.050 
objects at 45 degree angles now instead
of<00:03:38.000> 90<00:03:38.600> degree<00:03:38.810> angles<00:03:39.459> but<00:03:40.459> for<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.760> experts

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
of 90 degree angles but for the experts

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.120 
of 90 degree angles but for the experts
out<00:03:41.269> there<00:03:41.299> like<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.780> guys<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.890> can<00:03:43.010> actually

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
out there like you guys you can actually

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.220 
out there like you guys you can actually
just<00:03:43.430> hold<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:44.000> Alt<00:03:44.150> key<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.540> then<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:45.049> can

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
just hold the Alt key and then you can

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.350 
just hold the Alt key and then you can
place<00:03:45.530> things<00:03:45.860> off<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.549> grid<00:03:46.700> anywhere<00:03:47.120> and

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
place things off the grid anywhere and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.750 
place things off the grid anywhere and
rotate<00:03:48.290> things<00:03:48.530> at<00:03:48.709> any<00:03:48.920> angles<00:03:49.280> at<00:03:49.400> all<00:03:49.519> and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
rotate things at any angles at all and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.800 
rotate things at any angles at all and
it<00:03:50.480> all<00:03:50.600> works<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.880> top<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.239> we've

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
it all works on top of that we've

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.780 
it all works on top of that we've
actually<00:03:53.989> added<00:03:54.200> more<00:03:54.650> placement<00:03:55.640> on

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
actually added more placement on

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.240 
actually added more placement on
surfaces<00:03:56.360> for<00:03:56.510> things<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.709> don't<00:03:57.890> have<00:03:58.070> to

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
surfaces for things so you don't have to
