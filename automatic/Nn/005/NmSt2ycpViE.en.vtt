00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
I think that it's not easy living a life

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.300 
I think that it's not easy living a life
you<00:04:16.100> know<00:04:16.250> like<00:04:16.730> about<00:04:17.000> purity<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:19.160> like

you know like about purity and it's like

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.780 
you know like about purity and it's like
not<00:04:19.460> easy<00:04:19.640> at<00:04:19.850> all<00:04:19.910> actually<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:21.680> think<00:04:21.980> I<00:04:22.430> think

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
not easy at all actually I think I think

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.860 
not easy at all actually I think I think
it's<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.670> almost<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.300> little<00:04:26.330> easier<00:04:26.750> to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
it's like it's almost a little easier to

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.450 
it's like it's almost a little easier to
just<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.200> go<00:04:27.380> with<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.680> flow<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:27.890> what<00:04:28.190> our
