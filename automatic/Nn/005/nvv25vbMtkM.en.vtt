00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.690
 hello now I will compare the maximum 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:17.520
 speed in two cars gold s939 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:21.140
 l 939 and a 999 both has a proportional 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.140
 steering 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.450
 also both has 5 speeds 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:01:00.820
 1,999 immediately at top speed 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.330
 at minimum speed 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.970
 yes it is hard for him to move on 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.970
 minimum speed bolted 2 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:34.100
 fairly large turning angle now 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.100
 try the 239 model 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:23.860
 So the clear winner is the 939 model. 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:28.310
 due to the fact that the wheels are smaller 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.550
 regarding 999 movement succeeds 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:38.569
 much easier i think the motors are here 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:41.780
 same battery too same i 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.889
 I will not say that the 999 model drives worse but 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:50.419
 even the video shows that 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:52.729
 Basically, baby 939 is much more interesting but 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.610
 true on sharp turns he and 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.650
 tries to roll over motors 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.610
 collector in both models is heated 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.250
 prefer to 60 degrees it certainly 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.750
 decent heating 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:11.529
 so from time to time they need to be given 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.529
 rest thank you for your attention bye
