show you a quick and easy way to make
two<00:00:17.730> different<00:00:17.880> kinds<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> waves

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
two different kinds of waves

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.400 
two different kinds of waves
the<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.210> wave<00:00:21.450> I'm<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.930> show<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.140> how

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the first wave I'm going to show you how

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.710 
the first wave I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:22.470> make<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.419> for

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to make is this one that you can use for

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.010 
to make is this one that you can use for
the<00:00:24.810> surface<00:00:25.290> of<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> water<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:27.599> second

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
the surface of the water and the second

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.810 
the surface of the water and the second
one<00:00:28.169> is<00:00:28.290> this<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.860> that<00:00:29.009> you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.220> use<00:00:29.610> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
one is this one that you can use to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.560 
one is this one that you can use to
build<00:00:30.000> an<00:00:30.270> underwater<00:00:30.599> scene<00:00:32.180> okay<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.239> you're

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
build an underwater scene okay so you're

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
build an underwater scene okay so you're
going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> need<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.440> paper<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.310> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
going to need some paper for this to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.850 
going to need some paper for this to
make<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> stencil<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> stencil

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
make a stencil this is what the stencil

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.150 
make a stencil this is what the stencil
will<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.130> use

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
will look like and I like to use

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.910 
will look like and I like to use
recycled<00:00:42.060> printer<00:00:42.450> paper<00:00:42.630> for<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.740> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
recycled printer paper for this but you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.270 
recycled printer paper for this but you
can<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.130> any<00:00:44.640> thin<00:00:45.180> text<00:00:46.140> white<00:00:46.380> paper<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
can use any thin text white paper you

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.460 
can use any thin text white paper you
don't<00:00:47.400> want<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.880> use<00:00:48.120> heavy<00:00:48.480> cardstock<00:00:48.960> for

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
don't want to use heavy cardstock for

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.820 
don't want to use heavy cardstock for
this<00:00:49.820> then<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:50.850> turn<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.630> paper<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.440> you're

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
this then just turn the paper as you're

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.750 
this then just turn the paper as you're
cutting<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.490> make<00:00:53.670> nice<00:00:53.940> points<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.760> there

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
cutting it to make nice points and there

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
cutting it to make nice points and there
it<00:00:56.970> is<00:00:57.150> this<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:58.110> side<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.860> stencil<00:00:59.430> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it is this is a side of the stencil that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.299 
it is this is a side of the stencil that
we'll<00:00:59.790> be<00:00:59.970> using<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.930> surface<00:01:01.470> waves

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.740 

next<00:01:05.309> I'll<00:01:05.430> show<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
next I'll show you how to make the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
next I'll show you how to make the
stencil<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> underwater<00:01:08.130> waves<00:01:08.610> like

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
stencil for the underwater waves like

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.870 
stencil for the underwater waves like
these<00:01:12.289> for<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:13.439> underwater<00:01:13.859> waves<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.700> just

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
these for the underwater waves you just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.429 
these for the underwater waves you just
want<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> look<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.109> ripples

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
want them to kind of look like ripples

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
want them to kind of look like ripples
you<00:01:16.950> don't<00:01:17.249> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> make<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:17.999> pointy

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you don't want to make really pointy

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.910 
you don't want to make really pointy
waves<00:01:19.079> for<00:01:19.499> this<00:01:19.679> and<00:01:20.929> one<00:01:21.929> little<00:01:22.200> tip<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.710> like

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
waves for this and one little tip I like

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.010 
waves for this and one little tip I like
to<00:01:23.069> use<00:01:23.219> big<00:01:23.579> scissors<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> make<00:01:24.810> these

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to use big scissors when I make these

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.469 
to use big scissors when I make these
stencils<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.829> just<00:01:26.039> makes<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.490> easier<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.149> cut

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
stencils it just makes it easier to cut

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.580 
stencils it just makes it easier to cut
out<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.869> shape<00:01:29.929> next<00:01:30.929> I<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.289> talk<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
out the shape next I want to talk a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
out the shape next I want to talk a
little<00:01:31.799> bit<00:01:31.950> about<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.639> ink<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.359> tool

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
little bit about the ink in the tool

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.169 
little bit about the ink in the tool
that<00:01:33.899> I'm<00:01:33.990> using<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.039> a<00:01:35.069> Tim<00:01:35.460> Holtz<00:01:35.939> foam

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
that I'm using this is a Tim Holtz foam

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.539 
that I'm using this is a Tim Holtz foam
applicator<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.649> using<00:01:37.859> it<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
applicator and I'm using it with the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.569 
applicator and I'm using it with the
tumbled<00:01:39.090> glass<00:01:39.179> distress<00:01:39.689> ink<00:01:40.319> if<00:01:40.649> you<00:01:41.310> don't

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
tumbled glass distress ink if you don't

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.660 
tumbled glass distress ink if you don't
have<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.359> these<00:01:42.630> tools<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.310> use<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
have one of these tools you can use a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.569 
have one of these tools you can use a
sponge<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.259> any<00:01:46.469> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.009> sponge<00:01:47.340> or

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
sponge and like any kind of a sponge or

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.590 
sponge and like any kind of a sponge or
makeup<00:01:47.850> sponge

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
makeup sponge

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.069 
makeup sponge
but<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.530> works<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.039> great<00:01:51.079> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
but this just works really great you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.859 
but this just works really great you
just<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.499> to<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.679> nice<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.279> inky<00:01:53.789> and<00:01:54.149> then

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
just want to get nice and inky and then

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899 
just want to get nice and inky and then
you<00:01:55.079> take<00:01:55.350> your<00:01:55.380> stencil<00:01:56.249> that<00:01:56.279> we<00:01:56.459> made<00:01:56.759> in

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you take your stencil that we made in

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.699 
you take your stencil that we made in
the<00:01:56.999> previous<00:01:57.179> step<00:01:57.779> and<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.469> kind<00:01:58.649> of

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
the previous step and I just kind of

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.429 
the previous step and I just kind of
hold<00:01:59.069> it<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.819> the<00:01:59.969> paper<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.779> then<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
hold it there on the paper and then I

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.699 
hold it there on the paper and then I
start<00:02:01.889> off<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.639> edge<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.779> stencil<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
start off the edge of the stencil and I

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.819 
start off the edge of the stencil and I
pulled<00:02:05.189> ink<00:02:05.609> down<00:02:06.139> you<00:02:07.139> don't<00:02:07.349> want<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.679> go

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
pulled ink down you don't want to go

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.130 
pulled ink down you don't want to go
back<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.520> forth<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.020> want

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
back and forth with this you just want

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.010 
back and forth with this you just want
to<00:02:10.349> go<00:02:10.560> from<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.190> top<00:02:11.459> down<00:02:12.240> like<00:02:12.270> this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
to go from the top down like this

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.040 
to go from the top down like this
otherwise<00:02:14.010> you'll<00:02:14.730> mess<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:15.209> your<00:02:15.450> stencil

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
otherwise you'll mess up your stencil

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.560 
otherwise you'll mess up your stencil
and<00:02:16.170> you'll<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.500> ink<00:02:16.970> underneath<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
and you'll get ink underneath the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.350 
and you'll get ink underneath the
stencil

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
stencil

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.390 
stencil
you<00:02:19.570> don't<00:02:19.780> want<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.980> start<00:02:21.280> at<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
you don't want it so just start at the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.720 
you don't want it so just start at the
top<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:21.790> then<00:02:22.390> pull<00:02:22.780> down<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:24.100> like<00:02:24.370> that

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
top and then pull down just like that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.900 
top and then pull down just like that
and<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.160> first<00:02:27.580> row<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.940> waves<00:02:29.910> now

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
and that's the first row of waves now

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.150 
and that's the first row of waves now
for<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.570> next<00:02:31.840> row<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.260> waves<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.920> just

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
for the next row of waves you just

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.600 
for the next row of waves you just
position<00:02:33.850> your<00:02:34.210> stencil<00:02:34.810> off<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:36.010> side<00:02:36.040> or

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
position your stencil off to one side or

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.580 
position your stencil off to one side or
the<00:02:36.670> other<00:02:36.790> wherever<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:38.080> it'll<00:02:38.320> look

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
the other wherever you think it'll look

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.940 
the other wherever you think it'll look
nice<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.150> one<00:02:40.540> reason<00:02:40.780> I'd<00:02:41.080> try<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.560> cut

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
nice this is one reason I'd try to cut

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.790 
nice this is one reason I'd try to cut
the<00:02:42.130> stencil<00:02:42.480> bigger<00:02:43.480> than<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.440> cardstock

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
the stencil bigger than the cardstock

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.310 
the stencil bigger than the cardstock
that<00:02:45.310> I'm<00:02:45.459> doing<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.270> on<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:47.110> have

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
that I'm doing this on so that you have

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.970 
that I'm doing this on so that you have
options<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.640> room<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.060> play<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:50.830> you

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
options and room to play and then you

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.330 
options and room to play and then you
just<00:02:51.250> do<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.459> same<00:02:51.850> thing<00:02:52.180> again<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:54.040> try

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
just do the same thing again and I try

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.390 
just do the same thing again and I try
not<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.850> put<00:02:55.330> too<00:02:55.360> much<00:02:55.870> ink<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:57.160> row<00:02:57.370> of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
not to put too much ink on the row of

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.360 
not to put too much ink on the row of
waves<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.660> did<00:02:58.870> before<00:02:59.050> but<00:02:59.709> it's<00:02:59.950> okay

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
waves that we did before but it's okay

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.699 
waves that we did before but it's okay
to<00:03:00.430> put<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> little<00:03:00.970> bit<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:02.050> this<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.470> where

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
to put a little bit and this is where

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.920 
to put a little bit and this is where
the<00:03:02.980> Tim<00:03:03.310> Holtz<00:03:03.550> ink<00:03:03.940> is<00:03:04.180> really<00:03:04.660> nice<00:03:04.900> for

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
the Tim Holtz ink is really nice for

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.380 
the Tim Holtz ink is really nice for
this<00:03:05.320> because<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.980> all<00:03:06.100> blends<00:03:06.790> together

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
this because it all blends together

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.050 
this because it all blends together
really<00:03:08.050> well<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:09.450> there's<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.690> row<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:12.060> you

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
really well and there's that row and you

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.630 
really well and there's that row and you
can<00:03:13.300> just<00:03:13.540> keep<00:03:13.720> adding<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.530> many<00:03:14.770> rows<00:03:15.190> as<00:03:15.220> you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
can just keep adding as many rows as you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.110 
can just keep adding as many rows as you
want<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:17.410> stopped<00:03:18.010> at<00:03:18.250> these<00:03:18.489> two<00:03:18.850> for

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
want I just stopped at these two for

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.570 
want I just stopped at these two for
this<00:03:19.300> little<00:03:19.480> sample<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:20.500> then<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.130> wanted<00:03:21.489> to

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
this little sample and then I wanted to

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.580 
this little sample and then I wanted to
tell<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:21.880> too<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.390> can<00:03:22.660> try<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:22.959> with<00:03:23.170> other

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
tell you too you can try this with other

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.470 
tell you too you can try this with other
inks<00:03:24.130> but<00:03:24.280> I've<00:03:24.400> had<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.820> best<00:03:25.120> luck<00:03:25.420> with

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
inks but I've had the best luck with

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.570 
inks but I've had the best luck with
these<00:03:25.870> distress<00:03:26.350> inks<00:03:26.739> since<00:03:26.890> they<00:03:27.070> do<00:03:27.130> blend

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
these distress inks since they do blend

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.300 
these distress inks since they do blend
so<00:03:27.850> well<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:29.140> for<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.470> other<00:03:29.500> kind<00:03:30.130> of

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
so well and then for the other kind of

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.650 
so well and then for the other kind of
wave<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.610> just<00:03:31.180> do<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.570> same<00:03:31.810> thing<00:03:32.140> again

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
wave you just do the same thing again

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.320 
wave you just do the same thing again
and<00:03:34.660> that's<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.500> thanks<00:03:36.310> for<00:03:36.459> watching<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.239> I

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
and that's it thanks for watching and I

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.000 
and that's it thanks for watching and I
thought<00:03:37.540> I'd<00:03:37.690> share<00:03:37.900> one<00:03:38.200> last<00:03:38.440> little<00:03:38.709> tip

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
thought I'd share one last little tip

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.610 
thought I'd share one last little tip
before<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.519> go<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.630> can<00:03:40.840> use<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.290> same

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
before I go you can use the same

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.310 
before I go you can use the same
technique<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.220> create<00:03:42.580> grass<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.570> Hills<00:03:43.959> just

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
technique to create grass and Hills just

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.100 
technique to create grass and Hills just
use<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.340> same<00:03:45.580> kind<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:45.970> stencil<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.690> did<00:03:46.870> for

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
use the same kind of stencil you did for

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.100 
use the same kind of stencil you did for
the<00:03:47.170> underwater<00:03:47.680> wait
