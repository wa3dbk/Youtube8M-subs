about<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.990> Megatron's<00:01:25.530> doesn't<00:01:25.920> have

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
about you know Megatron's doesn't have

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.170 
about you know Megatron's doesn't have
his<00:01:26.159> head<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.640> he<00:01:26.670> obviously<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
his head because he obviously has to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
his head because he obviously has to
create<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.840> port<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> space<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
create this like port of space but in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
create this like port of space but in
order<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> make<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> terms<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.450> return

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
order to make the terms to return

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.929 
order to make the terms to return
because<00:01:31.320> he's<00:01:31.560> been<00:01:31.740> dormant<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.310> years<00:01:32.340> now

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
because he's been dormant for years now

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.969 
because he's been dormant for years now
and<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.780> been<00:01:33.810> easy<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.380> get<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.950> just

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and it's been easy to get out and just

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.280 
and it's been easy to get out and just
show<00:01:35.250> his<00:01:35.400> wrath<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
show his wrath and I think it's going to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350 
show his wrath and I think it's going to
be<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:37.500> revealed<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.009> part<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.790> but

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
because in part while we don't clearly

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.389 
because in part while we don't clearly
know<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.210> why<00:01:42.750> megatronus<00:01:43.500> wants<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.250> come

it looks like always bolt robot marriage
they<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:23.020> look<00:03:23.170> very<00:03:23.200> hard<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.860> do<00:03:24.040> sometimes

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
they just look very hard to do sometimes

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.120 
they just look very hard to do sometimes
there<00:03:25.420> are<00:03:25.660> two<00:03:25.930> front<00:03:26.260> much<00:03:26.410> forwards<00:03:26.800> always
