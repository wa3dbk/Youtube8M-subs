broth<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.630> there<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.020> mean<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.709> does<00:02:30.830> exactly

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
broth in there I mean it does exactly

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.559 
broth in there I mean it does exactly
but<00:02:31.400> apparently<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.819> helps<00:02:31.940> do<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.390> while

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
but apparently it helps do that while

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.130 
but apparently it helps do that while
it's<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.870> oven

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.570 

about<00:02:36.140> turkey<00:02:36.709> out<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.980> oven<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.430> been

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
about turkey out of the oven it's been

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.759 
about turkey out of the oven it's been
30<00:02:37.760> minutes<00:02:37.850> I'm<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.320> nervous<00:02:39.380> about<00:02:39.620> this

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
30 minutes I'm really nervous about this

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.440 
30 minutes I'm really nervous about this
farm<00:02:40.070> because<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.459> hot<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.150> heavy

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
farm because it's hot and it's heavy

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.180 
farm because it's hot and it's heavy
let's<00:02:42.350> hope<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.560> don't<00:02:42.590> drop<00:02:42.769> it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
let's hope I don't drop it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.509 
let's hope I don't drop it
I've<00:02:43.370> faced<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.180> now<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:46.130> much<00:02:46.340> heat<00:02:46.780> who<00:02:48.519> like

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
I've faced it now so much heat who like

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.720 
I've faced it now so much heat who like
progress<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.500> scoop<00:02:52.069> up<00:02:52.220> some<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.550> that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
progress then you scoop up some of that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.280 
progress then you scoop up some of that
if<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:54.019> that's<00:02:54.200> a

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
if you can and then I think that's a

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.890 
if you can and then I think that's a
base<00:02:54.500> right<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.550> sort<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.850> bathe<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.630> its

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
base right just sort of bathe it in its

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.690 
base right just sort of bathe it in its
own<00:02:57.080> juices<00:02:58.390> sounds<00:02:59.390> good<00:02:59.630> all<00:03:00.410> right<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.950> think

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
own juices sounds good all right I think

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.550 
own juices sounds good all right I think
that<00:03:01.850> looks<00:03:02.000> good<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.600> think<00:03:03.260> it's<00:03:03.380> time<00:03:03.500> for

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
that looks good I think it's time for

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.970 
that looks good I think it's time for
you<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.890> go<00:03:03.980> back<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> oven<00:03:04.430> mr.<00:03:04.850> bird<00:03:05.980> see

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
you to go back in the oven mr. bird see

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.650 
you to go back in the oven mr. bird see
you<00:03:07.100> later

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
you later

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.290 
you later
so<00:03:09.260> we<00:03:09.650> are<00:03:09.890> two<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.280> half<00:03:10.370> hours<00:03:10.640> into<00:03:10.850> the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
so we are two and a half hours into the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.930 
so we are two and a half hours into the
turkey<00:03:11.740> cooking<00:03:12.740> in<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.280> oven<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.820> it's

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
looking good it's looking kind of cooked

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.400 
looking good it's looking kind of cooked
this<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.030> part<00:03:17.240> where<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.810> take<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.050> main

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
this is the part where you take the main

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.100 
this is the part where you take the main
coil<00:03:18.800> off<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.490> replace<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:19.850> with<00:03:20.600> these

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
coil off and you replace it with these

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.420 
coil off and you replace it with these
little<00:03:21.170> foil<00:03:21.650> this<00:03:21.830> is<00:03:21.950> actually<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.250> part

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
little foil this is actually the part

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.560 
little foil this is actually the part
that<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.640> have<00:03:22.760> been<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:22.940> most<00:03:23.090> excited<00:03:23.510> about

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
that I have been the most excited about

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.080 
that I have been the most excited about
when<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.320> get<00:03:24.440> about<00:03:24.950> halfway<00:03:25.160> into<00:03:25.520> cooking

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
when you get about halfway into cooking

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.990 
when you get about halfway into cooking
you<00:03:26.300> have<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.600> cover<00:03:27.040> little<00:03:28.040> end<00:03:28.370> pieces<00:03:28.730> here

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
you have to cover little end pieces here

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.820 
you have to cover little end pieces here
so<00:03:29.180> they<00:03:29.270> don't<00:03:29.420> burn<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.320> do<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.620> by

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
so they don't burn and you do that by

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.030 
so they don't burn and you do that by
making<00:03:30.860> little<00:03:31.400> songs<00:03:31.640> for<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> turkeys<00:03:36.040> sock

is usually my dad's job that I don't
know<00:04:10.160> what<00:04:10.520> I'm<00:04:10.610> doing<00:04:10.820> but<00:04:11.150> as<00:04:11.900> with<00:04:12.260> all<00:04:12.290> my

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
know what I'm doing but as with all my

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.880 
know what I'm doing but as with all my
videos<00:04:13.070> let's<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.150> anyway<00:04:17.320> through<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.650> lot

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
videos let's do it anyway through a lot

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.640 
videos let's do it anyway through a lot
of<00:04:18.920> stuff<00:04:19.250> going<00:04:19.520> on<00:04:19.700> if<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.600> had<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:21.080> third<00:04:21.350> hand

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
of stuff going on if I had a third hand

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.010 
of stuff going on if I had a third hand
I<00:04:21.950> think<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.760> would<00:04:22.910> be

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
I think this would be

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.840 
I think this would be
okay<00:04:24.590> one<00:04:25.490> piece<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.210> Turkey<00:04:27.070> done<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.400> might

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
okay one piece of Turkey done I might

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.910 
okay one piece of Turkey done I might
have<00:04:29.000> looked<00:04:29.450> like<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:30.080> was<00:04:30.200> doing<00:04:30.470> okay<00:04:30.770> today

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
have looked like I was doing okay today

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.590 
have looked like I was doing okay today
but<00:04:31.190> shortly<00:04:31.520> after<00:04:31.610> starting<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.180> carve<00:04:32.450> into

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
but shortly after starting to carve into

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.510 
but shortly after starting to carve into
that<00:04:32.840> turkey<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.440> realized<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.340> whole

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
that turkey I realized that the whole
