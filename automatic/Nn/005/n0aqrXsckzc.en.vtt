the chance to become the next generation

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.810 
the chance to become the next generation
of<00:00:07.109> scientists<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:07.950> engineers<00:00:08.099> and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
of scientists and engineers and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.480 
of scientists and engineers and
entrepreneurs<00:00:09.469> if<00:00:10.469> they<00:00:10.650> study<00:00:10.920> hard<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.340> math

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
entrepreneurs if they study hard in math

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.549 
entrepreneurs if they study hard in math
and<00:00:11.670> science<00:00:11.730> then<00:00:12.630> their<00:00:12.750> futures<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.259> gonna

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
and science then their futures are gonna

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.269 
and science then their futures are gonna
be<00:00:13.710> bright<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:14.940> America's<00:00:15.529> now<00:00:16.529> may

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
be bright and so is America's now may

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.769 
be bright and so is America's now may
the<00:00:17.310> best<00:00:17.609> robot<00:00:18.090> win<00:00:21.320> one<00:00:22.320> day<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:23.279> tour

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
the best robot win one day was on tour

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
the best robot win one day was on tour
driving<00:00:24.779> around<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.560> arena<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.010> us<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.310> way

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
driving around the arena on us that way

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.820 
driving around the arena on us that way
so<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.029> thinking<00:00:27.480> wow<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.080> want<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.529> visit

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
so just thinking wow I want to visit

so just thinking wow I want to visit
this<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.880> googled<00:00:30.119> segways<00:00:30.960> inventor<00:00:31.640> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this so I googled segways inventor and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440 
this so I googled segways inventor and
Jinky<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.120> popped<00:00:33.329> up

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.820

engineering<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:21.740> just<00:01:22.430> blew<00:01:22.759> my<00:01:23.030> mind

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
engineering I just blew my mind

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.930 
engineering I just blew my mind
so<00:01:24.470> from<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.830> point<00:01:25.040> on<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.280> was<00:01:25.580> just<00:01:25.640> like

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
so from that point on I was just like

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.620 
so from that point on I was just like
I'm<00:01:26.690> all<00:01:26.960> about<00:01:27.259> first

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630
