available for operation uses we believe

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.700 
available for operation uses we believe
that<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> case<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.900> area<00:02:17.230> presents<00:02:17.650> an

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
that the case be area presents an

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.470 
that the case be area presents an
opportunity<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.310> balanced<00:02:18.940> development

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
opportunity for balanced development

noticed anything like that well I know
last<00:05:16.760> year<00:05:16.940> we<00:05:17.060> cleaned<00:05:17.300> up<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.420> same<00:05:17.720> spot

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
last year we cleaned up the same spot

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.020 
last year we cleaned up the same spot
just<00:05:18.350> different<00:05:18.650> areas<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.820> river

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
just different areas and the river

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.180 
just different areas and the river
actually<00:05:20.870> looked<00:05:21.050> a<00:05:21.110> lot<00:05:21.290> cleaner<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.920> in<00:05:22.040> one

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
actually looked a lot cleaner and in one

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.680 
actually looked a lot cleaner and in one
of<00:05:22.250> my<00:05:22.340> classes<00:05:22.700> we<00:05:22.790> actually<00:05:23.060> saw<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.300> harbor

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
of my classes we actually saw a harbor

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.160 
of my classes we actually saw a harbor
seal<00:05:23.720> swimming<00:05:24.320> in<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.470> river<00:05:24.590> last<00:05:25.010> week<00:05:25.250> so

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
seal swimming in the river last week so

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.480 
seal swimming in the river last week so
so<00:05:27.170> it<00:05:27.290> sounds<00:05:27.530> like<00:05:27.560> getting<00:05:28.130> down<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.400> the
