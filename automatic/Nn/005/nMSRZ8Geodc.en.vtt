00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.309
 for me the let's say the understanding of 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.230
 what it is the work of art develops 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.789
 or is understood more as a set of 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.379
 different sources of thought and 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.879
 It's always true that I have not had very 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.610
 clear where art ends and where 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.299
 other sources of thought begin 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.799
 with which good if there is that kind of 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:53.299
 let's say of polyvalent scope of what if 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.460
 you move from other supports to others 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.719
 disciplines is curious but what if I 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.239
 come are many proposals for 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.019
 American architects that if I 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.229
 they ask about the plans for how they are 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.970
 executed etc. not always treat me 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.130
 as an architecture studio rather than 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.780
 as an artist no sense of this is 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.780
 executed where is etcetera etcetera 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.730
 and well I finally island comes a little 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.050
 of a prior interest in architectures 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.120
 palafitic belongs to the state of 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.630
 alabama what they call the america 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.329
 depressed 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.430
 it is an island that throughout its 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.890
 history has been paid by some 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.680
 kind of strange circumstance to the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.799
 adversity not so exposed to any 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.740
 element as hurricane cyclones are 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.340
 etcetera and yet there is a kind 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.200
 of ghostly architecture that I the 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.100
 they truly truly did 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.119
 attractive and fundamentally the function 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.259
 that I wanted to create architectural mind was 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.289
 although all these houses are 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.299
 exposed to hurricane cyclones because they do not 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.149
 they make architecture in a certain way 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.970
 regulated in a certain way reasoned in 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.970
 around these circumstances create 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.450
 a bunkerized architecture with 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.290
 spaces or blogs or curved spaces that 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.769
 really let the wind go by and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.210
 that they kept a thread of rationality 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.650
 environment 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.670
 to all that kind of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.670
 of delirium 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.650
 in interactions however it is true 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.710
 that there is no let's say this pressure between 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.480
 social quotes and if there is more a 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.400
 divertimento or a search 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.160
 architectural around spaces 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.250
 construction which are wrapped in the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.710
 environment of nature and that work 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.500
 as ruins in the sense that they have 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.060
 a use and in this case a disuse that 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.540
 generate some estrangement in the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.540
 viewer 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.240
 if organs gr more than as the name 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.100
 indica is a game between flow charts and 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.640
 organs because practically the tubes 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.240
 of exhaust that go from wall to wall 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.040
 in tubes of an organ and it's the first 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.550
 time it comes to Spain that good 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.070
 speaks about the city of hanoi a 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.920
 city â€‹â€‹that already involving the with the video 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.370
 zinc in hanoi that practically go from 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.650
 hand 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.190
 good in the sense of how you can 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.680
 find rhythm in fatality and how 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.700
 there is harmony in the chaos and where here 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.030
 there would be grievance and there would probably be 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.250
 some kind of apprehension and aggression 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.200
 there is simply an influx of 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.870
 elements in which a 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.060
 kind of rhythm without greater accent 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.270
 say aggressive hence if 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.660
 true let's find that harmony of 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.660
 fatality
