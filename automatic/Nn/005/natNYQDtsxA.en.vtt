00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:12.280
 of how to download virtual dj version 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.740

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.020
 that some of us have this comes with all 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.509
 your complete applications in addition to the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.949
 program comes with the mixers 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.259
 professionals and not like the normal ones that 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.359
 has a normal dj virtual and that also 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.150
 it's a demo and it's not the real version 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.550
 good friends to start have to 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.950
 download the file oÃ­mbra that I leave 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.140
 in the description of the video there you 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.420
 they are looking for it to be downloaded 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.820
 I do not download it because I already have it 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.769
 then a file will be downloaded 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.320
 like this one they just have to 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.750
 unzip them will a folder like 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.660
 they open it and several files will come 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.030
 how do you first open this little program 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.579

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.530
 here you will get two buttons that one 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.660
 the installation of the program has been 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.089
 and the other button is the crack so that 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.760
 can open your program by clicking 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.590
 to install your virtual dj open box 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.070
 installation there they configure it to its 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.650
 way 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.080
 I do not install it anymore because I already have it 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.810
 installed good after it 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.150

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.880
 application icon afterwards right away 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.250
 apply the crack is not open the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.040
 virtual dj until they apply the crack 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.530
 once installing the virtual dj and the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.540
 crack they will be able to open it they will be able to see that 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.479
 the time to open the program comes with the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.369
 original hologram of the virtual says a 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.440
 Once you have opened, you will see that it is very 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.420
 different in all aspects from the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.910
 professional mixers 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.250

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.580
 all your applications have very good 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.100

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.500
