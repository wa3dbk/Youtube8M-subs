 If it's a little bit more busy here, it's gonna come here 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.270
 A little high 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:29.350

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 I hope by using a kite string 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.330
 Mighty 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.280

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.990

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.220
 No problem 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.650
 In this way to wrap around 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.489
 I will continue to roll in my favorite way 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.489

 Wrap it a little stronger 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.050
 Yes 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.700
 The force was Agemashi 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.800
 Chicken in the pot 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:42.320
 boots 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:47.180
 But you put your key pack that traditional Chinese medicine has entered a lot 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:52.790
 There is no problem if there is no Natsume without this 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.819
 This summer buds I think that is better to me easily and I it always put to come by 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.870
 It's silver this season, so even if you don't get it 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.290
 There is no problem and may put a package instead 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:11.280
 Pine nuts are also commonly used in Korea 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.160
 And I will put in the remaining garlic and also put the sliced ​​ginger rest 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.220
 One in yesterday 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:21.590
 I will put water at the end 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.820
 Please put in the pan until the chicken is covered 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.820
 I will put a fire 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.650
 Hey Meteo 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.650
 Oh and 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.110
 A little here 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.800
 I will leave 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.810
 15 books at high pressure 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:56.419
 think 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:05:01.270
 Yes, so the pressure was full, so a little sign 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:04.139
 We will weaken and 15 will also apply pressure with this 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.520
 Then because decompression was over 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.520
 8 open the lid 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.569
 Yes this 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:17.210
 is 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.210
 So first of all the tea pack 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:30.489
 Then I think that it is easy to eat those who here also were asked to pick up because there is a habit 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.489
 Part of rail grease floating above 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:41.280
 Do you want to make it 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:41.280
 I think I 'm taking the soup so I add water here once more 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:50.529
 Put a little that cattle 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:58.059
 It was boiling again and there was the last evil to become Masaki 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:06:03.590
 It's ready in the shop, and it's ready to serve, and it 's a good way to make a better skin for the moon and thighs 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:10.300
 It is the end of the umps theory Sanguretan 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.300
