00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and a lot of the time I can't find my

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049

shade<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> darkest<00:00:56.820> shade

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
shade or I have to use the darkest shade

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.319 
shade or I have to use the darkest shade
that<00:00:57.539> any<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.620> given<00:00:58.829> brand<00:00:59.129> makes<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.000> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that any one given brand makes but this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
that any one given brand makes but this
one<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.559> second<00:01:01.859> darkest<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
one is I think the second darkest or the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.509 
one is I think the second darkest or the
third<00:01:02.609> darkest<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.379> whole<00:01:05.010> bunch

completely different when it comes to
coverage<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.920> would<00:02:33.220> say<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.730> medium

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
coverage it is I would say a medium

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.140 
coverage it is I would say a medium
coverage<00:02:35.260> light<00:02:35.770> medium<00:02:36.190> coverage<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:37.090> a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
coverage light medium coverage I'm a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.220 
coverage light medium coverage I'm a
little<00:02:37.450> bit<00:02:37.540> biased<00:02:37.660> when<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.020> comes<00:02:38.140> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
little bit biased when it comes to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.450 
little bit biased when it comes to
coverage<00:02:38.500> because<00:02:38.710> usually<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:39.400> a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
coverage because usually I like a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.640 
coverage because usually I like a
foundation<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.240> is<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> very<00:02:40.960> very<00:02:41.230> sheer

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
foundation that is a very very sheer

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.170 
foundation that is a very very sheer
coverage<00:02:42.130> but<00:02:42.490> this<00:02:42.640> one<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:42.910> one<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> my

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
coverage but this one is one of my

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
coverage but this one is one of my
heavier<00:02:43.540> coverage<00:02:43.930> foundations<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.430> like

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
heavier coverage foundations and I like

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.460 
heavier coverage foundations and I like
it<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.880> lot<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.360> really<00:02:46.630> built<00:02:46.930> able<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.380> it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it a lot it's really built able and it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.470 
it a lot it's really built able and it
works<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:47.830> well<00:02:48.180> another<00:02:49.180> thing<00:02:49.390> that's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
works really well another thing that's

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.060 
works really well another thing that's
nice<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.170> oil<00:02:50.410> free

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070

makeup off at night and I'll look a
little<00:03:09.850> bit<00:03:10.000> dewy<00:03:10.300> but<00:03:10.930> nothing<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.530> I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
little bit dewy but nothing that I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.550 
little bit dewy but nothing that I
dislike<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.820> will<00:03:13.120> insert<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.660> demo<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.320> me

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560

applying<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.220> foundation<00:03:15.370> now

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.460 

so<00:04:09.849> hopefully<00:04:10.060> that<00:04:10.510> gave<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.870> an<00:04:10.959> idea<00:04:11.230> of

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
so hopefully that gave you an idea of

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.259 
so hopefully that gave you an idea of
how<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.650> foundation<00:04:12.159> goes<00:04:12.310> on<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:13.000> kind<00:04:13.180> of

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
how the foundation goes on the kind of

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.820 
how the foundation goes on the kind of
coverage<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:13.930> get<00:04:14.080> from<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.680> the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
coverage that you get from it and the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.020 
coverage that you get from it and the
finish<00:04:15.129> afterwards

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
finish afterwards

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.580 
finish afterwards
so<00:04:16.329> if<00:04:16.389> you're<00:04:16.540> looking<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.959> try<00:04:17.139> something

was hoping that maybe it would work as
an<00:04:59.440> under-eye<00:04:59.710> concealer<00:05:00.340> or<00:05:00.550> like<00:05:01.000> a

time I tried to wear it under the eyes I

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.490 
time I tried to wear it under the eyes I
had<00:05:33.910> to<00:05:34.000> go<00:05:34.120> back<00:05:34.270> in<00:05:34.510> with<00:05:34.630> my<00:05:34.840> NARS<00:05:35.050> creamy

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.820 
had to go back in with my NARS creamy
concealer<00:05:35.680> anyway<00:05:36.639> so<00:05:37.330> if<00:05:37.810> you<00:05:38.050> have<00:05:38.260> really

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
concealer anyway so if you have really

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.680 
concealer anyway so if you have really
really<00:05:38.860> really<00:05:39.340> light<00:05:40.000> under-eye<00:05:40.389> circles

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
really really light under-eye circles

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.140 
really really light under-eye circles
and<00:05:41.199> you<00:05:41.560> can<00:05:41.710> find<00:05:41.949> a<00:05:42.070> match<00:05:42.280> for<00:05:42.550> yourself<00:05:42.910> in

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
and you can find a match for yourself in

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.260 
and you can find a match for yourself in
the<00:05:43.810> range<00:05:44.080> maybe<00:05:44.800> give<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.400> try

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
the range maybe give it a try

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.510 
the range maybe give it a try
because<00:05:46.840> other<00:05:47.169> than<00:05:47.320> that<00:05:47.650> it's<00:05:47.919> not<00:05:48.160> useful

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
because other than that it's not useful

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.850 
because other than that it's not useful
for<00:05:49.000> much<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.330> anything<00:05:49.840> it's<00:05:50.110> not<00:05:50.320> pigmented

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
for much of anything it's not pigmented

for much of anything it's not pigmented
