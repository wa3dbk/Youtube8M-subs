00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
kind of dip when you're holding it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.940 
kind of dip when you're holding it
perhaps<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.409> use<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.740> as

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
perhaps you want to just use this as

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
perhaps you want to just use this as

your your shoulder mount is kind of just

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
your your shoulder mount is kind of just
you<00:01:31.829> know<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.400> holding<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.060> for

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you know you're holding it here just for

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.569

they'll<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.269> down<00:02:26.510> convert<00:02:26.840> them<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.019> 30

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
they'll just down convert them to 30

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.660 
they'll just down convert them to 30
frames<00:02:27.620> per<00:02:27.709> second<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:28.160> you're<00:02:28.250> still<00:02:28.489> going

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
frames per second so you're still going

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.190 
frames per second so you're still going
to<00:02:28.700> get<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.849> same<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.750> also<00:02:29.870> gives<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
to get the same it also gives you the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.190 
to get the same it also gives you the
option<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.769> standard<00:02:31.579> definition<00:02:31.670> or<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.930> crop

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
option of standard definition or a crop

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.509 
option of standard definition or a crop
feature<00:02:33.470> which<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:33.829> really<00:02:34.010> nice<00:02:34.190> which<00:02:34.400> I

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
feature which is really nice which I

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.370 
feature which is really nice which I
think<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:34.819> seven<00:02:35.030> times<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:36.079> zoom

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
think it's seven times the zoom

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.720 
think it's seven times the zoom
capability<00:02:36.920> without<00:02:37.160> distorting<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.700> image

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
capability without distorting the image

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.059 
capability without distorting the image
size<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.480> there's<00:02:38.930> lots<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.260> capability<00:02:39.769> here

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
size so there's lots of capability here

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.530 
size so there's lots of capability here
that<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.579> would<00:02:40.670> like<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.910> see<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.329> very

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that you would like to see in a very

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
that you would like to see in a very
high-end<00:02:41.780> professional<00:02:42.530> camera<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:47.560> am

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
high-end professional camera I am

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.729 
high-end professional camera I am
currently<00:02:48.799> using<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:50.709> LX<00:02:51.709> series<00:02:52.190> 16<00:02:53.180> gigabyte

currently using a LX series 16 gigabyte
class<00:02:54.739> 10<00:02:55.310> now<00:02:55.549> make<00:02:55.760> sure<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.000> when<00:02:56.180> you're

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
class 10 now make sure that when you're

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.569 
class 10 now make sure that when you're
when<00:02:56.959> you're<00:02:56.989> picking<00:02:57.709> out<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.980> card<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.340> it's

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
when you're picking out a card that it's

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.000 
when you're picking out a card that it's
a<00:02:58.670> minimum<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.389> class<00:02:59.630> 10<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:00.260> think<00:03:00.290> this

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
a minimum of class 10 I think this

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.890 
a minimum of class 10 I think this
camera<00:03:01.250> says<00:03:01.639> that<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.940> will<00:03:02.060> work<00:03:02.269> with<00:03:02.600> a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
camera says that it will work with a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.020 
camera says that it will work with a
minimum<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.500> class<00:03:03.859> six<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:04.519> even<00:03:04.790> with<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
minimum of class six but even with the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.050 
minimum of class six but even with the
class<00:03:05.239> 10<00:03:05.889> it<00:03:06.889> will<00:03:07.130> stop<00:03:07.519> recording

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
class 10 it will stop recording

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.819 
class 10 it will stop recording
sometimes<00:03:08.359> Midway<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.290> you'll<00:03:09.380> have<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.650> wait

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
sometimes Midway and you'll have to wait

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.210 
sometimes Midway and you'll have to wait
for<00:03:10.069> it<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.700> restart<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.859> you<00:03:12.950> can<00:03:13.069> start

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
for it to restart and then you can start

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.920 
for it to restart and then you can start
recording<00:03:13.340> again<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.389> seems<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:14.840> if

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
recording again but it seems to be if

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.180 
recording again but it seems to be if
you're<00:03:15.079> taking<00:03:15.500> especially<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:16.069> you're

you're taking especially if you're

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.160 
you're taking especially if you're
taking<00:03:16.459> still<00:03:16.880> photos<00:03:16.910> while<00:03:17.630> you're<00:03:17.870> doing<00:03:18.109> a

taking still photos while you're doing a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.610 
taking still photos while you're doing a
video<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:19.760> will<00:03:19.940> cause<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.540> video<00:03:21.079> recording

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
video it will cause the video recording

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.520 
video it will cause the video recording
to<00:03:21.709> stop<00:03:21.950> or<00:03:22.250> if<00:03:22.910> you're<00:03:23.090> moving<00:03:23.450> your<00:03:24.170> camera

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
to stop or if you're moving your camera

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.289

quickly<00:03:24.739> during<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.280> shot<00:03:25.519> it<00:03:25.760> will<00:03:25.880> do<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.180> as

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
quickly during a shot it will do that as
