constructors does that make it real or
not<00:00:46.140> real<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:47.280> stuff

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
not real then you have to other stuff

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.920 
not real then you have to other stuff
while<00:00:47.760> these<00:00:47.910> questions<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.450> should<00:00:48.480> even<00:00:48.750> be

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
while these questions we should even be

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.360 
while these questions we should even be
concern<00:00:49.289> yourself<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
concern yourself with and then you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.500 
concern yourself with and then you
gained<00:00:50.579> all<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:50.910> years<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> debate<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
gained all these years of debate and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.060 
gained all these years of debate and
even<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.199> people<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.590> cysts<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.860> it's

completely an illusion all I know is
that<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:45.390> some<00:01:45.570> point<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.960> my<00:01:45.990> brain<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> had

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that at some point in my brain that had

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
that at some point in my brain that had
negated<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> possibility<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> any<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
negated the possibility that any of it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
negated the possibility that any of it
was<00:01:48.479> real<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:49.110> me<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.380> walked<00:01:49.590> into<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> TARDIS

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
broken bits of it and of course it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.889 
broken bits of it and of course it
doesn't<00:01:56.579> make<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> TARDIS<00:01:57.270> console<00:01:57.630> sound

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
doesn't make the TARDIS console sound

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
doesn't make the TARDIS console sound
but<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.469> are<00:01:58.560> still<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.950> many<00:01:58.979> physical

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
but there are still so many physical

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:15.460 
but there are still so many physical
sounds<00:02:00.270> around<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> TARDIS

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.260 
most about it the world establishment
the<00:04:22.009> story<00:04:22.250> itself<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.669> didn't<00:04:22.880> find<00:04:23.090> that

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the story itself I didn't find that

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.120 
the story itself I didn't find that
convincing<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.320> didn't<00:04:24.530> really<00:04:24.740> need<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.979> be

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
convincing it didn't really need to be

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.249 
convincing it didn't really need to be
400<00:04:25.699> pages<00:04:25.850> long<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.509> also<00:04:26.660> was<00:04:26.900> very<00:04:27.110> obvious

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
400 pages long it also was very obvious

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.629 
400 pages long it also was very obvious
to<00:04:27.560> me<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:27.710> they<00:04:27.860> were<00:04:27.919> setting<00:04:28.190> up<00:04:28.400> for

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
to me that they were setting up for

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.950 
to me that they were setting up for
trilogy<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.330> think<00:04:29.539> it<00:04:29.630> could<00:04:29.750> have<00:04:29.840> been

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
trilogy and I think it could have been

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.749 
trilogy and I think it could have been
more<00:04:30.169> complex<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.740> sort<00:04:30.979> of<00:04:31.039> just<00:04:31.099> kept<00:04:31.400> wanting

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
more complex I sort of just kept wanting

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.310 
more complex I sort of just kept wanting
a<00:04:31.820> bit<00:04:31.970> more<00:04:32.180> out<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.449> it<00:04:32.720> my<00:04:32.870> Stannis<00:04:33.289> for

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
a bit more out of it my Stannis for

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.990 
a bit more out of it my Stannis for
dystopia<00:04:33.830> pretty<00:04:34.039> high<00:04:34.250> mainly<00:04:34.759> because<00:04:34.880> I

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
dystopia pretty high mainly because I

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.520 
dystopia pretty high mainly because I
read<00:04:35.300> some<00:04:35.509> really<00:04:35.780> good<00:04:35.930> dystopian<00:04:36.410> when<00:04:36.500> I

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530

very unnatural and unnecessary and it

and<00:05:21.289> unconvincing<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:22.009> again<00:05:22.280> took<00:05:22.550> you<00:05:22.699> out

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
and unconvincing it again took you out

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.730 
and unconvincing it again took you out
the<00:05:23.090> familiarity<00:05:23.449> of<00:05:23.780> it<00:05:23.960> wasn't<00:05:24.349> there

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
the familiarity of it wasn't there

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.140 
the familiarity of it wasn't there
something<00:05:24.889> like<00:05:25.070> about<00:05:25.220> noumic<00:05:25.580> catalyst<00:05:26.000> you

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
something like about noumic catalyst you

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.520 
something like about noumic catalyst you
get<00:05:26.270> used<00:05:26.449> to<00:05:26.539> quite<00:05:26.750> quickly<00:05:26.960> but<00:05:27.259> the<00:05:27.380> names

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
get used to quite quickly but the names

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.649 
get used to quite quickly but the names
and<00:05:27.650> heroes<00:05:27.949> but<00:05:28.099> like<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.520> really<00:05:29.000> pressure

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
and heroes but like a really pressure

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
here on the other hand I felt like there

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.100 
here on the other hand I felt like there
are<00:05:31.520> parts<00:05:31.849> in<00:05:32.030> which<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.389> writer<00:05:32.570> tried<00:05:32.930> too

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
are parts in which the writer tried too

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.749 
are parts in which the writer tried too
hard<00:05:33.139> to<00:05:33.470> create<00:05:33.590> this<00:05:33.830> fantastical<00:05:34.490> world

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
hard to create this fantastical world
