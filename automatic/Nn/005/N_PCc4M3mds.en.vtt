00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:14.360
 a new and fitness presents 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.440
 fitness and health sessions 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.890
 ah 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 ah 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.220
 to know the breaks between series and 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.930
 series are almost always measured in time 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.989
 almost all people measure it in time 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.579
 in seconds in minutes maybe the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.379
 truth is that technically it should be 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.390
 measured in heart rate the rhythm 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.190
 would be measured with a monitor and a 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.769
 telemetric band we do not all have 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.260
 access to this so that almost always 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.489
 is measured in time I want to say if you 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.129
 you want to do an aerobic workout 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.720
 it would be worth being under 15 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.670
 seconds if you want to make a 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.590
 muscle training with a 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.869
 little muscle tone a little bit 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.970
 fitness we would talk about 30 seconds 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.680
 approximately but 7 workouts of 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.020
 strength and you only care about the muscles 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.780
 muscle size and strength you could wait 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.460
 between series series up to 2 minutes is the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.460
 better way to calculate it 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.790
 there is a fitness present
