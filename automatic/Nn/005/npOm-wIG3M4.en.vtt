00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:28.468

00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:31.204

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:33.310

Elaichi (cardamom) - 10

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:45.296
We need to grind all of these whole spices before we start preparing Achar.

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:50.817
Now that we have our ground spices ready let us cut the lemons.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:02:05.844
Make 2 cuts on the lemon in a way that it remains attached at the base.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.830
Similarly cut all the lemons.

00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:22.351
These lemons have been soaked in water the entire night for 7-8 hrs.

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:31.552
Take out the lemons from water and wipe them with
a clean cotton cloth, let us prepare the Achar.

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:34.739
Soaking the lemons earlier makes them soft.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.729
We have cut all the lemons so let us fill them with the spices.

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:44.186
Firstly mix all the spices

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:52.988
Firstly mix all the spices, put powdered spices (black pepper, clove, jaiphal, javitri, methi seeds, jeera)

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:14.964
black salt, plain salt, Saindha salt, ginger powder, pepper powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder and Heeng powder in a bowl.

00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:19.444
Mix all the spice till they blend well.

00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.923
Now we will stuff the spices in the lemons.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:36.802
Put spices in the lemons pressing with a spoon.

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:45.081
These spices stuffed lemons can also be tied around with a thread.

00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:48.555
Stuff the lemons and keep them aside.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.056
Now that all the lemons are stuffed let us squeeze juice out of the other lemons.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:14.860
Cut lemons into half and squeeze their juice with a machine.

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.643
Fill the stuffed lemons in a container

00:04:27.504 --> 00:04:29.853
place them with the cut portion facing upwards.

00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:37.600
Put the left over spices over these lemons.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.578
Now pour the lemon juice in the container.

00:04:50.274 --> 00:04:57.437
Nimbu Achar is almost ready but it takes 20-25 days for them to get fully prepared.

00:04:57.807 --> 00:05:04.778
If we tie a cotton cloth on the mouth of this container and place it in the sun

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:09.552
Achar will be ready in 17-18 days.

00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:16.012
Else you can also keep Achar in the house

00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:26.540
Lemons when submerged completely in the juice turn soft faster.

00:05:26.947 --> 00:05:32.232
So add some more juice and we will see lemons will turn soft and decrease in size within 2-3 days.

00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:38.501
If this does not occur then take out some juice and pour some more juice in the container.

00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:41.222
Nimbu Achar is ready.

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:47.199
Nimbu ka Achar is normally made during the months of December and January as

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.560
spotless lemons with thin skins are easily available in the market during this time.

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.458
You need to be a bit cautious while preparing Nimbu ka Achar.

00:05:58.423 --> 00:06:04.192
Such as, there should be any moisture present while making Achar.

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:08.810
Cleanliness is a must; don't put any wet spoon in Achar.

00:06:08.934 --> 00:06:11.514
Any bowl that we use should not be wet.

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.413
We need to keep these things in mind while preparing Achar.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:17.377
Achar is to be filled in a container

00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:27.624
whether glass or plastic the container should be initially washed with boiling water and dried in the sun.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.668
There should not be any moisture left in the container.

00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:32.465
Only then we can fill Achar in it.

00:06:33.308 --> 00:06:41.547
After Achar is prepared and you take some of it to eat, always use a clean and dry spoon.

00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:43.714
Achar lasts for a long time

00:06:44.392 --> 00:06:53.381
if we keep it out in the sun at times then it's shelf life increases.

00:06:54.195 --> 00:07:03.854
If Nimbu ka Achar seems dry at any pint then we can add lemon juice to it which makes lemons soft and Achar tasty.

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:14.756
Stuffed Nimbu ka Achar lasts for 1-2 years but you need to store it with care.

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:19.495
As Achar gets old it gets tastier.

00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:28.815
. Nimbu ka Achar is very beneficial; it can be had when we face indigestion or gastric problems.

00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:35.776
