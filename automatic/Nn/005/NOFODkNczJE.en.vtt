00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:06.824
Another night has come,

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:09.929
we'll be playing again at 9 pm!

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.281
- Hey, Montillo!
- Hello!

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.365
- You're back!
- Yes, that's right.

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:25.141
- Pirata!
- How are you?

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.898
We're gonna make it, Pirata,
we're gonna make it!

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:47.334
We must win!

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:48.617
Absolutely!

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.651
He was massaging his back,
then he slapped his butt!

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.663
- You gotta be kidding!
- And he was smiling!

00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:06.601
- I'm telling you!
- Are you serious?

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:07.986
Come on!

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.343
It cannot be true!

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:12.381
It cannot be true,
it cannot!

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:15.313
Professor,
professor!

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:16.825
I cannot believe!

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:19.829
- Hey!
- Come on, man!

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:21.730
Are you switching sides?

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:24.068
- It can't be true!
- Come on, man!

00:01:57.043 --> 00:01:58.074
What's up, Pirata?

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:09.065
Come on, Pirata...

00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:12.030
You've got to be kidding!

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:18.991
Today is Children's Day,
are you going to score for Enzo?

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:21.914
I don't like to make
any promises,

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:23.424
I just let things happen,

00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:25.787
but if I manage to score
a goal for my son,

00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:27.534
I'll be thankful!

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.885
Today is Children's Day
and Our Lady of Aparecida's Day.

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:34.872
If God helps,
you'll celebrate scoring a goal.

00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.219
Would you dedicate it
to our little friend?

00:02:39.345 --> 00:02:41.845
Of course,
and there's another one now.

00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:44.196
- Really?
- My wife is pregnant.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.485
Congratulations!

00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:48.266
My responsibility
is even bigger now.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.652
That's true,
you have to score twice!

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:52.893
I'll score and hide the ball
under my jersey again.

00:02:52.894 --> 00:02:55.351
- Of course!
- I'll revive that celebration.

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:57.402
God willing!
Congratulations!

00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:58.434
Thank you.

00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:01.492
May they be healthy
and bring a lot of joy to your family.

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:03.651
- Another Santos fan is coming.
- God willing!

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.559
Let's put what we agreed
into practice,

00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:07.635
let's give everything
we've got while playing.

00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:09.498
As I always say,

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.542
let's make it happen,
not let it happen.

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:14.959
We have to chase the ball
from the very first minute of play,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.520
we have to win
every ball disputed.

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:18.693
Today is the day,

00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:21.177
today we'll start over
in this competition,

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:23.006
we have to win today...

00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:24.950
in order to and rise up our moral
in the competition.

00:03:25.456 --> 00:03:27.246
Let's go, guys?
Let's win!

00:04:18.184 --> 00:04:19.582
We managed to win once again,

00:04:20.217 --> 00:04:22.208
let's keep it up,
we played with our guts,

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:23.572
there's more coming
on Wednesday.

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:25.977
We won once again,

00:04:26.737 --> 00:04:28.944
we have to thank our fans,

00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:31.234
and congratulate everyone
on the victory.

00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:33.709
We played very well,

00:04:34.227 --> 00:04:37.039
and now we have
to keep it that way...

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.071
in order to go up
on the scoreboard.

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:42.931
You must slap his butt
more often, it worked!

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:44.700
It worked out.

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:46.598
You've got to be kidding me!

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.289
You've got to be kidding me!

00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:50.634
It was a tough match, but...

00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.539
that's how
the Brazilian Championship works,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.489
we knew it would be tough,

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.551
now let's keep moving forward.

00:04:58.403 --> 00:05:02.238
It was an extremely important
victory for us in the competition,

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:05.088
thanks to God we won,

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:06.986
now let's keep on winning!

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:10.935
Let's take the motivation
you showed tonight...

00:05:11.297 --> 00:05:13.981
and apply it in order
to score points against Internacional,

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:18.223
restore our happiness
and our confidence.

00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:19.984
We score two goals
which can only...

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:21.956
be scored by people
who know how to play,

00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:23.351
beautiful goals.

00:05:23.493 --> 00:05:24.979
We're qualified.

00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:28.262
We have an amazing goalkeeper...

00:05:28.263 --> 00:05:30.723
who will save
as many balls as we need,

00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:34.605
but let's do our best
in order to avoid that.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.690
- Is that right, Edu?
- Yes.

00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:37.753
Let's cheer up,
let's be happy!

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.329
We won this damn match!

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.645
We won,
we scored three points!

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.030
It was an important victory,

00:05:44.405 --> 00:05:46.202
we really needed
these three points,

00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:49.672
now let's keep up
with the good work,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.259
we have to focus
and keep on winning.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.902
Santos FC is a huge team,

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.106
extremely huge,

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.286
which has to always win.

00:05:59.015 --> 00:06:01.614
I'd like to send a huge kiss
to my sons,

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:02.708
Felipe and Rafael,

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:04.542
we were apart
during the entire day,

00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:05.822
but we'll celebrate tomorrow.

00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:08.598
Congratulations to our team
for their disposition,

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.059
for their commitment,

00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:12.390
we suffered some unneeded pressure
during the end of the match,

00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:13.821
but we had one man down,

00:06:13.822 --> 00:06:16.398
we had to improvise,
we didn't have any substitution left,

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:18.804
but at this point
we must focus on scoring points.

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:19.841
The competition is balanced,

00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:23.724
so the most important thing
was to score three point and go up.

00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:27.395
Congratulations to everyone
for this important victory,

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.817
we may now breath a little bit,

00:06:31.512 --> 00:06:34.524
but what really matters
is tonight's victory.

00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:36.989
Congratulations to our team,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.904
and these three points
will help us through the season.

00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:42.190
I'd like to send a hug to my son,

00:06:42.672 --> 00:06:43.854
today is Children's Day,

00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:46.076
tomorrow I'll wake him up
to give him a hug.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.426
Today is Children's Day
here in Brazil,

00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:49.346
Yes.

00:06:49.347 --> 00:06:52.154
You scored an amazing goal,
who was it for?

00:06:52.396 --> 00:06:54.374
For my sons, of course.

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:55.512
They are at home,

00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:58.178
we had to stay at the Training Center
to get prepared for the match,

00:06:58.397 --> 00:06:59.447
we couldn't be at home,

00:06:59.474 --> 00:07:03.280
so, it's not only for my sons,
but for everybody else's.

00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:05.570
Congratulations.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.315
The best thing is that
we managed to win,

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:10.307
when you score and help
the team winning you get even happier.

00:07:10.308 --> 00:07:12.614
Let's keep on working,

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:15.679
let's hope we manage to win
on Wednesday once again.
