your sweatshirt blouse a t-shirt thread

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.749 
your sweatshirt blouse a t-shirt thread
and<00:01:08.600> needle<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.500> you're<00:01:10.009> going<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.460> create

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
and needle and you're going to create

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.289 
and needle and you're going to create
the<00:01:11.210> bow<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.170> then<00:01:12.530> sew<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.130> onto<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.610> mouse

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
the bow and then sew it onto the mouse

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.680 
the bow and then sew it onto the mouse
you<00:01:14.750> could<00:01:15.320> also<00:01:15.560> create<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.610> bow<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
you could also create the bow and so the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.719 
you could also create the bow and so the
ball<00:01:17.899> together<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.560> then<00:01:18.860> sew<00:01:19.190> it<00:01:19.220> onto<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
ball together and then sew it onto the

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.520 
ball together and then sew it onto the
blouse<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.600> think<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.080> is<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.289> much

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
blouse but I think that this is a much

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.050 
blouse but I think that this is a much
easier<00:01:21.860> way<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.520> less<00:01:22.729> time-consuming

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
easier way and less time-consuming

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.660 
easier way and less time-consuming
because<00:01:23.810> we're<00:01:24.649> just<00:01:24.680> going<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.009> sew<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.520> bow

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
because we're just going to sew the bow

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.700 
because we're just going to sew the bow
on<00:01:25.880> straight<00:01:26.330> onto<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:27.170> sweater<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.649> you

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.440 

pretty<00:01:51.619> much<00:01:51.920> spaced<00:01:52.460> all<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.970> balls<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.420> my
