00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and for carbs I got an apple going on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.240 
and for carbs I got an apple going on
which<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.349> usually<00:02:15.650> what<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.800> like<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.099> have

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
which is usually what I like to have

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.880 
which is usually what I like to have
pre-workout<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.480> kind<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.230> guess

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
pre-workout just kind of a I guess

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.699 
pre-workout just kind of a I guess
ritual<00:02:19.610> thing<00:02:19.849> but<00:02:20.090> there's<00:02:20.300> no<00:02:20.680> rhyme<00:02:21.680> or

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
ritual thing but there's no rhyme or

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.710 
ritual thing but there's no rhyme or
reason<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.370> as<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.209> guys<00:02:23.390> know<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.599> don't

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
reason to it as you guys know I don't

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.820 
reason to it as you guys know I don't
really<00:02:24.170> tend<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.040> believe<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:26.260> meal<00:02:27.260> timing

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
really tend to believe a meal timing

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.630 
really tend to believe a meal timing
just<00:02:28.459> due<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.920> experiments<00:02:31.519> I've

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
just due to like the experiments I've

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.930 
just due to like the experiments I've
done<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.620> at<00:02:33.620> one<00:02:33.890> point<00:02:33.920> like<00:02:34.430> completely

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
done and at one point like completely

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.150 
done and at one point like completely
trying<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.360> time<00:02:35.569> everything<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.380> then

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
trying to time everything and then

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.800 
trying to time everything and then
changing<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.610> up<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.970> not<00:02:38.150> really<00:02:38.330> timing

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
changing it up and not really timing

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.589 
changing it up and not really timing
anything<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.470> basically<00:02:40.180> nothing<00:02:41.180> changed

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
anything and basically nothing changed

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.410 
anything and basically nothing changed
when<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.620> did<00:02:42.890> both<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.400> I'm<00:02:43.970> sure<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.239> guys

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
when I did both so I'm sure you guys

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.820 
when I did both so I'm sure you guys
have<00:02:44.450> been<00:02:44.630> able<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.870> tell<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.140> already<00:02:45.590> by

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
have been able to tell that already by

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.370 
have been able to tell that already by
me<00:02:46.160> having<00:02:46.370> fats<00:02:46.790> pretty<00:02:47.600> imposed<00:02:47.930> workout

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
me having fats pretty imposed workout

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.009 
me having fats pretty imposed workout
I'm<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.549> not<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.000> believer<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:50.720> it's

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
I'm just not a believer in that it's

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.880 
I'm just not a believer in that it's
gonna<00:02:51.170> make<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:52.220> big<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.670> difference<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
gonna make that big of a difference and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.949 
gonna make that big of a difference and
the<00:02:54.890> fact<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.390> know<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.510> pretty<00:02:56.840> much

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.600 
the fact is that you know I pretty much
just<00:02:57.080> go<00:02:57.349> for<00:02:57.530> my<00:02:57.650> macros<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.160> shoot<00:02:58.370> for<00:02:58.489> my

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
just go for my macros I shoot for my

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
macros each and every day however I end

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.820 
macros each and every day however I end
up<00:03:01.099> getting<00:03:01.220> those<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:03.260> know<00:03:03.380> it's<00:03:03.620> fine

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
up getting those in you know it's fine

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.039 
up getting those in you know it's fine
with<00:03:04.010> me<00:03:04.040> just<00:03:04.459> as<00:03:04.519> long<00:03:04.640> as<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:04.849> hit<00:03:05.060> them<00:03:05.269> but<00:03:06.019> I

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
with me just as long as I hit them but I

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.410 
with me just as long as I hit them but I
have<00:03:06.410> noticed<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:07.060> since<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.180> have<00:03:08.390> a

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
have noticed that since I have a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.160 
have noticed that since I have a
tendency<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:09.110> want<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.739> overeat<00:03:10.519> when<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.989> get

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
tendency to want to overeat when I get

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.370 
tendency to want to overeat when I get
really<00:03:12.349> hungry<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.920> do<00:03:13.310> try<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.120> have<00:03:14.840> more

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
really hungry I do try to have more

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.620 
really hungry I do try to have more
consistent<00:03:15.590> smaller<00:03:16.280> meals<00:03:16.579> but<00:03:17.239> that's<00:03:17.390> just

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
consistent smaller meals but that's just

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.380 
consistent smaller meals but that's just
for<00:03:18.079> basically<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.070> hunger<00:03:19.430> pangs<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:19.970> yes<00:03:20.209> I

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
for basically the hunger pangs and yes I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.750 
for basically the hunger pangs and yes I
still<00:03:20.570> get<00:03:20.750> those<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.109> book<00:03:21.730> unbelievable<00:03:22.730> I

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
know but still so that's the reason for

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.569 
know but still so that's the reason for
that<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.720> there<00:03:26.930> isn't<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.950> not<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.220> must

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
that but there isn't that is not a must
