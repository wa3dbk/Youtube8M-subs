00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.220
 we started frustration a little bit of 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 frustration to laugh or to vary in 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 2013 so it's going to be the first video 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.420
 of 2013 I hope you enjoy it and are 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.429
 three ways that we can be charged to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 less in my opinion that they can load me 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.599
 the balls when they kill us like that in call 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
 of duty at least in this call of duty 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.079
 black ops 2 so let's start with 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.760
 the number 3 and I say Mr. director 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.890
 and you can very well see how some 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.420
 assistance charge quickly while 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 under the streets the stairs in not so 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.810

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 some who for Egypt what the 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.470
 enemies something happening fast and yet 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.540
 that's how they kill me and I say very well that 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.930
 that having an explanation I see the camera 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.900
 of death I say watts and what happened here 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.820
 like shit pussies excuse the word 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.980
 but what fruit did they feed this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.049
 son is his mother to kill like that and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.299
 we go back to the girl or can not see how 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.799
 I put it slow the son in his pot I 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.750
 I think he had not even seen me 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.600
 while I was studying with a load 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.240
 electric killing through the wall 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.240
 fuck better let's go to number 2 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.170
 and well in number two we started 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.970
 again hindustÃ¡n exactly in the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 same place where number one started 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.660
 but let's see 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.580
 we kill we still do not get the agr I see 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.650
 one on the right tried to kill me 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.800
 kill and diego let's see the jogging and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:40.410
 the singing can see how I do it I say 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.020
 so what the fuck fuck we are going to see 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.600
 again the field and can see how 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.150
 fuck will only be the turn to shoot 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.270
 without even aiming and I do not even 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.550
 I see in the kill cam but what the hell and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 I do not know if what angers me the most is that 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.780
 kill or that after killing me out 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.180
 running as quietly as it is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.180
 as normal as they always kill like this 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.070
 but what the fuck after that, they give me 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.200
 want to go to the bathroom shit green but 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.420
 shit greens of the fury that I have 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.819
 and I do not know if joel shit green and I have 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.019
 another question face very well but it's worth 20 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.019
 let's go to number 1 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.920
 very well we got to number 1 and this time 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.409
 I crap my turn to laugh 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.849
 that this has happened or did the 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.069
 people who have happened this 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.110
 why why is throwing a tomahawk 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.549
 although I throw as I want to call 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.280
 good that they are two different things 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.049
 but that it falls to a user and as 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.150
 I just did here right now and very 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.500
 well to me the truth the truth never 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.420
 has happened this is to say never has 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.340
 dropped to my whim with a knife 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.200
 I throw across the map but I think 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.870
 It would be quite frustrating 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.940
 or maybe be proud of what happens to you 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.440
 but I do not know the truth but in the end 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.060
