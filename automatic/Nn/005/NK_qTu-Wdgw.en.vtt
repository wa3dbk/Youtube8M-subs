- aya is building his own fully
functional<00:00:02.190> computer<00:00:02.639> which<00:00:02.850> isn't<00:00:03.570> terribly

functional computer which isn't terribly
out<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.259> ordinary<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:05.250> fact<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:05.549> he's

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
out of the ordinary the fact that he's

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.909 
out of the ordinary the fact that he's
building<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.180> out<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.480> Legos<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.259> not

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
building it out of Legos is not

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.080 
building it out of Legos is not
something<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.370> hear<00:00:08.519> every<00:00:08.580> day

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090

PC<00:00:09.750> Magazine<00:00:09.929> approached<00:00:10.469> me<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.800> great

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
PC Magazine approached me with a great

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.990 
PC Magazine approached me with a great
idea<00:00:11.429> why<00:00:11.940> don't<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.179> build<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.719> Lego<00:00:13.650> PC<00:00:14.370> for

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
idea why don't you build a Lego PC for

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.820 
idea why don't you build a Lego PC for
their<00:00:15.240> how<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> build<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> computer<00:00:16.320> issue<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
their how to build a computer issue and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.590 
their how to build a computer issue and
so<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.250> took<00:00:17.430> up<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> challenge<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.420> is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so I took up the challenge this is

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.720 
so I took up the challenge this is
entire<00:00:19.050> PC<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.770> built<00:00:19.980> all<00:00:20.160> out<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.550> Lego

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
entire PC but it's built all out of Lego

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.370 
entire PC but it's built all out of Lego
so<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> doesn't<00:00:21.390> function<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.199> a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so it doesn't function it's just a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.950 
so it doesn't function it's just a
replica<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.430> PC<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.269> they<00:00:24.420> come<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.930> me

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
replica of a PC so they come back to me

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.990 
replica of a PC so they come back to me
they<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.439> I've<00:00:25.560> done<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.980> PC<00:00:26.519> Magazine

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
they see what I've done and PC Magazine

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
they see what I've done and PC Magazine
decides<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.930> know<00:00:27.960> why<00:00:28.410> don't<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.590> build<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
decides you know why don't we build a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.970 
decides you know why don't we build a
working<00:00:29.400> PC<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.269> use<00:00:30.779> Lego<00:00:31.109> bricks<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.740> part

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
working PC and use Lego bricks as part

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
working PC and use Lego bricks as part
of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> building<00:00:32.850> parts<00:00:33.180> PC<00:00:33.450> Magazine<00:00:33.899> has

those<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.200> Lego<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.590> give<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> real<00:00:41.129> Lego

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
those with Lego to give it a real Lego

feel and look to it the PC made of three
thousand<00:00:44.460> bricks<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:45.210> take<00:00:45.420> around

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
thousand bricks will take around

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.139 
thousand bricks will take around
twenty-five<00:00:46.379> hours<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.920> build<00:00:47.160> almost<00:00:47.430> twice

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
twenty-five hours to build almost twice

twenty-five hours to build almost twice
the<00:00:48.180> time<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.780> typical<00:00:49.289> desktop<00:00:49.530> Lego

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the time as typical desktop Lego

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.160 
the time as typical desktop Lego
sculptures<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.780> guesstimate

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
sculptures that's just a guesstimate

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.709 
sculptures that's just a guesstimate
though<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.039> working<00:00:53.610> version<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.360> still

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
though as the working version is still

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
though as the working version is still
under<00:00:54.960> construction<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:55.980> about

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
under construction so we're about

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
under construction so we're about
halfway<00:00:56.340> there<00:00:56.489> right<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
halfway there right now we have a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
halfway there right now we have a
working<00:00:57.960> LCD<00:00:58.440> monitor<00:00:58.800> 17<00:00:59.309> inch<00:00:59.489> LCD<00:00:59.699> monitor

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
functional model this was a challenge to
build<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.350> functioning<00:01:37.650> unit<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> little

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
build a functioning unit it's a little

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.609 
build a functioning unit it's a little
harder<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.509> people<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.960> computers<00:01:40.439> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
harder because people know computers and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.630 
harder because people know computers and
they<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.100> look<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
they know what they look like so I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.399 
they know what they look like so I
really<00:01:41.939> wanted<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> capture<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.170> sense

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
really wanted to capture it in the sense

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.539 
really wanted to capture it in the sense
that<00:01:43.470> people<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.950> recognize<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that people would recognize it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670 
that people would recognize it
immediately<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:45.360> you'd<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> Lego<00:01:46.020> PC<00:01:46.439> but

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
immediately if you'd like a Lego PC but

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560 
immediately if you'd like a Lego PC but
don't<00:01:46.890> quite<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> computer<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.240> Lego

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
don't quite have the computer or Lego

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
don't quite have the computer or Lego
