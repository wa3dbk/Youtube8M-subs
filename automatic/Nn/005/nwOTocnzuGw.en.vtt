if you put on your Google foo a little

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.140 
if you put on your Google foo a little
bit<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.220> can<00:04:33.340> look<00:04:33.520> up<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.700> list<00:04:34.000> of

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
bit you can look up the list of

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.120 
bit you can look up the list of
locations<00:04:34.480> where<00:04:34.870> it's<00:04:35.050> legal<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.470> record<00:04:35.919> and

where<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.370> not<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:37.000> anyway<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.389> thought

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
where it's not but anyway just thought

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.000 
where it's not but anyway just thought
that<00:04:37.600> was<00:04:37.750> kind<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:37.990> an<00:04:38.110> interesting<00:04:38.260> topic<00:04:38.680> if

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010

what language you're using in theory now
there<00:05:26.740> is<00:05:26.830> another<00:05:26.860> method<00:05:27.280> for<00:05:27.550> doing<00:05:27.669> this

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
there is another method for doing this

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.310 
there is another method for doing this
that<00:05:28.000> was<00:05:28.120> already<00:05:28.300> available<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:29.020> was<00:05:29.139> done

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
that was already available it was done

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.170 
that was already available it was done
using<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.800> xposed<00:05:30.220> framework<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:30.850> using<00:05:31.090> a

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
using the xposed framework and using a

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.120 
using the xposed framework and using a
module<00:05:31.510> on<00:05:31.630> top<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.960> that<00:05:32.050> but<00:05:32.590> this<00:05:32.680> way<00:05:32.860> all

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
module on top of that but this way all

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.950 
module on top of that but this way all
you<00:05:33.340> have<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.550> do<00:05:33.610> is<00:05:33.700> replace<00:05:33.970> one<00:05:34.270> APK<00:05:34.750> file

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
you have to do is replace one APK file

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.020 
you have to do is replace one APK file
now<00:05:35.650> unfortunately<00:05:36.100> whenever<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.880> does

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
now unfortunately whenever it does

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.340 
now unfortunately whenever it does
update<00:05:37.240> there's<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.630> very<00:05:37.750> good<00:05:37.840> chance<00:05:37.990> it'll

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
update there's a very good chance it'll

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.110 
update there's a very good chance it'll
get<00:05:38.500> replaced<00:05:38.860> but<00:05:39.220> you<00:05:39.520> should<00:05:39.760> be<00:05:39.880> able<00:05:39.940> to

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
get replaced but you should be able to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.390 
get replaced but you should be able to
just<00:05:40.240> swap<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:41.080> back<00:05:41.110> over<00:05:41.380> or<00:05:41.650> get<00:05:42.010> an<00:05:42.100> updated

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
just swap it back over or get an updated

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.040 
just swap it back over or get an updated
version<00:05:42.550> something<00:05:43.240> like<00:05:43.360> that<00:05:43.570> just<00:05:43.900> keep

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
version something like that just keep

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.360 
version something like that just keep

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
going to be pulling directly from google

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.680 
going to be pulling directly from google
play<00:06:48.950> which<00:06:49.550> makes<00:06:49.970> it<00:06:50.120> a<00:06:50.270> little<00:06:50.420> bit<00:06:50.570> more

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
play which makes it a little bit more

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.270

difficult<00:06:50.870> to<00:06:51.170> get<00:06:51.350> malware<00:06:51.560> in<00:06:51.920> now<00:06:52.160> of

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
difficult to get malware in now of

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.740 
difficult to get malware in now of
course<00:06:52.460> it<00:06:52.640> is<00:06:52.730> still<00:06:52.970> possible<00:06:53.000> to<00:06:53.480> get<00:06:53.600> it

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
course it is still possible to get it

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.200 
course it is still possible to get it
there<00:06:53.960> but<00:06:54.560> if<00:06:54.710> but<00:06:55.010> as<00:06:55.190> you<00:06:55.550> have<00:06:55.970> seen

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
there but if but as you have seen

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.000 
there but if but as you have seen
there's<00:06:56.690> a<00:06:56.780> permission<00:06:57.410> so<00:06:57.590> whenever<00:06:57.860> you<00:06:57.920> go

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
there's a permission so whenever you go

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.470 
there's a permission so whenever you go

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
calls and i'm going to be able to record

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.060 
calls and i'm going to be able to record
your<00:07:05.630> phone<00:07:05.780> calls<00:07:06.020> or<00:07:06.230> whatever<00:07:06.500> else<00:07:06.710> so<00:07:06.950> it

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
your phone calls or whatever else so it

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.980 
your phone calls or whatever else so it
is<00:07:07.160> a<00:07:07.190> very<00:07:07.370> nice<00:07:07.580> take<00:07:07.940> on<00:07:08.090> the<00:07:08.360> idea<00:07:08.660> that

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
is a very nice take on the idea that

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.690 
is a very nice take on the idea that
there<00:07:09.500> is<00:07:09.680> security<00:07:10.100> built<00:07:10.430> into<00:07:10.640> the

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
there is security built into the

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.550 
there is security built into the
platform<00:07:10.820> as<00:07:11.360> long<00:07:11.540> as<00:07:11.690> you<00:07:11.780> don't<00:07:12.140> root<00:07:12.350> your

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
platform as long as you don't root your

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.290 
platform as long as you don't root your
device<00:07:12.680> because<00:07:13.250> realistically<00:07:13.640> once<00:07:14.120> you've

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
device because realistically once you've

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.870 
device because realistically once you've
rooted<00:07:14.450> you<00:07:14.750> lose<00:07:14.990> most<00:07:15.770> security<00:07:16.340> so<00:07:16.670> it<00:07:16.790> is

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
rooted you lose most security so it is

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.040 
rooted you lose most security so it is
very<00:07:17.000> interesting<00:07:17.180> read<00:07:17.750> and<00:07:17.990> the

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
very interesting read and the

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.450 
very interesting read and the
presentation<00:07:18.590> itself<00:07:18.980> you<00:07:19.220> should<00:07:19.370> probably

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
presentation itself you should probably

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.190 
presentation itself you should probably
take<00:07:19.760> a<00:07:19.790> look<00:07:19.970> at<00:07:20.090> as<00:07:20.210> well<00:07:20.420> I'll<00:07:20.810> have<00:07:20.870> a<00:07:21.050> link
