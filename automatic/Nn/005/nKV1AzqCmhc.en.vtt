00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.500
 to install so first down you 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.269

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.510
 next when you go to the link 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.960

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.180
 jacques audiard score at fly you have 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.130
 pass the ring next then that these 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.280
 basins 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.610
 then you have to record and that's it 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.489
 so then I'm sorry m of 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.550

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.070
 once after that it'll be like that 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.290
 we want it on install 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.750

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.050
 in in the anchor point of ap data 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.940
 roaming 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.310
 so me like my bad au gratin not 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.600
 in eh ben i changed to the pass 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.380
 so enamelled in minecraft 3.6.2 that's it 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.440
 then where m ok the month of a train of 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.229
 to settle down we wait and quickly 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.790
 finances to stable once installed you 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.300
 go on other minecraft even 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.300
 converted 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.840
 then when you look there you 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.700
 see that there are the forges that settles 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:08.269
 and so one if you connect the south 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:10.630
 this sore and then the forge mode gets 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.630
 charge 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.980
 so if they did not like me it's 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.450
 a little bit long is free 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.940
 it was just now it was 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.940
 a little bit but still 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 so that wants 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:44.760
 follow me sometimes go 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.390
 that's after you can see in the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.000
 folder mode that forget that has three 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.220
 modes installed there are minecraft encoders 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.350
 pack for the mold smells and minecraft 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.040
 time so me all this is the push mode 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.680
 with them I installed the canvas board 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.120
 once if you want if you 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.600
 do not have it is that it's good if you 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.680
 do not have it is that you did neither 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.770
 mishandling 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.590
 then so low it's after we get 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.900
 does actually leave game now we're going 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.360
 install loud excuse me now 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.920
 here and there we follow cosette on the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.610
 link who are good when matt moss r25 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.790
 a suite you piss on 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.800
 you are there again on the irak fly towards 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.020
 the 5 seconds then passed 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.230
 the herald 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:45.370
 but then the vault and you press 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.420
 on clock so download this is the one 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.630
 in the middle but the big so then 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.160
 comes from these teams that goes from its rare 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.080
 rare points that will 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.450
 7 What change once it's good 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:09.660
 you put on the on the desktop here is 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:12.280
 then I went to your minecraft 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.820
 takm were rising in the mode folder 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.340
 that forget has created so then you 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.799
 open the files matte here we are 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.410
 and in there are two modes went from 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.730
 fashion and flout them slip no 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.840
 sorry folder to slip them into 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.650
 your fashion folder 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.180
 so for my part here once 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.270
 it's done and well you can 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.870
 now play with this mode on 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.700
 Minecraft 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.110
 except for those who were wondering 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.400
 what is the mode for 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.370
 fashion now so well that's all 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.160
 simple it serves to buy the sound effects 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.470
 for example in your body inventory 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.360
 in addition if you have a sword and that no 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.860
 replaced in the middle of the ranks to go 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.300
 with the pickaxe and beats his wife what she 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.550
 offers for rings for hot 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.060
 when it changes objects and well into 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.520
 fact that makes the taste is simply this 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.510
 what postulates so here I am going to do myself 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.200
 show that it works well I prefer 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.200
 but a bit far 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.060
 and I also wanted to miss the absence 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.449
 for months I have not made a video 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.880
 but now that I have installed as 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:26.130
 besides you see as a cantor of 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.479
 two films with is well terrien madic 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.240
 and although it took less space 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.639
 so I installed because for 10 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.150
 minutes of strong video strikes that 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.009
 still recognize 10 gigas or that's it 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.300
 so then see that my self is there 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.150
 marked this fashion but wanted to ship 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.580
 four lodden modes four modes does it 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.400
 so including mode and will you see 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.759
 unstable matmos mode and has now 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.229
 I want to show that they walk if 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.460

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.150
