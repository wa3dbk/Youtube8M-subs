the sixties production concept car this
is<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.140> highly<00:00:48.379> feasible<00:00:48.739> one<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:50.720> makes

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
is a highly feasible one and that makes

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.479 
is a highly feasible one and that makes
it<00:00:50.989> from<00:00:51.230> me<00:00:51.350> all<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.710> more<00:00:51.860> exciting<00:00:51.980> and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
means that which is builders car it is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.150 
means that which is builders car it is
plausible<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:56.059> not<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.239> fantasy<00:00:56.650> and<00:00:57.650> it's<00:00:58.070> a

we've done since be e type this car is
important<00:01:07.610> for<00:01:07.700> Jaguar<00:01:08.119> with<00:01:08.270> two<00:01:08.420> main

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
important for Jaguar with two main

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.560 
important for Jaguar with two main
reasons<00:01:09.369> firstly<00:01:10.369> because<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.000> emotional

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
reasons firstly because of the emotional

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.190 
reasons firstly because of the emotional
value<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:12.439> will<00:01:12.619> bring<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.310> ground<00:01:14.200> ever

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
value it will bring to the ground ever

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.719 
value it will bring to the ground ever
since<00:01:15.290> we<00:01:15.680> stopped<00:01:16.040> building<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.430> e-type

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
since we stopped building the e-type

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.580 
since we stopped building the e-type
people<00:01:17.240> have<00:01:17.330> asked<00:01:17.689> when<00:01:18.140> will<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.409> build

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
people have asked when will you build

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.550 
people have asked when will you build
another<00:01:18.860> retype<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:20.540> isn't<00:01:20.869> another<00:01:21.110> e-type

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
another retype this isn't another e-type

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.620 
another retype this isn't another e-type
but<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.070> in<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.310> spirit<00:01:22.760> that<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.330> e-type

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
but it's in the spirit that the e-type

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.230 
but it's in the spirit that the e-type
is<00:01:23.840> created

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
is created

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.770 
is created
like<00:01:26.930> every<00:01:27.200> Django<00:01:27.619> we<00:01:27.829> designed<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.220> car

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
like every Django we designed this car

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.300 
like every Django we designed this car
to<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> point<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.259> simplicity<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.920> people

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
to a point of simplicity that people

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.800 
to a point of simplicity that people
could<00:01:31.430> understand<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:32.270> by<00:01:32.360> looking<00:01:32.689> at

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
could understand it just by looking at
