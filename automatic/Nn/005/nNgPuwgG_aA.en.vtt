00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
go into a restaurant you go and you look

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459 
go into a restaurant you go and you look
at<00:00:38.429> the<00:00:38.489> menu<00:00:38.760> say<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> want<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:40.199> you

at the menu say I want this and then you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.189 
at the menu say I want this and then you
get<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.969> but<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.269> some<00:00:42.690> restaurants

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199

that have this tasting menu and the idea

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.889 
that have this tasting menu and the idea
behind<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.429> you<00:00:47.699> can<00:00:47.850> sample<00:00:48.089> a<00:00:48.480> wide

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
behind it is that you can sample a wide

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.660 
behind it is that you can sample a wide
variety<00:00:49.199> of<00:00:49.559> foods<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.070> instead<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.399> having<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
variety of foods but instead of having a

variety of foods but instead of having a
big<00:00:50.910> plate<00:00:51.239> full<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> tons<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.230> food<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.859> have
