00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
when I airplane goes up and it tumbles

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.880 
when I airplane goes up and it tumbles
and<00:00:27.450> goes<00:00:27.630> crazy<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.050> flips<00:00:28.350> around<00:00:28.440> and<00:00:28.680> goes

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and goes crazy and flips around and goes

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.350 
and goes crazy and flips around and goes
all<00:00:29.070> over<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.520> place<00:00:29.700> and<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.030> think<00:00:30.240> it's

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
all over the place and you think it's

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.900 
all over the place and you think it's
totally<00:00:31.230> out<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.350> control<00:00:31.650> which<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.250> they

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
totally out of control which it is they

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.810 
totally out of control which it is they
named<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> lump<00:00:33.690> Shabak<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.140> airplanes

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
named that the lump Shabak and airplanes

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.849 
named that the lump Shabak and airplanes
so<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.180> came<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.929> with<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.199> maneuver<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.679> this

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
so I came up with a maneuver and this

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.889 
so I came up with a maneuver and this
thing<00:00:38.039> that<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:39.089> was<00:00:39.239> similar<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.839> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
thing that that was similar to it in a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.410 
thing that that was similar to it in a
helicopter<00:00:40.019> and<00:00:40.699> since<00:00:41.699> no<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:41.969> had<00:00:42.089> done<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
helicopter and since no one had done it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.090 
helicopter and since no one had done it
there<00:00:42.839> was<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> name<00:00:43.289> board<00:00:43.530> need<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.829> named

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
there was a name board need to be named

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.029 
there was a name board need to be named
so<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.339> called<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.819> Chuck's<00:00:45.059> vaca<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
so I called it the Chuck's vaca and

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.919 
so I called it the Chuck's vaca and
basically<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.249> is<00:00:47.339> is<00:00:47.609> you<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.999> I<00:00:48.239> go

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
basically what it is is you just I go

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.930 
basically what it is is you just I go
really<00:00:48.960> i<00:00:49.229> do<00:00:49.409> about<00:00:49.679> 120<00:00:50.249> not<00:00:50.399> straight<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
really i do about 120 not straight and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.279 
really i do about 120 not straight and
level<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.359> I'll<00:00:51.479> pull<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.170> go

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
level then I'll pull it up and I go

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.349 
level then I'll pull it up and I go
straight<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.999> straight<00:00:54.329> up

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
straight up and as I'm going straight up

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.750 
straight up and as I'm going straight up
then<00:00:55.170> I'd<00:00:55.289> go<00:00:55.499> I<00:00:55.649> roll<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.429> straight<00:00:56.729> up

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
then I'd go I roll it going straight up

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.719 
then I'd go I roll it going straight up
and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.839> in<00:00:57.929> the<00:00:58.050> after<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.589> finish<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.519> role

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
and then in the after I finish the role

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.000 
and then in the after I finish the role
going<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.329> I'm<00:01:00.600> losing<00:01:00.899> inertia<00:01:01.409> and<00:01:01.559> airspeed

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
going up I'm losing inertia and airspeed

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
going up I'm losing inertia and airspeed
and<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.850> 20<00:01:03.210> airspeed<00:01:03.569> and<00:01:03.629> I'm<00:01:03.719> still

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and I get 20 airspeed and I'm still

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.930 
and I get 20 airspeed and I'm still
rolling<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.440> then<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.620> fall<00:01:04.680> upside<00:01:05.309> down<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
rolling and then I fall upside down and

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.850 
rolling and then I fall upside down and
I'm<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.630> still<00:01:06.930> rolling<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.680> come

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I'm and I'm still rolling it and I come

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.810 
I'm and I'm still rolling it and I come
out<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.130> thing<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> looking<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
out of that thing a looking like a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
out of that thing a looking like a
tumble<00:01:09.660> it<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.230> tumble<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.830> come<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.190> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
tumble it is a tumble and I come out of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
tumble it is a tumble and I come out of
it<00:01:11.370> and<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.550> get<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.450> more<00:01:12.570> airspeed<00:01:12.870> falling

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it and I get some more airspeed falling

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
it and I get some more airspeed falling
down<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.620> still<00:01:13.890> steering<00:01:14.400> around<00:01:14.730> and<00:01:14.940> pull

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
down and still steering around and pull

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.280 
down and still steering around and pull
it<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:15.710> it's<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:17.010> of<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:18.290> totally

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it out so that's it's kind of a totally

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
it out so that's it's kind of a totally
crazy<00:01:19.620> flipping<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.160> over<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.580> twisting<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
crazy flipping it over and twisting and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
crazy flipping it over and twisting and
spinning<00:01:21.570> maneuver<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> called<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
spinning maneuver that I called the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.880 
spinning maneuver that I called the
Chuck's<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.160> walk<00:01:23.310> before<00:01:24.240> every<00:01:24.660> flight<00:01:24.890> out

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
Chuck's a walk before every flight out

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.120 
Chuck's a walk before every flight out
and<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.850> sit<00:01:27.480> in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> helicopter<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.920> get

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and I I sit in the helicopter and I get

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.550 
and I I sit in the helicopter and I get
away<00:01:29.280> from<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> crowds<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.840> sit

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
away from the crowds and I just sit

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
away from the crowds and I just sit
there<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.800> think<00:01:31.920> about<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.640> maneuvers<00:01:32.970> I'm

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
there and think about the maneuvers I'm

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.540 
there and think about the maneuvers I'm
getting<00:01:33.270> ready<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.920> mentally

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
getting ready to do and I get mentally

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.290 
getting ready to do and I get mentally
focused<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> instrument<00:01:37.080> panel<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:38.550> the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
focused on the instrument panel the the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.630 
focused on the instrument panel the the
the<00:01:39.840> maneuver<00:01:40.560> I'm<00:01:40.650> getting<00:01:40.860> ready<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the maneuver I'm getting ready to do and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.140 
the maneuver I'm getting ready to do and
I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.150> my<00:01:42.270> head<00:01:43.610> I'm<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.820> come<00:01:44.970> in

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
I think in my head I'm going to come in

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.870 
I think in my head I'm going to come in
from<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.510> side<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.650> runway<00:01:47.100> at<00:01:47.370> 500

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
from the side and down the runway at 500

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.430 
from the side and down the runway at 500
feet<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.330> I'm<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> roll<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
feet and I'm going to do a roll and and

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.350

these maneuvers and not be out of

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.560 
these maneuvers and not be out of
control<00:03:40.620> I'm<00:03:41.100> flying<00:03:41.610> through<00:03:42.030> all<00:03:42.299> this

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
control I'm flying through all this

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.360 
control I'm flying through all this
stuff<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.079> it's<00:03:43.650> never<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.040> point<00:03:44.280> where

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
stuff and it's never in a point where

stuff and it's never in a point where
I'm<00:03:44.459> out<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.640> control<00:03:44.910> even<00:03:45.480> though<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.690> might

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
I'm out of control even though it might

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.750 
I'm out of control even though it might
look<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.350> i'm<00:03:46.530> flying<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.430> through<00:03:47.640> it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
look like it i'm flying it through it

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.949 
look like it i'm flying it through it
all<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> time<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.860> feeling<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:50.790> just

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
all the time and the feeling is just

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.150 
all the time and the feeling is just
incredible<00:03:51.959> as<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.470> probably<00:03:52.799> why<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> keep

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
incredible as is probably why I keep

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160 
incredible as is probably why I keep
doing<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.850> whole<00:03:54.090> idea<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.870> feeling

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
doing it but the whole idea the feeling

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.080 
doing it but the whole idea the feeling
that<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.500> really<00:03:55.829> enjoy<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.310> most<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.760> I

that<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.640> aviation<00:04:12.320> I'm<00:04:13.320> thinking<00:04:13.680> about

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
that is in aviation I'm thinking about

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.590 
that is in aviation I'm thinking about
doing<00:04:13.980> more<00:04:14.549> modifications<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.480> this

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
doing more modifications to this

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.849 
doing more modifications to this
aircraft<00:04:16.049> I'm<00:04:16.769> hoping<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.820> someday<00:04:18.650> get<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.769> to

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
aircraft I'm hoping to someday get it to

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.190 
aircraft I'm hoping to someday get it to
where<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.039> will<00:04:20.130> hover<00:04:20.340> upside<00:04:20.970> down<00:04:21.209> it's

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
where it will hover upside down it's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.570 
where it will hover upside down it's
going<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.410> take<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> lot<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.860> work<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.190> do<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.460> I

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
going to take a lot of work to do it I

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.900 
going to take a lot of work to do it I
know<00:04:23.669> how<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:23.970> do<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.330> but<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:26.760> going<00:04:26.849> to

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
know how to do it but and it's going to

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.700 
know how to do it but and it's going to
take<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.090> lot<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.270> nerve<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:27.690> actually<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.320> so

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710

myself<00:06:15.810> to<00:06:16.080> death<00:06:16.260> a<00:06:16.470> bunch<00:06:16.860> and<00:06:17.160> I<00:06:17.580> probably

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
myself to death a bunch and I probably

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.290 
myself to death a bunch and I probably
should<00:06:18.060> have<00:06:18.090> died<00:06:18.350> 15<00:06:19.350> times<00:06:19.590> ago<00:06:19.860> as<00:06:20.820> long<00:06:21.270> as

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
should have died 15 times ago as long as

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.960 
should have died 15 times ago as long as
I<00:06:21.540> can<00:06:21.770> teach<00:06:22.770> someone<00:06:23.160> how<00:06:23.310> to<00:06:23.490> do<00:06:23.700> this<00:06:23.820> stuff

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
I can teach someone how to do this stuff

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.030 
I can teach someone how to do this stuff
and<00:06:24.300> feel<00:06:24.570> comfortable<00:06:24.870> and<00:06:25.380> they're<00:06:25.890> going

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
and feel comfortable and they're going

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.350 
and feel comfortable and they're going
to<00:06:26.100> be<00:06:26.190> safe<00:06:26.370> doing<00:06:26.580> it<00:06:26.730> if<00:06:26.940> they<00:06:27.120> tried

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
to be safe doing it if they tried

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.600 
to be safe doing it if they tried
themselves<00:06:27.930> then<00:06:28.620> i'll<00:06:28.800> probably<00:06:29.310> put<00:06:29.490> on

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
themselves then i'll probably put on

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.000 
themselves then i'll probably put on
that<00:06:29.760> stool
