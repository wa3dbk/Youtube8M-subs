I took this one out of the box the knots

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
I took this one out of the box the knots
weren't<00:02:06.299> bleached<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.869> much<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.500> would<00:02:07.560> like

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
weren't bleached as much as I would like

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.559 
weren't bleached as much as I would like
them<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.789> popped<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> little

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
them to be so I just popped on a little

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.870 
them to be so I just popped on a little
bit

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
bit

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.990 
bit
concealer<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.710> would<00:02:11.890> match<00:02:12.130> like<00:02:12.760> my

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
concealer so it would match like my

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
always use this because i don't really

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.270 
always use this because i don't really
want<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.930> have<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> bleaching<00:02:26.710> it's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
want to have to do the bleaching it's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.240 
want to have to do the bleaching it's
really<00:02:27.820> pretty<00:02:28.210> it's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.690> generous<00:02:29.230> 24<00:02:29.860> inches

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
really pretty it's a generous 24 inches

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.450 
really pretty it's a generous 24 inches
so<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.520> falls<00:02:30.850> all<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.210> way<00:02:31.480> down<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.960> my<00:02:31.990> waist

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460
