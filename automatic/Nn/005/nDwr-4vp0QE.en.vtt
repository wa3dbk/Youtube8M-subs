00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.190 
now so we'll just do an IB action coffee
text<00:02:13.700> ID<00:02:14.700> sender<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.590> one<00:02:16.590> for<00:02:16.890> IV<00:02:17.370> action

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
text ID sender and one for IV action

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
text ID sender and one for IV action
paste<00:02:19.200> text<00:02:20.190> ID<00:02:20.730> Center<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.740> great

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
paste text ID Center now this is great

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.820 
paste text ID Center now this is great
because<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.930> copy<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.380> from<00:02:25.470> your<00:02:25.710> app

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
because it you can copy it from your app

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.340 
because it you can copy it from your app
and<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.700> will<00:02:26.850> remember<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:28.200> can

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
and it will remember it and you can

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.290 
and it will remember it and you can
paste<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> text<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.310> virtually<00:02:29.970> any<00:02:30.180> other

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
need in our view controller H copy those

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.100 
need in our view controller H copy those
actions<00:02:43.530> because<00:02:43.920> I'm<00:02:44.100> lazy<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.670> go<00:02:45.600> into<00:02:45.930> our

and a text field there we go

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.030 
and a text field there we go
nothing<00:04:15.330> fancy<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:16.140> course<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:16.919> make

this copy and we'll make this

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:31.660 
this copy and we'll make this
pace<00:04:24.730> its<00:04:27.910> well<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:28.940> cannot<00:04:29.510> think<00:04:30.200> today<00:04:30.670> okay

so now we're gonna go into our files
owner<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.950> connect<00:04:36.950> our<00:04:37.130> field<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.700> our<00:04:37.730> field

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
owner and connect our field to our field

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.490 
owner and connect our field to our field
or<00:04:39.080> labeled<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.800> our<00:04:39.950> label<00:04:40.550> our<00:04:41.030> copy<00:04:41.600> through
