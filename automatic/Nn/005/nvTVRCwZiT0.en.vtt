00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510 
does two things it has great reception
but<00:01:48.869> also<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.560> goes<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> satellite<00:01:50.399> so

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
but also it goes up to the satellite so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670 
but also it goes up to the satellite so
you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.000> far<00:01:51.180> away<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.990> France<00:01:52.380> or

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.940 
using and really tight hard to get to
spots<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:09.989> hang<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.739> off

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
spots so you can actually hang it off

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.080 
spots so you can actually hang it off
these<00:02:11.160> magnets<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
these magnets you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.309 
these magnets you

this you can actually call for a little
bit<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.110> light<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.250> more<00:02:23.370> light

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
bit of light for a little bit more light

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.220 
bit of light for a little bit more light
whoa<00:02:23.879> whoa<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.239> wait<00:02:24.780> for<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:27.019> pretty<00:02:28.019> good

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
guess makes me think now that our guess

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
guess makes me think now that our guess
was<00:02:32.040> we're<00:02:32.519> really<00:02:32.700> stupid<00:02:33.120> no<00:02:33.420> no<00:02:33.720> your
