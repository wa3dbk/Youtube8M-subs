00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.529
 exactly what the conditions 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.919

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.919

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.279
 jane that that that 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.649
 that the people were right that remains to be seen but more invasive 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.509
 we have time this year with the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.080
 retreat recruiting 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.400
 from a distance, everything was arranged to be listed 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.130
 and then that he might come kilo I am going now I will not let go of the music 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.780
 can continue to make sick 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.890
 and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 and maybe I'll come back as it says with a defective live show 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.090
 with cera at the kitchen table three weeks ago 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.510
 we had a conversation from go home, how else should you know that you want 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.310
 exactly 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.330
 yes that was a long conversation and then finally advice is something I want 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.200
 actually something totally different his name 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.430
 then came the idea of ​​but maybe we work on a farm and the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.540
 search for the following advice 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.630
 and found and 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 what has been and was arranged a Naarden 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.650
 he is very relieved and happy 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.670
 he finds this very difficult of course it is very emotional and 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.990
 but on the other side 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.820
 I also understand that you give up 40 will be the end of the seventies 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.770
 I have been doing this for so long and I have also had a considerable peak and 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.810
 now everything is still going well but it is actually no longer the same 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 wheel yes then you have to make decisions yourself 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.740
 become the delta 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.140
 yes anyway yes indeed canceled to jakarta 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.420
 and not meant to get out that I have farmland 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.530
 to deliver 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.320
 just went 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.690
 but yes that suddenly illegal ball rolling on the internet and giving up money laundering 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.310
 win money right 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.229
 entire media circus of prisoners I never expected that, but I also feel it 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.229
 well honored the nice award euro on everything done 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.770
 well i dont know who did it all but the ones for it 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.799
 with van loo countries last year 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.869
 she voted one has the gamblers we have for 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:41.959
 if you ever look at this 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.129
 which offers the very best in oath de 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.190
 been seen online we see start 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.209
 carter quality brought sassi had to be brought through 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.949
 think for a moment the reason why the netherlands has become very big forging denswil 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.449
 so who stings 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.040
 I believe so 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.609
 yet none of this seems to be his last 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.319
 this will be well I think it is very unfortunate it was also shocked then 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.429
 i heard it 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:15.359
 and yes it is for me he wants those areas that is not quite the same 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.919
 dr 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.509
 that is very crazy to put inter korean relationships made i never believe 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.559
 would be your last set so she wants you to say a few years 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.129
 ago is too valuable to turn around 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.680
 I must admit that I have never seen anything like that in my entire life 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.029
 no longer by turning so I think I have to keep an eye on things 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.460
 I'm so glad I miss it again 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.279
 the municipality is just 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.229
 the pioneer who real the first laid the foundation for all dutch house die 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:43.409
 there is now 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.529
 so all the aussie now both electro surpass anything whatsoever 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.399
 and the music of the measurement of doing so 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.599
 as the first to break through the Dutch roads internationally 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.659
 and the consequence of this is tiësto armin from neighbors and ferry 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.109
 Corsten Sander consequences people have with the darts 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.679
