tutorial explaining how to put cards on
the<00:00:03.750> CT<00:00:04.110> track<00:00:04.680> using<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.220> CTR<00:00:05.609> crater<00:00:05.850> this

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
the CT track using the CTR crater this

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.670 
the CT track using the CTR crater this
is<00:00:06.210> just<00:00:06.390> because<00:00:06.660> it's<00:00:06.930> slightly<00:00:07.350> different

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
is just because it's slightly different

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.440 
is just because it's slightly different
than<00:00:07.859> putting<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.760> in-game<00:00:09.210> track

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
than putting it on a in-game track

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.730 
than putting it on a in-game track
because<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.139> select<00:00:10.410> all<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
because you have to select all of the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.890 
because you have to select all of the
different<00:00:11.070> pieces<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.580> CT<00:00:11.910> has<00:00:12.150> by

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
different pieces that the CT has by

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.209 
different pieces that the CT has by
going<00:00:13.230> into<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.530> folder<00:00:13.799> but<00:00:13.889> that's<00:00:14.070> exactly

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
going into the folder but that's exactly

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.250 
going into the folder but that's exactly
what<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.969> explain<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.719> this

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
what I'm going to explain in this this

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
just go into the example folder in the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.540 
just go into the example folder in the
CT<00:00:22.410> our<00:00:22.500> Creator<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:23.100> worry<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.460> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
haven't really seen this before you can

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.929 
haven't really seen this before you can
just<00:00:25.289> ignore<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.800> program<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.760> go

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
just ignore the program for now just go

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
just ignore the program for now just go
into<00:00:27.090> examples<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> usually<00:00:28.320> do

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
into examples this is what I usually do

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.769 
into examples this is what I usually do
and<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.449> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and this is what you need to do in this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.150 
and this is what you need to do in this
case<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.920> work

Profis thing and this is basically going

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.229 
Profis thing and this is basically going
to<00:00:37.559> give<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> band<00:00:38.190> art<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.640> file<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.059> this

is a text file which you put into the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.459 
is a text file which you put into the
program<00:00:42.090> which<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> reads<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.230> turns

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
program which it reads and then turns

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
program which it reads and then turns
into<00:00:43.620> CT<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.160> you're<00:00:44.370> going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.879> have

into CT on you're going to want to have

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
into CT on you're going to want to have
the<00:00:45.180> profuse<00:00:45.570> version<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.379> version

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the profuse version because this version

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
the profuse version because this version
comes<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.700> actually<00:00:48.059> track<00:00:48.390> section

because<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.960> folder<00:00:55.320> needs<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.860> actually

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219

example another car you have to add a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.740 
example another car you have to add a
comment<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.460> then<00:02:03.090> copy<00:02:03.390> another

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
comment like that and then copy another

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.929 
comment like that and then copy another
name<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> file<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.759> well

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
name and put that in the file as well

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
name and put that in the file as well
and<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.299> basically<00:02:06.659> how<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.899> works<00:02:07.290> okay

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
and that's basically how that works okay

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.199 
and that's basically how that works okay
so<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.069> two<00:02:08.369> cars<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.940> are<00:02:09.090> going

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
so now we have two cars that are going

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.660 
so now we have two cars that are going
to<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.629> our<00:02:09.840> CTR<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.039> now<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.310> don't

in<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.860> way<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:33.329> this<00:03:33.600> folder<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.680> name

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
in this way in this folder so the name

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.160 
in this way in this folder so the name
of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.190> folder<00:03:35.340> which<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.120> copied<00:03:36.780> this

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
of the folder which I just copied this

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.360 
of the folder which I just copied this
is<00:03:37.320> basically<00:03:37.650> what<00:03:37.860> all<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.250> different

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
is basically what all the different

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.090 
is basically what all the different
track<00:03:38.820> sections<00:03:39.510> are<00:03:39.750> located<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.769> are<00:03:40.950> in

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
track sections are located that are in

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.009 
track sections are located that are in
the<00:03:41.250> CT<00:03:41.610> however<00:03:42.209> as<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.420> can<00:03:42.480> see<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
the CT however as you can see this is a

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.870 
the CT however as you can see this is a
ridiculous<00:03:43.680> amount<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.190> copy<00:03:44.549> all<00:03:44.850> of

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
ridiculous amount so to copy all of

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880 
ridiculous amount so to copy all of
these<00:03:45.150> names<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.750> put<00:03:45.989> them<00:03:46.170> into<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.650> track

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
these names and put them into the track

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.740 
these names and put them into the track
section<00:03:47.280> name<00:03:47.459> section<00:03:47.760> which<00:03:48.299> is<00:03:48.450> where<00:03:48.600> we

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
section name section which is where we

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.940 
section name section which is where we
want<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:48.989> get<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.260> names<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> track

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
want to get the names of the track

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.470 
want to get the names of the track
sections<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.459> we<00:03:50.579> want<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.820> have<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.150> CTR

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
sections that we want to have in the CTR

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.990 
sections that we want to have in the CTR
it's<00:03:51.600> just<00:03:51.840> ridiculous<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.070> we're<00:03:53.670> not<00:03:53.760> going

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
it's just ridiculous so we're not going

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.640 
it's just ridiculous so we're not going
to<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.390> but<00:03:54.750> rather<00:03:54.989> we're<00:03:55.350> going<00:03:55.530> to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
to do that but rather we're going to

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.160 
to do that but rather we're going to
take<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.130> folder<00:03:57.000> which<00:03:57.239> actually<00:03:57.660> includes

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
take the folder which actually includes

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.460 
take the folder which actually includes
the<00:03:58.440> CTF<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.120> example<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.049> warden

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
the CTF so in this example the warden

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.910 
the CTF so in this example the warden
right<00:04:01.709> uses<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:03.180> CT<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.840> basically<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.890> have

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
right uses the CT and basically you have

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.100 
right uses the CT and basically you have
to<00:04:05.190> find<00:04:05.370> any<00:04:05.670> folder<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.360> any<00:04:06.540> CT<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:06.959> that

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
to find any folder of any CT on that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.170 
to find any folder of any CT on that
uses<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.829> track<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.489> forward<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.090> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
uses this track so forward and this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.479 
uses this track so forward and this
would<00:04:09.390> just<00:04:09.510> be<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.690> CTR<00:04:10.230> EP<00:04:10.590> Woden<00:04:10.980> right<00:04:11.220> and

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
would just be the CTR EP Woden right and

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.660 
would just be the CTR EP Woden right and
for<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.359> family<00:04:13.140> profile<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:14.190> would<00:04:14.430> for

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
for the family profile that would for

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.539 
for the family profile that would for
example<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.510> Pegasus<00:04:16.049> right<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.500> we<00:04:17.400> go

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
example be the Pegasus right and we go

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.460 
example be the Pegasus right and we go
to<00:04:17.609> go<00:04:17.850> into<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.329> thing<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.870> here<00:04:19.169> we<00:04:19.289> have

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
to go into this thing and here we have

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.380 
to go into this thing and here we have
two<00:04:19.680> files<00:04:19.979> we<00:04:20.160> have<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.280> common<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:20.940> unique

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
two files we have a common and unique

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.080 
two files we have a common and unique
ovl<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.770> way<00:04:22.890> we<00:04:23.039> can<00:04:23.220> open<00:04:23.550> these<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.940> to

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
ovl and the way we can open these is to

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.290 
ovl and the way we can open these is to
open<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.539> new<00:04:24.570> node

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
open a new node

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.719 
open a new node
like<00:04:25.539> that<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.050> drag<00:04:26.710> them<00:04:26.919> in<00:04:27.099> today<00:04:27.460> and

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
like that and drag them in today and

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.809 
like that and drag them in today and
then<00:04:28.720> if<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.199> did<00:04:29.409> that<00:04:29.560> hold<00:04:29.889> on<00:04:30.039> not<00:04:30.580> drag

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
then if you did that hold on not drag

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.820 
then if you did that hold on not drag
them<00:04:31.000> both<00:04:31.210> into<00:04:31.449> that<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:32.440> drag<00:04:32.650> the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
them both into that just drag the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.610 
them both into that just drag the
commandant<00:04:33.490> ovl<00:04:33.909> into<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.629> notepad<00:04:35.169> and

commandant ovl into that notepad and

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.990 
commandant ovl into that notepad and
then<00:04:36.039> you'll<00:04:36.190> see<00:04:36.400> all<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.639> these<00:04:36.940> different

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
then you'll see all of these different

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.749 
then you'll see all of these different
