probably<00:03:26.919> go<00:03:27.069> down<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.549> would<00:03:28.000> have<00:03:28.090> thought

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
probably go down I would have thought

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.699 
probably go down I would have thought
maybe<00:03:28.419> starting<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.780> spine<00:03:29.079> crawler<00:03:29.440> be

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
maybe starting a spine crawler be

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.349 
maybe starting a spine crawler be
worthwhile<00:03:29.889> he's<00:03:30.549> not<00:03:30.730> going<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.030> stop<00:03:31.209> this

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
worthwhile he's not going to stop this

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.059 
worthwhile he's not going to stop this
bunker<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:31.900> time<00:03:34.169> good<00:03:35.169> control<00:03:35.650> out<00:03:36.010> of

innovation<00:03:36.760> cleans<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:37.959> up<00:03:37.989> no<00:03:38.349> problem<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
innovation cleans that up no problem and

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.349 
innovation cleans that up no problem and
it's<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:41.769> going<00:03:41.919> to<00:03:41.950> bunker<00:03:42.280> walk<00:03:42.489> now<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.329> I

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
it's just going to bunker walk now so I

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.150 
it's just going to bunker walk now so I
thought<00:03:43.569> starting<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.079> spine<00:03:44.410> as<00:03:44.560> nice<00:03:44.739> spines

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
thought starting a spine as nice spines

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.580 
thought starting a spine as nice spines
just<00:03:45.700> kill<00:03:46.060> marine<00:03:46.450> super<00:03:46.900> fast<00:03:47.169> get<00:03:47.470> out

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
just kill marine super fast get out

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.270 
just kill marine super fast get out
range<00:03:47.799> bunkers

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.330 

zergling<00:03:53.090> without<00:03:53.900> speed<00:03:54.230> there<00:03:54.680> goes<00:03:55.130> down

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
zergling without speed there goes down

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.410 
zergling without speed there goes down
that<00:03:55.370> crawler<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:55.970> it's<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.180> going<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.330> get

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
that crawler but it's just going to get

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.449 
that crawler but it's just going to get
sniped<00:04:01.690> yeah<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:03.680> pretty<00:04:04.100> close

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
sniped yeah this is this is pretty close

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.340 
sniped yeah this is this is pretty close
to<00:04:04.520> GG<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.120> would<00:04:05.390> like<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.660> see<00:04:05.870> something

to GG I would like to see something
crazy<00:04:06.740> happen<00:04:07.130> on<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.340> side<00:04:07.580> I<00:04:07.819> just<00:04:08.690> don't

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
crazy happen on this side I just don't

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.240 
crazy happen on this side I just don't
really<00:04:09.410> think<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:09.830> possible<00:04:11.830> this<00:04:12.830> overlord

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
really think it's possible this overlord

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.860 
really think it's possible this overlord
esma<00:04:13.580> say<00:04:13.730> these<00:04:13.880> overloads<00:04:14.239> get<00:04:14.450> sniped<00:04:14.690> then

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
esma say these overloads get sniped then

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.750 
esma say these overloads get sniped then
it's<00:04:15.020> definitely<00:04:15.560> done<00:04:15.770> with<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.549> too<00:04:16.730> bad

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
it's definitely done with that's too bad

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.310 
it's definitely done with that's too bad
i<00:04:16.910> was<00:04:17.209> like<00:04:17.329> i<00:04:17.480> was<00:04:17.690> hoping<00:04:17.930> for<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.109> little<00:04:18.169> bit
