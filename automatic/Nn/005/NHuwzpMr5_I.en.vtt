00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
noticed very first thing is going to be

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.430 
noticed very first thing is going to be
the<00:00:36.210> softness<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> thickness<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
the softness and the thickness of the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.670 
the softness and the thickness of the
the<00:00:40.440> cushions<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.550> speakers<00:00:42.590> it's<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the cushions on the speakers it's a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.700 
the cushions on the speakers it's a
little<00:00:44.070> bit<00:00:44.190> thinner<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.680> there<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
little bit thinner it really is there a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.310 
little bit thinner it really is there a
little<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.399> less<00:00:47.640> comfortable<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.420> mean<00:00:48.719> not

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
little bit less comfortable I mean not

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.130 
little bit less comfortable I mean not
that<00:00:49.379> they're<00:00:49.649> uncomfortable<00:00:50.070> by<00:00:50.489> any<00:00:50.670> means

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
that they're uncomfortable by any means

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.750 
that they're uncomfortable by any means
but<00:00:52.140> they're<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
but they're just they really are just a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
but they're just they really are just a
little<00:00:53.910> bit<00:00:54.120> less<00:00:54.329> comfortable<00:00:54.809> um<00:00:55.649> other

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
little bit less comfortable um other

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.090 
little bit less comfortable um other
than<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.149> guess<00:00:57.180> there<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.780> isn't<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
than that I guess there really isn't the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.709 
than that I guess there really isn't the
color<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.239> bothered<00:01:00.420> by<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.930> color

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719

I<00:03:06.290> don't<00:03:06.349> know<00:03:06.500> um<00:03:06.799> I<00:03:07.430> will<00:03:07.819> say<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.299> though<00:03:08.599> I

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
I don't know um I will say this though I

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.580 
I don't know um I will say this though I
I<00:03:09.590> maybe<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.879> might<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.329> be<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.569> my<00:03:11.629> head<00:03:11.930> but

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
I maybe it might just be in my head but

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.259 
I maybe it might just be in my head but
I<00:03:12.650> think<00:03:12.949> that<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.159> sound<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.549> just<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.849> little

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
I think that the sound is just a little

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.710 
I think that the sound is just a little
bit<00:03:14.419> crisper<00:03:15.909> don't<00:03:16.909> call<00:03:17.090> me<00:03:17.209> on<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.449> that's

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
bit crisper don't call me on that that's

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.610 
bit crisper don't call me on that that's
not<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:18.199> verified<00:03:18.799> but<00:03:19.209> i<00:03:20.209> feel<00:03:21.109> it<00:03:21.229> i<00:03:21.379> think

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
not like verified but i feel it i think

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.559 
not like verified but i feel it i think
so<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.280> that's<00:03:22.849> really<00:03:22.909> all<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.180> matters<00:03:23.299> is

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
so and that's really all that matters is

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.839 
so and that's really all that matters is
how<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.780> feel<00:03:23.930> about<00:03:24.109> your<00:03:24.379> purchase<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:24.919> what

that it's necessarily an upgrade as much
as<00:03:37.009> just<00:03:37.129> a<00:03:37.280> lateral<00:03:37.639> move<00:03:37.669> and<00:03:38.209> you're

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
as just a lateral move and you're

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.399 
as just a lateral move and you're
getting<00:03:39.349> you<00:03:39.590> know<00:03:39.620> cosmetic<00:03:40.280> features<00:03:41.409> the

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
getting you know cosmetic features the

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.080 
getting you know cosmetic features the
only<00:03:42.680> real<00:03:42.889> upgrade<00:03:43.310> would<00:03:43.459> be<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:44.000> know

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
only real upgrade would be you know

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.099 
only real upgrade would be you know
maybe<00:03:44.449> the<00:03:44.659> sound<00:03:44.870> quality<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.560> think<00:03:46.449> um<00:03:47.449> again

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
maybe the sound quality I think um again

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
lot of cosmetic changes and I think that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.790 
lot of cosmetic changes and I think that
it<00:04:28.160> sounds<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.490> little<00:04:28.699> bit<00:04:28.820> better<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:30.470> the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
it sounds a little bit better the the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.710 
it sounds a little bit better the the
charge<00:04:31.070> cable<00:04:31.400> or<00:04:31.699> whatnot<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.540> power

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
charge cable or whatnot the the power

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.540 
charge cable or whatnot the the power
cable<00:04:33.169> changing<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.830> don't<00:04:34.250> know<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.430> that

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
cable changing I don't know that that

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.890 
cable changing I don't know that that
really<00:04:34.729> changes<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.210> whole<00:04:35.389> lot<00:04:35.540> because<00:04:35.750> the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
really changes a whole lot because the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.659 
really changes a whole lot because the
sound<00:04:36.139> you<00:04:36.500> know<00:04:36.530> that's<00:04:36.770> just<00:04:36.860> power<00:04:37.160> you
