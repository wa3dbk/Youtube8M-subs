00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
of the beauties of the ingredients that

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.570 
of the beauties of the ingredients that
we're<00:02:22.930> using<00:02:23.080> here<00:02:23.320> today<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.370> gonna

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
we're using here today is it's not gonna

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.400 
we're using here today is it's not gonna
create<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.060> insulin<00:02:25.570> spike<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.230> you'll

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
create that insulin spike that you'll

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.830 
create that insulin spike that you'll
have<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.890> use<00:02:27.160> flour<00:02:27.580> or<00:02:28.030> whole<00:02:28.060> grain<00:02:28.600> so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
have it use flour or whole grain so

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.330 
have it use flour or whole grain so
that's<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.080> whole<00:02:29.320> key<00:02:29.560> about<00:02:29.860> maintaining

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
that's the whole key about maintaining

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.740 
that's the whole key about maintaining
your<00:02:30.400> blood<00:02:30.610> sugar<00:02:30.850> at<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> stable<00:02:31.300> level

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
your blood sugar at a stable level

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.170 
your blood sugar at a stable level
because<00:02:32.290> when<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.620> eat<00:02:33.100> whole<00:02:33.400> grains<00:02:33.700> your

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
because when you eat whole grains your

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.060 
because when you eat whole grains your
blood<00:02:34.420> sugar<00:02:34.660> goes<00:02:34.840> up<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.380> insulin<00:02:35.710> comes<00:02:35.920> in

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
blood sugar goes up the insulin comes in

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.860 
blood sugar goes up the insulin comes in
removes<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.610> sugar<00:02:36.910> from<00:02:37.150> your<00:02:37.210> blood<00:02:37.570> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
removes that sugar from your blood and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.870 
removes that sugar from your blood and
then<00:02:38.170> your<00:02:38.320> blood<00:02:38.500> sugar<00:02:38.890> levels<00:02:39.220> crash<00:02:39.550> again

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
then your blood sugar levels crash again

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.600 
then your blood sugar levels crash again
causes<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.990> have<00:02:41.140> more<00:02:41.530> hunger<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.460> that's

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
causes you to have more hunger so that's

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.010 
causes you to have more hunger so that's
why<00:02:42.730> it's<00:02:42.880> important<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.420> cook<00:02:43.630> with

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
why it's important to cook with

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.390 
why it's important to cook with
ingredients<00:02:44.200> we<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.710> right<00:02:44.860> here<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.190> use<00:02:45.310> an
