if<00:00:00.450> you<00:00:01.260> have<00:00:01.500> one<00:00:01.709> of<00:00:01.800> these<00:00:01.920> CPUs<00:00:02.550> where<00:00:03.389> the

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
if you have one of these CPUs where the

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.690 
if you have one of these CPUs where the
processor<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:06.410> glued<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.040> heatsink

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
processor is glued on to the heatsink

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240 
processor is glued on to the heatsink
and<00:00:09.050> it<00:00:10.050> doesn't<00:00:10.380> seem<00:00:10.559> like<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.980> can<00:00:11.130> be

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
and it doesn't seem like it can be

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.700 
and it doesn't seem like it can be
removed<00:00:11.639> there's<00:00:12.630> actually<00:00:13.049> an<00:00:13.170> easy<00:00:13.380> way<00:00:13.679> to

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
removed there's actually an easy way to

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.060 
removed there's actually an easy way to
remove<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:15.080> now<00:00:16.080> needless<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.710> say<00:00:16.740> I've

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
remove it now needless to say I've

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.210 
remove it now needless to say I've
already<00:00:17.310> removed<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:20.010> can

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
already removed this one and you can

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.170 
already removed this one and you can
clearly<00:00:20.490> see<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.109> adhesive<00:00:22.109> type

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
clearly see all the adhesive type

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.179 
clearly see all the adhesive type
material<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.330> was<00:00:24.510> fusing<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
material that was fusing it on to the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.780 
material that was fusing it on to the
heatsink<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:27.500> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> intel<00:00:29.869> celeron

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
heatsink here this is a intel celeron

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.430 
heatsink here this is a intel celeron
chip<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.570> came<00:00:33.989> out<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> an<00:00:34.469> own<00:00:35.480> IBM<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
chip that came out of an own IBM that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.000 
chip that came out of an own IBM that
had<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> bad<00:00:38.250> motherboard<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:41.210> what<00:00:42.210> i<00:00:42.239> did<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:43.010> i

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
had a bad motherboard so what i did is i

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.580 
had a bad motherboard so what i did is i
junked<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.969> entire<00:00:45.300> machine<00:00:45.750> i<00:00:45.780> scrapped<00:00:46.320> for

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
junked the entire machine i scrapped for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.920 
junked the entire machine i scrapped for
parts<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.160> obviously<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> parts<00:00:48.809> i

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
parts and obviously one of the parts i

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.029 
parts and obviously one of the parts i
saved<00:00:49.399> was<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> cpu<00:00:52.190> now<00:00:53.570> in<00:00:54.570> order<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> remove

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
saved was the cpu now in order to remove

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.510 
saved was the cpu now in order to remove
this<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.270> heat<00:00:57.390> sink<00:00:58.129> what<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
this from the heat sink what you want to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.350 
this from the heat sink what you want to
do<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.850> soak<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:02.149> rubbing<00:01:03.149> alcohol

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.929 

they<00:01:06.840> say<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.590> best<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.220> ninety<00:01:08.820> or

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
they say it's it's best to use ninety or

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.350 
they say it's it's best to use ninety or
ninety-five<00:01:09.299> percent<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.310> 70%<00:01:11.310> works<00:01:12.030> just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
ninety-five percent but 70% works just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.350 
ninety-five percent but 70% works just
fine<00:01:13.040> you<00:01:14.040> might<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.490> might<00:01:14.820> take<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> little

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
fine you might it might take a little

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.179 
fine you might it might take a little
longer<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.380> soak<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.460> say<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:18.799> 7<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.009> 10

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
longer to soak I would say about 7 to 10

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.710 
longer to soak I would say about 7 to 10
minutes<00:01:20.990> soaking<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> alcohol<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
minutes soaking in the alcohol so and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
minutes soaking in the alcohol so and
then<00:01:27.720> after<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.560> after<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.610> were

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
then after you do that after you were

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.469 
then after you do that after you were
after<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.170> soak<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.729> you<00:01:32.729> take<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> piece<00:01:33.299> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
after you soak it you take a piece of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.630 
after you soak it you take a piece of
dental<00:01:33.659> floss<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.750> literally<00:01:37.079> just

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
dental floss here and you literally just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.830 
dental floss here and you literally just
floss<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.939> CPU<00:01:41.390> obviously<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> be

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
floss the CPU obviously you got to be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.460 
floss the CPU obviously you got to be
careful<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:44.399> bend<00:01:44.700> any<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> pins<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
careful not to bend any of the pins that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.130 
careful not to bend any of the pins that
actually<00:01:46.890> happened<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> me<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:48.450> another

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
actually happened to me but another

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.039 
actually happened to me but another
trick<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> found<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:51.570> only<00:01:51.720> pins

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
trick that I found was the only pins

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.240 
trick that I found was the only pins
that<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.439> bent<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:53.250> case<00:01:53.930> were<00:01:54.930> ones<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that got bent in my case were ones that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
that got bent in my case were ones that
are<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.479> more<00:01:57.719> outer<00:01:57.990> portion<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.719> on

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
are on the more outer portion here on

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.010 
are on the more outer portion here on
the<00:02:01.110> very<00:02:01.500> outside<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> did<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.899> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the very outside so what I did is I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.760 
the very outside so what I did is I
actually<00:02:04.200> took<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> magnifying<00:02:05.340> glass<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
actually took a magnifying glass here I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.940 
actually took a magnifying glass here I
used<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> stronger<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.619> literally

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
used the stronger one and I literally

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.420 
used the stronger one and I literally
just<00:02:11.280> use<00:02:11.489> my<00:02:11.700> fingernail<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
just use my fingernail to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.500 
just use my fingernail to
riah<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.930> bend<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.290> back<00:02:16.470> into<00:02:16.680> shape<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.510> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
riah to bend it back into shape and it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.729 
riah to bend it back into shape and it
seems<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.080> fine<00:02:19.410> now

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
seems to be fine now

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.960 
seems to be fine now
I<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:22.680> haven't<00:02:22.980> tried<00:02:23.129> putting<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.640> back<00:02:23.760> in

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
I just haven't tried putting it back in

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.630 
I just haven't tried putting it back in
a<00:02:24.030> slot<00:02:24.360> yet<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.069> fits<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.519> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
a slot yet to see if it fits but it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.850 
a slot yet to see if it fits but it
looks<00:02:26.849> like<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.120> would<00:02:27.209> fit<00:02:27.269> fine<00:02:27.780> again<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
looks like it would fit fine again it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.309 
looks like it would fit fine again it
does<00:02:29.129> take<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.760> lot<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.360> patience<00:02:30.900> though<00:02:31.080> if

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
does take a lot of patience though if

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.620 
does take a lot of patience though if
you<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.709> attempt<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.130> doing<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:34.069> but

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
you have to attempt to doing that but

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.570 
you have to attempt to doing that but
once<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.780> soak<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> alcohol<00:02:37.860> for

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
once you soak it in the alcohol for

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.500 
once you soak it in the alcohol for
about<00:02:38.819> 10<00:02:39.090> minutes<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.900> should<00:02:40.790> should<00:02:41.790> might

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
about 10 minutes it should should might

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.210 
about 10 minutes it should should might
be<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.049> might<00:02:43.080> be<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.410> little<00:02:43.590> hard<00:02:43.890> at<00:02:44.040> first

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
be it might be a little hard at first

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.479 
be it might be a little hard at first
but<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.610> should<00:02:45.060> eventually<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:46.250> pop<00:02:47.250> right

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
but it should eventually just pop right

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.650 
but it should eventually just pop right
off<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.780> heatsink<00:02:49.849> from<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:51.030> glue

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
off of the heatsink from that glue

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.839 
off of the heatsink from that glue
that's<00:02:51.900> holding<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.380> up<00:02:52.530> well<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:53.640> not

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
that's holding it up well it's not

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.000 
that's holding it up well it's not
really<00:02:54.180> glue<00:02:54.360> it's<00:02:54.660> more<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.079> thermal

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
really glue it's more of a thermal

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.490 
really glue it's more of a thermal
adhesive<00:02:56.250> type<00:02:57.209> material<00:02:58.819> but<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:01.349> other

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
adhesive type material but and the other

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.970 
adhesive type material but and the other
tricky<00:03:01.920> part<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.540> more<00:03:03.840> that's<00:03:04.680> on

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
tricky part is you have more that's on

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.569 
tricky part is you have more that's on
the<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:07.140> chip<00:03:07.440> here<00:03:07.739> on<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.519> top<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:10.579> I'm

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
the the chip here on the top so I'm

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.809 
the the chip here on the top so I'm
trying<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.090> get<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.360> off<00:03:12.510> now<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.489> soaking

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
trying to get it off now so I'm soaking

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.420 
trying to get it off now so I'm soaking
it<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.150> some<00:03:15.599> more<00:03:15.780> alcohol<00:03:16.290> here<00:03:16.590> some<00:03:17.220> paper

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it in some more alcohol here some paper

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.710 
it in some more alcohol here some paper
towels<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:19.650> should<00:03:19.829> eventually<00:03:20.100> all<00:03:20.880> come

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
towels so it should eventually all come

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.000 
towels so it should eventually all come
off<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.170> should<00:03:22.350> be<00:03:22.410> able<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> scrape<00:03:22.950> it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
off and I should be able to scrape it

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.069 
off and I should be able to scrape it
off<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.489> not<00:03:24.299> another<00:03:24.630> thing<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.930> could

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
off if not another thing you could

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.539 
off if not another thing you could
probably<00:03:25.260> do<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.709> freeze<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:27.109> then<00:03:28.549> scrape

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
probably do is freeze it and then scrape

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.120 
probably do is freeze it and then scrape
it<00:03:29.760> off<00:03:29.989> probably<00:03:30.989> come<00:03:31.230> off<00:03:31.380> easier<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.950> way

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
it off probably come off easier that way

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.970 
it off probably come off easier that way
but<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:33.450> could<00:03:33.630> also<00:03:34.079> use<00:03:34.290> rubbing<00:03:35.160> alcohol

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
but you could also use rubbing alcohol

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.020 
but you could also use rubbing alcohol
so<00:03:38.480> that's<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.400> little<00:03:41.549> trick<00:03:41.819> I

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
so that's just a little trick I

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.030 
so that's just a little trick I
discovered<00:03:42.510> on<00:03:42.660> how<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.290> remove<00:03:43.590> one<00:03:43.859> of<00:03:43.889> these

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
discovered on how to remove one of these

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.040 
discovered on how to remove one of these
chips<00:03:44.450> from<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.569> heatsink<00:03:45.959> that's<00:03:46.260> fused<00:03:46.829> on
