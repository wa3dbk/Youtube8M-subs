strong under lots of conditions even on
the<00:01:16.920> offroad<00:01:17.310> let's<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> road<00:01:18.420> test

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.789 

it<00:01:22.240> really<00:01:22.420> performs<00:01:22.900> really<00:01:23.140> well<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.770> a

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
it really performs really well it is a

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.120 
it really performs really well it is a
hardtail<00:01:24.369> with<00:01:25.119> that<00:01:25.270> front<00:01:25.570> shock<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
hardtail with that front shock that

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.460 
hardtail with that front shock that
blood<00:01:27.430> shock<00:01:27.700> I<00:01:27.729> think<00:01:28.119> air<00:01:28.479> compression<00:01:28.930> and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
blood shock I think air compression and

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.950 
blood shock I think air compression and
so<00:01:30.159> it<00:01:30.280> just<00:01:30.310> performed<00:01:31.240> really<00:01:31.420> well

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
so it just performed really well

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.570 
so it just performed really well
it's<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:33.600> xcm<00:01:34.600> shock

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
it's a xcm shock

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.630 
it's a xcm shock
we<00:01:36.580> got<00:01:36.790> a<00:01:36.869> mechanical<00:01:37.869> disc<00:01:38.110> brakes<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.520> we're

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
we got a mechanical disc brakes so we're

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
that lasts which is great because that's

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.160 
that lasts which is great because that's
