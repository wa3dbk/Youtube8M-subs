00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.090
 good friends for youtube this today 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.639
 we are looking to repair the air 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:15.849
 hot air conditioning 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.849
 hot from a 2002 by explore this 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.560
 I finally found the part that is 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.730
 damaged that is this that we see here 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.500
 these 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.500
 has the function of opening and closing 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:37.570
 the door for air and cold hot air 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:41.620
 and cold this but it seems that already the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.860
 well dam replaced because this 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.860
 type of black color only sell it 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 auto parts 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.379
 I had to 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.750
 and order another part 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.739
 that is what is the original is the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.739
 I had to buy in four 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:11.510
 in science if you look at the difference 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:14.570
 between the end of this is like a p 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.470
 and without looking at the difference of this one that is 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.500
 square this was a replacement so it has 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.330
 to go as a type p 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.240
 so they do not waste their money 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.150
 buy a part of the car are and a 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.690
 part of the east 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.520
 from the agency then the agency comes 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.780
 happening like 80 dollars 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.869
 this car part 50 but then 50 80 and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.680
 something that is going to serve you and something that is 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.250
 better 80 than not 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.580
 this part is located below the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.050
 pedal 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.700
 the one on the pedal side 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.610
 here on our part 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.840
 yes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.840
 here where it says look 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.050
 here here goes a screw and below 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.480
 is the other 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.480
 below it has three screws 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.280
 It takes three screws only have 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.940
 to remove the lid of where they are 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.540
 under the wheel and to be 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:34.510
 make it a little comfortable to work I remove the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.510
 driver's seat as if they see it 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.800
 the part where one rests the arm 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.840
 carries 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.980
 four screws up here is and is 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.830
 easy to remove is not much logic has 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.100
 that remove one first this 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.830
 and then the part where it is the 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.590
 ashtray or where they go from there 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.160
 where they have the glasses you have to remove 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.950
 this is not necessary to disconnect what is 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.370
 the molding of the air conditioning as 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.500
 you do not need to connect it and the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.480
 You can take it from this side 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.290
 from here you can work is a little 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.290
 uncomfortable but you can get it out 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.310
 I put myself 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.600
 how are we going to try to put it and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.600
 synchronize everything well 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.519
 If you work hopefully yes yes no 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.690
 We lost a little time but I'm 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.730
 sure is that 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.730
 I'm sure good friends
