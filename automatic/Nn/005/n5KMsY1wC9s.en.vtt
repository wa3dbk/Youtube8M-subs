unfortunately<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:08.110> easy<00:01:08.320> answer<00:01:08.950> isn't<00:01:09.159> just

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
unfortunately the easy answer isn't just

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.160 
unfortunately the easy answer isn't just
set<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.119> buffer<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:10.780> lowest<00:01:11.110> setting

because if you do that you're going to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
your particular interface and that's a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.390 
your particular interface and that's a
shame<00:03:40.000> but<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.600> happens<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.620> then<00:03:42.190> there's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
shame but it happens and then there's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160 
shame but it happens and then there's
just<00:03:42.459> programs<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.330> no<00:03:43.720> matter<00:03:43.900> what

that's<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:47.770> reason<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.220> use<00:03:48.489> Reaper<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.720> my

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
that's one reason I use Reaper for my

that's one reason I use Reaper for my
doll<00:03:50.200> because<00:03:50.920> with<00:03:51.760> every<00:03:52.180> interface<00:03:52.450> I've

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
doll because with every interface I've

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.810 
doll because with every interface I've
thrown<00:03:53.290> at<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.860> doesn't<00:03:54.400> have<00:03:54.640> many

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
thrown at it it doesn't have many

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.229 
thrown at it it doesn't have many
problems<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.690> pretty<00:03:56.320> much<00:03:56.500> works<00:03:57.340> what<00:03:58.150> I'm

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
problems it pretty much works what I'm

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.479 
problems it pretty much works what I'm
trying<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.510> say<00:03:58.750> is<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.140> you've<00:03:59.470> tried<00:03:59.860> all<00:04:00.220> the

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
trying to say is if you've tried all the

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.820 
trying to say is if you've tried all the
tips<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:01.000> I've<00:04:01.120> said<00:04:01.630> during<00:04:02.260> this<00:04:02.530> video

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830

bound to show up the goal is to be able
to<00:04:36.370> record<00:04:36.730> without<00:04:37.630> any<00:04:37.900> audible<00:04:38.530> clicks<00:04:38.920> you

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
to record without any audible clicks you

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.070 
to record without any audible clicks you
don't<00:04:39.310> want<00:04:39.550> clicks<00:04:39.880> in<00:04:40.210> your<00:04:40.270> recordings

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
don't want clicks in your recordings

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.890 
don't want clicks in your recordings
that's<00:04:41.380> ridiculous<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.630> another<00:04:43.630> thing<00:04:43.810> you

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
that's ridiculous and another thing you

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.500 
that's ridiculous and another thing you
can<00:04:43.990> try<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:45.160> recommend<00:04:45.910> recording<00:04:46.420> at

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
can try is I recommend recording at

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.900 
can try is I recommend recording at
higher<00:04:46.750> sampling<00:04:47.440> rates<00:04:47.710> but<00:04:48.460> if<00:04:48.730> your

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
higher sampling rates but if your

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.830 
higher sampling rates but if your
computer<00:04:49.030> can<00:04:49.600> handle<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.140> then<00:04:50.970> 441<00:04:51.970> or<00:04:52.300> 48

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
computer can handle it then 441 or 48

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.840 
computer can handle it then 441 or 48

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
kilohertz you might have to go that

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.480 
kilohertz you might have to go that
route<00:04:55.170> unfortunately<00:04:56.170> if<00:04:56.350> you're<00:04:57.040> on<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.220> tight

there<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:10.870> hope<00:05:11.290> there's<00:05:12.040> a<00:05:12.130> program<00:05:12.430> called

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
there is hope there's a program called

there is hope there's a program called
ASIO<00:05:14.050> for<00:05:14.710> all<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:15.700> will<00:05:15.880> allow<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.720> take

ASIO for all that will allow you to take

the ASIO

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.880 
the ASIO

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
is in the video description so far we've

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.640 
is in the video description so far we've
covered<00:05:27.250> buffer<00:05:28.240> settings<00:05:28.720> while<00:05:28.990> recording

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
covered buffer settings while recording

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.340 
covered buffer settings while recording
but<00:05:30.400> for<00:05:30.670> mixing<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.090> mastering<00:05:31.270> just<00:05:32.230> go

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
but for mixing and mastering just go

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.020 
but for mixing and mastering just go
ahead<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:32.740> set<00:05:32.919> that<00:05:32.950> buffer<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.669> a<00:05:33.700> really

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
ahead and set that buffer to a really

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.480 
ahead and set that buffer to a really
high<00:05:34.180> setting<00:05:34.660> because<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:36.010> know<00:05:36.130> a<00:05:36.160> little

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
high setting because you know a little

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.220 
high setting because you know a little
lag<00:05:36.700> and<00:05:36.940> playback<00:05:37.330> isn't<00:05:37.840> really<00:05:38.020> an<00:05:38.140> issue

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
lag and playback isn't really an issue

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.580 
lag and playback isn't really an issue
and<00:05:39.330> once<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.419> start<00:05:40.720> adding<00:05:40.930> a<00:05:41.290> lot<00:05:41.470> of

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
and once you start adding a lot of

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.460 
and once you start adding a lot of
plugins<00:05:42.360> your<00:05:43.360> playback<00:05:43.840> will<00:05:44.140> start

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
plugins your playback will start

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.260 
plugins your playback will start
clicking<00:05:44.800> it'll<00:05:45.400> become<00:05:45.550> annoying

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
clicking it'll become annoying

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.630 
clicking it'll become annoying
it<00:05:46.419> might<00:05:46.660> even<00:05:46.690> crash<00:05:47.320> so<00:05:48.040> just<00:05:48.250> set<00:05:48.460> that

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
it might even crash so just set that

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.210 
it might even crash so just set that
buffer<00:05:49.030> high<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.540> you'll<00:05:50.020> be<00:05:50.140> good<00:05:50.350> this<00:05:51.070> has

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
buffer high and you'll be good this has

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.260 
buffer high and you'll be good this has
been<00:05:51.430> Adam<00:05:51.760> for<00:05:52.000> real<00:05:52.180> I'm<00:05:52.300> recording<00:05:52.810> calm
