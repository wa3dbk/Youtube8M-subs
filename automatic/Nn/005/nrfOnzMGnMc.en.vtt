welcome back to another FIFA 15 tutorial
I'm<00:00:05.819> gonna<00:00:06.150> show<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.540> guys<00:00:06.660> two<00:00:07.170> ways<00:00:07.319> of

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
I'm gonna show you guys two ways of

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.980 
I'm gonna show you guys two ways of
defending<00:00:08.130> free<00:00:08.610> kicks<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.420> all<00:00:09.570> know<00:00:09.750> that

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
defending free kicks we all know that

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.290 
defending free kicks we all know that
jumping<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.130> wall<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.670> not<00:00:12.000> always

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
jumping with the wall is not always

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.410 
jumping with the wall is not always
helpful<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.440> mostly<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.400> useless<00:00:14.790> if<00:00:15.150> your

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
helpful and mostly it's useless if your

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.290 
helpful and mostly it's useless if your
opponent<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.109> using<00:00:16.529> curl<00:00:16.800> free<00:00:17.190> kicks<00:00:17.520> that's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
opponent is using curl free kicks that's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.630 
opponent is using curl free kicks that's
why<00:00:18.510> I'm<00:00:18.779> gonna<00:00:19.080> cover<00:00:19.410> two<00:00:19.830> great<00:00:20.130> techniques

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
why I'm gonna cover two great techniques

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.910 
why I'm gonna cover two great techniques
that<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.390> using<00:00:21.600> while<00:00:22.020> defending<00:00:22.470> free

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
that I'm using while defending free

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
that I'm using while defending free
kicks<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.789> first<00:00:24.090> technique<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.570> by<00:00:24.779> using

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
kicks the first technique is by using

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.380 
kicks the first technique is by using
the<00:00:25.289> right<00:00:25.439> analog<00:00:25.890> method<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:27.000> switching

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the right analog method for switching

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750 
the right analog method for switching
players<00:00:27.840> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.650> haven't<00:00:29.070> mastered<00:00:29.279> this

players if you haven't mastered this

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.669 
players if you haven't mastered this
technique<00:00:30.210> yet<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.779> should<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:31.199> check<00:00:31.230> my

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
players using the right analog so when

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.260 
players using the right analog so when
your<00:00:37.350> opponent<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> free<00:00:38.399> kick<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:39.030> you

select a player around the wall and then
to<00:00:45.090> drag<00:00:45.450> him<00:00:45.719> back<00:00:45.899> towards<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.860> goal<00:00:47.070> line

to drag him back towards the goal line

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.209 
to drag him back towards the goal line
in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.059> empty<00:00:48.480> side<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.200> net<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.890> will

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
in the empty side of the net it will

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.160 
in the empty side of the net it will
surely<00:00:50.520> increase<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:51.210> chance<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.809> saving

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

free<00:00:52.620> kicks<00:00:52.920> especially<00:00:53.879> when<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.300> opponent

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
free kicks especially when your opponent

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.439 
free kicks especially when your opponent
is<00:00:55.079> using<00:00:55.590> kuroh<00:00:55.890> technique<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.699> scoring<00:00:57.239> kit

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
is using kuroh technique for scoring kit

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
is using kuroh technique for scoring kit
because<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.949> easy<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.760> curve<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
because it's so so easy to curve the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
because it's so so easy to curve the
ball<00:01:00.539> around<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.350> wall<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.010> second

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
ball around the wall the second

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
ball around the wall the second
technique<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> bit<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:03.570> different<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
technique is a bit more different and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
technique is a bit more different and
actually<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> haven't<00:01:05.220> played<00:01:05.580> too<00:01:05.880> many

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
actually I haven't played too many

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.660 
actually I haven't played too many
people<00:01:06.689> who<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.140> using<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:08.040> free<00:01:08.340> kicks

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
people who are using it at free kicks

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
people who are using it at free kicks
we're<00:01:09.210> gonna<00:01:09.479> use<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> left<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.290> right

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
we're gonna use the left and right

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.070 
we're gonna use the left and right
triggers<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:12.030> opponent<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> free

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
kick you can move the wall to the right

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
kick you can move the wall to the right
unless<00:01:15.330> using<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.320> triggers<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.920> your

automatically move towards the other
side<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.890> order<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.490> cover<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.150> free<00:01:27.390> side<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
side in order to cover the free side of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
side in order to cover the free side of
the<00:01:28.170> net<00:01:28.350> by<00:01:28.680> holding<00:01:29.220> down<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.430> left<00:01:29.670> trigger

the net by holding down the left trigger

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.120 
the net by holding down the left trigger
you<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:30.659> move<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> wall<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you will move the wall to the right and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429 
you will move the wall to the right and
by<00:01:32.490> holding<00:01:32.759> down<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.540> trigger<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
by holding down the right trigger you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
by holding down the right trigger you
will<00:01:34.619> move<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.070> wall<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> left<00:01:35.640> each<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
will move the wall to the left each of

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.170 
will move the wall to the left each of
the<00:01:36.960> two<00:01:37.140> techniques<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.799> effective<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the two techniques is effective and I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
the two techniques is effective and I
personally<00:01:39.930> prefer<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.380> use<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> first

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
personally prefer to use the first
