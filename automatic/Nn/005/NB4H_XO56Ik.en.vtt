some<00:01:38.220> other<00:01:38.250> things<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.299> you'll

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
some other things and I think you'll

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
some other things and I think you'll
find<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.990> most<00:01:40.290> nail<00:01:40.619> polish<00:01:41.040> colors<00:01:41.460> are

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
find that most nail polish colors are

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.149 
find that most nail polish colors are
fairly<00:01:42.360> versatile<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.710> too<00:01:43.890> many<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
fairly versatile I'm not too many of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
fairly versatile I'm not too many of
them<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.460> restrictive<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.509> extreme

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
them are restrictive the more extreme

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.749 
them are restrictive the more extreme
colors<00:01:46.590> don't<00:01:46.829> go<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.189> everything<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.610> mean

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
colors don't go with everything I mean

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.609 
colors don't go with everything I mean
