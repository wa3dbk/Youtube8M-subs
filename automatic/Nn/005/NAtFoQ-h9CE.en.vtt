00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.790 

we<00:00:38.610> went<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.970> yard<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.739> started<00:00:40.739> looking

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
we went out the yard and started looking

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.530 
we went out the yard and started looking
around<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.460> different<00:00:41.489> hydraulic<00:00:42.210> systems

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
around at different hydraulic systems

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.030 
around at different hydraulic systems
and<00:00:42.690> stuff<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.900> have<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> yard<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.949> we

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and stuff we have in the yard and we

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.130 
and stuff we have in the yard and we
realize<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.820> lift<00:00:45.059> gate<00:00:45.120> does<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.900> same

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
realize that a lift gate does this same

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.860 
realize that a lift gate does this same
function<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:47.730> moves<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.239> two<00:00:48.360> directions<00:00:48.510> oh

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
function it moves in two directions oh

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.390 
function it moves in two directions oh
if<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> does<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.680> down<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
if it does the up and down and then it

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.759 
if it does the up and down and then it
goes<00:00:50.519> to<00:00:50.550> fold<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.210> 90<00:00:51.510> degrees<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:52.260> well

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
goes to fold up at 90 degrees right well

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:53.990 
goes to fold up at 90 degrees right well
we<00:00:52.890> don't<00:00:53.010> need<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.519> just<00:00:53.699> need<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> up

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
we don't need that we just need the up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.490 
we don't need that we just need the up
and<00:00:54.150> down<00:00:54.269> we<00:00:54.720> just<00:00:54.750> need<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.470> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and down we just need the up and out so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.829 
and down we just need the up and out so
yeah<00:00:56.040> so<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.150> have<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.480> figured

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
yeah so now that we have this figured

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:58.250 
yeah so now that we have this figured
out

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
out

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
Delta support the scissor lift that's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.639 
Delta support the scissor lift that's
going<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.860> lift<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:39.140> tonneau<00:01:40.140> cover<00:01:40.380> and

down there was someone make a letter
wrinkles<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> design<00:01:58.739> damage<00:01:59.429> did<00:01:59.580> they<00:01:59.700> never

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
wrinkles in design damage did they never

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.100 
wrinkles in design damage did they never
fit<00:02:00.470> yeah

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
fit yeah

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.199 
fit yeah
but<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> running<00:02:04.920> board<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.910> lot<00:02:06.090> of

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
project so this looks like it's leopard

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.390 
project so this looks like it's leopard
skin<00:04:45.910> now<00:04:46.090> yeah<00:04:46.830> we<00:04:47.830> should<00:04:48.010> leave<00:04:48.160> it<00:04:48.280> like
