3.2<00:00:22.119> one<00:00:22.599> of<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.840> newest<00:00:23.170> things<00:00:23.380> we<00:00:23.529> have<00:00:23.740> out

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
3.2 one of the newest things we have out

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.900 
3.2 one of the newest things we have out
is<00:00:24.189> the<00:00:24.340> variable<00:00:24.670> cam<00:00:25.029> timing<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.670> is<00:00:27.880> a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
is the variable cam timing this is a

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.509 
is the variable cam timing this is a
camshaft<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:29.500> can<00:00:29.710> see<00:00:29.919> here<00:00:30.160> it's<00:00:30.310> not

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
camshaft and you can see here it's not

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.310 
camshaft and you can see here it's not
only<00:00:30.669> just<00:00:30.820> variable<00:00:31.480> cam<00:00:31.660> timing<00:00:31.689> but<00:00:32.259> it's

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
only just variable cam timing but it's

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.550 
only just variable cam timing but it's
also<00:00:32.650> variable<00:00:33.610> lift<00:00:34.060> you<00:00:34.990> can<00:00:35.170> see<00:00:35.350> here

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
also variable lift you can see here

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.010 
also variable lift you can see here
there<00:00:35.710> are<00:00:35.890> two<00:00:36.039> different<00:00:36.430> profiles<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:37.180> cam

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
there are two different profiles of cam

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.540 
there are two different profiles of cam
lobes<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.059> start<00:00:40.360> out<00:00:40.570> from<00:00:41.050> idle<00:00:41.410> up<00:00:42.309> to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
lobes when you start out from idle up to

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.150 
lobes when you start out from idle up to
about<00:00:42.699> 4,000<00:00:43.329> rpm<00:00:43.719> it's<00:00:44.320> on<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.559> small<00:00:44.949> lobe

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
about 4,000 rpm it's on a small lobe

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.279 
about 4,000 rpm it's on a small lobe
once<00:00:45.910> you<00:00:46.000> go<00:00:46.120> over<00:00:46.149> four<00:00:46.510> thousand<00:00:46.899> rpms

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
once you go over four thousand rpms

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.650 
once you go over four thousand rpms
switches<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:47.980> larger<00:00:48.430> lobe<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:49.300> larger

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
switches to the larger lobe the larger

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.970 
switches to the larger lobe the larger
low<00:00:49.809> more<00:00:50.230> duration<00:00:50.770> or<00:00:50.920> air<00:00:51.850> more<00:00:52.390> power<00:00:52.989> at

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
low more duration or air more power at

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.910 
low more duration or air more power at
top<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:54.699> so<00:00:55.539> and<00:00:55.930> then<00:00:56.109> when<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.410> come<00:00:56.530> back<00:00:56.710> to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
top in so and then when you come back to

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.680 
top in so and then when you come back to
idle<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.910> have<00:00:59.160> smaller<00:01:00.160> lobe<00:01:00.430> less<00:01:01.149> duration

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
idle you have smaller lobe less duration

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.100 
idle you have smaller lobe less duration
for<00:01:01.989> better<00:01:02.199> idle<00:01:02.829> characters<00:01:03.280> down<00:01:04.210> so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
for better idle characters down so

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.840 
for better idle characters down so
there's<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.650> technology<00:01:06.310> shirt<00:01:06.520> on<00:01:06.700> any

torque<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:30.009> here<00:01:30.790> another<00:01:31.030> feature<00:01:31.329> of<00:01:31.509> this

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
torque so here another feature of this

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
torque so here another feature of this
camshaft<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.399> lobes<00:01:33.640> are<00:01:33.939> staggered

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
camshaft is that the lobes are staggered

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.050 
camshaft is that the lobes are staggered
they're<00:01:35.740> not<00:01:35.920> exactly<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.790> same<00:01:37.000> location

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
they're not exactly in the same location

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.600 
they're not exactly in the same location
you<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:37.960> see<00:01:38.140> here<00:01:38.380> one<00:01:38.649> starts<00:01:39.040> here<00:01:39.250> one

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
you can see here one starts here one

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.060 
you can see here one starts here one
starts<00:01:39.939> over<00:01:40.210> here<00:01:40.420> one<00:01:41.079> is<00:01:41.259> actually<00:01:41.770> larger

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
starts over here one is actually larger

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.880 
starts over here one is actually larger
than<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.700> other<00:01:42.850> by<00:01:43.840> doing<00:01:44.320> this<00:01:44.350> they're

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
than the other by doing this they're

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.060 
than the other by doing this they're
actually<00:01:45.340> able<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.820> start<00:01:46.210> this<00:01:47.070> tumble

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
actually able to start this tumble

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.609 
actually able to start this tumble
effect<00:01:48.399> they<00:01:48.579> call<00:01:48.790> that<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:49.600> know<00:01:49.630> on

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
effect they call that you know on

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.130 
effect they call that you know on
previous<00:01:51.040> engines<00:01:51.399> there<00:01:51.549> was<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.729> intake<00:01:52.299> flap

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
previous engines there was a intake flap

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.709 
previous engines there was a intake flap
that<00:01:53.439> created<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.219> tumble<00:01:54.610> now<00:01:55.149> they<00:01:55.420> can<00:01:55.600> do

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
that created the tumble now they can do

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.749 
that created the tumble now they can do
it<00:01:55.810> with<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.049> camshaft<00:01:56.649> so<00:01:57.219> this<00:01:57.399> gets<00:01:57.610> the

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
it with the camshaft so this gets the

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.149 
it with the camshaft so this gets the
air<00:01:58.119> stirred<00:01:58.630> up<00:01:58.899> as<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.500> being<00:01:59.740> drawn<00:02:00.130> into

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
air stirred up as it's being drawn into

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.200 
air stirred up as it's being drawn into
the<00:02:00.670> engine<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.210> when<00:02:01.750> they<00:02:01.899> inject<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.590> fuel

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the engine and when they inject the fuel

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.060 
the engine and when they inject the fuel
it<00:02:04.210> actually<00:02:04.479> starts<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.229> mix<00:02:05.439> with<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.740> fuel

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
it actually starts to mix with the fuel

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.820 
it actually starts to mix with the fuel
and<00:02:06.280> air<00:02:06.430> it's<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.329> really<00:02:07.600> good<00:02:07.780> Adam<00:02:08.530> ization

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
and air it's a really good Adam ization

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.820 
and air it's a really good Adam ization
so<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.700> have<00:02:09.940> lower<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.500> have<00:02:11.620> lower

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
so you have lower you have lower

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.580 
so you have lower you have lower
emissions<00:02:12.120> better<00:02:13.120> combustion

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
emissions better combustion

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.500 
emissions better combustion
more<00:02:15.590> power<00:02:15.890> out<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.310> his<00:02:16.640> self<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.180> know<00:02:17.330> a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
more power out of his self you know a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.680 
more power out of his self you know a
lot<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.870> benefits<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.470> doing<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:19.010> oh<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:20.599> is

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
lot of benefits to doing that oh this is

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.140 
lot of benefits to doing that oh this is
Illinois<00:02:20.989> go<00:02:21.379> so<00:02:21.590> if<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.099> look<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.670> located

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
Illinois go so if you look it's located

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.140 
Illinois go so if you look it's located
right<00:02:23.420> here<00:02:23.540> yeah<00:02:24.230> okay<00:02:25.099> there<00:02:25.310> are<00:02:25.340> two<00:02:25.489> per

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
right here yeah okay there are two per

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.740 
right here yeah okay there are two per
cylinder<00:02:26.569> yeah<00:02:27.489> there's<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.640> track<00:02:28.940> here<00:02:29.390> that

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
cylinder yeah there's a track here that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.009 
cylinder yeah there's a track here that
this<00:02:29.959> solenoid<00:02:30.970> actually<00:02:31.970> goes<00:02:32.239> into<00:02:32.269> as<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
this solenoid actually goes into as the

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.740 
this solenoid actually goes into as the
camshaft<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.680> turning<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.880> can<00:02:35.090> see<00:02:35.390> there's

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
camshaft is turning you can see there's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.440 
camshaft is turning you can see there's
a<00:02:35.810> switchover<00:02:36.290> point<00:02:36.739> right<00:02:36.980> here<00:02:37.010> as<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
a switchover point right here as it

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.600 
a switchover point right here as it
switches<00:02:38.720> over<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.440> will<00:02:39.530> move<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.830> camshaft

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
switches over it will move the camshaft

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.289 
switches over it will move the camshaft
one<00:02:40.849> way<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:43.549> will<00:02:43.670> change<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.269> a

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
one way and then it will change it to a

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.900 
one way and then it will change it to a
different<00:02:44.660> lobe<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:46.280> other<00:02:46.430> side<00:02:46.700> it's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
different lobe on the other side it's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.789 
different lobe on the other side it's
the<00:02:47.000> same<00:02:47.239> exact<00:02:47.599> thing<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.200> all<00:02:48.380> they<00:02:48.530> have<00:02:48.560> to

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
the same exact thing so all they have to

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.789 
the same exact thing so all they have to
do<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.250> act<00:02:49.819> activate<00:02:50.540> actuate<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.260> other

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
do is act activate actuate the other

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.180 
do is act activate actuate the other
Silla<00:02:52.549> note<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.299> they'll<00:02:53.390> switch<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.810> back<00:02:54.190> so

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
Silla note and they'll switch it back so

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.819 
Silla note and they'll switch it back so
it's<00:02:55.430> just<00:02:55.640> two<00:02:56.180> solenoids<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:56.959> per

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
it's just two solenoids here per

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.630 
it's just two solenoids here per
cylinder

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.370 

tell<00:03:02.760> us<00:03:02.910> about<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.300> active<00:03:03.660> suspension<00:03:03.840> uh

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
tell us about the active suspension uh

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.070 
tell us about the active suspension uh
here's<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> silhouette<00:03:05.580> right<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
here's the silhouette right that on the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.620 
here's the silhouette right that on the
base<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.590> shock<00:03:07.800> hmm<00:03:08.310> there's<00:03:08.730> also<00:03:08.970> each

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
base of the shock hmm there's also each

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.449 
base of the shock hmm there's also each
corner<00:03:09.990> has<00:03:10.260> one<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:10.800> there's<00:03:11.069> also<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
corner has one right there's also a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.780 
corner has one right there's also a
level<00:03:11.880> sensor<00:03:12.300> here<00:03:12.569> that's<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.020> input<00:03:13.860> this

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
level sensor here that's the input this

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.880 
level sensor here that's the input this
is<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> potentiometer<00:03:15.750> that's<00:03:16.380> me<00:03:16.530> or<00:03:16.860> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
is like a potentiometer that's me or a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.050 
is like a potentiometer that's me or a
digital<00:03:17.370> encoder<00:03:17.760> yeah<00:03:19.310> we've<00:03:20.310> had<00:03:20.520> these<00:03:20.760> for

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
digital encoder yeah we've had these for

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.090 
digital encoder yeah we've had these for
a<00:03:21.120> number<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.660> years<00:03:21.750> with<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.410> active

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
a number of years with the active

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.000 
a number of years with the active
suspension<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.150> TT<00:03:24.810> vehicles<00:03:25.170> while

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
suspension with the TT vehicles while

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.449 
suspension with the TT vehicles while
the<00:03:26.130> Magnetic<00:03:26.670> also<00:03:27.030> has<00:03:27.240> it<00:03:27.680> laughing<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:28.860> Q

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
the Magnetic also has it laughing but Q

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.050 
the Magnetic also has it laughing but Q
sevens<00:03:29.850> with<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.230> right<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.560> 88<00:03:32.400> isn't<00:03:32.910> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
sevens with the right and 88 isn't it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.170 
sevens with the right and 88 isn't it
yeah<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.410> proven<00:03:34.590> part<00:03:35.070> two<00:03:35.880> proven

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
yeah so so it's a proven part two proven

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.140 
yeah so so it's a proven part two proven
part<00:03:36.450> yes<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.989> it's<00:03:37.980> been<00:03:38.250> yeah<00:03:38.670> we've<00:03:38.940> had

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
part yes and it's been yeah we've had

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.820 
part yes and it's been yeah we've had
these<00:03:39.330> for<00:03:39.540> quite<00:03:39.780> some<00:03:40.020> time<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.620> is

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
these for quite some time but this is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.190 
these for quite some time but this is
what<00:03:41.070> gives<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.550> feet<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.420> feedback<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
what gives the feet the feedback to the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.940 
what gives the feet the feedback to the
control<00:03:43.769> module<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:45.320> adjust<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.410> dampener

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
control module to adjust the dampener

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.300 
control module to adjust the dampener
here<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.900> on<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.080> real-time<00:03:49.380> basis<00:03:50.100> isn't

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
here and it's on a real-time basis isn't

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.740 
here and it's on a real-time basis isn't
it<00:03:50.519> because<00:03:50.790> it's<00:03:50.940> getting<00:03:51.180> direct<00:03:51.510> road

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
it because it's getting direct road

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.979 
it because it's getting direct road
input<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.830> gives<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.489> feedback<00:03:53.989> or

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
input so this gives the feedback or

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.020 
input so this gives the feedback or
collect<00:03:55.440> or<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.920> suspension<00:03:56.489> electrically

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
collect or the suspension electrically

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.690 
collect or the suspension electrically
shows<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.780> level<00:03:57.959> shows<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.920> level<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.459> then

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
shows the level shows the level and then

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.940 
shows the level shows the level and then
this<00:03:59.850> is<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.090> solenoid<00:04:00.750> here<00:04:01.230> which<00:04:01.800> is

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
this is the solenoid here which is

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.470 
this is the solenoid here which is
actually<00:04:02.160> controlling<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.970> damping<00:04:03.360> the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
actually controlling the damping the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.830 
actually controlling the damping the
mount<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.840> variable<00:04:04.230> damping<00:04:05.660> yeah<00:04:06.660> it's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
mount the variable damping yeah it's

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.729 
mount the variable damping yeah it's
pretty<00:04:07.019> simple<00:04:09.079> independently<00:04:10.079> controlled

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
pretty simple independently controlled

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.130 
pretty simple independently controlled
right<00:04:11.310> there's<00:04:11.640> also<00:04:12.060> when<00:04:12.360> we<00:04:12.480> go<00:04:12.600> law<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> all

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
right there's also when we go law to all

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.690 
right there's also when we go law to all
four<00:04:13.470> wheels<00:04:13.500> yeah<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:15.810> also<00:04:16.140> has<00:04:17.040> some<00:04:17.310> input

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
four wheels yeah it also has some input

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.150 
four wheels yeah it also has some input
to<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.540> canvas<00:04:18.780> which<00:04:19.320> also<00:04:19.620> gets

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
to the canvas which also gets

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.140 
to the canvas which also gets
information<00:04:20.519> from<00:04:21.120> ESP<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.229> abs<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.640> you<00:04:24.060> know

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
information from ESP and abs so you know

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.880 
information from ESP and abs so you know
depending<00:04:24.540> on<00:04:24.630> what<00:04:24.810> type<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:24.990> breaking<00:04:25.560> or<00:04:25.830> if

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
depending on what type of breaking or if

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.710 
depending on what type of breaking or if
you're<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.160> into<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.580> turn<00:04:26.880> or<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.600> know

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
you're going into a turn or you know

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.140 
you're going into a turn or you know
there's<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:29.160> will<00:04:29.370> also<00:04:29.550> control<00:04:30.120> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
there's a it will also control the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.680 
there's a it will also control the
dampening<00:04:31.520> for<00:04:32.520> handling<00:04:32.910> controls<00:04:33.390> as<00:04:33.600> well

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
dampening for handling controls as well

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.290 
dampening for handling controls as well
now<00:04:34.410> this<00:04:34.590> car<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.400> reason<00:04:35.700> for<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.090> is

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
now this car the reason for this is

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.890 
now this car the reason for this is
because<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.810> car<00:04:37.020> has<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.940> Audi<00:04:39.240> Drive

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
because this car has the the Audi Drive

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.680 
because this car has the the Audi Drive
select<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.370> drive<00:04:41.640> select<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.300> also

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
select and the drive select is also

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.990 
select and the drive select is also
programmable<00:04:43.490> depending<00:04:44.490> on<00:04:44.640> there's<00:04:44.850> an

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
programmable depending on there's an

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.050 
programmable depending on there's an
individual<00:04:46.160> setting<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.430> can<00:04:47.640> set<00:04:47.880> up

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
individual setting that you can set up

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.050 
individual setting that you can set up
and<00:04:48.270> usually<00:04:48.630> have<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> Modi<00:04:49.440> mm<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:50.060> there's

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
and usually have a Modi mm I there's

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.210 
and usually have a Modi mm I there's
also<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.479> dynamic<00:04:52.169> setting<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.860> there's<00:04:53.039> also

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
also a dynamic setting and there's also

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.020 
also a dynamic setting and there's also
a<00:04:53.400> comfortable<00:04:54.030> setting<00:04:54.240> and

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
a comfortable setting and

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.890 
a comfortable setting and
automatic<00:04:55.540> setting<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.460> each<00:04:57.460> setting<00:04:58.060> will

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.080 

feature<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:02.080> different<00:05:02.650> type<00:05:02.920> of<00:05:03.090> dampening

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
feature a different type of dampening

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.300 
feature a different type of dampening
