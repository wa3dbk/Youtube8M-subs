 chain the first was on call of 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.530
 duty kid besides the first two 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.030
 episodes have passed on about rating 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.610
 so even if it was a year ago I 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.980
 thanks again the qg code team of 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.930
 have me upe the aude on this chain 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.670
 community and of having done 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.620
 know this series and as had 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.600
 rather well walked on ghost and well I 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.489
 decides to start a second season on 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.379
 call of duty and then evening do so 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.900
 I still thank so much that I had 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.239
 claude this first episode that revive 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.800
 in too tenacious rx d history under a 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.870
 new season under a new game so 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.490
 and above all I present what is in 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.130
 history on call of duty then 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.900
 it is usually something hidden 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.000
 which can be an object a picture a 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.790
 text something like that hides and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.409
 so in the game that loses or a 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.659
 reference are a nod to some 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.940
 thing I gave a very famous example 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.880
 and very simple which are the summer read so 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.729
 on who were present on a lot of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.200
 call of duty modern three codes 4 short 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.469
 mirin TVs mostly had the call 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.180
 of 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.070
 and it was just a blink 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.899
 to the daughter of one of the developers 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.850
 game what I believe it was 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.810
 activision-blizzard I'm really 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270
 passionate I think it was a 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.740
 activity developer in his daughter 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.600
 died simply it seems to me 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.579
 cancer and her favorite teddy bear 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.200
 was simply forbidden to read 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.909
 that's why we find it on 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.500
 full of gifts it's just for a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.750
 simple wink a little thought 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.310
 here it is really nice and so 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.200
 several subscribers have asked me for a 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.670
 series on 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.890
 and then evening do since they have me 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.990
 quoted some small easter egg and well 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.789
 so I decided to relaunch this 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.130
 series on dancer do and we vote 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.000
 just started with loeb first 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.860
 historical that I will introduce you 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.550
 which is therefore simply in 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.440
 campaign 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.599
 so in the second mission I believe 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.890
 it's the class or it will 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.519
 intrigue the four there I do not know anymore 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.769
 the exact name 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.560
 as soon as you go balloon so this is a 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.120
 marking pomegranate behind the door and 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.430
 you will kill the enemies you will see 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.480
 on the floor there is an extraterrestrial stuffed 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.769
 is there you will say but what is it 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.019
 what are you talking about 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.430
 to shoot down and quite simply this 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.040
 plush and extra terrestrials were 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.220
 present on bo2 on newton online 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.630
 is still present on ghost when 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.140
 you and the historic dole on boards 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.400
 extinguishing contacts that we want 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.019
 kill the aliens there were plenty of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.280
 stuffed animals like that they were flying and 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.720
 well the places have committed it again a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.209
 time that's it makes sense no hunger 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.250
 it's nice to see this stuffed 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.019
 then second easter egg rather more 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.000
 interesting among other things a pretty trick 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.709
 fun that are hidden so that's going on 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.280
 on the strait mac in the car in 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.200
 spawn fire it's no sentinel 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.239
 it's the other team I believe and well 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.859
 sure the steering wheel on the side of those spawn in 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.420
 the car burn its marks and game 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.010
 over so sorry about the quality it's getting 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.090
 will see very very badly but I have not succeeded 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.780
 to have a better picture while 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 just 2 of this little hidden text on 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.069
 the bench of the as marck and game over and the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.750
 third easter eggs is also happening on 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.549
 detroit then there will have to be in 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.430
 viewer so go in private part 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.870
 to let know is not very difficult 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.290
 so look carefully where I placed my 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.049
 camera 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.549
 what that is where will have to go under the 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.569
 So that's it I did not find any other 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.850
 way to go under the ground half 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.329
 behind end of the mans under this little 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.459
 bush 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.440
 you will go from the ground to the ground and 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.940
 there you will see basically a kind 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.620
 image and there you go suddenly try 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.329
 to go as close to this image and 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.069
 as you see on the screen under the map 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.989
 the developers have hidden an image of 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.020
 san francisco world so if a picture 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.910
 really 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.520
 and rule 360 ​​degrees that is to say 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.750
 see the image all around us and 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.080
 it's really very very nice and very 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.820
 very beautiful so here it was not very 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.380
 important but it's really nice 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.270
 that they did then to know that by 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.320
 episode I will present each time 3 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.150
 easter egg 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.060
 but if you have other 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.220
 history on this call of duty is fine 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.110
 sure to do well do not hesitate to me them 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.120
