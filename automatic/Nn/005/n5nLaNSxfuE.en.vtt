00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 there was 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.879
 hello how about you guys now let's see 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.980
 a star that has 17 to me has 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.020
 seemed very funny because what it does 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.990
 is to recreate the end of a movie very 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 old but is curious to see the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 site is here where you are seeing now 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.939
 same is a little bit above the forza 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 shield is when crossing the next mountain 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.919
 behind forge could we find it is 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.329
 very simple once we get to the site 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.980
 we will stop in it with the helicopter 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.290
 on the mountain opposite and we 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.840
 we'll wait to see the end of the movie 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430
 thelma and louise 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.350
 the movie for those who do not know and 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.690
 I was carrying two girls who are running away 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.880
 of the police direction towards mexico and 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.100
 the police corral them in a 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.750
 gorge and they are the moment 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.750
 where you see with two options a 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.250
 committing suicide and another is letting oneself be caught 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.750
 two that were like that half allied if not 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.129
 I have misunderstood that the movie 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.490
 deep down I have not seen it because it 's very 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.670
 old woman 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.220
 they decide to commit suicide, go together 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 where he is living they are thrown by the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.480
 gorge and there the movie ends 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.330
 here in the gta does not end and here in the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.670
 You see how they burst down because it's 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.890
 a game here let's see how it bursts 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 the car we will see the whole car has 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.060
 burst down let's see the explosion 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.250
 it is quite pretty funny and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 we also have the option to stop the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.970
 half scene that is to say catch the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.360
 helicopter cut them the way 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.800
 take them out of the car and take us 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.970
 I imagine he would not let him save a thousand 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.940
 thank you because the truth is that it's a car 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.890
 normal and current not strange nor 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 different or that opens us somewhere else 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.660
 it's a pretty average car a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.369
 old cabriolet the car's grace 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.270
 is that in the part of asia from behind 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.280
 of the seats you have two guitars two 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.600
 mariachi hats and a sticker with 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.369
 the little flag of mexico 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.960
 nothing else is not more simply 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.689
 see the scene of the movie as you are 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.520
 watching now the car jumps bursts and 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.530
 little more but the truth that has made me 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.080
 grace I do not understand why in a game 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.899
 as it makes you a wink movie 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.039

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.590

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.819

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.470

 if not 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.519
