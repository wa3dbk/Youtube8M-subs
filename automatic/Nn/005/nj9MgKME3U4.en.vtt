 extraordinary one floor and is a watt &amp; 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.159

 brick that's good they've sliced 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.050
 in that sense I put two 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.500
 lengths below then another 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.350
 made with a mixture whose secret you 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.930
 is unveiled in the little booklet that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.150
 accompanies the videocassette one more 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.020
 ice cream 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.180
 all covered with whipped cream and 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.350
 decorated with a pretty flower of fruits 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.020
 candied and broken the case by a whole 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.560
 little word of explanation about the 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.020
 puff pastry on the buffet it's in 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 tree shape and it is lined with 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.330
 fresh fruit kiwis and strawberries 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.540
 one important thing is to give it 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.760
 a wound in the end with just a little 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.280
 of jelly a little trick 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.130
 put some dye in your game 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.800
 fades to make the glaze and 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.220
 it is much more beautiful 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.590
 now pear pear is very 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.989
 easy to do as long as you know 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.500
 how it just needs to be 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.790
 iced and when you pour the chocolate 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.090
 like ice cream and frozen chocolate 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.560
 almost instantly 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.560
 the centerpiece 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.750
 I told you about the centerpiece 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.850
 how important it was and I am 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.470
 sure you noticed mine 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.590
 as well as the candlesticks 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.770
 it's a very pretty thing but it's 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.590
 easy with these it's small 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.020
 plastic containers contain 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.360
 water and in which one stings 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.880
 flowers there are of this form there that 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.580
 put on the candlestick the candle 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.080
 becomes the center and this one that we can 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.210
 drop on the table 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.820
 now like that contains water that 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.750
 lasts can last several hours and even 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.310
 a whole day 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.470
 so we do not need to do his 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.209
 centerpieces at the last minute this 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.440
 which is a very important thing because 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.830
 we do not have the time last 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.600

 and it becomes your centerpiece at 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.320
 middle 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.840
 if you only have it go out it could 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.550
 also a long candle and it can 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.820
