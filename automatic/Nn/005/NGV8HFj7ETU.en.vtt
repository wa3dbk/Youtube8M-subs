00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 hello good morning today we are going to prepare 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.939
 grilled asparagus 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 in a way to make us good 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.620
 Crispy and soft inside 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.070
 we have fresh asparagus 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.070
 cut 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.960
 fat salt extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 we have a peeler or knife 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.449
 and we have here a milk iron is 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.100
 you can use a pan or griddle that 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.519
 go to the fire in this case and take advantage 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.930
 I'm great to not have to 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.180
 cut the asparagus 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 let's start the long pick up now 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.730
 Asparagus look good in charge 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.170
 bunch how do you explain other times more 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.210
 thin and thicker 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.920
 if you have a bunch and they come from all 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.200
 then you have to put what you have 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.659
 but if you have more asparagus as 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.549
 You can take the caliber you want or 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.280
 fine phylum fine or fat people are all worth 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.320
 for the iron 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.580
 in this case, look how long they are for 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.979
 that I put the electric iron 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.240
 so as not to have to cut them the part of 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.490
 down I already told you that you can 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.940
 take advantage is now in season are 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.070
 very tender but in every way what 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.990
 we will do will be to peel a 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.659
 little bit the bottom part starts to 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.040
 do so only what is a little 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.700
 because the truth they are very good not 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.700
 has cited 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.159
 we're going to peel it all 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.140
 so down below 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.240
 you take a part that is not either 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.690
 because the skin is also 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.640
 very tender appointment in this case 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.770
 the asparagus are still very good 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 they were in the majority 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.590
 you are removing what is the part 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.140
 from below so the habit only a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.250
 little bit 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.250
 we peel all 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.880
 and we throw them to the pan 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:50.090
 good is a little patience in each 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:52.580
 nothing but the year the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.560
 only in the bottom 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.540
 which is the one that we cut the other day to 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.520
 take advantage in this case not the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.720
 we cut only the peels and 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.720
 we directly put them like that 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.790
 Well, we have the asparagus 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.620
 peeled 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.620
 and let's start cooking them 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.450
 we are a little bit of olive oil 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.000
 extra virgin on the plate and we're going to 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.910
 pour a capita of fat salt all over 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 she 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.000
 this we are going to put it short 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.579
 so that it does not get snatched away, there's no need 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.150
 put the principles low we're going to go 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.150
 placing them 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.040
 it's how long they are 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.460
 then you have to place them for 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.460
 that in the long run if not we would not fall 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.500
 and placing all 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.730
 and that has to be done very slowly 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.730
 make them with time 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.549
 because it makes chubby 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.280
 you have to cook inside and the secret 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.880
 is to make it slow 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.080
 if you do not make them snatch a lot you 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.050
 there are much more outside and inside 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.060
 You can not do it, I always do it 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.060
 well and the truth that they come out spectacular 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.080
 from here it's strap 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.740
 and so we are going to do several runs that 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.560
 we are several more people 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.719
 everything we are has to do it 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.529
 so that one is done first and then 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.529
 make us the other 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.180
 help 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.230
 there are little ones we are going to be putting 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.750
 when the return 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.650
 so that they are leaving us 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.650
 we all love 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.410
 this type of plants as it has here 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.270
 to be able to graduate then yes what 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.020
 you can put 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.580
 short of strong because it would be 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.300
 turn the area around the threads 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.840
 until the end we are going to put the 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.840
 yellow 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.660
 but falling you see how they are doing 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.660
 slowly 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.230
 good belovai turning around slowly 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.810
 one by one 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.280
 look how they are doing 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.280
 the banks have days 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.199
 this is for you 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.910
 the wounded for pleasure and they measure 37 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:52.910
 centimeters long and 35 shorter are 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.910
 spectacular 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.900
 in a tray 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:02.200
 because it is the one that most parents 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.080
 and good 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.830
 let's take advantage of that we have 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.830
 seasonal asparagus 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.430
 as a destination 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.080
 well, nothing here slowly is 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.650
 unthinkable now let's do this 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.840
 batch and then we're going to make another 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.650
 and at the end by local we give a heater to 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.650
 all to eat 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.319
 Well, we already paid with all 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.860
 they are already off and here we have already 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.510
 stacked all so that those in 100 and 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.860
 we're going to do them and here we have the 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.860
 grilled asparagus 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.340
 have been looking at what good looks and is 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.250
 so tender cited inside the dente 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.870
 and golden on the outside now we can 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.870
 accompany then with a mayonnaise sauce 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.970
 or alone as you like with the salt that you 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.510
 we have thrown enough is in the background 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:08.260
 turning around and taking the salt 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.380
 Well nothing guys I hope you do and 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.580
 I hope you like it 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.580
 and take advantage
