looking at this great potential it is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.609 
looking at this great potential it is
quite<00:01:31.950> surprising<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.270> still<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
quite surprising that there are still so

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
quite surprising that there are still so
many<00:01:34.680> guitar<00:01:35.280> teachers<00:01:35.610> who<00:01:35.790> struggle<00:01:36.479> to
