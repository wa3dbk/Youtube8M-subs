00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 legends the first one counts the second 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.950
 he listens and the third discloses 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.690
 what wave lovers of the legends today 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.970
 I bring the song of the people the band 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.130
 as you can see in the title I think 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.530
 all have played pokemon any of 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.260
 its versions but this happened in the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.120
 cartridges green red and blue the truth I 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.220
 when I was a kid I played the pokemon 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.070
 yellow in me and in boy color never 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.830
 I played the blue red green never until 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.020
 it came out in gam boy advance so no 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.120
 I can check the legend but in 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.290
 some parts I read this and it's the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.390
 I wanted to share let's start 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.910
 it seems before the three 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.440
 pokemon editions will reach states 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 united and europe first 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.250
 marketed in Japan 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.770
 there a first version was commercialized 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.350
 of the three editions of pokemon and I say 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.510
 first version according to reports from the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.390
 police that summer there was a 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.970
 total of 104 cases of suicide in children 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.520
 aged between 7 and 12 years 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.830
 logically this age is the age 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.729
 perfect to run the game and sell 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.290
 more in all cases the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.630
 rigorous investigations was interrogated to 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 family and close friends 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.250
 the parents alleged that their children 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 they were hooked on that game before 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.840
 those statements the police analyzed 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.000
 several of these cartridges and in all 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.610
 them when loading the game the character 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.979
 the band appeared in the town after 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.259
 research continued from the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.060
 pokemon cartridges according to 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.820
 interrogations carried out 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.130
 several investigations could be known that 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.350
 children were induced to suicide by 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.360
 blame for the music that sounded when the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.360
 character was in town the band 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.250
 plus 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.170
 the song that is heard in the background is the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.910
 original according to what I searched for 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.120
 internet so we continue 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.580
 how was this possible because apparently the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.410
 melody had a few peaks of intensity 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.020
 of tones that only children and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.760
 preadolescents could perceive this 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.430
 attached to a combination of sounds 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.560
 strident and overwhelming they made 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.080
 the affected children will suffer 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.990
 first migraine headaches and 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.450
 insomnia as the first symptom followed by 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.460
 irritability with insomnia addiction to 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.280
 game and nose bleed and ending 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.650
 in nausea vomiting and a very depressed 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.070
 strong and unfit for children of that age 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.260
 it is precisely this last symptom the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.780
 that pushed children to lose the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.030
 attachment to life and taking life after 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.860
 perform the macabre discovery is 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.320
 informed the game freak company of what 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.900
 happened they modified that melody 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.180
 removing those peaks of beat intensity 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.310
 tonal and inaudible murmurs for 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.130
 adolescents and adults but that 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.080
 children if they could perceive giving as 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.140
 resulting version the many 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.240
 We were able to enjoy both in the USA and in 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.010
 Europe 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.950
 and even there the urban legend in 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.960
 little more question is known about it 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.000
 although the internet is a source of 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.670
 truthful information is also many 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.770
 nonsense as they also circulate many 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.470
 urban legends and horror stories 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.360
 about the pokemon world with respect to 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.510
 that we are really concerned with can 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.430
 melody induce suicide so long 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.370
 had to pass in town the band to 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.810
 get to that state of depression 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.150
 I remember one of the things that had 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.310
 what to do was look for the ghost of 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.720
 mother of coupons but I do not think I take 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.720
 too much time to do it 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.520
 can really a pokemon song 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.310
 induce suicide children nor all truth 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.010
 well that's all for today I'll see you in the 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.260

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.930

 like this we will continue uploading videos 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.280
 how are these better for me to follow 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.950
 growing this from the creepy pastries and 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.590
 legends I say goodbye and have good 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.050

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.139
