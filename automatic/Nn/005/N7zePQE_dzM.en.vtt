00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
super smooth but there's a lot of

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.290 
super smooth but there's a lot of
overspray<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:18.900> gonna<00:00:19.109> have<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.910> go<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> lot

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
overspray so I'm gonna have to go a lot

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.640 
overspray so I'm gonna have to go a lot
slower<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:23.060> practice<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.740 

figure<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.859> better<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:30.119> slower

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
figure out a better way to go slower

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
figure out a better way to go slower
so<00:00:31.399> here's<00:00:32.399> I'll<00:00:32.669> show<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.270> the
