SOG and then if you want to put the
safety<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.819> and<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.209> like<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.599> safety<00:01:54.810> buttons

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
safety on and I like the safety buttons

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.800 
safety on and I like the safety buttons
very<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.770> know<00:01:55.829> unobtrusive<00:01:56.520> not<00:01:56.759> um<00:01:57.029> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
very you know unobtrusive not um you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.449 
very you know unobtrusive not um you
know<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.139> won't<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.740> bumped<00:01:59.069> very<00:01:59.249> easily

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
know it won't be bumped very easily

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.909 
know it won't be bumped very easily
which<00:01:59.759> is<00:01:59.789> good<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:01.349> you<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.679> put<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:01.919 
which is good so I then you just put it

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:03.919 
which is good so I then you just put it
to<00:02:01.979> black<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.429> then<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.639> will<00:02:02.789> not<00:02:02.999> deploy<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
to black and then it will not deploy the

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.739 
to black and then it will not deploy the
blade<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.889> back<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.219> red<00:02:05.429> boom<00:02:06.209> whips<00:02:06.509> open

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
blade put it back to red boom whips open

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.990 
blade put it back to red boom whips open
with<00:02:06.869> authority<00:02:07.349> so<00:02:07.560> those<00:02:08.099> are<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
with authority so those are just the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360 
with authority so those are just the
basics<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.080> hand<00:02:10.289> blade<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.920> from<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
basics on the hand blade is from the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.300 
basics on the hand blade is from the
handle<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.330> tip<00:02:12.599> 3.5<00:02:13.560> inches<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.069> actual

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
handle to the tip 3.5 inches the actual

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.150 
handle to the tip 3.5 inches the actual
cutting<00:02:14.489> edge<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.760> 3.3<00:02:15.239> oz<00:02:15.780> 8<00:02:16.470> steel<00:02:16.830> good

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
cutting edge is 3.3 oz 8 steel good

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.430 
cutting edge is 3.3 oz 8 steel good
budget<00:02:17.370> steel<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.630> let's<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:19.020> ahead<00:02:19.110> get<00:02:19.410> out

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
budget steel so let's go ahead get out

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.720 
budget steel so let's go ahead get out
there<00:02:19.680> let's<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.040> kind<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.190> use<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.489> thing

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
there let's just kind of use this thing

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.530 
there let's just kind of use this thing
so<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.000> show<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.300> some<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.480> the
