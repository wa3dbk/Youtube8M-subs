00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
wet prairies in Florida like Paynes

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.530 
wet prairies in Florida like Paynes
Prairie<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.740> they're<00:02:27.100> really<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.370> unique

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
Prairie and they're really a unique

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.170 
Prairie and they're really a unique
ecosystem<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.570> we<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:29.130> when<00:02:30.130> things<00:02:30.970> are

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
ecosystem that we have when things are

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180 
ecosystem that we have when things are
dry<00:02:31.450> trees<00:02:31.990> grow<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.470> them<00:02:32.650> when<00:02:32.770> things<00:02:33.040> are

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
dry trees grow on them when things are

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.550 
dry trees grow on them when things are
wet<00:02:33.370> they<00:02:33.550> turn<00:02:33.760> into<00:02:33.910> lakes<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.870> dynamic

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
wet they turn into lakes and the dynamic

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.850 
wet they turn into lakes and the dynamic
nature<00:02:36.460> of<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.570> water<00:02:37.810> levels<00:02:38.290> makes<00:02:38.590> for

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
nature of the water levels makes for

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.800 
nature of the water levels makes for
really<00:02:39.190> interesting<00:02:39.850> habitat<00:02:40.390> for<00:02:40.690> both

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
really interesting habitat for both

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.949 
really interesting habitat for both
plants<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.290> animals<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> great

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
plants and animals so this is a great

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.770 
plants and animals so this is a great
example<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.770> we'll<00:02:45.610> see<00:02:45.910> all<00:02:46.180> kinds<00:02:46.690> of

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
example of that we'll see all kinds of

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.330 
example of that we'll see all kinds of
migratory<00:02:47.170> animals<00:02:47.590> come<00:02:47.950> through<00:02:48.160> here
