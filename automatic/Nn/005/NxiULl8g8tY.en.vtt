00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.949
 business class guests but also for 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.679

 guest status will have something like that first 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.440
 The offer of a lounge sounds loud 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.170
 however, air berlin is not a competitor 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.249
 but as an additional service 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.079
 be understood 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.370
 that is a complementary product 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.969
 We have many lounges on many 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.350
 airports 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.760
 that is our gold and platinum 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.170
 Customers also the business class guests 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.059
 can use the lounges 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.260
 but here in vienna, too, have the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.090
 possibility in the exclusive waiting area 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.140
 In addition, the customer in gateway 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.910
 to offer something 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.470
 because the ex private area is located 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.060
 located right next to your departure gates 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.530
 And that means the guests can hold up 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.090
 to stay here for the last moment 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.410
 before they get in then the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.580
 lounge is still a bit far away 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.910
 that means it does not close 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.350
 out 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.480
 we have both the lounges as well 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.790

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.980

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.790

 Power connection for electronic devices 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.250
 air Berlin subsidiary Micky only became available in 2009 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.530
 still awarded as low cost airline 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.240
 does such a service fit at all? 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.500
 in such a concept, then 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.660
 of course we have, of course 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.130
 cheap rates but we are not low 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.840
 cost airlines sense of 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.980

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.480

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.940
 as well as on the ground and in the ground 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.960
 We now invested by us 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.220

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.050

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.910
 the opening of the new waiting area 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.520
