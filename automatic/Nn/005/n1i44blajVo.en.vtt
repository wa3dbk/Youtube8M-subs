00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello people here is jonas from istanbul 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 unia ctv and now I want a video 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.220
 from my delta buffer make in the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.350
 video world is running accurate here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.980
 Specifications should be so wrong if 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.279
 one data span of 75 centimeters 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.119
 that's 30, that's why 30 will go 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.960
 represents fischer called 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:41.340
 there is hard foam from xps birth 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:44.789
 so that on one side to the white one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.289
 that wise rubber coating the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.969
 actually reallocation actually brings 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.590
 but nothing is very stable 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.059
 So you can really lie to him 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.030
 report 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.930
 but he has to make buttons 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.460
 I glue together for the plane 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.880
 a big layer is used that is the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.000
 teaching that was only one and then for 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.270
 the car here on top of two layers 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 and that's just on the side 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.570
 just rounded off the first 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.520
 just cut away one part 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.580
 Grinder down that has good 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.580
 is working 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.650
 dkfm step does not make it that way 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.970
 it does not get that much buzz so 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.350
 very fast through the air so slides 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.600
 better said that I better by the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.340
 Air cuts through that just does not work 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.570
 so much right again I have now 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.640
 electronics technically I have one 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:51.890
 xtronic 24 gram engine in there you can see 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:57.320
 the back of the carrey had the 1500 kg 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 So 1500 revolutions per forest is the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.439
 sufficient to operate the aircraft 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.909
 but if you have a little more power 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.100
 I want you to take a step 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.670
 maybe the mother will go upstairs 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.270
 from the market pool the way 34 degrees 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.370
 1700 kg who would bring more 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.030
 but for my purposes it is enough 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.459
 completely out 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.410
 you do not have to carry a camera now 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.180
 camera was not in it with the eh 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:30.370
 I have a great ski rank 25 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.720
 ampere regulator as I said 25 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.340
 He is also perfectly have here 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.970
 relatively long and there I still had 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.480
 There is no problem with it 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.220
 always very good quality price 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.930
 performance ratio but then there is one 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.190
 Spectrum receiver in there since I now 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.720
 not go into much details because here 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:03.769
 has its receiver and the battery is 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:06.980
 a focus of the battery is a city 1000 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.930
 milliampere 3 is okay that's very 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.730
 easily yields 80 grams and that is 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.799
 Perfect for the plane 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.290
 fluency still he mends himself 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.109
 definitely better than that 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.910
 if you create it now with it 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.459
 the bonsai a bit difficult there 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.840
 you have to be careful that he does not like that 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.459
 wind is knocked over 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.739
 he is a bit shaky as well 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.730
 nice to fly but to strong 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.730
 I would definitely fly wind 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.000
 the big 30 in turns off user 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.000
 to prefer 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.730
 I still have two hobby king 6 grams 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.530
 Servus cleaned up 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.780
 I know a little bit one man 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.980
 could be good at 90 grams servus 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.209
 Actually, it's going to be clear too 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.790
 recommend for that because so the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.650
 fold the aliens and relatively large 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.140
 that's why bigger service will be on 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.519
 Well recommend since the small already really 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.799
 Having difficulties is ever too 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.090
 move as might have noticed 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:14.450
 yes tate everywhere that is easy 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.799
 you get complete color package 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.470
 cheap on ebay in such a 4 pack 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.600
 yellow blue red green 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.160
 is really very recommendable 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.630
 you can use that airplane already 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.420
 finish what's good here, too 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.050
 can recognize 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:38.050
 short the bottom which is easy 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:40.480
 taped blue red green green you can see 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.700
 actually in the sky the best is the blue one 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.940
 but not even road at all 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.590
 more 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.850
 I do not know why so if it is 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:52.890
 always a bit but prefers to 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.890
 not at all that's up here 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.730
 Velcro tape to secure the battery 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.530
 and here you drive two more carbon 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.120
 namely cup and carbon fiber stood 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.570
 I have that for the simple reason 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.750
 First, to keep the distance 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.650
 that it does not tear the hard foam 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.960
 and for the other reason that you are here 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.669
 a bit of stability in the front 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.890
 The thing is because it just 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:27.790
 hard foam is and still two small ones 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:29.410
 Service from being here one 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.270
 space for the battery is cut off 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.650
 aircraft extremely stabilized the 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.240
 That's why you should stay here, too 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.490
 make an extra fortune in every case 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.120
 the case simply made of wood that is enough 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.780
 completely out 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.550
 here in the back then these too 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.260
 carbon fiber serenade since I was a crash 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.250
 did and he is back 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.130
 just a bit apart 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.169
 beaten and there just a co2 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.790
 carbon fiber or better said three 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:56.110
 carbon fiber comes from the stability in it 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.140
 I hope you liked it though 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.490
 Any questions you can have like 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.530
 They will gladly ask you too 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.380
 like to answer and after a short little 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.510
 info coming back soon too 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.890
 here is our car we have 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.140
 now longer only videos from 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.240
 Airplanes made what was there from the ground 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.030
 he is just every boxing first 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.440
 make planes to build yourself 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.120
 yes there it would be in any case soon 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.580
 again on videos of our house 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.580
 come and see you next time
