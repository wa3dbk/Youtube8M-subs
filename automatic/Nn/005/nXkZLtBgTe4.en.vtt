I'll go find a nice safe place to stick
that<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.340> sheds

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
that out in the one of the sheds

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
that out in the one of the sheds
somewhere<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.810> thinking<00:00:30.990> while<00:00:31.289> this

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
somewhere so I was thinking while this

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650 
somewhere so I was thinking while this
back<00:00:31.650> end<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.279> air<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.030> crawl<00:00:33.360> under

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
back end is in the air I can crawl under

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.900 
back end is in the air I can crawl under
there<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.870> look<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.350> how<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.680> pan<00:00:35.160> attaches

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
there and look at how that pan attaches

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
there and look at how that pan attaches
to<00:00:36.140> this<00:00:37.140> body<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.829> looks<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> me<00:00:38.190> like

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
to this body because it looks to me like

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.209 
to this body because it looks to me like
and<00:00:38.940> goes<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.870> inside<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:40.710> channel

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and goes up inside this little channel

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
and goes up inside this little channel
that<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.520> talking<00:00:41.700> about<00:00:41.910> having<00:00:42.390> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that I was talking about having to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.790 
that I was talking about having to
repair<00:00:44.629> if<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.840> does<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.440> channel

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
repair if it does and that channel

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
repair if it does and that channel
doesn't<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.129> any<00:00:47.280> bolts<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.260> it's<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
doesn't have any bolts in it it's just a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
doesn't have any bolts in it it's just a
channel<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.520> should<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.850> pretty<00:00:50.969> easy<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
channel so that should be pretty easy to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
channel so that should be pretty easy to
fix<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:52.860> i<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> order

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
fix I don't think i have to order

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.299 
fix I don't think i have to order
anything<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> make<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> those<00:00:55.190> I'm<00:00:56.190> gonna

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
look this is where the pan bolts to the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
look this is where the pan bolts to the
bottom<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.140> car<00:01:28.560> outside<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
bottom of this car outside of that is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.499 
bottom of this car outside of that is
this<00:01:29.970> embrace<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.780> i'm<00:01:30.900> talking<00:01:31.229> about<00:01:32.509> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
this embrace that i'm talking about and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
this embrace that i'm talking about and
because<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> outside<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.829> their<00:01:35.009> that's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because that is outside of their that's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.410 
because that is outside of their that's
all<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.450> embrace<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> pan<00:01:39.240> itself

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
all that is is embrace the pan itself

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.520 
all that is is embrace the pan itself
fits<00:01:39.840> inside<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.189> thinking<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
fits inside there so my thinking is I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.240 
fits inside there so my thinking is I
can<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.649> both<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.100> thing<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.240> pan<00:01:45.600> I

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
can on both this thing from this pan I

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.539 
can on both this thing from this pan I
can<00:01:47.250> rebuild<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.850> brace<00:01:49.070> both<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
can rebuild that brace both it on to

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.070 
can rebuild that brace both it on to
another<00:01:50.729> pan<00:01:51.119> Oh<00:01:52.130> will<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.280> good

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
another pan Oh will be good

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.560 
another pan Oh will be good
yeah<00:01:56.460> another<00:01:57.460> thought<00:01:57.730> is<00:01:57.760> to<00:01:58.090> leave<00:01:58.300> it<00:01:58.450> on

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
yeah another thought is to leave it on

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.590 
yeah another thought is to leave it on
this<00:01:58.840> pan<00:01:59.760> cut<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:00.910> out<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.270> replace<00:02:01.570> it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
this pan cut that out and replace it

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.960 
this pan cut that out and replace it
while<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.110> has<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.530> pan<00:02:02.740> holding<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.370> straight

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
while it has the pan holding it straight

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.210 
while it has the pan holding it straight
if<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:05.050> makes<00:02:05.230> any<00:02:05.320> sense<00:02:05.470> see<00:02:05.830> all<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.070> way

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
if that makes any sense see all that way

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
replace it with aluminum sunder who

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.470 
replace it with aluminum sunder who
lives<00:03:58.710> this<00:03:58.800> another<00:03:59.100> batter<00:03:59.460> later<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.970> might

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
lives this another batter later I might

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.840 
lives this another batter later I might
get<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.750> off<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.990> trailer<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:02.610> get<00:04:02.700> the
