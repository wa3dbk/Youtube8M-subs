00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.860
 Enter the village of Pellice with a helicopter. 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.280
 Though it is about 4000m a little 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.360
 You entered at once with the helicopter 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 Yesterday I entered Lobce village, 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.400
 And finally, from tomorrow 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.160
 Over there, 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.960
 Robche East Peak 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.700
 Is it about 6190 m? 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.480
 Adapt to that mountain. 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.900
 The theme this time is to climb in a short time 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.320
 I would like to go. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.880
 in Japan 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.010
 Creating a body that is easy to adapt to heights 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.520
 Doing various things such as training and food restrictions 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.680
 Good luck, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.400
 The result is, 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.600
 I think that it seems that Oita has appeared. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.820
 Anyway, this year 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.040
 I want to climb. 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 It is this year, is it? 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.810
 Mountain climbers 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.700
 In that no party was included, 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.740
 That big avalanche two years ago, and 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.740
 It is this year, is it? 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.200
 Oh last year, that big snowfall. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.560
 And there is an earthquake this year 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.610
 Although no mountain climbers have come, 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.780
 It is this year, is it? 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.210
 Opposite Everest, 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.490
 And 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.340
 I want to do a good climb. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.220
 I will climb Robche Peak from tomorrow.
