 the shadows or the broken blush is not a 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.050
 problem ends up breaking them with help 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.610
 the alcohol evaporates

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.100
 let it stand for 5 minutes and you will see that the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.100
 content will be in better condition 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 and 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.540
 do not 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.149
 sometimes pencils for eyes or lips 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.149
 they stop painting clearly 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.440
 this trick is super easy heats the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.640
 point with a lighter or candle

 burn and get yourself simple fast and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.930
 cash 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.480
 you bought yourself a wrong base not the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.400
 votes mix it with a base of a tone 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.999
