00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.450
 domineering complex saga of you put 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.880
 Michel Parmigiani Michael 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.410
 the minutes repetition first of all it's 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.000
 an object that gives you the status of their 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.600
 on demand this year you shoot on 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.360
 a target then you have the sense of 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.720
 hours of hour cards and minutes 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.660
 this to be able to apprehend them in 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.370
 full night or a little bit more 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.229
 or less discreet in the pocket but 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.570
 it's essentially for the night because 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.060
 that time from him but at the time the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.530
 candle the oil lamp and there's no 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.600
 switch it was not going that way 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.340
 so in time wanted to know what time 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.190
 is it was it was the repetition 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.190
 minutes before the minute repetition he 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.040
 was a repetition because the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.240
 half- car rehearsal and repetition 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.890
 five minutes 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.869
 then what's the repetition of a 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.729
 minute has arrived 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.140
 this minute repetition was invented 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.610
 by thomas this match an english a master 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.610
 watchmaker who counted for the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.869
 chronometry this minute repetition 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.420
 invented by thomas this match it's at 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.560
 turn of 1750 so it is very early 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.569
 minute repetitions 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.220
 they come to us first of all clocks 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.700
 such as this is so 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.470
 pendulums that rings the time passing in 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.490
 his name then a passer-by 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.380
 she rings the quarter hour hour the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.970
 half an hour and three quarters she 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.540
 do not ring the minutes because at the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.120
 request 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.400
 there are pendulums typically the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.450
 NeuchÃ¢tel clocks pulling on a 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.100
 cord 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.770
 it rings the quarter hour time 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:18.950
 that he is so often above the bed 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.080
 1 to know theirs in the night while 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.210
 like the minute repeater 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.320
 has in his pocket at the repetition 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.060
 minutes as we know it 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.000
 today is not a simple 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.830
 reducing a pendulum movement does not 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.760
 would the gear games the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.709
 games between pivoting the distances 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.010
 all this must be well managed for 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.140
 can imagine a reduction but of 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.940
 this pocket watch to make it a 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.330
 wristwatch it's yet another 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.330
 case 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.590
 and the minute repeater watch 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.540
 bracelet appeared around the years 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.970
 20 and the reduction even for the watch 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.610
 bracelet was not easy 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.239
 it took a lot of death exercise 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.670
 before being able to make a watch 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.400
 bracelet minute repetition now 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.340
 it's pretty well under control because the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.950
 miniaturization is much easier 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 in today's day that an era must 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.390
 to say that at one time it was very art 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.940
 artisanal and so and that it was 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.610
 extremely difficult to master the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.280
 sizing of the microphones part one can 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.690
 talk like that of micro parts by 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.950
 report to today with all 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.870
 the technological means have to 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.210
 provision anyway there is 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.490
 always 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.320
 the hand of the man who will intervene 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.560
 in a minute repetition so much 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.620
 the endless and complex settings so 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.950
 we will always have the craftsman the watchmaker 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.120
 who will finish his repetition minutes 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.570
 to end up on an object quite 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.570
 reliable 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.989
 the first minute repetitions of 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.200
 pocket it was stamps actually under 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.970
 like little bells that 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.370
 call stamp but these are all 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.070
 little bells in brass then there 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.860
 had either a bell or bell with 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.860
 two different times the stamps under 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.060
 form of the kidneys were abandoned to a 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.010
 given time for 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.260
 aesthetic issues because we 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.870
 failed to achieve demonstrates enough 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.930
 fine enough elegant and rather thin 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:51.250
 been invented then the stamp a sub 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.010
 vibrating film form to vibrate there 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.770
 must also the agreement of the and the stamp 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.600
 this is what allowed the 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.790
 shows to be much thinner 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.870
 the stamps follow the perimeter of the 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.669
 movement so they make a turn or more 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.669
 that a turn it can be a turn and a half 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.410
 or more and then we're dealing with 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.200
 simple stamps or so what we 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.669
 calls cathedral stamps the 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.350
 cathedral stamps these are times 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.580
 that are longer than the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.419
 stamps 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.409
 current 1 which has the effect of carrying 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.409
 are much more
