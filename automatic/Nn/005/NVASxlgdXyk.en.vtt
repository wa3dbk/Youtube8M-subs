00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.530
 we are here for three days on the 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.530
 charade circuit near Clermont 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.450
 ferrand for the organization of the two 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.270
 finals of the 2015 optifuel challenge 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.210
 organized by year our defense so the 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.340
 participants are judged on two 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.839
 criteria the first criterion so they 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.789
 pass a written questionnaire with 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.759
 fifteen questions questions that are 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.800
 more turned on the fuel echoes so this 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.770
 criterion counts for 15% of the mark 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.040
 final then they will spend a 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.820
 practical test so by performing two 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.440
 time a predetermined course and this 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.440
 test counts for 80% of the mark 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.660
 it was fine 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.809
 very windy mountainous course 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.870
 driving technique that demands 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.949
 a lot of 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.659
 of attention the roundabouts the 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.920
 business the hairpins the 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.320
 tanks is mounted it is necessary that the day before 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.479
 with to if they have a course 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.740
 demanding like this one with big 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.460
 climbs and descents 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.100
 especially we will mainly solicit the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.590
 ability to best use the wheel mode 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.649
 free especially so with the functions 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.990
 in Tyrol with also the retarder 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.539
 several criteria are taken into account 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.819
 that is to say that at the consumption there is 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.619
 the time spent in the green zone ago 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.030
 the number of brakes so that's okay 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.560
 allow us to really judge 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.319
 the abilities of our seven finalists 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.970
 had their driving every time so 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.530
 to monitor the performance of 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.630
 drivers during this challenge 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.170
 we will rely on the tibet optifuel 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.060
 infomax that will be useful referent on 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.950
 our axis especially for the population 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.709
 trainers who have to follow 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.600
 the performance of the drivers in the 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.060
 framework including training a fund 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.619
 says rational 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.649
 renault trucks since 2009 is committed 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.239
 in an approach of soul &amp; co therefore 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.300
 lower fuel consumption 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.680
 we are recognized as such by then 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.629
 all the carriers 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.090
 French and so it is in this context 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:21.129
 that we organized this challenge 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.690
 to develop with our customers the 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.250
 optifuel solutions proposed by renault 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.560
 trucks 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.570
 the vehicle used for the challenge 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.890
 optifuel and therefore the optifuel tea that 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.180
 was a concentrate of technologies 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.940
 dedicated fuel savings 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.730
 offered by renault trucks the tools 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.410
 are the robotic box that handles well 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.690
 already compared to the profile of the road 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.000
 she wants to act and the engine and the 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.110
 retarder that allows us not to 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.700
 use the brake pedal 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.700
 the machine is there it's great 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.860
 even well the market 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.849
 the pack up i roll the only free kick that 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.770
 we have this is the only shot of 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.319
 cravings when we get here to at the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.720
 river gold so and speed bumps after 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.819
 necessarily we optimize to 100% 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 there is no need to be in the mountains to 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.830
 have the utility of a retarder 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.300
 since the eco-driving optimization is 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.670
 also done and especially on the dollar 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.739
 when we come to a roundabout when we 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.890
 slow down in traffic 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.950
 this is where we will be able to have all the 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.760
 interests of being able to curb just to the good 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.980
 moment to optimize the vehicles have 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.600
 been specially developed with this 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.760
 objective here then to be able to reduce to 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.530
 maximum consumption since we 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.250
 are all aware that the more 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.350
 in addition our customers want to decrease this 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.519
 that blow since we know very well that 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.830
 in an operating account of a 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 carrier the fuel post and the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.980
 second shot after the post-driver 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.260
 we must think that we must master the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.720
 technology that is our services and 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.299
 there in this case on the t4 160 that we have 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.380
 one and the voight we really have everything 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.390
 we need to be able to anticipate 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.739
 and enhance our driving 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.100
 we are always the main actors 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.320
 their phase of account 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.910
 well the big moment has happened so to 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.220
 through these challenges renault trucks 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.600
 seeks to demonstrate that in the context of 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.360
 rational driving one is before 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.890
 everything about your driver performance 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.170
 even though the vehicle is equipped 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.190
 a maximum of technologies dedicated to 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.440
 fuel savings 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.390
 the difference is actually made on the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.550
 ability of the driver to do the right 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.940
 choice to get the best result 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.940
