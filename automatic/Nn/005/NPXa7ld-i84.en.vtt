00:00:02.028 --> 00:00:04.024
 This video explains how you can print from an iPad to 

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:07.092
 an HP printer with ePrint using Apple's AirPrint. 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.008
 First make sure that your HP ePrint printer is turned on 

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:15.044
 and is connected to a local wireless network. 

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:18.024
 To ensure that your printer is connected 

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:19.088
 with your local wireless network, 

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:21.052
 first go to the printer control panel. 

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:24.056
 Touch the button next to the Settings icon 

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.088
 in the bottom left corner. 

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:27.052
 The Settings menu appears. 

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:30.020
 Touch the button with the right arrow to 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.096

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:39.008
 scroll through the options and select Wireless settings, 

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:40.028

 The Wireless Settings menu appears. 

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:45.012
 Touch the button with the arrow on the right 

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:46.004

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.032
 and select Print Network Configuration Page 

00:00:48.032 --> 00:00:49.056
 and then touch OK. 

00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:53.008
 The printer prints the configuration page. 

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:56.072
 Under the 802.11 Wireless section 

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:57.080
 on the configuration page, 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.048
 the status should be "Connected." 

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:02.012
 Also the network name or SSID that is mentioned, 

00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:04.044
 should be the network that you wish to be connected to. 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.072
 NOTE: Bluetooth or 3G connections are not supported. 

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:10.016
 AirPrint is only compatible via 

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.036
 an 802.11 wireless network. 

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:15.068
 Make sure your iPad is connected 

00:01:15.068 --> 00:01:17.004
 with a local wireless network 

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.020
 by first going to the iPad home screen. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.024
 Tap the Settings icon. 

00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:23.060
 The Settings dialog opens. 

00:01:26.012 --> 00:01:27.040
 Tap the left panel 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.048
 on Wi-Fi. The Wireless Settings menu appears. 

00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:33.052
 Make sure the Wi-Fi button 

00:01:33.052 --> 00:01:34.084
 at the top of the right side panel 

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:36.096
 set to On to enable wireless internet. 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.020
 Then in the "Choose a Network ..." section 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.036
 all found wireless networks 

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:42.032
 displayed nearby. 

00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:44.056
 Tap the name of your local wireless network. 

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:47.000
 If requested, 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.092
 enter your WPA or WEP password 

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:51.040
 and then tap the Connect button. 

00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:53.072
 Once you are connected, 

00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:55.064
 a check mark appears next to the name of the network, 

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:57.060
 that confirms that you are connected correctly. 

00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:03.004
 Press the Start button to return to the home screen. 

00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:07.036
 Starting from the software application on your iPad 

00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:08.048
 from which you want to print, 

00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:11.036
 tap the Action icon to display the menu options. 

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:14.084
 Tap the Print button in the drop-down list 

00:02:14.084 --> 00:02:17.072
 to see the list of available HP ePrint products. 

00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:21.000
 NOTE: Some applications may not offer a print option 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.060
 because the application is not suitable for AirPrint 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.012
 therefore you will not be able to print 

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:27.000
 from that particular application. 

00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:33.072
 Select your HP ePrint printer from the drop-down list. 

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:36.016
 Adjust the print options as desired 

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.056
 and tap Print. 

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:40.076
 The print job is printed from the main tray. 

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.040
 If available, 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.088
 your photos will be printed automatically 

00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:45.060
 from a paper tray specially for photos.
