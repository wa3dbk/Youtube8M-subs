down here to the length that you want to
capture<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> pick<00:00:40.200> three

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
capture it up I'm going to pick three

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
capture it up I'm going to pick three
hundred<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
hundred so that we can see a lot of the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.470 
hundred so that we can see a lot of the
animation<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.290> won't<00:00:43.410> take<00:00:43.649> too<00:00:43.680> long<00:00:44.480> so

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
animation but it won't take too long so

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.279 
animation but it won't take too long so
now<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.620> hover<00:00:46.860> over<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:48.140> armature<00:00:49.140> down

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
now as you hover over the armature down

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.229 
now as you hover over the armature down
here<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.039> left<00:00:50.550> click<00:00:50.789> will

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
here you can see that left click will

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
here you can see that left click will
allow<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> capture<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.280> capture

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
allow you to capture so this capture

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.060 
allow you to capture so this capture
right<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.559> doing<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
right now and what that's doing is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.369 
right now and what that's doing is
baking<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.530> animation<00:00:58.530> down<00:00:58.800> into<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.520> end<00:00:59.789> ed

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
baking the animation down into an end ed

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
baking the animation down into an end ed
file<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.980> compatible<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.609> light<00:01:02.940> wave

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
file that is compatible with light wave

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.260 
file that is compatible with light wave
and<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> I'll<00:01:04.769> quickly<00:01:05.040> show<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.549> how<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> load

and so I'll quickly show you how to load

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.890 
and so I'll quickly show you how to load

the<00:02:18.049> mesh<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.470> that's<00:02:18.590> because<00:02:18.799> I<00:02:18.980> have<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
the mesh and that's because I have the

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.880 
the mesh and that's because I have the
MDD<00:02:20.030> file<00:02:20.299> already<00:02:20.569> applied<00:02:21.110> here<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.530> Messiah

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
MDD file already applied here in Messiah

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.479 
MDD file already applied here in Messiah
so<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:22.940> switch<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.420> off<00:02:23.569> I'll<00:02:24.290> just<00:02:24.769> left<00:02:25.280> click

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
so to switch it off I'll just left click

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.539 
so to switch it off I'll just left click
to<00:02:25.549> deactivate<00:02:26.769> now<00:02:27.769> I'll<00:02:28.010> make<00:02:28.190> sure<00:02:28.430> and

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
to deactivate now I'll make sure and

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.140 
to deactivate now I'll make sure and
click<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.849> object<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.629> then<00:02:30.640> recapture<00:02:31.640> by

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
click the object and then recapture by

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.900 
click the object and then recapture by
right<00:02:32.690> clicking<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:34.099> that's<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:34.580> right

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
right clicking so that's going to right

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.800 
right clicking so that's going to right
over<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:36.049> old<00:02:36.080> MDD<00:02:37.010> file<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:38.329> was<00:02:38.450> generated

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
over the old MDD file that was generated

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.819 
over the old MDD file that was generated
before<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.989> unfortunately<00:02:41.989> in<00:02:42.440> lightwave

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
before and unfortunately in lightwave

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.880 
before and unfortunately in lightwave
with<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.220> default<00:02:43.730> MDD<00:02:44.269> plugin<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:45.560> doesn't

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
with the default MDD plugin it doesn't

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.640 
with the default MDD plugin it doesn't
automatically<00:02:46.640> update<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.290> kind<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.590> have

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
automatically update so you kind of have

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.270 
automatically update so you kind of have
the<00:02:48.890> jog<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> little<00:02:49.489> bit<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:50.359> a<00:02:51.280> point

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
the jog it a little bit with a point

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.780 
the jog it a little bit with a point
oven<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.879> other<00:02:54.160> packages<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.310> don't<00:02:55.519> have

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
oven and other packages you don't have

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.240 
oven and other packages you don't have
to<00:02:56.060> do<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.720> jogging<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.799> maybe<00:02:58.010> that's

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
to do that jogging so maybe that's

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.580 
to do that jogging so maybe that's
something<00:02:58.459> new<00:02:58.910> tech<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.329> change<00:02:59.629> but<00:03:00.319> as<00:03:00.440> you

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
something new tech can change but as you

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.430 
something new tech can change but as you
can<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.799> here<00:03:01.069> on<00:03:01.190> frame<00:03:01.489> 1<00:03:01.879> 20<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:03.049> gorge<00:03:03.319> is

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440

can see here on frame 1 20 the gorge is
not<00:03:03.680> open<00:03:04.040> but<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.849> just<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.180> simple<00:03:05.599> matter

of<00:03:06.019> going<00:03:06.379> in<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.950> telling<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.640> yes<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:08.120> want<00:03:08.299> to

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
of going in and telling it yes I want to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.349 
of going in and telling it yes I want to
use<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.690> file<00:03:08.989> right<00:03:09.230> there<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.849> then<00:03:10.849> when

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
use that file right there and then when

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.300 
use that file right there and then when
you<00:03:11.480> scrub<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.959> see<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.379> jaw<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.920> open

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
you scrub you see that the jaw is open

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.979 
you scrub you see that the jaw is open
and<00:03:13.459> closing<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:16.160> there<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.400> go<00:03:16.489> fast<00:03:17.329> MDD<00:03:17.930> in

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
and closing so there you go fast MDD in

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.349 
and closing so there you go fast MDD in
a<00:03:18.139> nutshell
