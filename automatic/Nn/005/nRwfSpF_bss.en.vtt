00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.269
 hi friends 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.139
 the recipe that I bring for today is 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.410
 about if chops see part of the hbo 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:24.270
 here in this bag they were that was 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.140
 white onion garlic and parsley 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:32.300
 In addition to wearing these places 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 Go buoys on an iron and good 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.450
 initially a quarter of a bar from the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 butter is melting 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.460
 and we are going to place the pieces 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.650
 and to supply 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.790
 or say 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.790
 of this wine 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.100
 we hope friends cinemas now I'm going to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.640
 climb again with more chives with 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 this face 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.770
 and let them finish 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.950
 in this bark process 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.280
 in the heat also friends we are already in 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.479
 the task of preparing these delicious 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.610
 and sauce for these you see we have 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.390
 lemon 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.580
 the onion parsley onion white onion 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.820
 green and purple onion 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.710
 and three large garlic cloves of 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.300
 what I 'm just going to pretend 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.400
 extract the flavor 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.540
 and that's it 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.670
 I'm going to cut the garlic like that, nothing else 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.400
 so that I can extract it 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.709
 easily from the pan when there are 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.680
 suffered and now we go with the onion 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.930
 nothing more than half 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.150
 because this onion is what I 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.540
 I pretend to get dehydrated 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.540
 and here I go with the appointment that I loved 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.849

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.500
 with the cilantro that also 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.040
 I'm going to cut out a lot 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.069
 and that's it 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.840
 I can put the two tablespoons on fire 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.200

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.120
