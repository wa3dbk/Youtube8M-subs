00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello to all and infiniti I hope that 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.849
 you're all right how super 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.220
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.510
 new video a mercato minute so 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.190
 that's been done for some time now 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.450
 I saw some turn because I was gone in 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.439
 vacation for two weeks so I 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.359
 the ai explained in the videos 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.439
 previous ones I was able to get you out when 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.630
 even some videos during the holidays 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.369
 as I had shot them before and there I 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.140
 am from income so since about a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.579
 week but I had a little trouble for 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.960
 shoot videos because I was 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.909
 to make my apartment for nancy for 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.559
 next year so that's why 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.149
 I could not shoot you video but 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.620
 there we are with episode agreements 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.760
 so she runs number because we 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.920
 talk about a single player 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.920
 and this player and jason besides 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.750
 we're going to bet in this issue 2 jason ddr 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.910
 if you do not know it, it's a 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.530
 player who plays in manchester city on 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.480
 has not seen much in this club yet 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.879
 because there are a lot of defenders of 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.470
 defenders still pretty good so they 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.640
 are still better than jason 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.080
 nerves who is still a young player 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.310
 so that's why he can not 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 still evolved in this team 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.090
 he should be lent to the Olympic 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.619
 of Marseille with no option to buy which 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.330
 is normal because it's a young player 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.740
 would often like to use it later 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.060
 in their team or even sell it 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.590
 much more expensive than a in a 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.970
 club for example like marseille who will 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.080
 not recruit a player has more than 20 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.490
 millions of euros 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.539
 otherwise it's a player too who did 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.060
 a beautiful season last year 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.770
 on loan at celtic glasgow so the club 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.770
 Scottish who finished first of the season 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.110
 last is by the way he was also 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.220
 jason denner one of the key players of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 this team because he finished better 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.940
 championship hope 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.990
 the advantage of this transfer is good 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.369
 sure he 'll have some playing time at 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.990
 marseille so normally he should 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.330
 to hold if everything goes well 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.850
 for him to be very good defenders 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.500
 still in Marseille they have a cool 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.759
 or no it's not really how it's 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.890
 went to Toulouse cannes I 'll talk 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.140
 a little later but they also have some 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.119
 players like requip or the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.409
 defender of Aurillac we saw little year 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.759
 last but hey it's still a 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.890
 player who will be able to compete in 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.570
 this post otherwise it's good for his age 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.579
 so 20 years ago he had them a few 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.590
 month I believe in June so yeah he 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.640
 still super young so already who 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.110
 won in his team led 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.420
 international like there I 'm going to you 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.100
 to say that he played a few games with 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.989
 the team from belgium including sua 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.910
 against France he was titular in 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.290
 the belgian team has a very good match 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.640
 I remind you of this game frankly 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.780
 it was really huge it's like that 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.519
 that I would have in jelly discovered the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.620
 player and still impressed me 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.910
 otherwise the disadvantages it is of course 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 the loan with no option to buy for 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.329
 marseille so his subscribers a 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.829
 inconvenience because ok they'll have it 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.209
 for a year he may be doing 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.769
 really good things for the club 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.900
 but now they can not 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.400
 buy it so it's not really going 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.840
 say a significant price for them the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.160
 player is going to really serve them that a 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.410
 year so we do not really know how that's 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 was happening and also the departure of a cloud 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.859
 so it's a disadvantage but also a 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.750
 advantage because normally to a crowd where 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.160
 his contract ends next year 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.079
 so if he does not renew his contract 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.670
 he sells the vende for free as 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.590
 Gignac 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.180
 well ayew so that would be silly again 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.709
 do this this season of letting go of good 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.420
 players for free and the could 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.500
 resell it about 8 10 million 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.810
 I think for another club 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.610
 especially lyon who are on them 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.770
 grounds on was so he will normally 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.020
 a silver card he has a bronze card 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.340
 I went over to his lands where 64 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.630
 but I know he had a head card 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.770
 which was really interesting for a 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.319
 off map bronze 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.120
 there he is likely to be money me I am 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.160
 a little 72 for this player I do not know 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.330
 not really how is it going to be noted I 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.260
 did not really see this evolve 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.160
 season so I can not tell you 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.630
 but I still think he laughed 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.970
 pretty interesting cards for the liga 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.920
 in money otherwise we will lose the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.390
 perfect link with company so lÃ© 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.100
 Belgian manchester city defender 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.180
 it may belgian would have liked your de 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.530
 iron know if they had a card 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.510
 money interesting way why not 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.310
 to make a small team with a small 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.140
 hybrid using these two players in 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.760
 defense that we can not be bad but good 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.560
 it should still be easy to 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.810
 to put in a liga I think so 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.340
 it's already that's the number 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.200
 coming to an end I hope he will have you 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.489
 more certainly it was quite short we have 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.769
 talked about a single player I talked about when 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.299
 even longer on this player because 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.100
 it was only one player in episode 1 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.600
 place of 2 so I hope he will have you 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.880
 the more you liked it do not hesitate to 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.170
 to leave a love especially to a lot of 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.459
 young for my return it would make me 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.440
 really enjoyable because it really makes me 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.420
 a lot of fun shooting videos 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.650
 for you and so we find ourselves very 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.459
 soon for more videos 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.459
 were all
