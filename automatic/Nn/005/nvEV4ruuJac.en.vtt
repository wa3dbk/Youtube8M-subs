00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
point off and that was the whole focus

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.050 
point off and that was the whole focus
that<00:04:58.990> every<00:04:59.290> point<00:04:59.500> matters<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.130> much<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.640> it

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
that every point matters so much and it

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.430 
that every point matters so much and it
really<00:05:01.240> showed<00:05:01.540> tonight<00:05:01.750> we<00:05:02.020> took<00:05:02.200> care<00:05:02.410> of

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
really showed tonight we took care of

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.760 
really showed tonight we took care of
the<00:05:02.530> ball<00:05:02.650> we<00:05:02.860> didn't<00:05:03.130> make<00:05:03.250> air

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
the ball we didn't make air

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.129 
the ball we didn't make air
you<00:05:03.860> know<00:05:04.009> we<00:05:04.610> took<00:05:05.300> it<00:05:05.449> took<00:05:05.690> advantage<00:05:05.930> of

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
you know we took it took advantage of

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.809 
you know we took it took advantage of
opportunities<00:05:06.289> when<00:05:07.039> they<00:05:07.069> were<00:05:07.250> given<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.669> us

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
opportunities when they were given to us

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.490 
opportunities when they were given to us
and<00:05:08.090> that's<00:05:08.539> something<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.870> we<00:05:09.050> hadn't<00:05:09.379> been

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
and that's something that we hadn't been

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.010 
and that's something that we hadn't been
doing<00:05:09.800> as<00:05:10.039> well<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.819> I<00:05:11.060> think<00:05:11.090> we<00:05:11.389> got<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.810> lot

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
doing as well and I think we got a lot

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.779 
doing as well and I think we got a lot
better<00:05:12.139> about<00:05:12.349> this<00:05:12.590> week<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:13.099> I<00:05:13.340> think<00:05:13.669> it

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
better about this week so I think it

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.569 
better about this week so I think it
could<00:05:14.330> get<00:05:14.389> really
