00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
really cool even though Minnie's would

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.469 
really cool even though Minnie's would
have<00:01:47.189> been<00:01:47.340> nice<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:48.000> probably<00:01:48.329> not

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have been nice but probably not

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
have been nice but probably not
cost-effective<00:01:49.310> another<00:01:50.310> thing<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.579> must

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
cost-effective another thing I must

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.670 
cost-effective another thing I must
mention<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.540> bridge<00:01:51.810> inside<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.500> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
mention is the bridge inside of this is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760 
mention is the bridge inside of this is
very<00:01:53.310> very<00:01:53.790> cool<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.570> sets<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.079> across<00:01:55.470> there

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
very very cool it sets up across there

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.620 
very very cool it sets up across there
and<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.250> where<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> epic<00:01:57.030> battle<00:01:57.450> is

however<00:03:31.190> Balrog<00:03:31.910> now<00:03:32.180> has<00:03:32.450> four<00:03:33.110> attack<00:03:33.800> on

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
however Balrog now has four attack on

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.740 
however Balrog now has four attack on
Gandalf<00:03:34.520> so<00:03:34.640> Gandalf<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.209> going<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.630> to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
Gandalf so Gandalf is going to have to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.350 
Gandalf so Gandalf is going to have to
lay<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> good<00:03:36.260> card<00:03:36.560> or<00:03:36.860> else<00:03:37.010> he<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.550> going<00:03:38.270> to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
lay a good card or else he is going to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.290 
lay a good card or else he is going to
get<00:03:38.510> hurt<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.310> what<00:03:40.310> he<00:03:40.430> might<00:03:40.610> choose<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:40.970> do

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
get hurt so what he might choose to do

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.080 
get hurt so what he might choose to do
is<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.690> lay<00:03:41.870> one<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.140> his<00:03:42.520> special<00:03:43.520> cards

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
is to lay one of his special cards

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.600 
is to lay one of his special cards
because<00:03:44.390> both<00:03:44.870> players<00:03:45.080> have<00:03:45.290> special<00:03:46.220> cards

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
because both players have special cards

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.150 
because both players have special cards
and<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:46.880> one<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.270> called<00:03:47.770> Gandalf's<00:03:48.770> list

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
and this one is called Gandalf's list

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.370 
and this one is called Gandalf's list
and<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.850> Balrog<00:03:50.270> must<00:03:50.630> play<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.989> rest<00:03:51.170> of

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
and the Balrog must play the rest of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.410 
and the Balrog must play the rest of
this<00:03:51.530> duel<00:03:51.800> with<00:03:52.070> his<00:03:52.220> hand<00:03:52.580> face<00:03:53.060> up<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.360> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
this duel with his hand face up on the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.390 
this duel with his hand face up on the
table<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.320> would<00:03:54.470> be<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> very<00:03:54.890> good<00:03:55.160> card

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
table so this would be a very good card

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.370 
table so this would be a very good card
to<00:03:55.580> lay<00:03:55.850> so<00:03:55.910> now<00:03:56.180> Gandalf<00:03:56.570> can<00:03:56.720> see<00:03:56.840> exactly

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
to lay so now Gandalf can see exactly

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.890 
to lay so now Gandalf can see exactly
what<00:03:57.770> Balrog<00:03:58.190> has<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.760> what<00:03:59.270> he's<00:03:59.450> going<00:03:59.750> to

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
what Balrog has and what he's going to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.040 
what Balrog has and what he's going to
play<00:04:00.110> however<00:04:01.120> Gandalf<00:04:02.120> is<00:04:02.300> now<00:04:02.480> going<00:04:02.900> to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
play however Gandalf is now going to

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.350 
play however Gandalf is now going to
take<00:04:03.320> some<00:04:03.560> hits<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:04.130> obviously<00:04:04.340> he<00:04:05.150> has

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
take some hits because obviously he has

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.080 
take some hits because obviously he has
empty<00:04:05.900> spots<00:04:06.200> here<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.220> can<00:04:07.340> see<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
empty spots here so as you can see the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.300 
empty spots here so as you can see the
more<00:04:08.330> cubes<00:04:08.810> or<00:04:09.110> diamonds<00:04:09.470> or<00:04:09.650> circles<00:04:10.130> you

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
more cubes or diamonds or circles you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.640 
more cubes or diamonds or circles you
have<00:04:10.340> on<00:04:10.790> here<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.690> better<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.260> if<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.500> have

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
have on here the better so if you have

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.840 
have on here the better so if you have
eight<00:04:12.920> that's<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.459> best<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.820> possibly

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
eight that's the best you can possibly

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.000 
eight that's the best you can possibly
do<00:04:14.269> if<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.600> zero<00:04:15.260> which<00:04:15.530> some<00:04:15.769> do<00:04:15.980> have

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
do if you have zero which some do have

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.099 
do if you have zero which some do have
zero<00:04:16.580> you're<00:04:17.209> going<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.510> get<00:04:17.660> hit<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> lot

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
zero you're going to get hit a lot

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.560 
zero you're going to get hit a lot
so<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:18.739> will<00:04:19.070> continue<00:04:19.549> until<00:04:19.729> one<00:04:20.090> person

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
so you will continue until one person

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.470 
so you will continue until one person
gets<00:04:20.780> knocked

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
gets knocked

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.780 
gets knocked
let's<00:04:21.840> say<00:04:22.050> Balrog<00:04:22.650> winds<00:04:22.950> up<00:04:23.100> ends<00:04:23.700> up

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.460 
let's say Balrog winds up ends up
winning<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.180> round<00:04:24.390> after<00:04:24.600> playing<00:04:24.930> six

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470

cards you can only play six even though

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.170 
cards you can only play six even though
you<00:04:28.290> draw<00:04:28.470> nine<00:04:28.740> one<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> great<00:04:29.730> parts<00:04:30.030> of

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
you draw nine one of the great parts of

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.000
