retaliate like that that should have

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.510 
retaliate like that that should have
been<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.540> yellow<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.990> i'm<00:02:49.050> not<00:02:49.200> sure<00:02:49.260> why<00:02:49.860> it

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
been a yellow and i'm not sure why it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.510 
been a yellow and i'm not sure why it
wasn't<00:02:50.820> because<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.330> was<00:02:51.450> an<00:02:51.690> obvious<00:02:52.520> non

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
wasn't because it was an obvious non

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.410

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
retaliation it probably would have

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.000 
retaliation it probably would have
changed<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.550> game<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.150> unless<00:03:01.050> they<00:03:01.290> yes<00:03:01.800> it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
changed the game on unless they yes it

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.730 
changed the game on unless they yes it
should<00:03:02.760> have<00:03:02.880> happened<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.720> was<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:04.200> any

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
should have happened it was if any

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.320 
should have happened it was if any
estimate<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.220> got<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.520> yellow<00:03:05.850> he<00:03:06.000> certainly

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
estimate of got that yellow he certainly

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.580 
estimate of got that yellow he certainly
would<00:03:06.600> not<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:06.900> ripped<00:03:07.110> his<00:03:07.260> shirt<00:03:07.290> off

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
would not have ripped his shirt off

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.040

game for one of the other teams he
didn't<00:03:36.000> do<00:03:36.090> something<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.630> horrendous<00:03:37.320> and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
didn't do something so horrendous and

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.590 
didn't do something so horrendous and
we've<00:03:37.920> seen<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.310> throughout<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.150> world<00:03:39.330> cup

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
we've seen it throughout the world cup

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.150 
we've seen it throughout the world cup
and<00:03:40.850> in<00:03:41.850> comparison<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.990> number<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.620> all

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
and in comparison to the number to all

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.040 
and in comparison to the number to all
the<00:03:44.430> other<00:03:44.580> referees<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.360> this<00:03:45.510> world<00:03:45.720> cup<00:03:45.900> or

the other referees of this world cup or
a<00:03:46.080> lot<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.500> them<00:03:46.650> he<00:03:47.070> actually<00:03:47.250> did<00:03:47.730> what<00:03:47.970> I

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
a lot of them he actually did what I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.550 
a lot of them he actually did what I
would<00:03:48.240> consider<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.840> be<00:03:48.960> if<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.200> want<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.470> have

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
would consider to be if you want to have

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.640 
would consider to be if you want to have
a<00:03:49.590> weighted<00:03:50.040> scale<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.520> an<00:03:50.730> a-plus<00:03:51.210> job

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
a weighted scale here an a-plus job

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.500 
a weighted scale here an a-plus job
comparatively<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:53.150> will<00:03:54.150> agree<00:03:54.420> that

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
comparatively I will agree that

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.360 
comparatively I will agree that
certainly<00:03:54.990> was<00:03:55.200> not<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.530> worst<00:03:55.710> called<00:03:56.070> game

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
certainly was not the worst called game

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.520 
certainly was not the worst called game
and<00:03:56.790> compared<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.630> some<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.020> reps<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.470> I

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
and compared to some of the reps that I

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.980 
and compared to some of the reps that I
have<00:03:58.650> seen<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:58.980> world<00:03:59.220> cup<00:03:59.430> he<00:04:00.240> probably<00:04:00.720> did

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
have seen this world cup he probably did

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.470 
have seen this world cup he probably did
a<00:04:01.020> favorable<00:04:01.620> job<00:04:01.860> however<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.820> will<00:04:02.970> say<00:04:03.180> that

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
a favorable job however I will say that

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.540 
a favorable job however I will say that
it<00:04:03.870> did<00:04:04.050> seem<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.620> lot<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.010> calls<00:04:05.250> were

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
it did seem that a lot of the calls were

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.210 
it did seem that a lot of the calls were
favorable<00:04:06.300> towards<00:04:06.780> Spain<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.770> may<00:04:07.890> become

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
favorable towards Spain and I may become

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.950 
favorable towards Spain and I may become
before<00:04:08.610> we<00:04:08.670> started<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.240> it<00:04:09.360> seems<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.810> it

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
before we started that it seems like it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.800 
before we started that it seems like it
sometimes<00:04:10.200> it<00:04:10.830> seems<00:04:11.610> like<00:04:11.670> Spain<00:04:12.060> had<00:04:12.240> 14<00:04:12.660> men

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
sometimes it seems like Spain had 14 men

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.440 
sometimes it seems like Spain had 14 men
on<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.990> field<00:04:13.140> yeah<00:04:14.100> I'd<00:04:14.520> say<00:04:14.580> that<00:04:14.910> well<00:04:15.210> they

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
on the field yeah I'd say that well they

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.010 
on the field yeah I'd say that well they
did<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:15.990> they<00:04:16.760> actually<00:04:17.760> made<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.750> even

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
did and they actually made that even

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.700 
did and they actually made that even
more<00:04:19.170> apparent<00:04:19.500> once<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.570> tango<00:04:21.570> was<00:04:21.720> sent<00:04:22.500> off

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
more apparent once I tango was sent off

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.430 
more apparent once I tango was sent off
for<00:04:23.040> really<00:04:24.000> again<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.720> may<00:04:24.900> have<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.140> point

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
for really again you may have a point

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.660 
for really again you may have a point
here<00:04:25.560> he

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
here he

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.640 
here he
he<00:04:26.760> placed<00:04:27.300> his<00:04:27.630> hand<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:29.250> shoulder<00:04:29.400> of

he placed his hand on the shoulder of

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.710 
he placed his hand on the shoulder of

like<00:04:36.540> a<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:37.110> know<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.440> house<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.950> cards<00:04:37.980> as<00:04:38.550> we

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
like a you know a house of cards as we

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.010 
like a you know a house of cards as we
say<00:04:39.230> again<00:04:40.550> at<00:04:41.550> some<00:04:41.730> point<00:04:42.000> for<00:04:42.210> our<00:04:42.300> web<00:04:42.720> and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
say again at some point for our web and

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.830 
say again at some point for our web and
he<00:04:43.260> did<00:04:43.440> let<00:04:43.590> some<00:04:43.890> things<00:04:43.920> go<00:04:44.250> huh<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.720> know

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
he did let some things go huh you know

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.260 
he did let some things go huh you know
like<00:04:46.170> Robins<00:04:47.130> being<00:04:47.490> grabbed<00:04:47.820> down<00:04:48.030> and

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
like Robins being grabbed down and

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.240 
like Robins being grabbed down and
pulled<00:04:48.480> down<00:04:48.720> by<00:04:48.990> polio<00:04:49.410> as<00:04:49.680> he<00:04:49.800> went<00:04:49.950> towards

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
pulled down by polio as he went towards

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.370 
pulled down by polio as he went towards
the<00:04:50.340> goal<00:04:50.490> but<00:04:50.880> he<00:04:51.030> gave<00:04:51.690> hiding<00:04:52.140> another

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
the goal but he gave hiding another

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.530 
the goal but he gave hiding another
yellow<00:04:52.890> for<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.430> maybe<00:04:53.610> there<00:04:53.850> you're

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
yellow for that so maybe there you're

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.330 
yellow for that so maybe there you're
probably<00:04:54.780> right<00:04:54.900> there<00:04:55.170> was<00:04:55.350> an<00:04:55.500> imbalance<00:04:56.010> um

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
probably right there was an imbalance um

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.690 
probably right there was an imbalance um
but<00:04:57.120> webs<00:04:57.480> gotta<00:04:57.780> calm<00:04:58.080> as<00:04:58.620> he<00:04:59.010> sees<00:04:59.400> them<00:04:59.430> I

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
but webs gotta calm as he sees them I

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.180 
but webs gotta calm as he sees them I
think<00:04:59.880> he's<00:05:00.150> generally<00:05:00.630> a<00:05:00.660> pretty<00:05:00.900> fair<00:05:01.410> guy<00:05:01.860> I

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
think he's generally a pretty fair guy I

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.050 
think he's generally a pretty fair guy I
just<00:05:02.790> think<00:05:02.910> he<00:05:03.090> didn't<00:05:03.360> see<00:05:04.760> Robin<00:05:05.760> being

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
just think he didn't see Robin being

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.650 
just think he didn't see Robin being
ganked<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:06.690> then<00:05:07.530> I<00:05:07.830> think<00:05:08.160> he<00:05:08.490> made<00:05:08.880> too<00:05:09.450> much

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
ganked and then I think he made too much

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.770 
ganked and then I think he made too much
maybe<00:05:10.020> because<00:05:10.380> nes<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.010> little<00:05:11.280> tiny<00:05:11.460> guy

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
maybe because nes is a little tiny guy

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.830 
maybe because nes is a little tiny guy
of<00:05:12.780> high<00:05:13.440> Kangas<00:05:14.270> hand<00:05:15.270> being<00:05:15.570> on<00:05:15.720> his

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
of high Kangas hand being on his

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.790 
of high Kangas hand being on his
shoulder<00:05:16.320> um<00:05:17.990> when<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.110> kind<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.410> brings<00:05:19.590> us

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
shoulder um when that kind of brings us

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.160 
shoulder um when that kind of brings us
were<00:05:20.010> there<00:05:20.190> any<00:05:20.310> standout<00:05:21.300> players<00:05:21.630> for<00:05:22.020> you

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
were there any standout players for you

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.120 
were there any standout players for you
in<00:05:23.100> this<00:05:23.310> world<00:05:23.850> cup<00:05:24.060> game<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:25.410> will<00:05:25.890> say<00:05:26.010> that

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130
