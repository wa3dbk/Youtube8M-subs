00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
I was actually trying to find a place

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.620 
I was actually trying to find a place
that<00:01:10.350> did<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.340> kind<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.729> work<00:01:11.940> when<00:01:12.509> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that did just this kind of work when you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
that did just this kind of work when you
come<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.229> start<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.160> move<00:01:14.399> depending

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
come in and start if you move depending

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
come in and start if you move depending
on<00:01:15.030> whether<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> had<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> wood<00:01:15.869> or<00:01:15.990> synthetic

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
on whether you had a wood or synthetic

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.950 
on whether you had a wood or synthetic
stock<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.160> stock<00:01:17.330> where<00:01:18.330> parts<00:01:18.660> would<00:01:18.780> get

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
stock the stock where parts would get

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410 
stock the stock where parts would get
prepped<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.880> bit<00:01:21.030> differently

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
prepped a little bit differently

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.270 
prepped a little bit differently
depending<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.990> what<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.289> is<00:01:22.320> metal<00:01:22.830> would<00:01:23.130> get

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
depending on what it is metal would get

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.510 
depending on what it is metal would get
a<00:01:23.310> salt<00:01:23.610> fetching<00:01:24.030> primer<00:01:24.800> would<00:01:25.800> would<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
a salt fetching primer would would get a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.359 
a salt fetching primer would would get a
primer<00:01:26.850> sealer<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.229> lay<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> base<00:01:28.799> coat<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
primer sealer then we lay a base coat of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.910 
primer sealer then we lay a base coat of
paint<00:01:30.119> depending<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:31.140> pattern<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
paint depending on what pattern and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 
paint depending on what pattern and
stuff<00:01:32.130> we're<00:01:32.369> working<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
stuff we're working with you would you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.649 
stuff we're working with you would you
know<00:01:34.920> put<00:01:35.189> typically<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> light<00:01:36.060> base<00:01:36.329> coat

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
know put typically a light base coat

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.850 
know put typically a light base coat
down<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.119> when<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.149> lay<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.930> pattern

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
down on it and when you lay this pattern

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
down on it and when you lay this pattern
actually<00:01:41.340> comes<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> film<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.689> would

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
actually comes on a film which we would

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.350 
actually comes on a film which we would
lay<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.560> water<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.729> basically<00:01:45.119> he

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
lay in a in water it's basically he

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.260 
lay in a in water it's basically he
didn't<00:01:45.600> tank<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.990> water<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.950> sits<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.000> for

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
didn't tank of water it sits there for

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.149 
didn't tank of water it sits there for
one<00:01:48.689> minute<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.229> gets<00:01:49.560> sprayed<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.040> an

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
one minute and gets sprayed with an

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.100 
one minute and gets sprayed with an
activator<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.850> what<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> would<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
activator and what that would do is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.190 
activator and what that would do is
dissolve<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.670> actual<00:01:54.030> film<00:01:54.390> itself<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
dissolve the actual film itself so you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
dissolve the actual film itself so you
what<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.070> ink<00:01:56.340> floating<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
what you have is ink floating on the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.780 
what you have is ink floating on the
water<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.430> particular

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
water and then like with this particular

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.999 
water and then like with this particular
stock<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> actually<00:02:01.500> dip

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
stock you would go in and actually dip

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.399 
stock you would go in and actually dip
the<00:02:02.159> part<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.390> doing<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.990> etching

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the part and what it's doing is etching

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.399 
the part and what it's doing is etching
or<00:02:04.799> embedding<00:02:05.280> itself<00:02:05.460> into<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.299> end<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
or embedding itself into the end of the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.190 
or embedding itself into the end of the
pain<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.369> had<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.329> of<00:02:09.420> an<00:02:09.539> older<00:02:09.780> Johnson

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
pain so I had kind of an older Johnson

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.840 
pain so I had kind of an older Johnson
center<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> muzzleloader<00:02:11.009> barrel<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
center with a muzzleloader barrel and a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.940 
center with a muzzleloader barrel and a

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
short little 20 gauge turkey barrel that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.440 
short little 20 gauge turkey barrel that
I've<00:02:14.070> been<00:02:14.160> hoping<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> little<00:02:15.120> updating

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I've been hoping to do a little updating

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.870 
I've been hoping to do a little updating
to<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.440> process<00:02:16.680> these<00:02:17.070> guys<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:17.519> through<00:02:17.760> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
to this process these guys go through is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.819 
to this process these guys go through is
really<00:02:18.209> pretty<00:02:18.390> interesting<00:02:18.989> once<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> base

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
really pretty interesting once the base

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.590 
really pretty interesting once the base
layer<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.250> put<00:02:20.459> on<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.880> guys<00:02:21.030> will<00:02:21.239> paint<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
layer is put on the guys will paint the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.270 
layer is put on the guys will paint the
gun<00:02:21.840> parts<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.320> well<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.920> they<00:02:23.010> were<00:02:23.070> able<00:02:23.100> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
gun parts as well so they were able to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.860 
gun parts as well so they were able to
take<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.609> ink<00:02:23.790> from<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.180> dipping<00:02:24.630> process

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
take the ink from the dipping process

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.110 
take the ink from the dipping process
the<00:02:25.680> timing<00:02:26.040> has<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.220> be<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.549> right<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.970> make

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the timing has to be just right to make

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.940 
the timing has to be just right to make
this<00:02:27.299> work<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> final<00:02:28.709> product

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this work but to see the final product

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.370 
this work but to see the final product
makes<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.519> all<00:02:29.670> worthwhile<00:02:30.299> but<00:02:31.109> a<00:02:31.170> really

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
makes it all worthwhile but a really

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.780 
makes it all worthwhile but a really
positive<00:02:31.680> response<00:02:32.459> he<00:02:33.030> said<00:02:33.269> we

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
positive response he said we

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.789 
positive response he said we

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
amazed at the quality of the patterns as

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.429 
amazed at the quality of the patterns as
it<00:03:24.730> comes<00:03:24.939> out<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.419> water<00:03:25.689> and<00:03:25.930> just<00:03:26.349> so

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
it comes out of the water and just so

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.659 
it comes out of the water and just so
you<00:03:26.530> know<00:03:26.560> it's<00:03:26.859> easier<00:03:27.189> to<00:03:27.280> tell<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.579> the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
you know it's easier to tell you the

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.670 
you know it's easier to tell you the
patterns<00:03:28.000> they<00:03:28.180> don't<00:03:28.629> have<00:03:28.870> than<00:03:29.409> the<00:03:29.500> ones

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
patterns they don't have than the ones

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.300 
patterns they don't have than the ones
they<00:03:29.889> do<00:03:31.019> there's<00:03:32.019> hundreds<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.859> hundreds<00:03:33.220> of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
they do there's hundreds and hundreds of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.220 
they do there's hundreds and hundreds of
patterns<00:03:33.730> out<00:03:33.939> there<00:03:34.209> we<00:03:34.450> have<00:03:34.659> three

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
patterns out there we have three

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.300 
patterns out there we have three
separate<00:03:35.530> companies<00:03:35.919> that<00:03:36.040> we<00:03:36.159> go<00:03:36.280> through

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
separate companies that we go through

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.869 
separate companies that we go through
that<00:03:36.939> we<00:03:37.450> order<00:03:37.780> patterns<00:03:38.169> from<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.879> each

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
that we order patterns from and each

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.059 
that we order patterns from and each
company<00:03:40.449> probably<00:03:40.720> has<00:03:41.260> over<00:03:41.919> a<00:03:41.949> hundred

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
company probably has over a hundred

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.469 
company probably has over a hundred
patterns<00:03:42.729> available<00:03:44.069> so<00:03:45.069> I<00:03:45.579> mean<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.299> have

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
patterns available so I mean you have
