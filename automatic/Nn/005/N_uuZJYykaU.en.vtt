 existence of strange boxes of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.019

 are completely sealed began to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.619
 appear after a weekend of 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.380
 copious sightings in the sky of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.120
 wide and about 20 high and they emit a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 kind of lament or high tone like the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.559
 described by old stories of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660

 sounds that are heard around the world 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 or something new so far there are 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.219
 several hypotheses about the provenance of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.199
 these mysterious boxes from a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.840
 art exhibition to waste 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.180
 of Japanese disaster of course 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.730
 there are voices that speak of the phenomenon 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.920
 extraterrestrial and UFOs night 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.350
 on Sunday we heard a high- pitched sound and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.990
 penetrating as if it were a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.329
 alarm explained doris to the local newspaper 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.380
 the retiree who lives near this 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.180
 Beach 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 I know that in Estonia field things happen 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 rare but to find a box of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.020
 metal glowing in the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 beach is the last straw added 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.100
 the geologists of the forest service 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.990
 Oregon have been called to try 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.090
 explain what has now been revealed 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.979
 like a series of metal boxes 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.530
 buried in the sand from top to bottom 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.149
 on the Oregon coast and possibly 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.030

 in which the first of these appeared 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.600
 boxes have multiplied their 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.069
 appearances so the marine guard 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.470
 has taken action on the matter 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.440
 trying to collect them before they are 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.970
