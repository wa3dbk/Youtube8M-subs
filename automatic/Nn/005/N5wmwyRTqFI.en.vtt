the thing that I came across to me in
that<00:03:43.159> program<00:03:43.400> was<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:44.269> lack<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.510> transitions

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
that program was the lack of transitions

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.800 
that program was the lack of transitions
and<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.610> lack<00:03:46.849> of<00:03:46.879> choreography<00:03:47.599> in<00:03:47.720> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
and the lack of choreography in the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.339 
and the lack of choreography in the
first<00:03:48.079> half<00:03:48.379> and<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:49.519> really<00:03:49.849> is<00:03:50.180> what

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
first half and that really is what

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.220 
first half and that really is what
separates<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.739> men<00:03:51.769> from<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.939> boys<00:03:53.030> here<00:03:53.629> in

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.150 
second part of the combination axle you
see<00:04:42.980> he<00:04:43.160> makes<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.550> rotation<00:04:44.060> pretty<00:04:44.330> sure

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
see he makes the rotation pretty sure

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.959 
see he makes the rotation pretty sure
just<00:04:46.160> a<00:04:46.280> bit<00:04:46.430> slow<00:04:46.760> down<00:04:46.970> everything<00:04:47.510> back

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
just a bit slow down everything back

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:50.879 
just a bit slow down everything back
and<00:04:49.179> that

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
and that

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.129 
and that
negative<00:04:51.669> rate<00:04:51.879> of<00:04:51.999> exit<00:04:52.240> execution<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:52.930> that

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
negative rate of exit execution on that

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.469 
negative rate of exit execution on that
because<00:04:53.469> of<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:53.710> but<00:04:53.860> then<00:04:54.849> he<00:04:54.999> started<00:04:55.330> to

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
because of it but then he started to

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.600 
because of it but then he started to
sell<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:55.780> program<00:04:56.139> last<00:04:56.560> spin<00:04:56.949> wasn't<00:04:57.370> great

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
sell the program last spin wasn't great

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.439 
sell the program last spin wasn't great
either<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:59.050> that's<00:04:59.259> gonna<00:04:59.439> hurt<00:04:59.650> him<00:05:00.449> his

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
either so that's gonna hurt him his

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.119 
either so that's gonna hurt him his
personal<00:05:01.840> best<00:05:01.990> score<00:05:02.259> is<00:05:02.469> good<00:05:02.889> and<00:05:03.009> I'm

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
personal best score is good and I'm

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.369 
personal best score is good and I'm
getting<00:05:03.430> right<00:05:03.999> up<00:05:04.300> at<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.569> top<00:05:04.659> of<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:05.110> but

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:05.379 
getting right up at the top of this but

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.959 
getting right up at the top of this but
I<00:05:05.680> can't<00:05:06.009> see<00:05:06.249> that<00:05:06.400> mean<00:05:06.639> though<00:05:06.789> they

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
I can't see that mean though they

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:08.790 
I can't see that mean though they
serious<00:05:07.449> politicians<00:05:08.020> no<00:05:08.169> it<00:05:08.289> wasn't<00:05:08.319> as<00:05:08.680> good

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
serious politicians no it wasn't as good

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.059 
serious politicians no it wasn't as good
as<00:05:08.949> Reynolds<00:05:09.219> no<00:05:09.639> well<00:05:10.120> as<00:05:10.300> good<00:05:10.449> as<00:05:10.569> you<00:05:10.689> bear

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
as Reynolds no well as good as you bear

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:18.690 
as Reynolds no well as good as you bear
don't<00:05:12.069> think<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:12.610> I<00:05:13.360> have<00:05:13.599> in<00:05:13.719> third

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.790 

I<00:05:18.820> take<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.480> for<00:05:19.720> sure<00:05:19.750> may<00:05:20.350> become<00:05:20.650> an

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
I take that for sure may become an

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.519 
I take that for sure may become an
amazing

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:34.469 

the<00:05:24.979> score<00:05:25.279> crazy

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479
