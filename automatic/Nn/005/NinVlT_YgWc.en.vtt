 play toy shadow fight 2 this 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.080
 great fighting game with original graphics 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.390
 and with very cool tricks very 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.380
 realistic also present here 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.880
 just cool high-quality physics 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.910
 I have something there now immersed 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.839
 I look here at the record 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.909
 the toy unfortunately does not slow down 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:42.469
 I know why this is so 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:45.409
 slegontsa not too much here that's so 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.949
 we have a character we go are in 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:51.459
 training hall and we are expensive 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.859
 fight different opponents 

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:57.739
 toys are present weapons in which 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.440
 we can buy equipment for weapons 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.589
 our character, that is, these are 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.619
 there are brass knuckles with spikes knives I have already reached 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.960
 such saif also present here 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.329
 look different weapons are gained 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.020
 buy everything for gold also 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:19.729
 weapons can be improved that is 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.219
 have chosen weapons that have already been bought and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.950
 Squeeze the improvement naturally added 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.590
 previous weapon damage is also possible 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.329
 improve but for some reason only ask not 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.420
 I know what it is possible to buy 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.549
 armor a helmet and further there will be shurikens there 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.920
 I still have some chips 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.820
 reached 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.340
 so here we have another skill tree 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.130
 which we can choose two skills from 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.499
 tree but someone channel one skill then 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.170
 further bifurcation that is like a rare 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:55.069
 gets upset and you can buy both 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.109
 generally choose which bonus for you 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.929
 better as there is a variety of punches 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.149
 if you can learn them very well 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.899
 fight and defeat your enemies 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:09.200
 and then immediately there is achievement and well 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.580
 now the very essence of the toy is 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.340
 by myself and min 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.370
 and such a fighting game which is present 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.120
 several modes I mean, here is the hall 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.150
 for training 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.170
 here is a map of this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.630
 first pack 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.460
 that is, there is a lynx here it is the boss 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.130
 win already give a drink all 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.030
 bodyguards and also like this others 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.410
 hermit bosses then from the butcher and have not 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.730
 each of the bosses is present 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.510
 bodyguard let's quickly 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.850
 consider going to fight and now I can 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.850
 fight with the second bodyguard 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:52.850
 this boss is such a healthy one 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:55.790
 dude in this so spheres with so cool 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.730
 called m brick i mean it's him 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:04.760
 such a nickname so I do not know for a long time 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.140
 loaded thing toy really slow down 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.410
 On the record, I already tried everything in 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.300
 settings but for some reason she doesn't want 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.519
 work better i just really like 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.470
 show you this game to you 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.900
 necessarily and not missed those who are still 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.130
 didn't play 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:32.930
 throwing our enemy down kick it 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:37.070
 double tackle in my here see the enemy 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.739
 our wins very hard hitting him 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.019
 very tough by the way with such brakes 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.459
 in principle, you can also go cool as 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:50.600
 already clearly visible what the enemy does if 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.820
 prilovchilis to this you can win and I 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.920
 now dropped the weapon ie the enemy 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.000
 applied some special gift i dropped 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.860
 their 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.030
 king fights go on two rounds so 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.940
 let's go out and consider another mode 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.760
 surviving in this mode we just 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.040
 earn gold that is then enemies 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.780
 go one after another the more Europe 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.510
 in a row you win the more gold 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.220
 earn and life you have one 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.850
 and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.470
 as if they are not replenished with each 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.440
 blow you dial 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:33.980
 evil its part on hard in my opinion 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:36.680
 affects damage just like you in any 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.160
 fighting games here are a lot of blows but by the way they 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.420
 not so much as in some fights 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.780
 4 button which looks more like 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.780
 classic it's still a fighting game for 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.850
 android devices but what good is that 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:59.500
 that here everything is very adapted cool 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:03.080
 that is, it is not some 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.520
 slasher real fighting game with cool 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.580
 animation and cool physics here 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.900
 realistic jumps and kicks there everything 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.160
 cool overall done how cool it is 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.350
 got it all due to 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.930
 brakes and I could predict it 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:27.260
 This jump with a turn repulsed as immediately 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.120
 same we rush into battle and this is impossible 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.120
 this more than three help won 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 backlight 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.750
 chick recited 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:59.919
 I need to listen to the perfect class more often 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:03.880
 playing this recording game is real here 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:07.720
 it turns out the girl can not 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.930
 and the men understood well, so I understand they are here 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.320
 all the same already very tough with time 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:28.570
 we become on the ridge I charged straight 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:39.729
 from the sneaker the guy managed to get through he repulsed 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:45.010
 my hit oops and now with a jump again 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:47.400
 like this and background powerful life a little 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.400
 highly 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.380
 killed me that okay earned money here 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.060
 such a regime for each will be spent 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.950
 energy that is you cannot endlessly 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:02.200
 fight is the biggest minus of the game 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:06.550
 Well, of course, even the last mode is 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.680
 tournament mode here you fight with 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:13.210
 opponents that time after time 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.490
 become more powerful and they can all at once 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.440
 constantly changing, too, different from them 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:22.660
 drove here this vulture is coming now 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.340
 against us with knives but here pro if already 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.200
 can't move in current 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.720
 survival earns money there and 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:35.830
 do your listening just 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:40.600

 I apologize for the brakes of course but very much 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.210
 I wanted to review this
