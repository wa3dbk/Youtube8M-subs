00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.030
 Make up our nails beautifully 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.610
 we are going to need the enamels of 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.459
 our favorite colors and I 'm going to 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.070
 choose two that are especially for 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.260
 decorating the nails I will also choose 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.330
 two other enamels that contrast with 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.029
 the first ones because we do not want that 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.439
 our scenery miss we're going to 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.199
 choose a varnish that are these 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.800
 transparent with brightness and already you what 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.350
 you want to use to decorate peter 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.030
 little stars and we will need a 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:43.120
 clear varnish and a quick dryer 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.920
 let's start let's paint all 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 our nails in a normal way 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.640
 a tumor 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.140
 This tone is from my south and well I see it 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.270
 like the color of a gum of those 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.120
 normal is the color rosita of the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.640
 chewing gums 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.450
 and I like them very much I feel that he gives 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.230
 A lot of sight to our little hands I go 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.850
 to leave an unpainted fingernail and I'll 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.840
 continue painting normal 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 the other nails 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.500
 when I have all the nails painted 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.119
 except one that leaves the one you want without 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.070
 paint 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.030
 let's use a varnish that is 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.030
 transparent 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.939
 or some varnish that you have of these 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.729
 which are like acrylic or encapsulated 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.549
 all these things can serve us 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.179
 and if you only have a shine too 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.179
 can you put it 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.760
 we put it on the nail that we do not paint 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.610
 in each of the spaces 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.170
 and we are going to occupy a color leader 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.170
 favorite that we want 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.330
 and we 're going to sprinkle 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.760
 covering very well each hole of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.770
 our nail do not want us to stay 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.140
 how little eyes without glitters 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.960
 and in whatever a little bit we're going to give it 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.010
 a second layer to our nails and 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.010
 before painted 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.690
 and well when we finish we are going to shake a 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.470
 little bit our nail with the iter we are going to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.470
 remove the excess 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.010
 and something like that remains 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.840
 since we have our little hand so 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 let it dry very well and 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.140
 we go with the other 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.970
 remember very well close your 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.850
 glazes because we do not want to be 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.430
 make them all ugly 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.220
 I'm going to use a purple color here but 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.630
 as metallic and we will do the same 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.420
 what we did in the other hand 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.960
 paint all our nails less 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.960
 a 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.300
 and at the end they already know some 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.660
 clear varnish or this acrylic or 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.610
 whatever it is in the one that we do not paint 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.610
 to also put a little glitter 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.620
 only here I will occupy little color 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.659
 blue 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.659
 and soak in my half 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.910
 and all that remains is to remove the excess 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.850
 little bit with the help of a little finger or I do not know 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.220
 some stick what you want to use 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.500
 to remove the excess you know not you 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.040
 They must be small holes in all your 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.040
 pretty 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.759
 since they are completely dry 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.449
 let's start decorating them I'm going to 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.310
 occupy my varnish this special and I'll 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.979
 try to make a kind of like 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.340
 hearts I do not have anything perfect 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.919
 because I'm not a specialist in this but 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.330
 Well, if you are not good at drawing or 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.009
 things like that are going to look good 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.610
 Also if you are a little funny, do not 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.610
 import 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:55.670
 you can make hearts oyenart nail of 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.450
 little dots or puppy tracks I do not know 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.010
 some bears penguins whatever you want 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.890
 I chose hearts because it's like 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.440
 easier I'm not very good at this 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.520
 nail designs and because that's what 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.520
 it's easier for me 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.059
 and take your time, be you pressed 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.639
 because if you press you will leave 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:26.009
 all wrong and you're going to get angry and you're going to 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.300
 sell things and do not have to be 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.689
 quiet and all the things without any 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.689
 Pressure 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.729
 very well then there would be something like that 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:53.130
 As you can see my hearts are not so 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.130
 perfect but I swear I tried 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.490
 now the same in the other hand 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.860
 this is a varnish like pink and 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.580
 He also says hearts and I stayed 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.099
 something like that they do not distinguish much but 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:11.039
 because they are pink hearts they did not see them 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.659
 it's just like the edge now 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.580
 that are very very dry 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.709
 we have to wait for them to be very very 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.110
 very dry because otherwise we would throw it 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.449
 lose everything we will occupy our 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.680
 varnish this transparent with little 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.370
 glitter 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.280
 and we are going to give a single layer on each nail 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:34.440
 because if we give two I would pay the 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.440
 little hearts that we put before 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.110
 and then a single layer and thin 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.090
 it is only to have flashes 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.750
 not what we or others 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.750
 hearts 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.080
 and the same in our other hand 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.230
 very well now with our dryer let's go 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:24.220
 to put 2 to 3 layers on our 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.220
 nails with glitter 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.110
 this is so that they do not fall off so 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.980
 fast the brightness these signs last you 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.750
 of 3 to 4 days and this because nothing else 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.960
 only one that has glitter is the one that 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.480
 so you do not want to fall faster 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.020
 the other pretty that would last two 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.020
 weeks 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:01.839
 and then after doing the latter 

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:05.099
 step that's all already you only have 

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:08.099
 to wait for it to dry on your nails 

00:08:05.099 --> 00:08:08.099
 bye
