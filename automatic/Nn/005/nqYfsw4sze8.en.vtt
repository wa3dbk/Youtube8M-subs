doors<00:00:19.439> warp<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.369> different<00:00:20.670> ways

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
doors warp in a lot of different ways

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.200 
doors warp in a lot of different ways
that<00:00:22.070> happens<00:00:23.070> if<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> wood<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.550> not<00:00:23.699> totally

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
that happens if the wood is not totally

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.089 
that happens if the wood is not totally
dry<00:00:24.480> sometimes<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.230> depends<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
dry sometimes it depends a lot on the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.830 
dry sometimes it depends a lot on the
weather<00:00:26.279> humidity<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.060> lot<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> those<00:00:27.570> things

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
weather humidity a lot of those things

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.550 
weather humidity a lot of those things
that<00:00:27.960> happen<00:00:28.410> depending<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.490> where<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.789> live

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
now now this specific door we would

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
now now this specific door we would
actually<00:00:33.960> replace<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> new<00:00:35.460> one

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
actually replace it just get a new one

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.430 
actually replace it just get a new one
replace<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:36.690> worth<00:00:36.960> messing<00:00:37.380> with

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
replace it it's not worth messing with

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.930 
replace it it's not worth messing with
the<00:00:37.620> crack<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> continue<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the crack it's going to continue to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
the crack it's going to continue to
cause<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> problems<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.850> how

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
cause you problems just because how

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.950 
cause you problems just because how
severe<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.629> work<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.320> warping<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.960> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
severe the work the warping is so the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
severe the work the warping is so the
other<00:00:46.110> thing<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> hap<00:00:47.160> has<00:00:47.399> happened

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
other thing that is the hap has happened

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.299 
other thing that is the hap has happened
with<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.000> particular<00:00:48.210> door<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.860> warped

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
with this particular door is it's warped

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
with this particular door is it's warped
in<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> direction<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.780> middle

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
in this direction so that this middle

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.010 
in this direction so that this middle
this<00:00:52.620> middle<00:00:52.949> panel<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.430> shrunk<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
this middle panel has shrunk and so that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.689 
this middle panel has shrunk and so that
we<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.289> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.680> step<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.489> right

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
we have kind of a step going on right

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.720 
we have kind of a step going on right
there<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> side<00:00:58.980> style

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
there going in to the to the side style

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
there going in to the to the side style
there<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> would<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there so what I would do with that is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740 
there so what I would do with that is
that<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.370> small<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.000> piece<00:01:03.210> I'd<00:01:03.390> actually

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
that that small of a piece I'd actually

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
that that small of a piece I'd actually
just<00:01:03.930> sand<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> down<00:01:04.430> looking<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
just sand it down looking at this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
just sand it down looking at this
warping<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.900> too<00:01:07.140> severe<00:01:07.470> on

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
warping it's not it's not too severe on

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
warping it's not it's not too severe on
this<00:01:07.770> particular<00:01:08.280> door<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> little

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this particular door if it was a little

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.510 
this particular door if it was a little
bit<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.470> than<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.740> we'd<00:01:10.979> probably<00:01:11.159> cut<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
bit more than that we'd probably cut it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
bit more than that we'd probably cut it
on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> saw<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.510> sand<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> make<00:01:13.200> sure

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
on the saw and then sand it to make sure

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.320 
on the saw and then sand it to make sure
that<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.710> good<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that it was good to go on this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
that it was good to go on this
particular<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.530> sand<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
particular one I'm just going to sand it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.740 
particular one I'm just going to sand it
so<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.950> sand<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.400> off<00:01:20.750> we're<00:01:21.750> gonna<00:01:21.840> sand

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
so as we sand that off we're gonna sand

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.990 
so as we sand that off we're gonna sand
sandesh<00:01:24.410> so<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:24.710> it's<00:01:24.860> flush<00:01:25.160> with<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.550> with

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
sandesh so that it's flush with the with

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.350 
sandesh so that it's flush with the with
the<00:01:26.150> peace<00:01:26.360> tax<00:01:26.630> do<00:01:26.870> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.290 

making<00:01:34.110> sure<00:01:34.140> that

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
making sure that

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:44.850 
making sure that
holding<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.780> sander<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.380> good<00:01:37.560> position

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:54.810 

a<00:01:46.230> little<00:01:47.230> bit<00:01:47.350> more

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.789 

there<00:01:55.820> we<00:01:55.939> go<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.810> went<00:01:56.990> out<00:01:57.080> after<00:01:57.619> we

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
there we go and that went out after we

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.320 
there we go and that went out after we
sanded<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.280> down<00:01:58.520> we<00:01:58.729> can<00:01:58.970> see<00:01:59.150> now<00:01:59.299> that

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
sanded that down we can see now that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.200 
sanded that down we can see now that
it's<00:01:59.630> flush<00:01:59.900> on<00:02:00.140> this<00:02:00.320> side<00:02:00.970> we'd<00:02:01.970> go<00:02:02.119> ahead

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
it's flush on this side we'd go ahead

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.210 
it's flush on this side we'd go ahead
and<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.869> do<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.049> round<00:02:03.320> over<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.799> then<00:02:03.890> apply

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
and just do a round over and then apply

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.499
