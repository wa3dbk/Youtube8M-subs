00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
about this because they didn't know what

it was for and to be honest I had no
idea<00:00:40.999> either<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.469> I've<00:00:42.800> been<00:00:43.249> looking<00:00:43.519> into<00:00:43.670> it

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
idea either so I've been looking into it

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.279 
idea either so I've been looking into it

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.090 
and THQ did not release any information
about<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.449> so<00:00:50.449> I<00:00:50.480> started<00:00:51.289> playing<00:00:51.559> game<00:00:52.069> a

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
about it and so I started playing game a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.160 
about it and so I started playing game a
little<00:00:52.429> bit<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.850> trying<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:53.600> see<00:00:53.899> if<00:00:54.019> I<00:00:54.109> would

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
little bit and trying to see if I would

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.099 
little bit and trying to see if I would
notice<00:00:54.559> anything<00:00:54.890> different<00:00:55.329> and<00:00:56.329> tell<00:00:57.019> you

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
notice anything different and tell you

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.099

the<00:00:57.140> truth<00:00:57.409> it's<00:00:57.589> all<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.859> same<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:58.429> mean<00:00:59.179> the

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
the truth it's all the same I mean the

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.549 
the truth it's all the same I mean the
bike<00:01:00.319> ride<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:01.129> same<00:01:01.539> do<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.659> rider<00:01:02.929> gestures

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
bike ride the same do the rider gestures

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.630 
bike ride the same do the rider gestures
are<00:01:03.800> all<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.070> same<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:05.650> like<00:01:06.650> his<00:01:07.040> movement

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
are all the same and like his movement

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.240 
are all the same and like his movement
didn't<00:01:08.450> change<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.290> bikes<00:01:09.500> I'll<00:01:09.710> handle<00:01:10.100> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
didn't change the bikes I'll handle the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.350 
didn't change the bikes I'll handle the
same<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.450> only<00:01:11.479> difference<00:01:11.750> was<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.290> DLCs

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
same the only difference was the DLCs

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.420 
same the only difference was the DLCs
now<00:01:14.360> on<00:01:14.570> ps3<00:01:14.930> they're<00:01:15.470> having<00:01:15.830> some<00:01:15.980> trouble

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
now on ps3 they're having some trouble

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.390 
now on ps3 they're having some trouble
this<00:01:17.300> whole<00:01:17.360> Stewart<00:01:17.930> compound<00:01:18.440> thing<00:01:18.680> if<00:01:19.220> you

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
this whole Stewart compound thing if you

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.190 
this whole Stewart compound thing if you
use<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.640> Moto<00:01:20.240> club<00:01:20.660> pro<00:01:21.160> access<00:01:22.160> code<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:23.200> so

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
use the Moto club pro access code and so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.110 
use the Moto club pro access code and so
I'm<00:01:24.290> assuming<00:01:24.410> it<00:01:24.830> had<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.280> little<00:01:25.730> bit<00:01:25.910> of<00:01:25.940> the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
I'm assuming it had a little bit of the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.730 
I'm assuming it had a little bit of the
patch<00:01:26.330> had<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.750> do<00:01:26.900> with<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.050> trying<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.620> get

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
patch had to do with that trying to get

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.990 
patch had to do with that trying to get
that<00:01:27.890> fixed<00:01:28.370> and<00:01:30.100> also<00:01:31.100> i'm<00:01:31.220> assuming<00:01:31.460> some<00:01:31.880> of

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
that fixed and also i'm assuming some of

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.130 
that fixed and also i'm assuming some of
it<00:01:32.680> was<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.920> make<00:01:34.100> available<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.730> or<00:01:35.660> to

it was to make available the or to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.990 
it was to make available the or to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
they actually have to have them built

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.130 
they actually have to have them built
into<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.310> game<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.880> then<00:01:44.210> when<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.540> buy<00:01:44.780> them

this<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.349> my<00:02:15.590> best<00:02:15.890> guess<00:02:16.300> I'm<00:02:17.300> assuming<00:02:18.050> that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
this is my best guess I'm assuming that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.809 
this is my best guess I'm assuming that
it<00:02:18.290> has<00:02:18.440> something<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.950> do<00:02:19.069> with<00:02:19.250> Supercross

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
it has something to do with Supercross

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.650 
it has something to do with Supercross
I'm<00:02:21.069> guessing<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.099> they<00:02:22.489> have<00:02:22.910> finished<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I'm guessing that they have finished the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.259 
I'm guessing that they have finished the
Supercross<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:24.530> come<00:02:25.069> very<00:02:25.250> close<00:02:25.549> it's<00:02:26.060> about

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
Supercross or come very close it's about

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.300 
Supercross or come very close it's about
ready<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:28.640> was<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.819> download<00:02:29.330> to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
ready and so that was a download to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.490 
ready and so that was a download to
include<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.700> game<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.209> then<00:02:32.720> when

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
include that in the game and then when

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.660 
include that in the game and then when
they<00:02:33.530> decide<00:02:34.010> when<00:02:34.190> they're<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.459> to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
they decide when they're going to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.030 
they decide when they're going to
release<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.299> then<00:02:35.780> it'll<00:02:35.989> just<00:02:36.230> don't<00:02:36.829> make<00:02:36.980> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
release it then it'll just don't make it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.559 
release it then it'll just don't make it
so<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.340> just<00:02:37.489> shows<00:02:37.549> up<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.120> store<00:02:38.360> and

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
so it just shows up in the store and

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.949 
so it just shows up in the store and
it's<00:02:38.720> another<00:02:38.900> 100<00:02:39.440> kb<00:02:39.860> download<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:41.420> activate

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
it's another 100 kb download to activate

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.680 
it's another 100 kb download to activate
it<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.459> i'm<00:02:43.519> assuming<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:44.180> was<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
it and so i'm assuming it was the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.770 
it and so i'm assuming it was the
Supercross<00:02:45.319> Adam<00:02:46.360> that's<00:02:47.360> what<00:02:47.569> I'm<00:02:47.630> hoping

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
Supercross Adam that's what I'm hoping

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.000 
Supercross Adam that's what I'm hoping
anyways<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.590> would<00:02:48.709> be<00:02:48.799> nice<00:02:49.040> if<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.599> then<00:02:51.019> I<00:02:51.410> I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
anyways I would be nice if not then I I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.520 
anyways I would be nice if not then I I
really<00:02:52.700> don't<00:02:52.880> know<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.269> mean<00:02:53.599> that's<00:02:53.750> pretty

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
really don't know I mean that's pretty

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.690 
really don't know I mean that's pretty
big<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:56.079> for<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.200> last<00:02:57.410> big<00:02:57.799> patch<00:02:58.190> they<00:02:58.519> made

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
big and for the last big patch they made

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.640 
big and for the last big patch they made
they<00:02:58.910> actually<00:02:59.360> released<00:02:59.870> information<00:03:00.260> about

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
they actually released information about

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.400 
they actually released information about
what<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.069> did<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:02.390> could<00:03:02.540> notice<00:03:02.750> like<00:03:03.260> I

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
what it did and you could notice like I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.789 
what it did and you could notice like I
noticed<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.400> last<00:03:04.730> patch<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.470> bike

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
noticed at the last patch like the bike

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.190 
noticed at the last patch like the bike
gyro<00:03:07.400> effect<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.970> everything<00:03:08.359> brake<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.170> gas

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
gyro effect and everything brake and gas

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.530 
gyro effect and everything brake and gas
gyros<00:03:09.859> it<00:03:10.579> actually<00:03:10.700> made<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.030> difference<00:03:11.420> in

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
gyros it actually made a difference in

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.670 
gyros it actually made a difference in
riding<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:15.200> there's<00:03:15.560> no<00:03:15.620> difference<00:03:16.190> so

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
riding and this there's no difference so

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.500 
riding and this there's no difference so
that's<00:03:18.680> about<00:03:19.220> all<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.549> information<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.209> have

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
that's about all the information I have

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.129 
that's about all the information I have
I<00:03:20.930> mean<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> whole<00:03:23.269> supergross<00:03:23.840> thing

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
I mean like the whole supergross thing

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.569 
I mean like the whole supergross thing
that's<00:03:24.380> not<00:03:24.530> confirmed<00:03:24.920> or<00:03:25.190> anything<00:03:25.459> that's

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
that's not confirmed or anything that's

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.759 
that's not confirmed or anything that's
just<00:03:25.880> me<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.660> know<00:03:26.720> throwing<00:03:27.109> ideas<00:03:27.319> out

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
just me you know throwing ideas out

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.340 
just me you know throwing ideas out
there<00:03:28.269> that's<00:03:29.269> what<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.540> believe<00:03:29.660> it's<00:03:30.109> for

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
there that's what I believe it's for

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.650 
there that's what I believe it's for
they<00:03:31.280> probably<00:03:31.549> finished<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.150> Supercross

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
they probably finished the Supercross

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.589 
they probably finished the Supercross
and<00:03:32.690> that's<00:03:33.049> going<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.260> be<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.410> big<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.480> a

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
and that's going to be a big that is a

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.080 
and that's going to be a big that is a
big<00:03:35.900> part<00:03:36.109> of<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.319> game<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.530> mean<00:03:36.829> ding<00:03:37.090> throw

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
big part of the game I mean ding throw

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.370 
big part of the game I mean ding throw
something<00:03:38.420> like<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.870> there<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:39.139> so<00:03:39.230> that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
something like that in there and so that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.430 
something like that in there and so that
would<00:03:39.470> need<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.680> big<00:03:39.950> patch<00:03:40.389> and<00:03:41.389> so<00:03:42.349> I'm

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
would need a big patch and so I'm

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.319 
would need a big patch and so I'm
thinking<00:03:42.739> that's<00:03:42.829> what<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.130> was<00:03:43.190> for<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.790> way

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
thinking that's what it was for that way

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.960 
thinking that's what it was for that way
when<00:03:44.599> they<00:03:44.750> actually<00:03:45.139> release<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.980> it'll<00:03:46.760> just

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
when they actually release it it'll just

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.199 
when they actually release it it'll just
be<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.180> 100<00:03:47.780> kb<00:03:48.340> activation<00:03:49.340> download<00:03:49.940> thing

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
be a 100 kb activation download thing
