understand the demolition is like a game
of<00:00:36.809> tug-of-war<00:00:37.640> that's<00:00:38.640> pretty<00:00:39.000> much<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
of tug-of-war that's pretty much what is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
of tug-of-war that's pretty much what is
just<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:40.160> it's<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> lot<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.550> searching

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
just like it's got a lot of searching

destroy<00:00:42.120> characteristics<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> most

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
destroy characteristics but for the most

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
destroy characteristics but for the most
part<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> tug-of-war<00:00:44.329> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.750> push<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
part it's a tug-of-war you can push the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
part it's a tug-of-war you can push the
enemy<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.559> their<00:00:46.829> spawn<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.489> keep<00:00:48.120> them

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
enemy into their spawn and keep them

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.900 
enemy into their spawn and keep them
there<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> push<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
there and they have to push out and to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.939 
there and they have to push out and to
push<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.449> pushing<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.870> back<00:00:52.079> into<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
push out there pushing you back into I

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.080 
push out there pushing you back into I
guess<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> reverse<00:00:54.449> tug-of-war

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
guess would be a reverse tug-of-war

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.760 
guess would be a reverse tug-of-war
they'd<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.360> push<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.230> firing

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
they'd have to push you out on firing

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.080 
they'd have to push you out on firing
range<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.180> defensive<00:01:01.109> side<00:01:01.789> most<00:01:02.789> likely

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
couple reasons the construction building

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.609 
couple reasons the construction building
has<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> very<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:09.119> overlook<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> they

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
has a very good overlook on a and they

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.570 
has a very good overlook on a and they
have<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.830> go<00:01:10.979> through<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.340> construction

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
have to go through the construction

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.600 
have to go through the construction
building<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.240> gives<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> bandage<00:01:13.080> spot

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610

the<00:01:14.610> offensive<00:01:15.090> team<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.420> firing<00:01:15.659> range<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the offensive team on firing range is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.270 
the offensive team on firing range is
already<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> disadvantage<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:17.040> they

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
already at a disadvantage because they

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.630 
already at a disadvantage because they
start<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.640> low<00:01:17.820> ground<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:19.220> they<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
start on low ground and they have the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.340 
start on low ground and they have the
access<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.299> sea<00:01:21.509> container<00:01:21.900> which<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
access to this sea container which you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
access to this sea container which you
shoot<00:01:22.530> me<00:01:22.650> shoot<00:01:22.680> through<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:23.840> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
shoot me shoot through right now that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
shoot me shoot through right now that
they<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.680> funnel<00:01:25.920> through<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.340> quickly

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
they can funnel through really quickly

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.090 
they can funnel through really quickly
before<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.360> counteract<00:01:27.780> them<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100

every<00:04:12.439> time<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.620> killed<00:04:12.890> somebody<00:04:13.239> because<00:04:14.239> the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
every time I killed somebody because the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.150 
every time I killed somebody because the
number<00:04:14.569> one<00:04:14.720> way<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:14.959> die<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.560> this<00:04:15.680> game<00:04:15.950> is

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
number one way I die in this game is

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.550 
number one way I die in this game is
staying<00:04:17.090> overstayed<00:04:17.720> my<00:04:17.750> welcome<00:04:17.900> in<00:04:18.320> zones

staying overstayed my welcome in zones

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.550 
staying overstayed my welcome in zones
and<00:04:19.120> firing<00:04:20.120> range<00:04:20.329> is<00:04:20.479> really<00:04:20.959> bad<00:04:21.139> for<00:04:21.380> that

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
and firing range is really bad for that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.100 
and firing range is really bad for that
because<00:04:21.769> it's<00:04:22.100> such<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.310> small<00:04:22.520> map<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.630> being<00:04:23.990> a

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
small map means as soon as you kill

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.330 
small map means as soon as you kill
somebody<00:04:26.900> they're<00:04:27.259> almost<00:04:27.560> ready<00:04:27.949> to<00:04:28.160> come

this<00:06:35.819> is<00:06:36.000> a<00:06:36.029> very<00:06:36.240> bad<00:06:36.360> move<00:06:36.719> on<00:06:36.839> their<00:06:36.900> team

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.990 
this is a very bad move on their team
and<00:06:37.229> I<00:06:37.409> guess<00:06:37.919> save<00:06:38.129> right<00:06:38.370> there<00:06:38.580> because<00:06:38.759> the

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
and I guess save right there because the

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.519 
and I guess save right there because the
guy<00:06:39.120> decided<00:06:39.539> to<00:06:39.629> use<00:06:39.719> an<00:06:39.839> olympia<00:06:40.289> which

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
guy decided to use an olympia which

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:43.550 
guy decided to use an olympia which
horrible<00:06:41.460> decision<00:06:41.940> and<00:06:42.150> i<00:06:42.990> have<00:06:43.110> a<00:06:43.139> teammate

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
horrible decision and i have a teammate

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.070 
horrible decision and i have a teammate
saved<00:06:43.919> me<00:06:44.069> right<00:06:44.279> here<00:06:44.699> as<00:06:45.330> i<00:06:45.539> expected<00:06:45.960> him

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
saved me right here as i expected him

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.390

come<00:06:46.229> out<00:06:46.319> this<00:06:46.409> backdoor<00:06:46.650> but<00:06:47.069> he<00:06:47.250> actually

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
come out this backdoor but he actually

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.129 
come out this backdoor but he actually
double<00:06:47.879> tracks<00:06:48.120> he<00:06:48.240> comes<00:06:48.419> back<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:48.990> he

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
double tracks he comes back and he

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.329 
double tracks he comes back and he
probably<00:06:49.529> would<00:06:49.770> have<00:06:49.830> killed<00:06:50.009> me<00:06:50.159> if<00:06:50.190> you

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:50.339 
probably would have killed me if you

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.510 
probably would have killed me if you
look<00:06:50.520> to<00:06:50.699> the<00:06:50.729> right<00:06:51.000> and<00:06:51.919> i<00:06:52.919> can<00:06:53.069> hit<00:06:53.190> again

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
look to the right and i can hit again

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.089 
look to the right and i can hit again
but<00:06:54.360> that's<00:06:54.779> the<00:06:54.960> making<00:06:55.229> them<00:06:55.349> a<00:06:55.409> 44<00:06:55.919> and

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099 
but that's the making them a 44 and

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:57.800 
but that's the making them a 44 and
three<00:06:56.400> you<00:06:56.879> want<00:06:57.089> to<00:06:57.180> kind<00:06:57.360> of<00:06:57.449> think<00:06:57.629> of<00:06:57.750> the

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
three you want to kind of think of the

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.339 
three you want to kind of think of the
the<00:06:58.319> whole<00:06:58.800> match<00:06:59.039> as<00:06:59.419> like<00:07:00.419> a<00:07:00.569> field<00:07:00.930> we<00:07:01.229> have

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
to pay tug-of-war at and b is very

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.869 
to pay tug-of-war at and b is very

important a lot of people because b is

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.999 
important a lot of people because b is
