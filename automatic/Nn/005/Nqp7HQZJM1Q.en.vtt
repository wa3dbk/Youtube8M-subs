of times people buy it by the quart so

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.280 
of times people buy it by the quart so
it<00:02:12.370> just<00:02:12.700> makes<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> easier<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.569> say<00:02:13.780> 2<00:02:13.840> cups

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it just makes it easier to say 2 cups

it just makes it easier to say 2 cups
and<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:15.700> 4<00:02:16.000> chicken<00:02:16.390> bowl
