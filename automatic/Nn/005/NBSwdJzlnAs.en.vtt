00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:13.460
 I'm going to prepare baked turbot for 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:20.500
 I need a turbot that is already 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:27.130
 clean parsley lemon potatoes onion salt 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:29.780
 oil white wine paprika garlic and lemon 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.710
 I'm going to dedicate this recipe to my 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.829
 friend who is the fishmonger and who has 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.409
 a fish fish that excellent and has 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.409
 I was given this precious I 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.530
 The first thing we have done is to strip the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.100
 potatoes wash them and cut them into slices 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.050
 not very stiff about half a centimeter and 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.020
 we do the same with the onion we have 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.220
 cut into segments and now both 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.130
 together we're going to half fry them in a 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.190
 frying pan with oil we will discard a 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.990
 little salt and you do not have to fry them 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.010
 completely because then in the oven it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.470
 will finish doing simply that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.990
 begin to brown a little bit and when 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.450
 let's see that they begin to brown 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.520
 we will go to the source where then 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.520
 bake we have everything together 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.500
 here we have the oven source already with 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.540
 the half fried potatoes and the onion 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.540
 now on top we will put the turbot 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.290
 in the mortar that we have crushed a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.780
 garlic clove and a handful of parsley 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.050
 once we had him crushed him 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.770
 we have added a small tip of 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.810
 paprika and a little bit of oil 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.360
 then removed well and now all this 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.210
 chopped 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.340
 we're going to put it to the turbot 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.020
 above as you see 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.380
 I have already placed the turbot on top of 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.520
 the potatoes and the onion is not salty 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.780
 on both sides 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.780
 and in the openings 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.000
 they are made on the spine because I have put 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.160
 lemon slices 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.069
 So now let's take the tooted 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.829
 what I have told you 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.590
 and the oven we have it preheating to 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.530
 200 degrees 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.220
 and now we only have left 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.340
 put a bunch of wine over it 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.340
 White 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.940
 it's like it has the bite above 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.160
 so now let's add the bitch 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.650
 dita of white wine with it we get 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.860
 Do not dry the fish by having 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.920
 caldito in the tray then let's 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.350
 put it on once I have heated the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.140
 oven we have put the tray in the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.200
 second height below and we're going to 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.880
 to have like half an hour because this was rolling 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.010
 I weighed approximately 900 grams 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.890
 now he only has 5 minutes left 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.280
 finish and what I have done is upload a 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.470
 height the baking tray so that it 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 brown on the skin 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.830
 then the turbot we already have it 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.410
 done but now I want the skin 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.750
 is a little bit more toasted, so 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.930
 last five minutes up 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.910
 and finally we have here our 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.560
 baked turbot with potatoes and 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.930
 Onions the aspect says it all 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.519
 verification that it is already done 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.430
 is that the head separates very 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.950
 easily from the body 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.950
 Well now to eat
