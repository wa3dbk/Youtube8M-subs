behind this forklift and just lie down
you<00:02:13.260> don't<00:02:13.440> need<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.710> yyo<00:02:14.310> anything<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
you don't need to yyo anything but you

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.630 
you don't need to yyo anything but you
get<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> pretty<00:02:15.960> clear<00:02:16.080> view<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> bomb<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
then just run round backwards through

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.530 
then just run round backwards through
where<00:02:19.740> they've<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.280> come<00:02:20.460> from<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.940> then

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
where they've just come from and then

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.979 
where they've just come from and then
you<00:02:21.660> can<00:02:21.840> diffuse<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.159> second<00:02:23.819> spot<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.239> in

you can diffuse the second spot is in
this<00:02:25.319> corner<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.040> either<00:02:26.159> do

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
a statue or lie down and why why I'd

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.920 
a statue or lie down and why why I'd
suggest<00:02:30.670> why<00:02:30.879> wine<00:02:31.120> from<00:02:31.390> here<00:02:31.629> because
