00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
explode just next to the workbench you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.590 
explode just next to the workbench you
can<00:01:38.610> very<00:01:38.880> quickly<00:01:39.680> reassemble<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.979> chat<00:01:41.310> gun

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600

if a part falls into lava and the part

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.359 
if a part falls into lava and the part
will<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:46.079> destroyed<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.649> respawn

at<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.880> origin<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:49.020> example<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.560> engine

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
at the origin so for example this engine

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.940 
at the origin so for example this engine
will<00:01:50.250> respawn<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.180> tunnel<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:52.860> you

powerup like double points or so this

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
but actually has no practical use now we

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.690 
but actually has no practical use now we
use<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.900> chat<00:02:19.140> gun<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.590> very<00:02:19.800> specific<00:02:20.100> way

and that's quite a long time you can't

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.039 
and that's quite a long time you can't
move<00:03:23.579> by<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.880> chat<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.360> charge<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.900> it's

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
move by the chat on this charge so it's

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.110 
move by the chat on this charge so it's
also<00:03:25.230> more<00:03:25.620> dangerous<00:03:26.070> than<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.340> old<00:03:26.549> usage

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
also more dangerous than this old usage

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.240 
also more dangerous than this old usage
and<00:03:27.269> it's<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:28.019> very<00:03:28.140> slower<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.950> don't

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
and it's it's very slower and I don't

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.310 
and it's it's very slower and I don't
really<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.570> can<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.110> if

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
really like this but you can do it if

you still save a lot of ammo of your

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.760 
you still save a lot of ammo of your
regen<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.780> yeah<00:05:06.780> it's<00:05:06.900> very<00:05:06.960> safe<00:05:07.350> to<00:05:07.410> use

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
regen and yeah it's very safe to use

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.270 
regen and yeah it's very safe to use
here<00:05:08.250> we<00:05:08.280> do<00:05:08.580> not<00:05:08.760> have<00:05:08.970> to<00:05:09.800> keep<00:05:10.800> your<00:05:11.039> focus

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
here we do not have to keep your focus

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.790 
here we do not have to keep your focus
on<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.639> narrow<00:05:11.910> spot<00:05:12.300> or<00:05:12.539> so<00:05:12.720> because<00:05:12.900> crawlers

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
on a narrow spot or so because crawlers

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.860 
on a narrow spot or so because crawlers
do<00:05:14.039> not<00:05:14.190> hit<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.760> fast<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.360> they<00:05:15.780> are

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
do not hit you that fast and they are

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.480 
do not hit you that fast and they are
not<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.500> big<00:05:16.740> danger

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
not that a big danger

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.790 
not that a big danger
so<00:05:17.669> making<00:05:17.910> crawlers<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:18.720> then<00:05:18.900> use<00:05:19.530> their

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
so making crawlers and then use their

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.129 
so making crawlers and then use their
chat<00:05:20.130> cam<00:05:20.310> for<00:05:20.760> them<00:05:20.970> is<00:05:21.180> actually<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> quite

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
chat cam for them is actually a quite

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.890 
chat cam for them is actually a quite
nice<00:05:22.380> strategy<00:05:23.099> the<00:05:23.910> problem<00:05:24.330> with<00:05:24.570> all<00:05:24.750> of

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
nice strategy the problem with all of

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.960 
nice strategy the problem with all of
these<00:05:25.020> is<00:05:25.229> just<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.680> after<00:05:25.979> two<00:05:26.610> births

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
these is just that after two births

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.089 
these is just that after two births
approximately<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.139> shotgun<00:05:28.500> will<00:05:28.680> be<00:05:28.830> fully

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
approximately the shotgun will be fully

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.560 
approximately the shotgun will be fully
heated<00:05:29.400> up<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:29.880> then<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.120> have<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:30.419> wait

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
heated up and then you have to wait

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.680 
heated up and then you have to wait
these<00:05:30.990> those<00:05:31.830> two<00:05:32.130> minutes<00:05:32.490> when<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:33.240> set<00:05:33.539> this

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
these those two minutes when I set this

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.620 
these those two minutes when I set this
is<00:05:33.870> a<00:05:33.900> long<00:05:34.229> long<00:05:34.590> time<00:05:35.039> because<00:05:35.699> I'm<00:05:35.940> for

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
is a long long time because I'm for

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.540 
is a long long time because I'm for
example<00:05:37.080> when<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.470> play<00:05:37.680> normal<00:05:38.160> with<00:05:38.370> the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
example when I play normal with the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.300 
example when I play normal with the
regen<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.510> just<00:05:40.020> need<00:05:40.229> two<00:05:40.410> minutes<00:05:40.560> for<00:05:40.979> the

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
regen I just need two minutes for the

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.330 
regen I just need two minutes for the
full<00:05:41.639> around<00:05:41.970> 30<00:05:42.419> or<00:05:42.599> so<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.979> can<00:05:44.130> imagine

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
full around 30 or so and you can imagine

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.100 
full around 30 or so and you can imagine
when<00:05:44.699> you<00:05:44.789> have<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.090> wait<00:05:45.300> two<00:05:45.570> minutes<00:05:45.750> after

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
when you have to wait two minutes after

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.250 
when you have to wait two minutes after
two<00:05:46.470> bursts<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:47.669> rounds<00:05:48.030> will<00:05:48.180> go<00:05:48.360> extremely

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
two bursts the rounds will go extremely

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.290 
two bursts the rounds will go extremely
long<00:05:49.500> therefore<00:05:50.310> we<00:05:50.580> kind<00:05:50.729> of<00:05:50.880> have<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.270> use

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
long therefore we kind of have to use

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.350 
long therefore we kind of have to use
that<00:05:51.630> knifing<00:05:52.169> thing<00:05:52.409> but<00:05:53.010> it's<00:05:53.820> shit<00:05:54.120> it's

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
that knifing thing but it's shit it's

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.779 
that knifing thing but it's shit it's
shit<00:05:54.419> I<00:05:54.840> don't<00:05:54.900> like<00:05:55.139> this<00:05:55.530> so<00:05:56.460> what<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.639> would

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
shit I don't like this so what I would

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.939 
shit I don't like this so what I would
recommend<00:05:57.120> actually<00:05:57.630> in<00:05:57.990> your<00:05:58.110> game<00:05:58.349> is<00:05:58.530> use

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
recommend actually in your game is use

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.029 
recommend actually in your game is use
the<00:05:59.130> regen<00:05:59.520> as<00:05:59.669> long<00:06:00.060> as<00:06:00.300> possible<00:06:00.720> only<00:06:01.380> and

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
the regen as long as possible only and

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.070 
the regen as long as possible only and
only<00:06:02.159> if<00:06:02.520> you're<00:06:02.729> out<00:06:03.030> of<00:06:03.060> ammo<00:06:03.479> with<00:06:03.720> all<00:06:03.900> your

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
only if you're out of ammo with all your

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.529 
only if you're out of ammo with all your
guns<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.500> would<00:06:04.650> actually<00:06:04.979> then<00:06:05.010> start<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:06.240> use

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
guns I would actually then start to use

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.200 
guns I would actually then start to use
the<00:06:06.810> chat<00:06:07.080> gun<00:06:07.320> but<00:06:07.740> if<00:06:07.889> you<00:06:07.919> know<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:09.060> that

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
the chat gun but if you know you that

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.510 
the chat gun but if you know you that
you<00:06:09.270> will<00:06:09.570> anyway<00:06:09.810> run<00:06:10.409> out<00:06:10.620> of<00:06:10.650> ammo<00:06:11.070> with<00:06:11.370> the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
you will anyway run out of ammo with the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.540 
you will anyway run out of ammo with the
rig<00:06:11.729> and<00:06:11.940> you<00:06:11.970> can<00:06:12.210> also<00:06:12.389> start<00:06:12.870> to<00:06:13.050> make
