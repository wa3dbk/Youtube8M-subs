 david I will not make a skit for 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.719
 put back lines because it's not important 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.460
 because guys this is important that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 you write it all down and answer it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 questions I recommend he made the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.369
 his gift and look at these five 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 minutes of video that are really a lot 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.609
 important that will concern his 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.609
 Cream will leave Inter will march making fun n 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.930
 who is good that they are rotten and welcome in 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.540
 this nori of survival 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.760
 then now before saying any 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.840
 what we have to talk a little bit in fact 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.030
 this will be an episode of which 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.520
 we will talk will not last long I will not cut 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.080
 much above all because I want to do 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.940
 living to understand things that second 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.960
 I'm important about this evening 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.300
 that you really asked me 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.970
 a lot of it started from the assumption 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.240
 that I administer this series e 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.979
 I loved to record it and I will continue to love it 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.300
 when to register or there are gods 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.280
 problems the first problem is that 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.009
 many ask for one 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.140
 involvement that is quite high 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.030
 we don't talk about comments with likes 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.430
 because it makes ten people have an interest 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.290
 don't put it on like you can put it 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.450
 I like it though if actually 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.950
 the episode in the south is different the only one 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.869
 take my survival column if that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.940
 you just don't like it and one more episode 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.580
 long obviously loyalty is 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 very low because I noticed is that many 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.940
 of you 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.700
 after four minutes of this 5 minutes 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.649
 let's say this series detach ok 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.700
 detach what it means that if the tantrums 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.130
 from 2 to 12 minutes 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.050
 everyone only looks at the first five 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.490
 minutes and then it comes off 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.990
 the episode when maybe there is the moment 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.740
 more epic when I do things more 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.660
 important 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.830
 so now I'm here to ask you 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.750
 some things 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.959
 if you want this survival to continue 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.580
 if he wants me as I have many if you move 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.160
 lately I'm doing so much writing vi 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.500
 thank you so much ee if you noticed 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.330
 I changed because of youtube side 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.429
 because I tell you that they have changed because 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.890
 just lately I'm not doing anymore 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.349
 many series and not bringing them forward to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.790
 36 more enduring feature of video 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.200

 ahead of the other series 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.590
 I'm talking about minigames I'm in 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.840
 deeply the skywards will return 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.910
 enroll in goals that in many 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.380

 since so many me must find us but 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.659
 because not really 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.549

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.170
 said it's a blog I don't like because I don't 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.450
 I have so many topics to talk about then 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.329

 who will want to donate etcetera 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.329
 I can buy a new car 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.849
 photographic to increase the quality of 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.290
 video that I think is enough 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.729
 bad when i do the webcam now you 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.769

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:05.229
 been given this light now I want 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.060

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.519
 a beautiful light despite being on vacation 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.979
 I'm bringing you early because I care 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.430
 really a lot to this story of 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.099
 youtube 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.440
 so I would like you to tell me really 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.329
 in the comments if you this series 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.549
 you want it to want me to continue it 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.740
 obviously all will be back 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.690
 But we will take them seriously 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.520
 we will do only one episode a week of 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.650
 this series structured better perhaps 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.900
 which lasts 12 minutes but those twelve minutes 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.820
 I registered less 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.250
 in which I can make you laugh so much 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.690
 progress and figures hold it if you want then 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.790
 even that changes the world 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.229
 which I would never want because I have 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.270
 many worlds started but this is 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.430
 was the only one I carried on for 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.930
 they really call you so long 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.639
 the one below in the comments 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.710
 all it takes is that there are guys 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.030
 involvement on your part that me 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.070
 make it clear that I this series of 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.229

 goal every time we will attack and 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.860
