00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.710
 Hello, how are you friends? 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.050
 pc and this is a new video tutorial the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.260
 that I bring to all those who like 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.900
 minecraft to all who have games 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.500
 Finally, this tutorial will help you 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.410
 all because it 's super good we're going to 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.440
 see already in the title how to do 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.780
 that our video game runs faster 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.540
 and it's very easy is with a program that is 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.840
 totally free that is called rising 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.840
 game 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.969
 same I'll leave the link in the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.500
 description of the video so I do not know 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:03.300
 worry about anything in this program what 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 that is good this program what 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.570
 It is that while we are 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 playing low processes that are 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.850
 unnecessary for the game so 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.539
 our ram memory and our processor 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.060
 to run alone so to speak 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.940
 our games then it will be that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.260
 quickly reduced us faster 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.840
 this is the main one that comes has a 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.730
 diagnostician to optimize 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.710
 and update the drivers that 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.160
 have here the monitor the audio in order 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.470
 can put the fps you can see the fps 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.020
 that is incurring the truth I do not 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.350
 I like it a lot but if it's not necessary 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.620
 you can record in the end this is from 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.150
 good wonder that's how to use it 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.440
 too easy 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.740
 if they installed it and it gives them and they came out 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.230
 here your games well then if you missed 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.690
 one or if no game came out that 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.230
 they need it because it is very easy first thing 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.230
 what should they do 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.829
 first thing to do is create a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.620
 Direct access to your game desk 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.930
 when they have done that, they give it here 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.950
 in the more to add and they will leave 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.610
 here the game that they want to add and you 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.250
 and it depends on you 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.000
 but here I have added my 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.590
 games and added minecraft and improve very 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.410
 fast and good 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.140
 whenever they go to play they should have 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.840
 open this program so that I can 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.800
 run can open it from here or the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.590
 same program and when you open your 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.090
 media game you can is going to put 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.480
 in game mode seen good this is the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.590
 first that I bring to you today and the second 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.870
 this is going to close this dedicated city 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.660
 especially to maikel users 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.480
 which is how to increase the number 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.480
 of fps if you do not know why 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.480
 this is this guy is a lot of them 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.390
 It also depends on your pc and requires 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.760
 how many do you have you are going to see how many 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.560
 round has your pc 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.170
 if you do not know it's very easy you have here to 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.770
 start here paul already on twitter in your 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.270
 properties you wait a second and here you 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:44.280
 will load 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:54.570
 the properties of your life and here in 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:57.390
 memory in my case are two of that 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.930
 it depends on you as I said then if 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.700
 you know it is 2gb 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.920
 well here is the code those codes 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.170
 I go to the description of the video then 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.170
 here select from the script 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.280
 and when you have already copied 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.959
 you simply go to the control panel what 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.820
 you open 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.580
 it seems that in all the elements of 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.580
 control panel and you open the flame to this one 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.919
 we have out here and here when 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.940
 open this go to this jabalya tab 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.940
 I'll vert and it will appear 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:53.599
 so it seems 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:57.949
 then they are going to give double click here 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:04.009
 they will give control 20 and we are ready 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:06.499
 will appear this code give unacceptable in 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.899
 apply accept and everything will be ready 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:11.149
 now your brand to run faster 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:14.979
 with the racing game and we are going to enter 

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:14.979
 the entry sps that will be 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.640
 well not so much but they will be very good 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.100
 to play and they will be able to enjoy 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.260
 of this wonderful game if you do not have 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.710
