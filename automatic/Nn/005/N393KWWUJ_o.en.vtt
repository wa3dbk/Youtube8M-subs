I<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.630> see<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> birds<00:00:22.140> outside<00:00:22.410> through<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
I can see the birds outside through the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.220 
I can see the birds outside through the
reflection

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.900 

so<00:00:26.830> what<00:00:26.920> are<00:00:26.980> you<00:00:27.040> doing<00:00:29.280> polishing<00:00:30.280> damaged

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
so what are you doing polishing damaged

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.680 
so what are you doing polishing damaged
ooh<00:00:31.349> okay<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:33.730> see<00:00:33.910> that<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:36.330> can<00:00:37.330> see

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
ooh okay I can see that I can see

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.250 
ooh okay I can see that I can see
everything<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.500> show<00:00:39.989> might<00:00:40.989> be<00:00:41.170> it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
everything in the show might be it

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.189 
everything in the show might be it
slightly<00:00:41.860> overkill<00:00:42.550> on<00:00:42.699> this<00:00:42.879> one<00:00:43.059> but<00:00:43.390> kind

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
slightly overkill on this one but kind

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.490 
slightly overkill on this one but kind
of<00:00:44.290> more<00:00:44.500> experiment<00:00:45.100> experiment<00:00:45.879> yeah<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:47.080> can

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
of more experiment experiment yeah I can

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.630 
of more experiment experiment yeah I can
see<00:00:47.620> already<00:00:47.770> that's<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.220> gross-rosen

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
see already that's the gross-rosen

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.259 
see already that's the gross-rosen
pattern<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.620> just<00:00:50.830> the<00:00:50.920> big<00:00:51.100> swoops<00:00:51.460> mm-hmm

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
pattern it's just the big swoops mm-hmm

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.360 
pattern it's just the big swoops mm-hmm
the<00:00:52.480> pattern<00:00:52.809> it<00:00:52.960> barely<00:00:53.590> shows<00:00:53.890> up<00:00:54.100> in<00:00:54.250> your

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
the pattern it barely shows up in your

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.070 
the pattern it barely shows up in your
polish<00:00:54.760> it's<00:00:55.030> gonna<00:00:55.210> look<00:00:55.390> cool<00:00:57.120> Wow<00:00:58.120> there

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
polish it's gonna look cool Wow there

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.950 
polish it's gonna look cool Wow there
you<00:00:59.199> are<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:04.030> why<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.239> polishing<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.750> first

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you are so why you polishing it first

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.750 
you are so why you polishing it first
well<00:01:07.960> guess<00:01:08.860> we've<00:01:09.040> been<00:01:09.190> playing<00:01:09.370> with<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.549> few

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
well guess we've been playing with a few

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.700 
well guess we've been playing with a few
of<00:01:09.880> these<00:01:09.940> now<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.510> batch<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:10.990> made<00:01:11.140> we

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
of these now in this batch we made we

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.490 
of these now in this batch we made we
made<00:01:11.740> 24-day<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.520> steel<00:01:12.790> blades<00:01:13.030> yeah<00:01:13.900> in<00:01:14.290> this

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
made 24-day of steel blades yeah in this

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.710 
made 24-day of steel blades yeah in this
batch<00:01:14.710> which<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:15.850> more<00:01:16.000> than<00:01:16.210> we've<00:01:16.330> ever<00:01:16.420> made

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
batch which is more than we've ever made

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.580 
batch which is more than we've ever made
ever<00:01:20.729> explain<00:01:21.729> yourself<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:23.229> polish

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
ever explain yourself so you you polish

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.340 
ever explain yourself so you you polish
it<00:01:23.740> up<00:01:23.830> because<00:01:24.369> when<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.880> H<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.390> only<00:01:25.930> one<00:01:26.260> of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
it up because when you H it only one of

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.260 
it up because when you H it only one of
the<00:01:26.409> metals<00:01:26.740> really<00:01:27.100> gets<00:01:27.310> etched<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:28.090> other

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
the metals really gets etched the other

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.870 
the metals really gets etched the other
one<00:01:28.510> if<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:29.080> do<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:29.979> carefully<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.549> doesn't

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
one if you do it carefully it doesn't

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.880 
one if you do it carefully it doesn't
really<00:01:31.060> get<00:01:31.689> eaten<00:01:31.930> away<00:01:32.079> at<00:01:32.200> all<00:01:32.469> so<00:01:32.829> you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
really get eaten away at all so you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.760 
really get eaten away at all so you
leave<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.509> polished<00:01:34.509> beforehand<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.439> then

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
leave that polished beforehand and then

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.469 
leave that polished beforehand and then
it's<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.979> lot<00:01:36.100> easier<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.490> buff<00:01:36.759> up<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.240> make

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
it's a lot easier to buff up and make

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.539 
it's a lot easier to buff up and make
the<00:01:37.630> contrast<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:39.450> lot<00:01:40.450> bigger<00:01:41.399> there<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:42.460> go

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
the contrast a lot bigger there you go

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.980 
the contrast a lot bigger there you go
you<00:01:42.670> hit<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.880> light<00:01:43.060> on<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.329> just<00:01:43.509> right<00:01:43.750> and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
you hit the light on it just right and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.349 
you hit the light on it just right and
it's<00:01:44.710> actually<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.189> shiny<00:01:45.549> metal<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:46.299> looks

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
it's actually the shiny metal that looks

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.569 
it's actually the shiny metal that looks
black<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:49.979> depending<00:01:50.979> on<00:01:51.039> how<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.250> look<00:01:51.490> at

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
black and depending on how you look at

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.959 
black and depending on how you look at
it<00:01:51.640> now<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.939> hold<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:53.289> looks<00:01:53.469> different

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.499 

so<00:01:57.969> shinier<00:01:58.390> better<00:01:58.890> yeah<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.280> mean<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.270> didn't

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
so shinier better yeah I mean I didn't

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.649 
so shinier better yeah I mean I didn't
go<00:02:01.630> quite<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.259> shiny<00:02:02.560> on<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.859> other<00:02:03.009> ones

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
go quite this shiny on the other ones

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.169 
go quite this shiny on the other ones
just<00:02:05.229> do<00:02:05.350> an<00:02:05.439> experiment<00:02:05.859> yeah<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.759> can't

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
just do an experiment yeah and you can't

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.190 
just do an experiment yeah and you can't
really<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.210> they<00:02:10.390> were<00:02:10.450> less<00:02:10.720> polished

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
really see that they were less polished

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.100 
really see that they were less polished
before<00:02:11.680> yeah<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.580> depends<00:02:12.850> on<00:02:12.880> how<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.110> leave

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
before yeah it depends on how you leave

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.650 
before yeah it depends on how you leave
it<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.319> too<00:02:14.500> long<00:02:14.680> yeah<00:02:15.250> both<00:02:15.760> metals<00:02:16.210> start<00:02:16.540> to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
it in too long yeah both metals start to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.070 
it in too long yeah both metals start to
etch<00:02:16.810> yeah<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> I'm<00:02:19.420> still<00:02:19.630> trying<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.900> figure

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
etch yeah so I'm still trying to figure

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.970 
etch yeah so I'm still trying to figure
out<00:02:20.230> which<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.280> best<00:02:22.140> system<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.319> do<00:02:23.500> yeah

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
out which is the best system to do yeah

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.980 
out which is the best system to do yeah
the<00:02:24.460> three<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.730> did<00:02:24.940> yesterday<00:02:25.120> all<00:02:25.540> turned<00:02:25.810> out

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
the three I did yesterday all turned out

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.820 
the three I did yesterday all turned out
slightly<00:02:26.460> different<00:02:28.410> yeah<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.470> don't<00:02:29.680> know<00:02:29.740> if

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
slightly different yeah I don't know if

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.230 
slightly different yeah I don't know if
the<00:02:29.980> difference<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.430> I'll<00:02:30.550> even<00:02:30.670> show<00:02:30.910> up<00:02:30.940> here

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
the difference is I'll even show up here

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.740 
the difference is I'll even show up here
on<00:02:31.270> camera<00:02:31.690> yeah<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:32.740> one<00:02:32.950> shinier<00:02:35.489> but

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
on camera yeah like this one shinier but

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.410
