hot and the time to do the maintenance

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.150 
hot and the time to do the maintenance
is<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:24.029> see<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.630> Sub<00:00:24.900> Zero<00:00:25.160> because

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
is now you see in a Sub Zero because

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.580 
is now you see in a Sub Zero because
it's<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> built<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.779> compressor<00:00:28.320> now<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it's a built in your compressor now I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.070 
it's a built in your compressor now I
can't<00:00:29.160> afford<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.640> sub<00:00:29.880> Cyril<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> GE

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
can't afford a sub Cyril this is a GE

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.760 
can't afford a sub Cyril this is a GE
but<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.430> refrigerator<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.770> your

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
but it's a good refrigerator to but your

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.400 
but it's a good refrigerator to but your
compressor<00:00:35.340> okay<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.809> compress<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
compressor okay and you compress the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.549 
compressor okay and you compress the
core<00:00:37.790> condenser<00:00:38.790> coils<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> top

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
core condenser coils for all on the top

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.639 
core condenser coils for all on the top
and<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.520> happens<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.360> there's<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> fan<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and what happens is there's a fan of

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.150 
and what happens is there's a fan of
that<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.579> blows<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.719> warm<00:00:45.989> air<00:00:46.289> from

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that that blows all the warm air from

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.510 
that that blows all the warm air from
the<00:00:47.340> compressor<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> grill<00:00:49.800> now

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the compressor out to the grill now

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.430 
the compressor out to the grill now
sometimes<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.210> walk<00:00:51.390> compared<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.140> put

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
sometimes you walk compared so you put

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
sometimes you walk compared so you put
your<00:00:52.590> hand<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.280> feel<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> warm<00:00:53.879> air

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
your hand up you can feel the warm air

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.150 
your hand up you can feel the warm air
coming<00:00:54.420> out<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.870> means<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.260> doing<00:00:55.680> its<00:00:55.829> job

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
coming out that means it's doing its job

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.930 
coming out that means it's doing its job
but<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.960> working<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.710> hundred<00:00:59.250> percent<00:00:59.370> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
but is it working a hundred percent is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
but is it working a hundred percent is
it<00:01:00.660> creating<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:03.379> compressor<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> run<00:01:04.769> harder

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it creating a compressor to run harder

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
it creating a compressor to run harder
than<00:01:05.610> normal<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.110> sub-zero<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
than normal you see in a sub-zero you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.130 
than normal you see in a sub-zero you
have<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> compresses<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.420> refrigerate<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
have to compresses you refrigerate it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
have to compresses you refrigerate it
compresses<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.400> next<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.060> coils

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
compresses it's right next to your coils

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
compresses it's right next to your coils
and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.350> freeze<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> compressor<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and then you freeze the compressor and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.560 
and then you freeze the compressor and
normally<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:16.439> coils<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.100> dirty<00:01:17.790> your

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
normally if your coils are dirty your

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
normally if your coils are dirty your
refrigerator<00:01:19.350> compressor<00:01:19.830> gets<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.580> hot<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
refrigerator compressor gets so hot that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.440 
refrigerator compressor gets so hot that
it<00:01:21.630> ends<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.049> cycling<00:01:22.979> off<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.450> eventually

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it ends up cycling off and eventually

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.679 
it ends up cycling off and eventually
burning<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:25.110> after<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> day<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.689> what

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
burning out after a day or so so what

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.109 
burning out after a day or so so what
you<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.500> now<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> call<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you need to do now is to call the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.080 
you need to do now is to call the
appliance<00:01:30.689> doctor<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.610> coils

appliance doctor and get your coils

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.960 
appliance doctor and get your coils
cleaned<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.430> yourself

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
cleaned or if you can do it yourself

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.289 
cleaned or if you can do it yourself
fine<00:01:36.240> try<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.590> twice<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.189> year<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
fine try to do it twice a year if you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.130 
fine try to do it twice a year if you
can't<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> twice<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> year<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.060> now<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:43.110> it

April May before the warm weather comes

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
April May before the warm weather comes
in<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.409> once<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.009> warm<00:01:50.250> weather<00:01:50.520> comes

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
in and that compressors working hard

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
in and that compressors working hard
you're<00:01:53.790> thinking<00:01:54.180> refrigerators<00:01:54.899> still

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you're thinking refrigerators still

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
you're thinking refrigerators still
working<00:01:55.590> fine<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.520> maybe<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.180> two

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
working fine then maybe one or two

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.690 
working fine then maybe one or two
degrees<00:01:57.689> different<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.460> day

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
degrees different and then at one day

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.550 
degrees different and then at one day
you<00:01:59.759> wake<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.119> or<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.810> come<00:02:01.140> home<00:02:01.320> from

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
you wake up or you come home from

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.670 
you wake up or you come home from
vacation<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.969> compressor<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.810> dead<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
vacation and that compressor is dead and
