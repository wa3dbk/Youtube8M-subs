00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
so yeah so i think i think it's i think

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.500 
so yeah so i think i think it's i think
it's<00:04:03.970> um<00:04:04.209> i<00:04:04.770> think<00:04:05.770> it's<00:04:06.270> important<00:04:07.270> that<00:04:07.300> you

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510

it's um i think it's important that you
start<00:04:07.930> off<00:04:08.110> small<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.530> then<00:04:08.860> move<00:04:09.610> yourself

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
start off small and then move yourself

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.740 
start off small and then move yourself

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
it it took quite a bit of practice and

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.680 
it it took quite a bit of practice and
the<00:04:57.310> practice<00:04:57.880> done<00:04:58.240> on<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:59.200> mountain<00:04:59.530> bike

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.480 
the practice done on the mountain bike
was<00:05:01.690> actually<00:05:02.200> far<00:05:02.830> less<00:05:03.640> costly<00:05:04.680> than<00:05:05.680> if<00:05:06.370> I

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
was actually far less costly than if I

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.080 
was actually far less costly than if I
had<00:05:06.520> learned<00:05:06.970> on<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.710> on<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.770> motorcycle<00:05:09.250> you

hammered<00:06:11.240> so<00:06:13.930> you<00:06:14.930> know<00:06:15.050> there's<00:06:15.290> routes<00:06:15.560> to

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
hammered so you know there's routes to

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.000 
hammered so you know there's routes to
take<00:06:16.040> and<00:06:16.360> you<00:06:17.360> know<00:06:17.480> maybe<00:06:17.720> maybe<00:06:18.140> the<00:06:18.410> 600cc

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
take and you know maybe maybe the 600cc

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.680 
take and you know maybe maybe the 600cc
was<00:06:19.340> too<00:06:19.520> big<00:06:19.790> maybe<00:06:19.970> I<00:06:20.120> should<00:06:20.330> have<00:06:20.450> started

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
was too big maybe I should have started

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.210 
was too big maybe I should have started
on<00:06:21.020> a<00:06:21.280> 250<00:06:23.050> but<00:06:24.050> but<00:06:24.290> you<00:06:24.410> know<00:06:24.500> I'm<00:06:24.650> a<00:06:24.680> big<00:06:24.800> guy

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
on a 250 but but you know I'm a big guy

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.840 
on a 250 but but you know I'm a big guy
so<00:06:25.550> you'd<00:06:26.120> have<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:26.540> take<00:06:26.750> that<00:06:26.930> risk<00:06:27.260> and

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
so you'd have to take that risk and

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.060 
so you'd have to take that risk and
assess<00:06:28.850> it<00:06:29.060> and<00:06:29.180> say<00:06:29.450> okay<00:06:29.950> you<00:06:30.950> know

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
assess it and say okay you know

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.460 
assess it and say okay you know
considering<00:06:31.490> I'm<00:06:31.700> a<00:06:31.730> big<00:06:32.000> guy<00:06:32.410> I'm<00:06:33.410> very

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.530 
considering I'm a big guy I'm very
strong<00:06:34.010> I<00:06:34.220> can<00:06:34.400> handle<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:34.910> bike<00:06:35.120> you<00:06:35.390> know

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
the 600cc bike okay so that's that

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.760 
the 600cc bike okay so that's that
wasn't<00:06:39.260> such<00:06:39.380> a<00:06:39.410> bad<00:06:39.650> trade-off<00:06:40.330> and<00:06:41.470> and<00:06:42.470> and

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
wasn't such a bad trade-off and and and
