the<00:00:17.330> microphone<00:00:18.050> it's<00:00:18.350> when<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:18.770> Malagasy

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 
the microphone it's when the Malagasy

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.190 
the microphone it's when the Malagasy
transforming<00:00:20.540> to<00:00:20.840> a<00:00:20.869> softer<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:21.770> see<00:00:22.160> collected

transforming to a softer I see collected

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:31.300 
transforming to a softer I see collected
so<00:00:24.310> you<00:00:25.310> have<00:00:25.669> engaged<00:00:26.270> like<00:00:27.070> 2007<00:00:29.050> 2001<00:00:30.310> where

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
so you have engaged like 2007 2001 where

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.670 
so you have engaged like 2007 2001 where
you<00:00:31.460> had<00:00:31.610> all<00:00:31.790> many<00:00:32.060> cats<00:00:32.360> money<00:00:32.840> Kassadin<00:00:33.530> the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
you had all many cats money Kassadin the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.790 
you had all many cats money Kassadin the
money<00:00:33.860> Casillas<00:00:34.460> is<00:00:35.450> very<00:00:35.720> rough<00:00:35.930> no<00:00:36.260> it's<00:00:36.500> out

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
money Casillas is very rough no it's out

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.540 
money Casillas is very rough no it's out
on<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.070> ballot<00:00:37.720> it's<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.989> Danny<00:00:39.290> gets<00:00:39.680> rush

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
on the ballot it's the Danny gets rush

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.160 
on the ballot it's the Danny gets rush
it's<00:00:41.239> hot<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:42.920> need<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:43.460> have<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:44.170> second

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's hot so you need to have that second

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.000 
it's hot so you need to have that second
fermentation<00:00:45.410> which<00:00:46.220> was<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.700> first<00:00:46.880> one<00:00:48.010> so

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
fermentation which was the first one so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.080 
fermentation which was the first one so
you<00:00:49.070> need<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.490> have<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.760> second

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
you need to have that second

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.430 
you need to have that second
fermentation<00:00:50.300> de<00:00:50.900> tous<00:00:51.680> after<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.850> wine

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
fermentation de tous after the wine

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.030 
fermentation de tous after the wine
usually<00:00:54.440> like<00:00:54.860> right<00:00:55.100> now<00:00:56.440> most<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.830> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
usually like right now most of the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.300 
usually like right now most of the
seller<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.840> went<00:01:00.590> through<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.950> molarity

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
seller is went through the molarity

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.240 
seller is went through the molarity
already<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.480> tank<00:01:02.780> or<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.140> berry<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:03.950> it

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
already the tank or the berry and it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.109 
already the tank or the berry and it
really<00:01:04.900> don't<00:01:05.900> depend<00:01:06.759> say<00:01:07.759> for<00:01:07.970> instance

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
really don't depend say for instance

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.240 
really don't depend say for instance
2003<00:01:09.100> 2003<00:01:10.180> we<00:01:11.180> are<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.509> vineyard<00:01:11.979> one<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.100> our

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
2003 2003 we are the vineyard one of our

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.630 
2003 2003 we are the vineyard one of our
bodies<00:01:14.060> here<00:01:14.299> we<00:01:15.140> in<00:01:15.380> had<00:01:15.530> any<00:01:15.740> manifested

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
bodies here we in had any manifested

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.539 
bodies here we in had any manifested
that's<00:01:17.109> all<00:01:18.109> for<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.530> analogies<00:01:19.039> very

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
that's all for the analogies very

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.429 
that's all for the analogies very
exceptional<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.570> we<00:01:20.780> didn't<00:01:20.960> have<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.170> do<00:01:21.289> the

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
exceptional so we didn't have to do the

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.410 
exceptional so we didn't have to do the
fermentation<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:22.100> was<00:01:22.219> no<00:01:22.399> money<00:01:22.549> because<00:01:23.390> of

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
fermentation it was no money because of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.340 
fermentation it was no money because of
the<00:01:23.689> heat<00:01:23.899> you<00:01:24.200> know<00:01:24.350> because<00:01:25.249> of<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.520> oh

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
the heat you know because of the oh

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.630 
the heat you know because of the oh
maybe<00:01:27.350> innocent<00:01:27.950> /<00:01:28.240> maturation<00:01:29.259> but<00:01:30.640> this

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
maybe innocent / maturation but this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.370 
maybe innocent / maturation but this
side<00:01:32.140> 2003<00:01:33.429> usually<00:01:34.429> every<00:01:34.789> year<00:01:34.819> we<00:01:35.509> do<00:01:35.749> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
side 2003 usually every year we do the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.319 
side 2003 usually every year we do the
malolactic<00:01:36.770> fermentation<00:01:36.969> but<00:01:37.969> it's<00:01:38.179> a

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
malolactic fermentation but it's a

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.440 
malolactic fermentation but it's a
natural<00:01:38.479> process<00:01:39.039> we<00:01:40.039> don't<00:01:40.249> you<00:01:40.490> know<00:01:40.609> you<00:01:40.789> I

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
natural process we don't you know you I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.379 
natural process we don't you know you I
know<00:01:42.049> that<00:01:42.469> now<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.009> can<00:01:43.429> add<00:01:43.579> some<00:01:43.609> bacteria

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
know that now you can add some bacteria

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:49.080 
know that now you can add some bacteria
to<00:01:45.020> provoke<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.979> process<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.670> molarity<00:01:47.170> but

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
to provoke the process of molarity but

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.879
