00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.170 
of picture today doesn't necessarily
mean<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> better<00:01:58.320> picture<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:59.399> different<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
mean a better picture just different you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
mean a better picture just different you
know<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.899> edit<00:02:01.649> errs<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> see

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
know because they edit errs want to see

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.399 
know because they edit errs want to see
something<00:02:02.520> new<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.329> light<00:02:04.020> paintings

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
something new and light paintings

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.170 
something new and light paintings
certainly<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> way<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.729> think

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
certainly a way to do that and I think

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.260 
certainly a way to do that and I think
that<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:07.049> sort<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> idea<00:02:07.829> i<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.729> when

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that was sort of the idea i think when

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.170 
that was sort of the idea i think when
rich<00:02:09.840> brought<00:02:10.140> me<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
rich brought me in on the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.050 
rich brought me in on the
arlington<00:02:12.180> book<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.590> became<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.940> my

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
arlington book and I became to my

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 
arlington book and I became to my
knowledge<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.480> think<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.990> not<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
knowledge I think one of the not the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.320 
knowledge I think one of the not the
first<00:02:17.310> certainly<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.120> first

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
first certainly one of the first

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
first certainly one of the first
photographers<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.140> ever<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.830> a

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
up on the back of the camera and I could

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.960

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
so I do it again and it would take 20 or

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.890 
so I do it again and it would take 20 or
30<00:04:48.930> tries<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.650> get<00:04:49.800> one<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.330> really<00:04:51.870> really

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
30 tries to get one that I really really

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.860 
30 tries to get one that I really really
liked<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:52.440> really<00:04:53.130> seemed<00:04:53.460> to
