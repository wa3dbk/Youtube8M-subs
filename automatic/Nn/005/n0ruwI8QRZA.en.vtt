repetitions<00:00:31.439> he<00:00:32.070> had<00:00:32.189> too<00:00:32.309> much<00:00:32.520> volume<00:00:32.820> he

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
repetitions he had too much volume he

doesn't know where to begin how does he

doesn't know where to begin how does he
get<00:00:36.120> back<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.690> track<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.500> where<00:00:38.280> he<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.550> before

get back on track to where he was before
getting<00:00:39.210> sick<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.510> here's<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.770> very<00:00:40.890> first

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
getting sick so here's the very first

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.290 
getting sick so here's the very first
thing<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.280> want<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> recognize<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
thing I want you to recognize is that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.840 
thing I want you to recognize is that
the<00:00:42.480> two<00:00:42.870> losses<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.340> you're<00:00:44.550> probably

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the two losses that you're probably

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.750 
the two losses that you're probably
going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> experience<00:00:45.780> first<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.760> your

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
going to experience first are your

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.180 
going to experience first are your
cardiovascular<00:00:48.090> conditioning<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.190> your

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
cardiovascular conditioning and your

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.709 
cardiovascular conditioning and your
nervous<00:00:50.670> systems<00:00:52.129> pattern-recognition<00:00:53.719> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
nervous systems pattern-recognition so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.080 
nervous systems pattern-recognition so
in<00:00:54.809> other<00:00:54.899> words<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:56.010> heart<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:56.820> going

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
in other words your heart is not going

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.420 
in other words your heart is not going
to<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.270> able<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.539> produce<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:58.109> much<00:00:58.469> volume<00:00:58.949> per

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
to be able to produce as much volume per

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.360 
to be able to produce as much volume per
beat<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:00.000> order<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.930> reach<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> your

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
beat in order to reach all of your

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880 
beat in order to reach all of your
muscle<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.170> organs<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.769> your

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
muscle in order to make that work out

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
muscle in order to make that work out
something<00:01:06.960> spectacular<00:01:07.490> it's<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> have

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
something spectacular it's going to have

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.700 
something spectacular it's going to have
to<00:01:08.909> beat<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> lot<00:01:09.270> more<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> little

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
to beat a lot more to get that little

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.020 
to beat a lot more to get that little
bit<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.890> blood<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.549> needs<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
bit of blood to where it needs to go so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.130 
bit of blood to where it needs to go so
your<00:01:12.150> heart<00:01:12.390> has<00:01:12.540> gotten<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:12.990> bit

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
your heart has gotten a little bit

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.390 
your heart has gotten a little bit
weaker<00:01:13.470> three<00:01:13.920> months<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.280> doing

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
weaker three months of not doing

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.440 
weaker three months of not doing
anything<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.450> typical<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> ask<00:01:16.560> most

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
anything that's typical if you ask most

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.760 
anything that's typical if you ask most
endurance<00:01:18.450> athletes<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.290> marathon

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
endurance athletes you know marathon

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
endurance athletes you know marathon
runners<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.430> very<00:01:20.640> first<00:01:20.850> thing<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> goes

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
runners the very first thing that goes

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.260 
runners the very first thing that goes
after<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.140> layoff<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.740> their<00:01:23.220> their<00:01:23.880> heart's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
after a layoff is their their heart's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.020 
after a layoff is their their heart's
ability<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.290> produce<00:01:25.680> volume<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
ability to produce volume and then the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.679 
ability to produce volume and then the
second<00:01:27.299> thing<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:27.750> nervous<00:01:28.110> system<00:01:28.229> has

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
second thing is your nervous system has

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.649 
second thing is your nervous system has
sort<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:31.009> produced<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> amnesia<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.390> kind

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
sort of produced in it amnesia and kind

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.289 
sort of produced in it amnesia and kind
of<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.900> forgets<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:35.400> patterns<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.090> are

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
of it forgets the patterns that are

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.910 
of it forgets the patterns that are
associated<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.110> exercises<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
associated with the exercises that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
associated with the exercises that
you're<00:01:38.070> doing<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.329> good<00:01:39.509> thing<00:01:39.689> about

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you're doing right the good thing about

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.289 
you're doing right the good thing about
both<00:01:40.159> is<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> cardiovascular<00:01:41.579> fitness<00:01:42.000> comes

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
both is a cardiovascular fitness comes

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.060 
both is a cardiovascular fitness comes
back<00:01:42.479> past<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.140> there's<00:01:43.710> something<00:01:43.860> called

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
back past and there's something called

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.980 
back past and there's something called
muscle<00:01:44.520> memory<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.689> basically

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
muscle memory right this is basically

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
muscle memory right this is basically
your<00:01:46.200> nervous<00:01:46.500> system<00:01:46.619> has<00:01:47.280> already

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
your nervous system has already

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.980 
your nervous system has already
developed<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:49.579> pattern<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.840> just

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
developed that pattern and now it just

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.810 
developed that pattern and now it just
basically<00:01:52.170> has<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> recall<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.610> both<00:01:53.790> of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
basically has to recall it so both of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.190 
basically has to recall it so both of
them<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.210> come<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.720> quickly<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> took

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
them can come back very quickly it took

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
them can come back very quickly it took
you<00:01:55.320> three<00:01:55.500> months<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.799> lose<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.310> say<00:01:56.820> you'll

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
