remains unaffected hail can remove many
of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.300> granules<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> an<00:01:34.320> impacted<00:01:34.920> area<00:01:35.340> we

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
of the granules in an impacted area we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.300 
of the granules in an impacted area we
wanted<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.259> would<00:01:37.410> happen<00:01:37.800> if<00:01:37.979> we

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
wanted to see what would happen if we

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.690 
wanted to see what would happen if we
remove<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.090> some<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.229> granules<00:01:40.800> and<00:01:41.040> so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
remove just some of the granules and so

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.690 
remove just some of the granules and so
we<00:01:41.880> lightly<00:01:42.270> scraped<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.380> area<00:01:43.800> circled<00:01:44.550> in

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
we lightly scraped the area circled in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.450 
we lightly scraped the area circled in
red<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.170> note<00:01:46.410> that<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.920> exposed

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
red you will note that the exposed

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.120 
red you will note that the exposed
asphalt<00:01:48.210> begins<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.930> bubble<00:01:49.170> under<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> Rays

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
asphalt begins to bubble under the Rays

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.999 
asphalt begins to bubble under the Rays
of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> Sun<00:01:50.729> while<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.450> undamaged<00:01:52.380> area<00:01:52.830> of

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of the Sun while the undamaged area of

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.830 
of the Sun while the undamaged area of
the<00:01:53.100> shingle<00:01:53.490> remains<00:01:54.149> intact
