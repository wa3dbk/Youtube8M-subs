hey<00:00:07.350> guys<00:00:07.529> welcome<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.919> PC<00:00:08.250> perspective

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
hey guys welcome to PC perspective

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.089 
hey guys welcome to PC perspective
chances<00:00:09.389> are<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.690> fall<00:00:09.929> into<00:00:10.230> one<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.860> two

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
chances are you fall into one of two

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.940 
chances are you fall into one of two
camps<00:00:11.700> when<00:00:12.059> seeing<00:00:12.360> something<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.780> this

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
camps when seeing something like this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.169 
camps when seeing something like this
sitting<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.099> desk<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.490> see<00:00:14.670> no<00:00:14.910> purpose

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
sitting on the desk you see no purpose

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.099 
sitting on the desk you see no purpose
for<00:00:15.630> an<00:00:16.260> open-air<00:00:16.830> test<00:00:17.250> bench<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:17.960> you<00:00:18.960> think

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
for an open-air test bench or you think

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.510 
for an open-air test bench or you think
it's<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> coolest<00:00:19.560> thing<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> world<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it's the coolest thing in the world and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.170 
it's the coolest thing in the world and
there's<00:00:20.640> actually<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:20.939> interesting

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
there's actually some interesting

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.330 
there's actually some interesting
benefits<00:00:21.630> right<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.350> if<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:22.949> an<00:00:23.039> open

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
benefits right so if you have an open

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.980 
benefits right so if you have an open
air<00:00:23.550> test<00:00:24.060> bench<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.960> here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
air test bench like the one we have here

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.500 
air test bench like the one we have here
this<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.439> actually<00:00:25.590> from<00:00:26.460> Puget<00:00:26.730> systems<00:00:27.060> this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
this is actually from Puget systems this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.099 
this is actually from Puget systems this
is<00:00:27.630> their<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.349> called<00:00:28.560> test<00:00:28.859> bench<00:00:29.189> kit<00:00:29.550> II

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
is their just called test bench kit II

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.470 
is their just called test bench kit II
ATX<00:00:31.109> version<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> brand<00:00:33.149> new<00:00:33.239> product

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
ATX version one it's a brand new product

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.569 
ATX version one it's a brand new product
that<00:00:33.690> they've<00:00:33.809> released<00:00:33.930> recently<00:00:34.430> made<00:00:35.430> out

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that they've released recently made out

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.610 
that they've released recently made out
of<00:00:35.700> acrylic<00:00:35.790> as<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.540> see<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.410> one<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
of acrylic as you can see but one of the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
of acrylic as you can see but one of the
benefits<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.450> obviously<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.660> primary<00:00:39.870> one<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
benefits is obviously the primary one is

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260 
benefits is obviously the primary one is
quick<00:00:40.530> access<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.340> components<00:00:41.969> right<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
quick access to your components right so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
quick access to your components right so
if<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> change<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.840> your<00:00:42.870> graphics<00:00:43.290> cards<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
if you change out your graphics cards a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.200 
if you change out your graphics cards a
lot<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.040> change<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.430> processors<00:00:45.059> or

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
lot you change out your processors or

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
lot you change out your processors or
your<00:00:45.329> memory<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:46.289> you're<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.620> fiddling<00:00:47.340> on

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
your memory or you're just fiddling on

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
your memory or you're just fiddling on
the<00:00:47.700> motherboard<00:00:48.000> quite<00:00:48.510> often<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the motherboard quite often this is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.740 
the motherboard quite often this is
really<00:00:49.950> handy<00:00:50.190> however<00:00:51.149> even<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:51.570> not

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
really handy however even if you're not

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900 
really handy however even if you're not
doing<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.230> there's<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> benefit<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.370> being

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
doing that there's the benefit of being

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.090 
doing that there's the benefit of being
able<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.140> components<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
able to see all of your components in a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.060 
able to see all of your components in a
cool<00:00:56.670> way<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.510> even<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> big

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
cool way right so even if you have a big

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
cool way right so even if you have a big
case<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> big<00:00:59.760> window<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> side<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
case with a big window on the side you

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.260 
case with a big window on the side you
don't<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.559> look<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.520> components<00:01:03.120> in

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
don't get to look at your components in

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
don't get to look at your components in
the<00:01:03.750> same<00:01:03.989> way<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.229> would<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> had<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.920> test

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the same way you would if you had a test

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.380 
the same way you would if you had a test
bench<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.119> you're<00:01:06.240> just

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
bench like this so if you're just

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
bench like this so if you're just
somebody<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.720> wants<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> show<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
somebody that wants to show off what you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250 
somebody that wants to show off what you
like<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.520> access<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> things<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:10.020> can

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
like to have access to things these can

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.310 
like to have access to things these can
be<00:01:10.409> pretty<00:01:10.979> interesting<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.640> devices<00:01:12.320> now

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
be pretty interesting little devices now

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
be pretty interesting little devices now
as<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.369> tell<00:01:14.490> basically<00:01:14.850> by<00:01:14.939> looking<00:01:15.240> at

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
as you can tell basically by looking at

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
as you can tell basically by looking at
it's<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.720> simple<00:01:16.320> device<00:01:16.650> it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it's a pretty simple device it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.149 
it's a pretty simple device it's
basically<00:01:17.869> several<00:01:18.869> pieces<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.200> acrylic<00:01:19.470> held

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
basically several pieces of acrylic held

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.810 
basically several pieces of acrylic held
together<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.759> some<00:01:21.180> screws<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> bolts

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
together with some screws and bolts

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.280 
together with some screws and bolts
installation<00:01:23.820> process<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.960> fairly

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
installation process was fairly

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
installation process was fairly
straightforward<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:26.189> got<00:01:26.369> several<00:01:27.119> pieces

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
straightforward you got several pieces

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.920 
straightforward you got several pieces
of<00:01:27.860> acrylic<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.759> cut<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
of acrylic that was cut and you had to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
of acrylic that was cut and you had to
take<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.350> some<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.710> annoying<00:01:32.479> later

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
take off some of that annoying later

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
take off some of that annoying later
something<00:01:34.079> annoying<00:01:34.200> covering<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
something annoying covering of it that

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.160 
something annoying covering of it that
keeps<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:35.460> getting<00:01:35.640> scratched<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> then

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
keeps it from getting scratched and then

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.929 
keeps it from getting scratched and then
you<00:01:37.380> basically<00:01:37.890> lay<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.460> you've<00:01:38.700> got<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you basically lay it out you've got a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
you basically lay it out you've got a
piece<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.329> foam<00:01:39.600> here<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> bottom<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
piece of foam here on the bottom that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
piece of foam here on the bottom that
you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.610> stick<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> bottom<00:01:42.240> layer<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you can stick to the bottom layer of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
you can stick to the bottom layer of
acrylic<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:44.369> nice

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
acrylic it's actually really nice

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120 
acrylic it's actually really nice

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
because it allows you to do things like

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
because it allows you to do things like
put<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.700> hard<00:01:48.060> drive<00:01:48.329> or<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.720> your<00:01:48.840> power

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
put your hard drive or put your power

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.710 
put your hard drive or put your power
supply<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.670> foam<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.570> not

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
supply on this foam and it's it's not

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
supply on this foam and it's it's not
sticky<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.619> some<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.850> got

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
sticky but it's got some it's it's got

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.219 
sticky but it's got some it's it's got
some<00:01:54.149> friction<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.659> right<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.020> things

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
some friction on it right so things

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.600 
some friction on it right so things
aren't<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.649> slide<00:01:55.920> around<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
aren't going to slide around on the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.160 
aren't going to slide around on the
bottom<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.270> even<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.689> choose<00:01:57.930> not

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
bottom of it so even if you choose not

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.760 
bottom of it so even if you choose not
to<00:01:58.229> screw<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.820> components<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.409> still

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to screw in the components you can still

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
to screw in the components you can still
use<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.219> test<00:02:02.520> bed<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.060> our<00:02:03.479> power

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
use this test bed and so our power

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.810 
use this test bed and so our power

well<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.730> kind<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.940> keeps<00:03:33.180> things<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.690> little

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
well it kind of keeps things a little

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.170 
well it kind of keeps things a little
bit<00:03:34.200> clean<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.280> do<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> e-atx

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
bit clean and but I do like the e-atx

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.940 
bit clean and but I do like the e-atx
size<00:03:36.570> because<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.170> actually<00:03:37.440> gives<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.740> lot

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
size because it actually gives you a lot

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.890 
size because it actually gives you a lot
of<00:03:37.980> space<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.370> we've<00:03:38.640> got<00:03:38.820> all<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.150> our<00:03:39.300> power

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900

supply<00:03:40.110> cables<00:03:40.710> sitting<00:03:40.980> here<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.820> didn't

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
supply cables sitting here and I didn't

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.580 
supply cables sitting here and I didn't
feel<00:03:42.209> like<00:03:42.270> detaching<00:03:43.170> them<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.440> putting

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
feel like detaching them and putting

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.260 
feel like detaching them and putting
them<00:03:43.680> away<00:03:43.830> because<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.430> may<00:03:44.580> need<00:03:44.760> them<00:03:44.970> for

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
them away because we may need them for

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.090 
them away because we may need them for
more<00:03:45.900> graphics<00:03:46.350> cards<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:46.740> there's<00:03:46.890> enough

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
more graphics cards but there's enough

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.500 
more graphics cards but there's enough
room<00:03:47.190> for<00:03:47.280> me<00:03:47.490> to<00:03:47.580> kind<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.760> line<00:03:48.030> them<00:03:48.209> up<00:03:48.330> and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
room for me to kind of line them up and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.480 
room for me to kind of line them up and
kind<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.750> push<00:03:49.380> them<00:03:49.560> there<00:03:49.830> behind<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.280> power

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
kind of push them there behind the power

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.310 
kind of push them there behind the power
supply<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.360> they're<00:03:51.480> not<00:03:51.600> dangling<00:03:52.080> out

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.449

through<00:03:52.500> out<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.740> side<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.070> we<00:03:53.130> can<00:03:53.160> still

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
through out the side so we can still

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.460 
through out the side so we can still
move<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.970> throughout<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.450> office<00:03:54.840> quite

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
move this throughout the office quite

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.460 
move this throughout the office quite
easily<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:56.220> also<00:03:56.940> like<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.540> inclusion<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:58.170> this

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
easily I also like the inclusion of this

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.380 
easily I also like the inclusion of this

ATI<00:04:10.050> I<00:04:10.230> think<00:04:10.770> hooked<00:04:11.010> up<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.850> is<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> 120

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
ATI I think hooked up and this is a 120

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.810 
ATI I think hooked up and this is a 120
millimeter<00:04:12.810> version<00:04:13.020> if<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.440> have<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> 240<00:04:14.340> you

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
millimeter version if you have a 240 you

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.420 
millimeter version if you have a 240 you
just<00:04:15.150> attach<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.049> bottom<00:04:16.260> portion<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.310> it

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
just attach the bottom portion of it

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.620 
just attach the bottom portion of it
here<00:04:17.640> and<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.790> top<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.270> would<00:04:18.450> actually

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
here and the top of it would actually

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.210 
here and the top of it would actually
stick<00:04:19.020> out<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.230> little<00:04:19.350> bit<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:19.890> it's<00:04:20.100> I

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
stick out a little bit so it's I

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.979 
stick out a little bit so it's I
actually<00:04:20.549> think<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.850> would<00:04:21.000> be<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> pretty

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
actually think that would be a pretty

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.490 
actually think that would be a pretty
neat<00:04:22.229> effect<00:04:23.240> although<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.540> seems<00:04:24.840> very<00:04:24.990> minor

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
neat effect although it seems very minor

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.780 
neat effect although it seems very minor
the<00:04:25.770> inclusion<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.310> this<00:04:26.460> kind

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
the inclusion of this kind

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.060 
the inclusion of this kind
fixed<00:04:27.240> power<00:04:27.420> button<00:04:27.870> up<00:04:28.080> front<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.590> nice

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
fixed power button up front is nice

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.760 
fixed power button up front is nice
right<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.690> is<00:04:30.870> only<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.200> power<00:04:31.440> button<00:04:31.650> it's

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
right so it is only a power button it's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230 
right so it is only a power button it's
not<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:31.920> reset<00:04:32.400> or<00:04:32.550> anything<00:04:32.730> like<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:32.970> but

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
not a reset or anything like that but

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.820 
not a reset or anything like that but
they<00:04:33.360> do<00:04:33.420> include<00:04:33.960> some<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.710> those

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
they do include some of those

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.190 
they do include some of those
accessories<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:36.270> box

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
accessories in the box

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.720 
accessories in the box
the<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.830> said<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.070> installation<00:04:38.520> process

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
the like I said the installation process

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.210 
the like I said the installation process
was<00:04:39.150> fairly<00:04:39.570> straightforward<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:40.530> did

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
was fairly straightforward I did

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.130 
was fairly straightforward I did
accidentally<00:04:41.790> mount<00:04:42.060> one<00:04:42.630> piece<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.960> acrylic

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
accidentally mount one piece of acrylic

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.580 
accidentally mount one piece of acrylic
upside<00:04:44.070> down<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:45.150> first<00:04:45.390> time<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.080> had<00:04:46.380> to

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
upside down the first time and had to

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.200 
upside down the first time and had to
disassemble<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.550> portion<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.090> to

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
disassemble a portion of it to

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.030 
disassemble a portion of it to
reassemble<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:48.840> because<00:04:49.140> a<00:04:49.350> couple<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
reassemble it because a couple of the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.680 
reassemble it because a couple of the
things<00:04:50.250> weren't<00:04:50.430> lining<00:04:50.880> up<00:04:51.060> when<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> was

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
things weren't lining up when I was

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.900 
things weren't lining up when I was
actually<00:04:52.020> installing<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.560> motherboard<00:04:52.980> and

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
actually installing the motherboard and

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.550 
actually installing the motherboard and
speaking<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.420> which<00:04:54.540> they<00:04:54.720> do<00:04:54.780> include<00:04:55.260> the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
speaking of which they do include the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.760 
speaking of which they do include the
hardware<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.580> enable<00:04:57.480> hot<00:04:58.260> swap<00:04:58.560> of

do that depending on where your system

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.270 
do that depending on where your system
