00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 been promised to 2015 is the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.860
 official launch for everyone's 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.940
 ift the glasses is today is the latest version 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.660
 it was crystal rolfe and that version 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 has improved and the quality of it where 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.519
 the nec panels will have inside the glasses 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.129
 ift is won is 1080p for each eye 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.010
 we will have a resolution in full hd 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.560
 and each eye was also improved 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.200
 motion detection of either you 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.400
 the head and the character do the same 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 movement in the right game and is obviously already 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 It was promised that for the final version 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.030
 still 50% better, and if this 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.360
 performance then promises a lot is a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.380
 technology that will revolutionize 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.760
 know if the price is 350 dollars 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.930
 was the latest version of developer kit 2 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.080
 is that I was stressed $ 150 if the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.720
 final version coming out about it will be 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.570
 a wonder to everyone who will be 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.740
 a very inviting price, it is clear that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.620
 Here in Brazil 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.800
 I think I 'd go out with the two thousand 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.500
 but it is still an important 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.140
 technology that promises a lot is 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.750
 of course before you buy into what 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.360
 he analysis has to at least do 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.860
 a test drive and we'll see if it will leave in 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.370
 department stores equal to stores 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.360
 we already have it there or if it goes 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.500
 be in specific sectors only 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.140
 no more waiting 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.739
 ok a big personal hug until 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.739
