they're coming from all about every

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.890 
they're coming from all about every
single<00:03:53.859> block<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.970> monsters<00:03:55.510> poor<00:03:55.720> this

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
single block is a is monsters poor this

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.270 
single block is a is monsters poor this
might<00:03:56.260> be<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.620> might<00:03:56.650> one<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.070> those<00:03:57.190> things

might be it might one of those things

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.710 
might be it might one of those things
where<00:03:57.400> these<00:03:57.609> blocks<00:03:57.940> automatically<00:03:58.510> turn

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
where these blocks automatically turn

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.599 
where these blocks automatically turn
into<00:03:58.989> silverfish<00:03:59.440> blocks<00:03:59.739> over<00:03:59.950> time<00:04:00.220> well

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
into silverfish blocks over time well

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.280 
into silverfish blocks over time well
about<00:04:00.790> yet<00:04:01.030> if<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.329> don't<00:04:01.480> let<00:04:01.570> me<00:04:01.630> push<00:04:02.140> they

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
about yet if you don't let me push they

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.380 
about yet if you don't let me push they
bury<00:04:02.530> they<00:04:03.100> grow<00:04:03.280> back<00:04:03.489> into<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.850> ground<00:04:04.120> and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
bury they grow back into the ground and

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.000 
bury they grow back into the ground and
they'll<00:04:04.989> just<00:04:05.170> go<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.350> whichever<00:04:05.590> block<00:04:05.890> they

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
they'll just go to whichever block they

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.640 
they'll just go to whichever block they
feel<00:04:06.190> like<00:04:06.600> well<00:04:07.600> they<00:04:07.690> probably<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.380> they

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
feel like well they probably and they

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.500 
feel like well they probably and they
probably<00:04:08.799> infect<00:04:09.310> other<00:04:09.549> blocks<00:04:09.910> right<00:04:10.269> yeah

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
probably infect other blocks right yeah

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.210 
probably infect other blocks right yeah
what<00:04:10.840> I'm<00:04:10.959> thinkin<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.470> don't<00:04:11.950> think<00:04:12.100> they

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
what I'm thinkin I don't think they

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.340 
what I'm thinkin I don't think they
multiply<00:04:12.730> like<00:04:13.090> there's<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.870> set<00:04:14.049> amount<00:04:14.140> of

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
multiply like there's a set amount of

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.170 
multiply like there's a set amount of
them<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.680> here<00:04:14.920> he<00:04:15.190> replaced<00:04:15.670> all<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.880> balls

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
them in here he replaced all the balls

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.360 
them in here he replaced all the balls
and<00:04:16.390> then<00:04:16.539> we<00:04:16.720> started<00:04:17.500> cashing<00:04:17.769> them<00:04:18.070> if<00:04:18.280> they

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
and then we started cashing them if they

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.099 
and then we started cashing them if they
started<00:04:18.640> burrowing<00:04:18.789> into<00:04:19.120> oh<00:04:19.299> my<00:04:19.510> god<00:04:19.660> more

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
started burrowing into oh my god more

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.080 
started burrowing into oh my god more
popping<00:04:20.650> out<00:04:20.799> oh<00:04:20.979> my<00:04:21.220> god<00:04:21.519> well<00:04:21.909> I<00:04:21.940> think

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
popping out oh my god well I think

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.460 
popping out oh my god well I think
they're<00:04:22.300> all<00:04:22.450> gonna<00:04:22.570> pop<00:04:22.780> out<00:04:22.930> for<00:04:23.110> all<00:04:23.229> these

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
they're all gonna pop out for all these

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.000 
they're all gonna pop out for all these
stone<00:04:23.740> brush<00:04:23.979> up<00:04:24.159> here

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
stone brush up here

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.260 
stone brush up here
probably<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:25.550> should<00:04:25.580> probably<00:04:25.820> just<00:04:26.030> clear

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
probably we should probably just clear

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.740 
probably we should probably just clear
this<00:04:26.390> place<00:04:26.540> out<00:04:27.070> oh<00:04:28.180> crap<00:04:29.180> sorry<00:04:29.330> Oh<00:04:31.750> does
