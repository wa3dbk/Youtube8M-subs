00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010
 and we are with them in these programs 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:10.650
 beautiful to inspire Christmas 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 against which how many years if really 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.619
 it was fantastic good and I love being 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.539
 here and the repercussion that it has and all the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.119
 world sees him thank everyone 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
 eternal to my students to you 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.619
 to your team to all to all students 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.150
 to go step by step and see 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.939
 these trees what I want to say from 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.520
 Libya is that she is not only a great 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.890
 creative but a great job to Bogota 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.450
 well let's see these trees that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.980
 surely they can do it at home 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.730
 course it is in the idea that was the idea 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.440
 to do it at home with different 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 establishes that they find some can 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 it may be in disuse we can leave them 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 well and start working and working in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.079
 go to create little tree to create ways to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 see that with different colors we follow 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.520
 with pastel colors but dominates a lot 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.550
 the pink also a green 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.130
 good natural dragon and do everything for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.860
 the cic land or things that one has 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.980
 spheres that have wood cuts and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.320
 they will see the step by step full step to 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.890
 I pass each of the little things 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.640
 little tree with cake in wood so 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.260
 first step plus the first thing we do 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.050
 with the woods as they are all different 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.260
 tones or we can have them all the same 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.870
 is to dye them with a little color 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.060
 red oxide acrylic if we want 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.760
 and they already have different breasts that give a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.010
 variety of woods that serve us 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.670
 funds to just look like those 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.610
 old woods lacquer wood wood well 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.790
 sealed already we commented it is what 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.040
 ideal for any wood the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.040
 protection once this is 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.440
 protected 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.660
 what is it that we spend our beloved 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.950
 candle may be that you have not 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.750
 we need to do it or not 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.930
 because these woods have a lot 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.380
 cloudiness but equal and step logically 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.450
 in the places where I'm going to wear 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 remember that we are doing the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.110
 worn out 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.790
 ready this is already 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.820
 mixed and I get celsius colors 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.680
 we go remember acrylic green 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.680
 lime plus cheese 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.390
 the idea was to achieve something more doughy 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.960
 and in this case we do it with the gesture 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.530
 of terna here we have the pink that was 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.610
 Pink baby pink sing and also that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.890
 you have to look good to Maldonado 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.400
 well pasty we can make this happen 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.460
 above or month and until it gives a layer 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.920
 quite quite considerable in this 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.920
 let's do it so we can never see 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.890
 you see well the rose that we had 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.630
 perfect is going to magically this is 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:07.860
 runs with a taste very well the idea is 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.370
 then take a very thick sandpaper and 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.249
 start to wear 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.829
 where I wanted to be really 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:20.560
 appear the wood may be a little more 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.409
 a little less that's going to be at ease and 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.760
 we always finished it with a loop 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.069
 steel 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.010
 and that will give you the little grill that 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.890
 we need more we can 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:37.540
 wear more or less here too 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.640
 I run this and I have a binary 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.400
 just with the lime green the touch 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.890
 final is to place a sponge on 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.799
 belly multipurpose adhesive is 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.569
 well sticky and can be was plated 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.620
 Golden 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:56.620
 remember the brightness always up 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.620
 much 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.970
 it is a detail nothing more because the measurement 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.000
 It has its privacy and is ideally not 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.340
 is completely golden 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.650
 we have a second proposal we have 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.080
 these spheres of telgopor we can give 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.330
 a base of the color that we want and 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.930
 we can decorate it directly with the 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.930
 dimensional 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.750
 plus 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.180
 and there it is clean and ready 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.820
 the living room is long pink support 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.750
 It is made with a photocopy any 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.060
 I have given it more resistance with a 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.590
 acetate already has multipurpose stuck 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:50.160
 cut it out is this tense and then what 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.260
 What I do is decorate it with foil and it happened 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.180
 a ribbon a thread with a needle if 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.560
 I want to hang it and it stays 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.080
 perfectly done if you just tell them with 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.240
 libya good if the program is a lot for 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.180
 see many times but how is the 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.850
