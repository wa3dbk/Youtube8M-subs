00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it in the middle and so it'll kind of be

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.149 
it in the middle and so it'll kind of be
like<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.350> we'll<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.830> room<00:01:17.040> than

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
like this but we'll have more room than

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.440 
like this but we'll have more room than
these<00:01:17.310> pins<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> three

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
these pins because this is just a three

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.170 
these pins because this is just a three
foot<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> they'll<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> 24

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
foot and so it will have a they'll be 24

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.260 
foot and so it will have a they'll be 24
by<00:01:21.210> 24<00:01:21.330> pins<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.259> they'll<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.119> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
by 24 pins is what they'll be so that is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.719 
by 24 pins is what they'll be so that is
my<00:01:24.420> next<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:25.049> next<00:01:25.350> goal<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.549> hold

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
my next my next goal and that will hold

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
my next my next goal and that will hold
all<00:01:26.939> these<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.689> these<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.140> ones<00:01:28.500> that

to<00:01:51.030> her<00:01:51.780> growing<00:01:52.079> up<00:01:52.259> she's<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:52.740> bitty

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to her growing up she's a little bitty

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.410 
to her growing up she's a little bitty
thing<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.030> she'll<00:01:54.750> grow<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:56.420> but

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
thing right now but she'll grow up but

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.870 
thing right now but she'll grow up but
the<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.869> they're<00:01:58.079> these<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.799> built<00:01:59.009> as<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the way they're these are built as you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.859 
the way they're these are built as you
do<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> frame<00:02:00.450> which<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.590> these<00:02:01.770> two<00:02:02.040> by<00:02:02.189> fours

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
do the frame which is these two by fours

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.089 
do the frame which is these two by fours
like<00:02:03.869> an<00:02:04.020> H<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.490> connect<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.950> 2<00:02:07.950> by<00:02:08.069> 4

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
like an H and then you connect a 2 by 4

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.339 
like an H and then you connect a 2 by 4
on<00:02:08.610> both<00:02:08.670> sides<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.679> 2<00:02:10.920> by<00:02:10.950> 4<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:12.360> top<00:02:12.780> okay

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
on both sides and a 2 by 4 on top okay

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.059 
on both sides and a 2 by 4 on top okay
and<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.340> brace<00:02:15.670> every<00:02:16.150> two<00:02:16.450> feet<00:02:17.069> see

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
and then you brace every two feet see

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.280 
and then you brace every two feet see
that<00:02:18.219> one<00:02:18.340> down<00:02:18.459> there<00:02:18.670> across<00:02:19.109> every<00:02:20.109> two

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
that one down there across every two

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.319 
that one down there across every two
feet<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:21.159> says<00:02:21.400> these<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:24.819> can<00:02:24.969> see<00:02:25.180> it

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
feet that says these here you can see it

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.149 
feet that says these here you can see it
these<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.109> are<00:02:26.139> made<00:02:26.469> separately<00:02:27.069> and

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
these here are made separately and

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.580 
these here are made separately and
they're<00:02:27.310> instead<00:02:27.969> placed<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.329> there<00:02:28.590> these

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
they're instead placed in there these

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.740 
they're instead placed in there these
kind<00:02:30.549> of<00:02:30.579> messed<00:02:30.790> me<00:02:30.939> up<00:02:30.969> because<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.540> did<00:02:31.719> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
kind of messed me up because I did a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.649 
kind of messed me up because I did a
three<00:02:32.079> inch<00:02:32.280> tilt<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.519> them<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:34.209> make<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.480> rain

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
three inch tilt on them to make the rain

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.449 
three inch tilt on them to make the rain
off<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.469> wouldn't<00:02:35.769> suggest<00:02:35.889> that<00:02:36.159> just<00:02:36.370> to

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
off but I wouldn't suggest that just to

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.420 
off but I wouldn't suggest that just to
them<00:02:36.549> square<00:02:37.439> they're<00:02:38.439> easier<00:02:38.799> that<00:02:38.950> way<00:02:39.159> and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
them square they're easier that way and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.030 
them square they're easier that way and
what<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.060> do<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.510> up<00:02:40.689> here<00:02:41.139> after<00:02:41.469> you<00:02:41.799> get<00:02:41.889> done

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
what I do is up here after you get done

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.949 
what I do is up here after you get done
with<00:02:42.099> your<00:02:42.340> pen<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:42.969> it's<00:02:43.090> square<00:02:43.450> because

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
with your pen and it's square because

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.239 
with your pen and it's square because
you<00:02:44.049> can<00:02:44.139> see<00:02:44.290> our<00:02:44.379> mine<00:02:44.560> has<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.769> little<00:02:45.040> bit<00:02:45.159> of

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:45.249 
you can see our mine has a little bit of

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.259 
you can see our mine has a little bit of
a<00:02:45.340> drop<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.889> right<00:02:47.889> there

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
a drop to it right there

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.179 
a drop to it right there
I'd<00:02:49.659> put<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.930> 1<00:02:50.169> by<00:02:50.200> underneath<00:02:51.010> right<00:02:51.129> here

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
I'd put a 1 by underneath right here

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.449 
I'd put a 1 by underneath right here
just<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:52.000> give<00:02:52.150> enough<00:02:52.389> heat<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.599> water<00:02:52.810> off

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
just to give enough heat the water off

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459 
just to give enough heat the water off
but<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.879> way<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.060> did<00:02:55.299> these<00:02:55.449> I<00:02:55.480> had<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:56.349> know

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
but the way I did these I had a you know

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.170 
but the way I did these I had a you know
how<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.680> cut<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.219> do<00:02:57.340> different<00:02:57.669> angles<00:02:58.030> and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
how to cut and do different angles and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.170 
how to cut and do different angles and
it<00:02:58.269> just<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.959> wasn't<00:02:59.349> worth<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.560> effort<00:03:00.180> but

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
it just it wasn't worth the effort but

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.069 
it just it wasn't worth the effort but
decent<00:03:01.659> hear<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.590> scream<00:03:03.099> them<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.689> to<00:03:04.870> by

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
decent hear you scream them to the to by

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.369 
decent hear you scream them to the to by
Oh<00:03:05.319> below<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.569> that's<00:03:07.780> how<00:03:07.989> these<00:03:08.199> are

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
Oh below it and that's how these are

are made out of stripped two-by-fours
I<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:24.090> cut<00:03:25.090> two<00:03:25.269> by<00:03:25.419> fours<00:03:25.659> in<00:03:25.750> half<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.229> then

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
I just cut two by fours in half and then

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.890 
I just cut two by fours in half and then
did<00:03:27.430> all<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.849> that's<00:03:28.090> how<00:03:28.269> old<00:03:28.449> it<00:03:28.569> is<00:03:28.599> to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
did all this that's how old it is to

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.920 
did all this that's how old it is to
save<00:03:29.319> a<00:03:29.349> little<00:03:29.470> bit<00:03:29.739> did<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.609> doors<00:03:30.849> or<00:03:32.819> just

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
save a little bit did the doors or just

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.749 
save a little bit did the doors or just
all<00:03:34.979> one<00:03:35.979> before<00:03:36.370> cut<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.239> half<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:38.590> use<00:03:39.489> the

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:39.759 
all one before cut in half and use the

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.110 
all one before cut in half and use the
whole<00:03:39.939> I<00:03:40.599> think<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.259> did<00:03:41.439> one<00:03:41.829> inch<00:03:42.040> up<00:03:42.669> here<00:03:43.000> in

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
whole I think I did one inch up here in

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.349 
whole I think I did one inch up here in
two<00:03:43.329> inches<00:03:43.629> I<00:03:43.750> think<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.989> this<00:03:44.379> is<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:45.359> after

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
two inches I think I this is the after

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.699 
two inches I think I this is the after
this<00:03:46.509> all<00:03:46.720> cuts<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.229> you<00:03:47.319> know<00:03:47.409> this<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.650> a

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
this all cuts it you know this is a

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.710 
this all cuts it you know this is a
little<00:03:47.799> bigger<00:03:48.040> than<00:03:48.159> that<00:03:48.419> is<00:03:49.419> what<00:03:49.599> I<00:03:49.629> think

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
little bigger than that is what I think

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.599 
little bigger than that is what I think
I<00:03:49.840> did<00:03:50.019> because<00:03:50.169> on<00:03:50.290> this<00:03:50.439> one<00:03:50.650> here<00:03:51.009> I<00:03:51.159> just

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
I did because on this one here I just

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.849 
I did because on this one here I just
used<00:03:52.060> one<00:03:52.359> inch<00:03:52.509> pieces<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.109> they<00:03:53.709> just

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
used one inch pieces and they just

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.619 
used one inch pieces and they just
haven't<00:03:54.159> worked<00:03:54.220> good<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:54.879> can<00:03:55.030> see<00:03:55.299> this

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
haven't worked good so you can see this
