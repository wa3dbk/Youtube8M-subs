you

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.720 

I'm<00:00:05.410> here<00:00:05.740> with<00:00:05.770> the<00:00:06.069> fujifilm<00:00:07.950> x100<00:00:08.950> changing

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
I'm here with the fujifilm x100 changing

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.549 
I'm here with the fujifilm x100 changing
the<00:00:09.820> lens<00:00:10.030> camera<00:00:10.450> from<00:00:10.600> fujifilm<00:00:11.110> this<00:00:11.260> year

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
the lens camera from fujifilm this year

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.660 
the lens camera from fujifilm this year
but<00:00:11.740> we're<00:00:11.860> seeing<00:00:12.070> it<00:00:12.190> first<00:00:12.400> here<00:00:12.519> at

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
but we're seeing it first here at

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.240 
but we're seeing it first here at
photokina<00:00:13.120> the<00:00:13.990> first<00:00:14.200> one<00:00:14.410> was<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.710> x-pro<00:00:15.220> 1

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
photokina the first one was the x-pro 1

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.700 
photokina the first one was the x-pro 1
and<00:00:15.760> that<00:00:15.849> was<00:00:16.029> a<00:00:16.059> pretty<00:00:16.360> pricey<00:00:16.810> prospecting

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
and that was a pretty pricey prospecting

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.680 
and that was a pretty pricey prospecting
this<00:00:18.070> one's<00:00:18.279> looking<00:00:18.670> a<00:00:18.849> little<00:00:19.029> bit<00:00:19.240> cheaper

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
this one's looking a little bit cheaper

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.390 
this one's looking a little bit cheaper
so<00:00:19.900> it's<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.110> bit<00:00:20.260> more<00:00:20.380> affordable<00:00:21.039> for<00:00:21.100> your

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
so it's a bit more affordable for your

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.330 
so it's a bit more affordable for your
general<00:00:21.760> consumer<00:00:22.500> now<00:00:23.500> it<00:00:23.800> does<00:00:24.010> have<00:00:24.220> the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
general consumer now it does have the

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.090 
general consumer now it does have the
same<00:00:24.670> center<00:00:25.359> of<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.810> x-pro<00:00:26.230> 1<00:00:26.260> so<00:00:26.710> it's<00:00:26.920> got<00:00:27.070> a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
same center of the x-pro 1 so it's got a

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.279 
same center of the x-pro 1 so it's got a
16<00:00:27.520> point<00:00:27.730> three<00:00:27.910> megapixel<00:00:28.090> sensor<00:00:28.930> in<00:00:29.050> here

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
16 point three megapixel sensor in here

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.470 
16 point three megapixel sensor in here
but<00:00:30.100> in<00:00:30.189> terms<00:00:30.430> of<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:30.730> rest<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:31.029> it<00:00:31.119> it's<00:00:31.330> a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
but in terms of the rest of it it's a

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.210 
but in terms of the rest of it it's a
little<00:00:31.750> bit<00:00:31.900> smaller<00:00:32.169> in<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.410> body<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:33.070> you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
little bit smaller in the body and you

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.340 
little bit smaller in the body and you
don't<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:33.910> hybrid<00:00:34.300> viewfinder<00:00:34.989> on<00:00:35.170> the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
don't have the hybrid viewfinder on the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.930 
don't have the hybrid viewfinder on the
x<00:00:35.470> pro<00:00:35.680> one<00:00:35.890> you<00:00:36.040> had<00:00:36.220> an<00:00:36.339> optical<00:00:36.729> and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
x pro one you had an optical and

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.880

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
electronic viewfinder on this one you've

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.140 
electronic viewfinder on this one you've
just<00:00:39.100> got<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.370> only<00:00:39.850> dude<00:00:40.180> finder<00:00:40.570> now<00:00:41.409> it's<00:00:41.650> a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
just got the only dude finder now it's a

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.719 
just got the only dude finder now it's a
2.86<00:00:43.170> million<00:00:44.170> doctor<00:00:44.710> viewfinder<00:00:45.309> and<00:00:45.489> it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
2.86 million doctor viewfinder and it

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.020 
2.86 million doctor viewfinder and it
uses<00:00:45.909> a<00:00:46.120> spherical<00:00:46.629> glass<00:00:46.839> in<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.229> lens<00:00:47.440> which

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
uses a spherical glass in the lens which

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.820 
uses a spherical glass in the lens which
fujifilm<00:00:49.030> says<00:00:49.299> should<00:00:49.600> make<00:00:49.839> it<00:00:50.019> sharper<00:00:50.530> in

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
fujifilm says should make it sharper in

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.219 
fujifilm says should make it sharper in
the<00:00:51.100> corners<00:00:51.519> you've<00:00:52.449> got<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.629> very<00:00:52.809> slightly

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
the corners you've got a very slightly

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.469 
the corners you've got a very slightly
smaller<00:00:53.680> display<00:00:54.190> here<00:00:54.489> this<00:00:54.879> one's<00:00:55.030> an<00:00:55.150> LCD

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
smaller display here this one's an LCD

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.079 
smaller display here this one's an LCD
display<00:00:55.989> not<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.559> 3-inch<00:00:56.979> it<00:00:57.159> for<00:00:57.309> 2.8<00:00:57.850> inch

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
display not the 3-inch it for 2.8 inch

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.700 
display not the 3-inch it for 2.8 inch
so<00:00:58.600> it's<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:58.869> slightly<00:00:59.110> smaller<00:00:59.500> than<00:00:59.589> the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
so it's just slightly smaller than the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.910 
so it's just slightly smaller than the
expo<00:01:00.159> one<00:01:00.430> you've<00:01:01.420> got<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.570> similar<00:01:02.019> setup<00:01:02.559> in

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
expo one you've got a similar setup in

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.070 
expo one you've got a similar setup in
the<00:01:02.949> functions<00:01:03.460> you've<00:01:03.940> got<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.390> exposure

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
the functions you've got the exposure

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.570 
the functions you've got the exposure
compensation<00:01:05.229> here<00:01:05.890> your<00:01:06.250> shutter<00:01:06.460> speed

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
compensation here your shutter speed

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.580 
compensation here your shutter speed
here<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.479> then<00:01:07.869> you<00:01:07.960> can<00:01:08.140> change<00:01:08.170> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
here and then you can change the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.190 
here and then you can change the
aperture<00:01:08.829> using<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.579> ring<00:01:09.759> on<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.149> lens<00:01:10.200> now

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
aperture using the ring on the lens now

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.959 
aperture using the ring on the lens now
looking<00:01:11.619> through<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.130> only<00:01:12.399> view<00:01:12.460> finder<00:01:12.789> it

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
looking through the only view finder it

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.490 
looking through the only view finder it
really<00:01:13.240> is<00:01:13.329> quite<00:01:13.630> right<00:01:13.960> as<00:01:14.140> I've<00:01:14.289> said

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
really is quite right as I've said

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.440 
really is quite right as I've said
they've<00:01:14.710> made<00:01:14.920> some<00:01:14.950> changes<00:01:15.579> to<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.060> in

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
they've made some changes to that in

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.749 
they've made some changes to that in
terms<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.840> complaints<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.799> x-pro<00:01:18.310> 1<00:01:18.340> and

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
terms of complaints to the x-pro 1 and

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.219 
terms of complaints to the x-pro 1 and
it<00:01:18.850> really<00:01:19.000> does<00:01:19.210> sort<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.570> pick<00:01:19.810> up<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.079> night

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
it really does sort of pick up the night

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.349 
it really does sort of pick up the night
in<00:01:20.409> here<00:01:20.439> another<00:01:21.399> difference<00:01:21.609> on<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.030> model

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
in here another difference on this model

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.419 
in here another difference on this model
is<00:01:22.479> that<00:01:22.539> you've<00:01:22.810> got<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:23.020> pop-up<00:01:23.439> flash<00:01:23.770> which

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
is that you've got a pop-up flash which

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.209 
is that you've got a pop-up flash which
you<00:01:24.579> didn't<00:01:24.820> have<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.270> x-pro<00:01:25.719> 1<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:27.009> as

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
you didn't have on the x-pro 1 now as

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.490 
you didn't have on the x-pro 1 now as
I've<00:01:27.369> said<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:28.179> one<00:01:28.390> will<00:01:28.570> be<00:01:28.750> cheaper<00:01:29.289> than

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
I've said this one will be cheaper than

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.469 
I've said this one will be cheaper than
the<00:01:29.560> extra<00:01:29.979> one<00:01:30.189> it's<00:01:30.579> coming<00:01:30.939> in<00:01:31.060> at<00:01:31.179> nine

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
the extra one it's coming in at nine

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.719 
the extra one it's coming in at nine
hundred<00:01:31.929> euros<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.649> body<00:01:32.829> only<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.490> what

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
hundred euros for the body only so what

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.120 
hundred euros for the body only so what
are<00:01:33.789> we<00:01:33.850> going<00:01:33.969> to<00:01:34.060> say<00:01:34.210> about<00:01:34.359> 800<00:01:35.140> pounds<00:01:35.590> if

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
are we going to say about 800 pounds if

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.919 
are we going to say about 800 pounds if
you're<00:01:36.189> buying<00:01:36.579> it<00:01:36.700> as<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.850> kit<00:01:37.270> it's<00:01:37.749> a<00:01:37.840> little

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
you're buying it as a kit it's a little

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.440 
you're buying it as a kit it's a little
bit<00:01:38.140> pricey<00:01:38.350> around<00:01:38.829> sort<00:01:39.039> of<00:01:39.179> 1200<00:01:40.179> years<00:01:40.270> i

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
bit pricey around sort of 1200 years i

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.610 
bit pricey around sort of 1200 years i
think<00:01:40.719> we<00:01:40.810> are<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.229> i<00:01:41.499> guess<00:01:41.829> it's<00:01:42.009> more<00:01:42.159> like

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
think we are so i guess it's more like
