batteries<00:01:48.970> holding<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.280> goes<00:01:51.430> down<00:01:51.460> it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
batteries holding as it goes down it's

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.940 
batteries holding as it goes down it's
just<00:01:52.630> like<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> regular<00:01:52.990> fuel<00:01:53.410> gauge<00:01:53.590> it'll<00:01:53.830> go

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
just like a regular fuel gauge it'll go

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.580 
just like a regular fuel gauge it'll go
down<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.310> do<00:01:54.460> not<00:01:54.490> lose<00:01:54.970> any<00:01:55.240> power<00:01:55.590> until

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
down you do not lose any power until

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.720 
down you do not lose any power until
you're<00:01:56.800> out<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.310> power

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730
