00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.540
 chapter 6 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 unexpected meeting when i came back 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 his home and just sat on the sofa and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.180
 grabbed his head 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 am i really so attached to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.410
 animatronic that I am ready to kill 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.050
 expected such a turn so 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.670
 the only thing left to do 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 duplicate audio and video recordings to 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 blackmail the pizzeria founders and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 beg for his reward know and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.320
 when will come back after i did 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.640
 duplicate and I already simply closed the gas 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.980
 a little bit sleepy and then 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 check for what this tablet is it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.239
 completely different from what I saw 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.300
 in the place of the guard closing my eyes again 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 plunged into the world of dreams through a dream and I 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.829
 heard some strange sounds 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.780
 usually nobody comes to me who 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.329
 it's rubbing my eyes I froze in place from 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.030
 fear of me was a puppet 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.180
 I would consider it a regular joke T-shirt 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.850
 but not this time her eyes were burning the same 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.369
 skates like that animatronics and that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.880
 do I really do it my punishment 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.930
 for what I did yesterday sit there 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.299
 please, we still looked at each other 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.000
 on the friend on the spot but unexpectedly 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.100
 puppet tashu cancel I rose and 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.619
 sat on the couch however fear is still not 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.729
 unexpectedly this animatronic left me 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.570
 spoke to me 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.750
 Hello , how are you ? 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.869
 at the exhibition this is the first time I 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.310
 heard the voice of this animatronic 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.509
 since i was known puppet 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.549
 is the experimental version 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.040
 animatronics with improved artificial 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.020
 intelligence on for some reason this 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.909
 animatronic was not controlled but 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.250
 to disassemble it for some reason was 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.290
 impossible therefore this was invented 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.360
 casket because of her animatronic 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.149
 getting calmer but nobody so 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.350
 and did not dare to correct this failure pancakes 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.509
 why I remembered it just now 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.020
 gathered spirit and answered with me everything 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.390
 okay, I just slept just yawning 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.540
 looked at his watch 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.020
 8-10 What is this animatronic crazy 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.690
 whether 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.650
 although there should not be another question 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.190
 why is he here puppet watched everything 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.040
 on me 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.650
 her eyes were burning and I understood that she was clearly 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.569
 something I suspect I decided 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.969
 to ask 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.920
 and you can not explain why it is not 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.540
 in its place 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.189
 the children can and the mound jumped 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.760
 me and grabbing my throat start 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.629
 not talking about children I tried 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.010
 graze them 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.939
 tried but nothing came out they 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.120
 did not recognize me as their savior and 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.400
 to lead a puppet for him 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.790
 turned away from me 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.239
 tried to save what she says what 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.980
 I do n't understand because of him I remembered 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.200
 agent note where he mentioned that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.019
 phaseber family dnr was closed due 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.209
 disgusting smell from animatronics 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.829
 did this puppet try she 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.379
 was even before this pizzeria 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.540
 I had too many questions for her 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.180
 but I was even afraid to open my mouth to 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.030
 find out at least 1 answer I remembered 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.379
 the tablet that I brought sky rooms 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.239
 gently taking his composition I started 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:36.239
 include it followed the question are you 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.500
 hate me i swallowed a knife 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.500
 this animatronic can feel and 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.150
 may be this though santa engineer 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.900
 obsessed with animatronics what 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.109
 be surprised 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.599
 I still decided to answer and because of what 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.549
 i can hate you because you 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.319
 here or because I wanted someone 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.479
 save 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.209
 i know your feelings sincere puppet 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:02.849
 you want to help everyone, even fighting with 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.439
 the hardest but even I can't do anything 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:10.290
 do even save someone I looked 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.299
 on the tablet and was amazed in front of the icon 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.500
 with the image of animatronics were numbers 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:20.120
 here were all animatronics that I knew 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.979
 these numbers are tilly meters 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.320
 so that's why they attack 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.110
 guard steve from this tablet 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.720
 would send commands so the signal 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.660
 mongongo not immediately worked well, what am I 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.630
 puppet looking up sponges 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.220
 this puppet ask me mean you 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.900
 want to save someone too 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.940
 Yes, I really want even at the cost of my life 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.500
 her eyes suddenly went out on her heart 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.830
 Immediately and required means no more 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.600
 worth it afraid I hope you succeed 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:57.250
 maz well I must return it 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.539
 now just thinking about you will like it 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.020
 after which I again went all the sound 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.000
 caskets and puppet was not understand what 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.280
 that meant why she needed to 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.070
 come to me but at least i 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.400
 I know that I did not rule but I doubt 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.870
 that it will help not to keep them in the night 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.660
 putting the kettle and I decided to find out what 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.190
 I left a gift puppet 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.400
 having untied the tape and opening the box I would 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.950
 surprised what was inside there was 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.860
 pistol pistol taking him in my arms 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.300
 nostalgia immediately swept over 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.880
 when i was a little mother with kept u 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.460
 yourself this gun 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.040
 Biryukova always clean the pupil of the eye 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.860
 smeared went to the shooting range and shot him 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.990
 sometimes even about me 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.539
 one day when we went to shooting dad 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.340
 nevertheless decided to give a shoot without taking 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.830
 the gun I do not think bed 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.319
 Targets father was very Julian because I 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.389
 hit exactly the top ten it was 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.280
 indescribable feeling after i 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.870
 pulled the trigger 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.419
 Of course I was a little scared of this recoil 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.310
 he constantly water me there and honed 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:03.479
 possession of this weapon after all promised me 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:06.000
 give it back when i grow up new this is not 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.490
 it happened because they never returned with 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.430
 your last flight 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.400
 I always remember the words of the father remember 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.060
 son if you are in arms 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.710
 I don't use to kill anyone 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.529
 I use it to protect those who you 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.500
 roads and be always calm and not 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:30.599
 hesitate here the rink will give and you can our 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.279
 on the trigger I leaned the trunk to my forehead and 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.729
 talked to 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:38.009
 father i remember about it 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.409
 I checked the cartridges the store was completely 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.480
 charged in the same box was another 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.490
 clip 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.380
 apparently someone from the former guards was 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.950
 armed on however he did not live so 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.910
 I whistled like a teapot for a long time 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.330
 brewed coffee 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.410
 cleaned all the composition I started breakfast yes 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.260
 my plan was initially failed 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:03.200
 however the puppet fixed it 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:06.470
 smiling I spoke a rumor thank you 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.470

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.380

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.330
 would he like to say something interesting 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.350
 this is what you can influence 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.500

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.780
