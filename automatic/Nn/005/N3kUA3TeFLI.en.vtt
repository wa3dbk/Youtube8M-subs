00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the way this amp is set up where I have

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
the way this amp is set up where I have
the<00:01:08.490> EQ<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.820> everything<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> volumes<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the EQ and everything in the volumes so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:53.050 
the EQ and everything in the volumes so
now

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.599 

that's<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.539> Texas<00:01:53.869> Channel<00:01:54.200> go<00:01:55.130> ahead<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.520> the

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
that's the Texas Channel go ahead on the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.789 
that's the Texas Channel go ahead on the
mega<00:01:55.820> for<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.179> to<00:01:57.020> me<00:01:57.109> this<00:01:57.259> channel<00:01:57.560> sounds

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
mega for you to me this channel sounds

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.059 
mega for you to me this channel sounds
are<00:01:57.890> closest<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> Herbert<00:01:58.909> as<00:01:59.240> far<00:01:59.539> as<00:02:00.069> the

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
are closest to a Herbert as far as the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.090 
are closest to a Herbert as far as the
UM<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.600> Einstein<00:02:02.990> goes<00:02:03.229> because<00:02:03.439> like

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
UM the Einstein goes because like

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.249 
UM the Einstein goes because like
depending<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.149> how<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.329> have<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.539> set<00:02:05.780> up<00:02:05.810> if

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
depending on how you have it set up if

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.719 
depending on how you have it set up if
you<00:02:06.649> have<00:02:06.859> the<00:02:07.720> first<00:02:08.720> channel<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:10.549> clean

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
you have the first channel and the clean

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.820 
you have the first channel and the clean
mode<00:02:10.940> it<00:02:11.569> has<00:02:11.629> kind<00:02:11.959> of<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.080> bleed<00:02:12.349> over<00:02:12.530> feature

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
mode it has kind of a bleed over feature

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
mode it has kind of a bleed over feature
so<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.879> depending<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:14.299> what<00:02:14.629> setting<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
so it depending on what setting of the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.110 
so it depending on what setting of the
first<00:02:16.250> channel<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.549> have<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:16.849> it's<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.060> a

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
first channel you have if it's in a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.150 
first channel you have if it's in a
clean<00:02:18.019> mode<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.349> like<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.560> least<00:02:18.709> bleed<00:02:18.980> or

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
clean mode is like the least bleed or

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.110 
clean mode is like the least bleed or
it's<00:02:19.250> got<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.549> clearest<00:02:19.910> kind<00:02:20.060> of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
it's got like the clearest kind of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.180 
it's got like the clearest kind of
punching<00:02:20.420> sound<00:02:20.660> Texas<00:02:21.590> had<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.769> little<00:02:22.010> more

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
punching sound Texas had a little more

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.190 
punching sound Texas had a little more
compression<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.540> more<00:02:23.660> bleed<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.019> mega

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
compression a little more bleed and mega

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.360 
compression a little more bleed and mega
kind<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.530> makes<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.709> little<00:02:24.890> channel<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.190> most

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
kind of makes a little channel the most

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.210 
kind of makes a little channel the most
bled<00:02:25.670> through<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.290> I'll<00:02:27.290> try<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.650> catch<00:02:27.920> that

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
bled through and I'll try and catch that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.500 
bled through and I'll try and catch that
on<00:02:28.310> here<00:02:28.489> it's<00:02:28.610> it's<00:02:28.790> more<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.030> fuel<00:02:29.269> thing

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
on here it's it's more of a fuel thing

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.059 
on here it's it's more of a fuel thing
it's<00:02:29.780> going<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.989> be<00:02:30.049> pretty<00:02:30.260> minut<00:02:30.739> in<00:02:30.890> the

you know let's wish on the quick master
volume<00:03:31.260> use<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.530> here's<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.800> second<00:03:32.100> master

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
volume use this here's the second master

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.380 
volume use this here's the second master
volume<00:03:32.580> about<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.760> same<00:03:32.940> volume<00:03:33.150> level

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.900 

so<00:03:38.380> not<00:03:38.560> too<00:03:38.710> much<00:03:38.830> tunnel<00:03:39.190> change<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.640> mean<00:03:39.760> now

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
so not too much tunnel change I mean now

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.100 
so not too much tunnel change I mean now
I<00:03:40.210> know<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.420> volumes<00:03:40.720> about<00:03:40.780> its<00:03:40.960> close

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
I know the volumes about its close

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.710 
I know the volumes about its close
together<00:03:41.380> as<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.560> could<00:03:41.800> audibly<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:43.630> know

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
together as I could audibly but you know

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.120 
together as I could audibly but you know
and<00:03:43.930> that's<00:03:44.020> pretty<00:03:44.500> hard<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.800> do<00:03:44.920> on<00:03:45.040> an

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
and that's pretty hard to do on an

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.430 
and that's pretty hard to do on an
analog<00:03:45.400> device<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.000> okay<00:03:46.990> so<00:03:47.050> here's<00:03:47.350> the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
analog device and okay so here's the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:04:07.540 
analog device and okay so here's the
lesion<00:03:47.890> on<00:03:48.340> mode<00:03:49.210> one

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.940 

I'll<00:04:08.550> flip<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.790> over<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.180> mode<00:04:09.600> 2<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.680> first

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
I'll flip it over to mode 2 on the first

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:29.340 
I'll flip it over to mode 2 on the first
channel<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.460> here's

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:56.520 

also<00:04:30.350> show<00:04:30.530> Omega

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.070 

I<00:04:56.560> personally<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:57.790> to<00:04:57.910> run<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.180> first<00:04:58.840> minor

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
I personally like to run it first minor

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:32.740 
I personally like to run it first minor
thing<00:04:59.260> as<00:04:59.350> much

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.660 

yeah<00:05:32.900> excuse<00:05:33.560> my<00:05:33.710> sloppiness<00:05:34.160> that<00:05:34.400> just<00:05:34.550> kind

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
of got up from a nap but um that takes

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.270 
of got up from a nap but um that takes
care<00:05:37.430> of<00:05:37.490> everything

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.930

functioning<00:05:43.940> he's<00:05:44.060> usually<00:05:44.180> all<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:44.540> effects

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
functioning he's usually all the effects

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.150 
functioning he's usually all the effects
live<00:05:44.960> hooked<00:05:45.140> up<00:05:45.290> but<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.530> don't<00:05:45.680> want<00:05:45.830> to<00:05:45.980> use

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
live hooked up but I don't want to use

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.950 
live hooked up but I don't want to use
it<00:05:46.340> so<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:46.640> mean<00:05:46.850> it<00:05:46.970> works<00:05:47.090> perfectly<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:47.600> had<00:05:47.840> it

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
it so I mean it works perfectly I had it

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.140 
it so I mean it works perfectly I had it
worked<00:05:48.110> up<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.260> few<00:05:48.410> months<00:05:48.500> back<00:05:48.820> so<00:05:49.820> that's

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
worked up a few months back so that's

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.910 
worked up a few months back so that's
the<00:05:50.360> Einstein<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:50.960> hope<00:05:51.410> somebody<00:05:51.620> elect

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
the Einstein and hope somebody elect

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.760 
the Einstein and hope somebody elect
purchase<00:05:52.280> it<00:05:52.430> thanks
