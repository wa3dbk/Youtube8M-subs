00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.310
 a very good news is also a subject 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.500
 very expected all owners of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.410
 cell phones starting in March we will 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.120
 be able to change them from cell phone company 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.769
 but this does not mean that we are going to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.099
 lose our phone number 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.320
 it's called numerical portability from 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.079
 March, users who change their 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.079
 company will not lose your number 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.730
 cellular is an achievement that comes comes 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.460
 of recognition by the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.040
 status of the right of users 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.950
 we have a right about our number 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.829
 and also to the delay of the 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.719
 implementation in the year 2009 there was a 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.850
 Amparo action that we carry out from the 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.719
 union of users and consumers that 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.940
 had a favorable and good effect 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.260
 right recognition combination 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.660
 of the state of the action so that 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.720
 it is simply what we now see that 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.850
 the companies of the sector begin to 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.490
 offer we are going to be able to change 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.520
 of company 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.200
 towards Asia that offers you better 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.960
 not only better benefits are seen 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.970
 benefits in the plans benefits 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.550
 economic but also a series of 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.080
 things quality of service quality of 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.520
 attention and those that allow us to 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.220
 there is a good signal in the areas where 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.620
 we are usually done is going 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 to have a people is this portability 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.340
 general number what we always ask 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.650
 us greater competition from the area 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.710
 it is expected that from now on the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.320
 companies improve the quality of their 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.220
 services are blue are quilmes are a 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.600
 the most are to lanÃºs when they say we have 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.410
 problems with the signal lend more 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.610
 attention it seems to me that they are the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.910
 possibility of leaving are good 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.890
 incentives so that like us 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.450
 the associations we ask for more 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.550
 state intervention we also have 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.720
 we ask for a better market, that is, I think 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.640
 what 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.540
 it will aim to generate incentives 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 important so there is a better 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.810
 market
