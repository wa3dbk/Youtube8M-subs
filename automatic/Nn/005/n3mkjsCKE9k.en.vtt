00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.780
 The winter is finally over and over 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.260
 it starts work again on the 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.300
 field 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.970
 this includes a sustainable one 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.250
 application of pesticides that 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.530
 one arable land moderately and nevertheless in the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.810
 treating rush tempo can be proved 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.160
 last september the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.890
 agrarian cooperative gold so theirs 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.430
 staff an amazon field spray and 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.259
 a fendt 933 vario joined one 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.960
 set a new record 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.819
 the goal within 24 hours 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.769
 at least 1,000 hectares of rape 

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:41.370
 petting a harry pulls 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.530
 to create treatment 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.300
 clearly for such a project it needs 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.649
 a real big business the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.059
 agrarian cooperative gold so 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.399
 farms near the german 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.489
 polish border in brandenburg more 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.429
 as 6300 hectares mainly 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.199
 winter wheat and winter rape due to 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.850
 weather conditions had to start 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.019
 september the start of a day 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.940
 be moved 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.369
 the record day was exactly 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.620
 planned through but all euphoria to 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.900
 despite the final go comes 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.910
 in the end, from the head of plant construction of the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.830
 agrarian business because the record attempt 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.600
 should finally be under real 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.600
 conditions of use take place 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.300
 challenge enough because we have 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.640
 treatment plants which also partially 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.260
 go across the field so that you 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.540
 also a few obstacles to stand there 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.150
 has 40 meters white tight 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.530
 the syringe belongs up there 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.410
 appropriate driving which sends 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.020
 And in any case the thumb 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.020
 that you have a successful day here tomorrow 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.060
 can do the planning for the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.690
 Record attempt already began weeks 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.560
 before 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.060
 The main initiator of the project is Amazon 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.830
 The manufacturer sends the race into the race 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.260
 12,000 liters of antifreeze x11 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.360
 1200 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.750
 As a tractor, it was decided completely 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.690
 deliberately suitable for fans of the 900 vario 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.290
 thanks to efficiency comfort and performance 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.890
 perfect for this use exactly at 12 o'clock 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.720
 12 on the third of september 2014 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.720
 the record attempt then started 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.200
 three drivers steer the sprits team in the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.750
 stratified operation supported by a 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.940
 mobile rtk station and the tractor 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.400
 own track guidance system vario guide 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.990
 the drivers can connect perfectly 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.490
 drive 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.570
 In addition, all obstacles were on 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.440
 digital cards in advance frank 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.620
 working speeds up to 17 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.290
 hourly kilometers are possible with the 40 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.180
 meters working width are so fast the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.180
 first 100 hectares done 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.450
 also among the extraordinary 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.670
 conditions of the record attempt course 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.130
 it is also about the plant protection so 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.730
 efficient and sustainable as possible too 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.730
 hold 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.860
 section control helps with this 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.080
 The steering system will be overlapped 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.620
 in front of terrain and at the edges of the field 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.500
 individual part widths of the rod 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.240
 automatically switched on and off 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.370
 Turboprop highspeed penalties also caused 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.120
 at the high speeds for one 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.010
 Precise wetting the work becomes 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.010
 in compliance with vario dog 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.010
 documented 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.620
 Remedies are regularly noted 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.810
 and of course extrapolated it 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.720
 looks good but who knows what 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.819
 anything can happen 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.150
 and shortly after 6 pm, the team is around 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.829
 around the fendt 933 mario already on the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.390
 sixth area west of the village 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.390
 Rice wine arrived 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.930
 How is the third fuel stop? 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.900
 third tankstop now overloaded 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.849
 has worked very well 328 so far 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.739
 we have achieved so far now 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.090
 slowly dark and look what they are after 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.220
 to bring even after the onset of 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.810
 darkness attracts the record contender 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.180
 continue his tracks 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.220
 adrenaline displaces fatigue 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.530
 smaller ones for such work 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.950
 keep completely normal incidents 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.930
 The team is also awake at 9 o'clock am 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.960
 next morning, three more remaining 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.970
 hours the output of 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 on average actually more than 43 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.470
 hectares per hour brings the record in 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.400
 tangible closeness 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.680
 Of course, the clock is running 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.110
 unstoppable under neither for that 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.419
 fill up the syringe still to implement 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.490
 is this stopped and what is 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.650
 actually with the fuel supply of the 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.330
 tractor just under three hours ago 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.160
 goalkeeping decides the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.360
 team for safety's sake too 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.790
 to refuel enemy 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.729
 Under the line, this results so far 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.090
 a fuel consumption of 24 2 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.870
 liters per hour or 0 5 6 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.740
 liter per hectare of processed area 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.050
 peak values 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.990
 the targeted record of 1000 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.490
 hectares of field already after 23 hours and 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.590
 20 minutes 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.090
 after 24 hours there are huge 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.580
 1032 hectares on the counter 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.740
 Also found pleased with the tug 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.670
 an important part of this record 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.670
 to have contributed
