00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
loss week at that time so that's why i'm

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620 
doing that for the month of november a
six-mile<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.400> i<00:01:29.670> run<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.479> work
