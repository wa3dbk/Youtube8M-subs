00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.839
 sascha for mobile gags and us 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.080
 still compare the apple 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.549
 iphone 5 with android devices and there 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.180
 we have the absolute flagships and 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.580
 that is from samsung the galaxy s3 can 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.790
 so mid of the year and based on 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.630
 a quadcore exynos arm cortex a9 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.290
 processor with 1 4 gigahertz at the apple 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.110
 iphone 5 we have the apple a6 that is 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.120
 a dual core arm cortex a15 that is 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.449
 already the next generation of the poor 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.670
 processors 1 2 ghz 1 gigabyte ram 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.390
 by the way, in both variants as well 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.609
 also equal to 16 32 and 64 gb 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.760
 gives the big difference in samsung 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.070
 galaxy s3 is quite easy for her to do it 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.089
 could upgrade the micro sd card 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.079
 I think I'm going to pack 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:58.390
 meanwhile up to 640 gb high and have there 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.219
 your whole corner more memory for apps 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.199
 above all things for content 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.300
 disposal 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.310
 with the cameras off we have 10 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.700
 Megapixel camera here on the samsung 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.460
 galaxy s3 12 megapixel camera on the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.070
 iphone 5 on the back on my 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 iphone 5 8 megapixel camera of the flash 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.760
 lite of the idea and samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.250
 is the similar 8 megapixel camera and 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.480
 There is one flash lite led displays 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.920
 big difference because I just falls 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.760
 on the now synonymous in the English video 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.220
 have forgotten 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.810
 we have an ips display so-called 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.970
 retina display of apple 11 is 36 x 640's 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.280
 the resolution 4 inch where we put here 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.340
 have a super amoled display at 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.660
 Samsung Galaxy S3 with 720p resolution 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.540
 So 12 80 x 720 when it comes to weight 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.030
 133 gram is the thing is really 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.870
 an absolute feather for yourself and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.000
 galaxy s3 up to 112 grams 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.600
 the other way around, it came around 9 12 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.270
 Apple iPhone 5 133g at Samsung Galaxy 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.840
 s3 and last but not least that 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 look at 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.679
 vidic or how thin the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.650
 Both devices are down the galaxy s 38 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.959
 6 mm and exactly 1 mm thin also loss 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.530
 but it looks a bit different 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:23.189
 design considers 76 mm at the apple iphone 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.730
 5 priced the two play absolutely 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:30.450
 in the premier league since put so at 690 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.170
 euro g2 of 5 going on in germany and the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.099
 Samsung Galaxy S3 year street price 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.840
 somehow so 500 to 550 euro 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.579
 both not cheap both 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.859
 internationally good smartphones that one 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.180
 first comparison of the apple iphone 5 here 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.889
 on the right side with the samsung 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.959
 galaxy s3 is still on the 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.919
 I am on the left side for magix 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.919
 Thanks for seeing
