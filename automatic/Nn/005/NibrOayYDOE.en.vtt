hitting the weak point with the shotgun

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.270 
hitting the weak point with the shotgun
which<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.739> wasn't<00:02:52.739> doing<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.980> very<00:02:53.010> good<00:02:53.160> job

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
which I wasn't doing a very good job

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.830 
which I wasn't doing a very good job
with<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.730> know<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.880> was<00:02:54.030> hip<00:02:54.239> firing<00:02:54.510> because

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
with you know I was hip firing because

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.090 
with you know I was hip firing because
that's<00:02:55.140> what<00:02:55.290> you're<00:02:55.380> doing<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.620> multiplayer

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
that's what you're doing the multiplayer

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
that's what you're doing the multiplayer
and<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:57.209> know<00:02:57.300> when<00:02:57.420> I'm<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.630> close<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and you know when I'm this close for the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.229 
and you know when I'm this close for the
shotgun<00:02:58.350> Airmen<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:59.130> isn't<00:02:59.820> something<00:03:00.000> I'm

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
shotgun Airmen just isn't something I'm

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.280 
shotgun Airmen just isn't something I'm
used<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.570> doing<00:03:01.550> but<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.910> do<00:03:03.900> end<00:03:04.110> up<00:03:04.170> getting

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
used to doing but I do end up getting

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.720 
used to doing but I do end up getting
really<00:03:04.650> close<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.890> running<00:03:05.130> out<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.310> ammo<00:03:05.640> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
really close to running out of ammo and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.449 
really close to running out of ammo and
I<00:03:05.819> think<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.180> killed<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.540> with<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> grenade<00:03:07.459> but

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
I think I killed this with a grenade but

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.180 
I think I killed this with a grenade but
just<00:03:09.269> be<00:03:09.390> aware<00:03:09.600> if<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.810> get<00:03:10.050> too<00:03:10.709> far<00:03:10.739> away

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
just be aware if you get too far away

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.160 
just be aware if you get too far away
you<00:03:11.580> are<00:03:11.730> vulnerable<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.390> being<00:03:12.540> immediately

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
you are vulnerable to being immediately

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.350 
you are vulnerable to being immediately
killed<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.709> there's<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.069> stick<00:03:14.340> there's<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
killed so there's the stick there's the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.479 
killed so there's the stick there's the
flip<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.870> there's<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.250> obligatory

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
flip and there's the the obligatory

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.600 
flip and there's the the obligatory
explosion<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.860> now<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.010> that's<00:03:20.220> done<00:03:20.370> you're

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
explosion so now that that's done you're

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.280 
explosion so now that that's done you're
going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> get<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> checkpoint<00:03:21.290> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
going to get a checkpoint this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.110 
going to get a checkpoint this
checkpoint<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.829> useful<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.430> are<00:03:23.579> out<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.760> ammo

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
checkpoint is useful we are out of ammo

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.750 
checkpoint is useful we are out of ammo
but<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:25.380> know<00:03:25.470> any<00:03:25.709> checkpoint<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.700> a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
but you know any checkpoint is is a

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.819 
but you know any checkpoint is is a
lifesaver<00:03:27.420> on<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.900> mod<00:03:28.140> because<00:03:28.440> some<00:03:28.799> of

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
lifesaver on this mod because some of

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.380 
lifesaver on this mod because some of
the<00:03:28.980> missions<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.370> don't<00:03:29.760> have<00:03:30.000> them<00:03:30.209> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
the missions just don't have them and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.640 
the missions just don't have them and
they<00:03:30.450> mean<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.870> have<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.200> do<00:03:31.350> perfect

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
they mean that you have to do perfect

they mean that you have to do perfect
player<00:03:32.070> for<00:03:32.310> far<00:03:32.549> too<00:03:32.579> long<00:03:34.190> but<00:03:35.190> as<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.430> can

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
player for far too long but as you can

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.250 
player for far too long but as you can
see<00:03:35.579> couple<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.030> wretches<00:03:36.360> coming<00:03:36.720> my<00:03:36.840> way<00:03:37.049> now

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
once you get rid of the Reavers you can

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.990 
once you get rid of the Reavers you can
run<00:04:39.560> down<00:04:39.740> there<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.190> use<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.730> it<00:04:40.850> to

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
you can't die while you're doing it but

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.440 
you can't die while you're doing it but
for<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.230> most<00:04:45.380> it's<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.680> pretty<00:04:45.860> safe<00:04:46.100> strategy

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
for the most it's a pretty safe strategy

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.730

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
just be real careful because these are

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.430

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
a previous video there is a way to avoid

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.160 
a previous video there is a way to avoid
death<00:05:02.420> by<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:04.250> talkbot<00:05:04.790> but<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.600> don't

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
death by the the talkbot but I don't

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.510 
death by the the talkbot but I don't
know<00:05:06.230> if<00:05:06.320> it<00:05:06.410> works<00:05:06.590> in<00:05:06.740> this<00:05:06.860> game<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.370> it's

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
know if it works in this game and it's

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.090 
know if it works in this game and it's
such<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.880> difficult<00:05:08.210> timing<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.990> do<00:05:09.170> is<00:05:09.800> I<00:05:10.040> don't

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
such a difficult timing to do is I don't

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.360 
such a difficult timing to do is I don't
think<00:05:10.370> it's<00:05:10.490> really<00:05:10.730> worth<00:05:10.880> it<00:05:11.920> well<00:05:12.920> get

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
think it's really worth it well get

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.470 
think it's really worth it well get
underneath<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.060> Reaver

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
underneath the the Reaver

underneath the the Reaver
there's<00:05:14.780> another<00:05:14.990> one<00:05:15.140> flying<00:05:15.380> around<00:05:15.650> which

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
makes this a lot more dangerous then I

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.900 
makes this a lot more dangerous then I
should<00:05:17.780> really<00:05:17.990> be<00:05:18.200> doing<00:05:18.230> but<00:05:18.830> I'm<00:05:19.730> in<00:05:19.880> a

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
should really be doing but I'm in a

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.870 
should really be doing but I'm in a
pretty<00:05:20.180> cavalier<00:05:20.810> mood<00:05:21.250> we've<00:05:22.250> got<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.610> stars

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
pretty cavalier mood we've got the stars

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.730 
pretty cavalier mood we've got the stars
we<00:05:23.150> just<00:05:23.360> need<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.660> stay<00:05:23.870> alive<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.170> kill<00:05:24.530> them

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
we just need to stay alive and kill them

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.100 
we just need to stay alive and kill them
that<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.460> second<00:05:25.790> one<00:05:25.850> lands<00:05:26.120> there<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:27.080> I

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
that the second one lands there so I

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.780 
that the second one lands there so I
back<00:05:27.320> up<00:05:27.470> a<00:05:27.560> little<00:05:27.680> bit<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:28.340> doesn't<00:05:28.610> stop

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
back up a little bit so it doesn't stop

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.430 
back up a little bit so it doesn't stop
cheeping<00:05:29.240> me<00:05:29.420> with<00:05:29.570> missiles<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:32.320> try<00:05:33.320> and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
cheeping me with missiles I try and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.590 
cheeping me with missiles I try and
position<00:05:33.530> myself<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.070> I<00:05:34.130> can<00:05:34.280> see<00:05:34.490> his<00:05:34.730> weak

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
position myself so I can see his weak

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.480 
position myself so I can see his weak
spot<00:05:35.930> but<00:05:36.620> he<00:05:36.770> moves<00:05:36.980> in<00:05:37.160> front<00:05:37.310> of<00:05:37.430> the

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
spot but he moves in front of the

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.360 
spot but he moves in front of the
building<00:05:37.910> which<00:05:38.060> is<00:05:38.090> typical<00:05:38.990> enemy<00:05:39.500> AI<00:05:39.620> as

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
building which is typical enemy AI as

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.980 
building which is typical enemy AI as
you<00:05:40.520> can<00:05:40.640> see<00:05:40.790> he<00:05:40.940> just<00:05:40.970> blew<00:05:41.390> up<00:05:41.510> which<00:05:41.750> means

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
you can see he just blew up which means

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.070 
you can see he just blew up which means
he's<00:05:42.200> dead<00:05:42.440> I<00:05:42.850> think<00:05:43.850> my<00:05:44.210> team<00:05:44.270> rushed<00:05:44.810> forward

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
he's dead I think my team rushed forward

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.900 
he's dead I think my team rushed forward
and<00:05:45.200> killed<00:05:45.500> all<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.920> people<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.310> fire<00:05:46.610> into

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
and killed all the people that fire into

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.480 
and killed all the people that fire into
this<00:05:47.030> area<00:05:47.720> because<00:05:48.500> that's<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.980> noise<00:05:49.130> that

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
this area because that's the noise that

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.790 
this area because that's the noise that
means<00:05:49.610> we're<00:05:49.910> done<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:50.630> there's<00:05:51.410> no<00:05:51.590> more

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
means we're done so there's no more
