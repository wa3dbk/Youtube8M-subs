00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.450
 Hello everyone, lidar murtazin and you 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.650
 talk today what to choose galaxy s6 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.160
 or galaxy s6 edge 2 devices 2 different 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.830
 of fate 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.529
 I will honestly say that I asked a question today 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.080
 about which machine to me of these two 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.660
 of course I had to choose for simplicity 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.490
 experiment probably take the machine 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.830
 white and white or black and 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.410
 black and then it would be more 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.949
 fair comparison but honestly you 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.720
 I confess that my soul lies to Joe and for 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.390
 edge voted a little more 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.129
 people from the image point of view he 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.350
 looks completely different than 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.110
 some other devices but that is 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.839
 phones from other manufacturers 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.820
 fresh wave if you want something fresh 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.449
 in the market why because there is 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.839
 small bend on both sides i.e. 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.940
 this here comes the screen screen a little bit 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:02.979
 curved climbs the side 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.019
 if we compare their backup sidewalls then 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.149
 it turns out that this is a wide side 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.890
 here the side as a hall knowing for 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.539
 account of it 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.090
 visually first of all it seems 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.100
 much thinner well because 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.259
 notice the metal edge he 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.429
 here is thinner than here on this machine 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.159
 almost double 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.140
 it is only visual and deceptive 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.850
 impression on the craft actually 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.509
 absolutely almost the same 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.659
 dimensions believe it in their hands so they 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.219
 different but different not strong 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.679
 but the second point is the screens themselves 51 screens 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.229
 51 inches in size they are not 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.049
 these strips differ 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.789
 fit on the side 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.600
 just pay attention to herself 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.210
 strip 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.819
 here is the very fold of the bend itself is very small 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.039
 virtually no color distortion if we 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.329
 talking about what you get with 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.880
 using this strip 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.070
 not so much in fact 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.229
 because when we 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.720
 let's see we have a section 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.800
 curved screen 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.370
 It means the backlight edge when the device 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.770
 lies like this here goes 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.900
 backlight if you got a call there 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.920
 missed here some contact 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.709
 which was u missed call 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.239
 messages to him here are these messages which 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.660
 shown here you can 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.239
 choose different panels 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.020
 which will be shown on the side 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.380
 to the side it will be some channels it will be 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:57.680
 weather and things like that on the side 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:02.660
 side and night hours with how much we have with 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:06.920
 10 probably up to 22 let's assume 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.880
 will move to the right side so it is easier 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.269
 there is this right side here we are 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 get i think you don't see now 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.230
 because the backlight is very very bright 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.410
 but in total darkness when really 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.690
 darkness you see the date here and see 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.910
 here 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.640
 but actually when the time 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.310
 the darkness you are so apparatus lies it is very 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.400
 cool in terms of what you see 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.070
 who is it what is it 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.090
 let me try calling him and 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.090
 we will see now 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.180
 in fact I won't be able to him now 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.720
 call because i have a sim card 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.909
 in another device but not the essence 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.629
 the call is still displayed 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:05.540
 here if we are talking about this one 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.140
 curved screen it is fully touch with 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.769
 point of view of the fact that only but on 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.980
 edges 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.110
 the outer light is playing rather and the brink 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.630
 curved not very much but the most 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.970
 the main thing is that when we work with this 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.799
 I have a border anyway 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.860
 there is a feeling that the first 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.350
 time is worth getting used to it and 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.710
 it is from a practical point of view 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.620
 ergonomics probably not so good with 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.800
 the other side really but he 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.500
 looks just gorgeous is two different 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.300
 apparatus he even outwardly here you know it 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.220
 optical illusion he looks like 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.780
 Much thinner than this 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.470
 the device is really thinner on 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.669
 millimeter 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.060
 but at the same time they are very aesthetically different 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:57.229
 different very much so very licked 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.270
 familiar and here this device edge is just 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.169
 a fairy tale for the price they differ very much 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.530
 just if it is assumed for the price 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.030
 50 thousand the edge will cost approximately 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.280
 5 thousand more expensive 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.479
 naturally it is about the same volume 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.760
 memory inside the back panel she 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.570
 framed and have both apparatus 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.360
 exactly the same camera is the same 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.680
 all the same then there is no 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.500
 the difference you will not find just the difference 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.020
 There is in that in c6 the usual nano-sim 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.900
 hidden on the left side here 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.889
 due to the fact that her thin frame 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.979
 hid 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.550
 on the top of everything else 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.710
 also well there is a microphone slightly shifted 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.320
 the microphone here is offset by vodka on the top 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.070
 butt here if we look here here 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.039
 all the same that is in essence 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.200
 The apparatus turned out to be both very 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.710
 interesting 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.200
 Of course due to the higher price with s6 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.570
 edge will sell less from the point 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.240
 interface performance and 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:11.080
 other things they are exactly the same 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.450
 no difference a little narrower 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.770
 This screen looks like a battery 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:20.290
 by the way here 2550 is built in here 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.000
 2600 but in real life that difference 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.070
 no effect on the processor and there and 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.630
 there and memory is absolutely 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.160
 same to me again stressed 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.340
 probably seems to us aesthetic point 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.100
 view see what you like more 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.810
 I like s6 edge more from all 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.810
 points of view but also accessories for it 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.910
 A little more interesting, but about this we 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.610
 talk separately i will show you how 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.740
 effexor looks like in a separate video which 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.230
 charging cases and things like that 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.100
 exist for these devices on this 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:57.730
 all do not forget to like about it 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.700
 video about these devices thank if 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:05.470
 it seems to you that in general you need to say 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:08.230
 thanks, I think all the same 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.380
 From 6 years old will be my next machine 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.480
 which will replace the 5 on the channel 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.400
 many videos about and appear 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.030
 these devices compared to other 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.510
 models again 4 out of 5 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.550
 sony xperia z3 well, and about the interface already 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.620
 talked in some detail therefore 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.520
 watch these videos do not forget to put 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.560
 huskies 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.790
 thank you in advance for them good luck 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.790
 good mood bye
