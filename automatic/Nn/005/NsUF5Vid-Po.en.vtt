 close to how he's doing 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.100
 you see that the last week the rain were quite poor in general 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.230
 not only in Argentina but also 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.690
 in the southern area of ​​brazil in paraguay I practically see him very little 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.240
 grandson we believe 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.400
 that she is the influence 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.930
 of the girl's event that started 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.140
 As I told you to develop in the Pacific, look 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.630
 in foz de iguazú 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 1 and 10 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.380
 it did not rain practically anything and now they are not either nowadays 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 and in almost all the Paraguayan territory 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.910
 there was practically no rain in the last 15 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.950
 and I know what happened in Argentina March 29 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.160
 one 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.439
 min worth 1 2 millimeters 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.420
 partly formosa chaco north of currents 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.950
 been a shower 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.250
 quite important in the northwest of buenos aires 52 millimeters 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.480
 and in the area reference 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.810
 between 30 and 50 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.219

 there was no rainfall 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.469
 and we are practically 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.760
 at the doors of the month of October when it must have 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.610
 more than 100 millimeters at least that in the month 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.099
 I particularly do not think it's going to be like that saying that we're going to have 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.579
 a 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.180
 1 October quite dry in general 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.460
 in patagonia you see between one and five millimeters it was almost generate 1 and 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.659

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.340
 it was almost general except 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.339
 in black river where practically nothing has rained from the area of ​​or forced 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.749
 January there was no tension 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.609
 from the beginning 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.979
 that in this poor rains we are having 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.619
 the end of September 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.079
 you should already 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.889
 to the event of the girl who is influencing 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.519
 in that rainy season 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.040
 throughout the Argentine Republic and also 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.289
 in the south of brazil uruguay 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.209
 in Paraguay he said 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.259
 that we were going to fear that 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.269
 by the way observe very well 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.919
 what kind of grain are we going to plant? 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.279
 for the issue that 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.519
 the stadium of france 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.499
 get to have little rain for example corn and well that will remain 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.169
 surely the amount 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 that one can harvest is to say what performance 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:16.159
 lower 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.859
 that the interpreters 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.150
 grandson will be from the cdc abente 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.629
 to that effect of the girl computing

 it may generate a storm ute the usual time 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.160
 but they will be isolated storms of nocturnal big match prize will pass 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.999

 to the air's own instability 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.430
 with a touch you will have a little more comedy 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.300

 until then
