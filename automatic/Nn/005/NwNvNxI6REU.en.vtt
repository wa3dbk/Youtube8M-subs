00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
that but hopefully this will make up for

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.630 
that but hopefully this will make up for
it<00:01:00.560> so<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.920> five<00:01:01.070> nights<00:01:01.280> at<00:01:01.370> Freddy's<00:01:01.610> 2

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
it so the five nights at Freddy's 2

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.310 
it so the five nights at Freddy's 2
trailer<00:01:02.030> came<00:01:02.239> out<00:01:02.360> recently<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:03.110> there's<00:01:03.230> a

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
trailer came out recently and there's a

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.750 
trailer came out recently and there's a
theory<00:01:03.590> floating<00:01:03.980> around<00:01:04.070> for<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.400> new<00:01:04.520> game

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
theory floating around for the new game

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.450 
theory floating around for the new game
the<00:01:05.600> theory<00:01:05.870> goes<00:01:05.900> like<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:06.350> both<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.250> old

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
the theory goes like this both the old

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.070 
the theory goes like this both the old
and<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> new<00:01:07.970> animatronics<00:01:08.660> come<00:01:08.810> out<00:01:08.930> at

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
and the new animatronics come out at

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.140 
and the new animatronics come out at
night<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.620> new<00:01:09.740> animatronics<00:01:10.370> want<00:01:11.030> to

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
night in the new animatronics want to

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.580 
night in the new animatronics want to
take<00:01:11.390> apart<00:01:11.660> and<00:01:11.870> deactivate<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.440> old

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
take apart and deactivate the old

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.560 
take apart and deactivate the old
animatronics<00:01:12.890> there<00:01:13.670> are<00:01:13.790> no<00:01:13.940> doors<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
animatronics there are no doors in the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.180 
animatronics there are no doors in the
new<00:01:14.690> version<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.620> only<00:01:15.740> way<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.950> defend

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
new version so the only way to defend

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.460 
new version so the only way to defend
yourself<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.640> Freddy<00:01:16.940> fazbear<00:01:17.420> mask<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
yourself is a Freddy fazbear mask if the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.780 
yourself is a Freddy fazbear mask if the
old<00:01:18.590> animatronics<00:01:18.950> come<00:01:19.400> into<00:01:19.550> your<00:01:19.640> room

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
old animatronics come into your room

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.370 
old animatronics come into your room
then<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.119> want<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.390> Freddy<00:01:20.630> fazbear<00:01:21.110> mask

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
then you want the Freddy fazbear mask

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.960 
then you want the Freddy fazbear mask
over<00:01:21.710> your<00:01:21.740> head<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.280> if<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.729> new

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
over your head and if the new

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.310 
over your head and if the new
animatronics<00:01:23.600> come<00:01:23.720> into<00:01:23.869> your<00:01:23.960> room<00:01:24.080> then

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
animatronics come into your room then

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.109 
animatronics come into your room then
you<00:01:24.410> want<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.650> mask<00:01:24.860> off<00:01:25.070> because<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.970> new

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
you want to mask off because the new

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.640 
you want to mask off because the new
ones<00:01:26.330> still<00:01:26.540> want<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.869> deactivate<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.500> old

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
ones still want to deactivate the old

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.840 
ones still want to deactivate the old
ones<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.040> if<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.220> look<00:01:28.399> like<00:01:28.550> an<00:01:28.729> old

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
ones so if you look like an old

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.160 
ones so if you look like an old
animatronic<00:01:29.450> they<00:01:29.540> will<00:01:29.660> want<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.869> take<00:01:29.930> you

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
animatronic they will want to take you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.859 
animatronic they will want to take you
apart<00:01:30.410> since<00:01:30.649> you<00:01:30.860> are<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> cyborg<00:01:31.910> but<00:01:32.780> you

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
apart since you are a cyborg but you

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.420 
apart since you are a cyborg but you
will<00:01:32.990> probably<00:01:33.170> be<00:01:33.380> honest<00:01:33.800> laying<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.250> pile

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
will probably be honest laying in a pile

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.980 
will probably be honest laying in a pile
of<00:01:34.610> blood<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.060> if<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.390> old<00:01:35.509> ones<00:01:35.690> come<00:01:35.869> in

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
of blood and if the old ones come in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.420 
of blood and if the old ones come in
then<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.200> want<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.410> Freddy<00:01:36.619> fazbear<00:01:36.979> mask<00:01:37.190> on

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
then you want the Freddy fazbear mask on

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.190 
then you want the Freddy fazbear mask on
but<00:01:37.910> I<00:01:37.940> found<00:01:38.270> something<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.780> might<00:01:38.960> either

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
but I found something that might either

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.499 
but I found something that might either
benefit<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:40.040> theory<00:01:40.399> or<00:01:40.580> completely<00:01:41.090> ruin

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
benefit the theory or completely ruin

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.180 
benefit the theory or completely ruin
the<00:01:41.600> theory<00:01:41.930> at<00:01:42.110> one<00:01:42.530> point<00:01:42.680> in<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.890> trailer

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
the theory at one point in the trailer

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.010 
the theory at one point in the trailer
it<00:01:43.310> shows<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.550> new<00:01:43.729> Bonnie<00:01:44.000> with<00:01:44.270> no<00:01:44.450> face<00:01:44.750> and

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
it shows a new Bonnie with no face and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.520 
it shows a new Bonnie with no face and
suddenly<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.500> Bonnie<00:01:45.680> disappears<00:01:47.410> this<00:01:48.410> is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
suddenly the Bonnie disappears this is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.050 
suddenly the Bonnie disappears this is
an<00:01:48.649> edit<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:49.100> script<00:01:49.369> I<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:49.670> realized<00:01:49.970> I

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
an edit in the script I just realized I

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.480 
an edit in the script I just realized I
messed<00:01:50.330> up<00:01:50.509> um<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.860> now<00:01:51.950> realized<00:01:52.160> that

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
messed up um I just now realized that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.040 
messed up um I just now realized that
the<00:01:52.580> Bonnie<00:01:52.759> with<00:01:52.970> no<00:01:53.090> face<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.869> old

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
the Bonnie with no face is the old

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.380 
the Bonnie with no face is the old
Bonnie<00:01:54.410> so<00:01:54.950> technically<00:01:55.610> or<00:01:55.910> not<00:01:56.030> technically

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
Bonnie so technically or not technically

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.090 
Bonnie so technically or not technically
just<00:01:56.720> really<00:01:57.140> I'm<00:01:57.289> proving<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.770> theory

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
just really I'm proving the theory

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.550 
just really I'm proving the theory
correct<00:01:58.310> I'm<00:01:58.789> not<00:01:59.030> dis<00:01:59.300> proving<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.170> forget

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
correct I'm not dis proving it so forget

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.139 
correct I'm not dis proving it so forget
what<00:02:00.860> like<00:02:01.220> I'm<00:02:01.399> probably<00:02:01.610> gonna<00:02:01.850> fast

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
what like I'm probably gonna fast

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.930 
what like I'm probably gonna fast
forward<00:02:02.240> in<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.899> second<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:03.530> yes<00:02:03.770> Howie<00:02:04.069> in<00:02:04.459> one

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
forward in a second so yes Howie in one

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.340 
forward in a second so yes Howie in one
scene<00:02:05.149> you<00:02:05.330> could<00:02:05.479> see<00:02:05.630> Freddie<00:02:05.899> laying<00:02:06.200> in

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
scene you could see Freddie laying in

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
from the first game and there was a

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.970 
from the first game and there was a
theory<00:04:01.570> that<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.959> first<00:04:02.170> guy<00:04:02.350> got<00:04:02.560> killed<00:04:02.770> by

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
theory that the first guy got killed by

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.740 
theory that the first guy got killed by
the<00:04:03.040> animatronics<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.850> was<00:04:04.030> stuffed<00:04:04.360> in<00:04:04.570> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
the animatronics and was stuffed in the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.510 
the animatronics and was stuffed in the
golden<00:04:05.050> Freddy<00:04:05.290> suit<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:06.070> that's<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.310> story

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
golden Freddy suit but that's a story

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.280 
golden Freddy suit but that's a story
for<00:04:06.640> another<00:04:06.820> day<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:07.750> de<00:04:07.930> proves<00:04:08.140> his

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
for another day but this de proves his

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.960 
for another day but this de proves his
theory<00:04:08.560> because<00:04:08.800> it<00:04:09.040> won<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.400> shows<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:09.850> he's

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
theory because it won it shows that he's

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.610 
theory because it won it shows that he's
still<00:04:10.090> alive<00:04:10.150> in<00:04:10.540> 2<00:04:10.720> he<00:04:10.930> says<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.140> whole<00:04:11.410> new
