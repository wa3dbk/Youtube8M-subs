package<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.599> a<00:00:28.840> sense<00:00:29.079> that<00:00:29.200> it's<00:00:29.829> probably

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
package and a sense that it's probably

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.280 
package and a sense that it's probably
was<00:00:30.610> made<00:00:30.820> because<00:00:31.119> we<00:00:31.480> are<00:00:31.570> around<00:00:31.779> Christmas

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
was made because we are around Christmas

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.210 
was made because we are around Christmas
and<00:00:32.920> it<00:00:33.700> costs<00:00:34.120> just<00:00:34.150> over<00:00:34.570> five<00:00:34.990> pounds<00:00:35.620> I've

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
and it costs just over five pounds I've

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.030 
and it costs just over five pounds I've
actually<00:00:36.430> used<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:37.300> points<00:00:37.900> that<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.560> have

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
actually used the points that I have

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.029 
actually used the points that I have
collected<00:00:39.720> with<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.750> boots<00:00:41.050> card<00:00:41.470> is<00:00:41.829> so

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
collected with the boots card is so

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.580 
collected with the boots card is so
fundamentally<00:00:42.789> I<00:00:42.820> got<00:00:43.059> it<00:00:43.180> for<00:00:43.359> free<00:00:43.590> not

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
fundamentally I got it for free not

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.220 
fundamentally I got it for free not
because<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.430> was<00:00:45.760> sent<00:00:46.030> them<00:00:46.270> by<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> PR<00:00:46.960> but

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
because I was sent them by a PR but

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.849 
because I was sent them by a PR but
because<00:00:47.590> i<00:00:47.829> use<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.340> boots<00:00:48.940> points<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.590> let's

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
because i use the boots points so let's

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.970 
because i use the boots points so let's
start<00:00:51.070> with<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.430> shampoo<00:00:52.000> this<00:00:52.719> is<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.109> 50

start with the shampoo this is a 50
milliliters<00:00:54.609> and<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.500> reason<00:00:56.769> why<00:00:56.859> I<00:00:56.890> wanted

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
milliliters and the reason why I wanted

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.400 
milliliters and the reason why I wanted
this<00:00:57.489> because<00:00:58.000> i've<00:00:58.300> been<00:00:58.359> using<00:00:58.809> another

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
this because i've been using another

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.889 
this because i've been using another
product<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.160> actually<00:01:00.879> is<00:01:01.329> made<00:01:01.539> for

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
product that actually is made for

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.920 
product that actually is made for
colored<00:01:02.260> hair<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.859> it's<00:01:03.309> very<00:01:03.550> good<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.390> i

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
colored hair and it's very good and i

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.570 
colored hair and it's very good and i
wanted<00:01:05.320> something<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.680> was<00:01:05.890> cheaper<00:01:06.400> so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
wanted something that was cheaper so

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.380 
wanted something that was cheaper so
let's<00:01:07.000> give<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.360> try<00:01:07.540> and<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.670> notice<00:01:10.360> is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
let's give it a try and what I notice is

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.260 
let's give it a try and what I notice is
that<00:01:10.600> first<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.350> all<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.220> does<00:01:12.850> not

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
that first of all that this does not

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.660 
that first of all that this does not
deposit<00:01:13.960> any<00:01:14.170> kind<00:01:14.650> of<00:01:14.860> pigment<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:18.250> not

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
deposit any kind of pigment so I'm not

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.200 
deposit any kind of pigment so I'm not
that<00:01:18.939> sure<00:01:19.240> how<00:01:20.049> it's<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:21.189> a<00:01:21.280> position<00:01:21.610> to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
that sure how it's in a position to

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.359 
that sure how it's in a position to
actually<00:01:22.509> that<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.290> color<00:01:23.530> because

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
actually that the color because

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.789 
actually that the color because
fundamentally<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:25.180> not<00:01:25.390> releasing<00:01:26.020> any<00:01:26.049> kind

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
fundamentally is not releasing any kind

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.130 
fundamentally is not releasing any kind
of<00:01:26.920> ingredient<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.610> is<00:01:28.149> going<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.689> stick<00:01:28.960> on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
of ingredient that is going to stick on

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.830 
of ingredient that is going to stick on
your<00:01:29.259> hair<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:30.220> basically<00:01:30.820> enhance<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.630> color

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
your hair to basically enhance the color

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.010 
your hair to basically enhance the color
you<00:01:32.110> already<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.909> same<00:01:33.939> goes<00:01:34.390> for<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
you already have the same goes for the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.319 
you already have the same goes for the
condition<00:01:35.890> are<00:01:36.009> basically<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.549> not<00:01:36.820> releasing

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
condition are basically is not releasing

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.530 
condition are basically is not releasing
any<00:01:37.420> color<00:01:37.750> in<00:01:38.409> fact<00:01:38.740> what<00:01:39.729> I've<00:01:39.909> noticed<00:01:40.149> is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
any color in fact what I've noticed is

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.420 
any color in fact what I've noticed is
that<00:01:40.600> fundamentally<00:01:41.469> these<00:01:41.680> two<00:01:41.829> products<00:01:42.159> as

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
that fundamentally these two products as

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.330 
that fundamentally these two products as
far<00:01:42.670> as<00:01:42.759> I'm<00:01:42.909> concerned<00:01:42.939> are<00:01:43.600> totally<00:01:43.990> useless

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
far as I'm concerned are totally useless

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.649 
far as I'm concerned are totally useless
first<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.460> all<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.610> tend<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.969> use<00:01:46.180> Bumble<00:01:46.630> and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
high quality and they tend to very very

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.080 
high quality and they tend to very very
few<00:01:53.170> tense<00:01:53.409> your<00:01:53.590> actives<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.670> means<00:01:54.939> that

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
few tense your actives it means that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.910 
few tense your actives it means that
they<00:01:55.180> don't<00:01:55.390> ladder<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.750> lot<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.289> I'm<00:01:56.380> not<00:01:56.590> used

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
they don't ladder a lot so I'm not used

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.550 
they don't ladder a lot so I'm not used
to<00:01:57.100> shampoo<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.729> make<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.240> lot<00:01:58.630> another<00:01:59.200> and

to shampoo the make a lot another and
actually<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.430> is<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.759> totally<00:02:01.450> opposite

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
actually this is the totally opposite

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.190 
actually this is the totally opposite
they<00:02:03.189> are<00:02:03.280> extremely<00:02:03.579> poor<00:02:04.119> quality<00:02:04.570> in<00:02:04.930> fact

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
they are extremely poor quality in fact

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.560 
notice any difference whatsoever when it
comes<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.730> enhancing<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.880> color<00:02:16.120> because

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
comes to enhancing the color because

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.830 
comes to enhancing the color because
they<00:02:17.020> don't<00:02:17.260> release<00:02:17.650> any<00:02:17.950> kind<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.310> pigment

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
they don't release any kind of pigment

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.770 
they don't release any kind of pigment
so<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:20.080> really<00:02:20.230> happy<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.830> just<00:02:21.099> got<00:02:21.370> this

totally<00:02:28.220> utterly<00:02:28.370> useless<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.770> shampoo<00:02:31.550> is

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
totally utterly useless the shampoo is

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.350 
totally utterly useless the shampoo is
not<00:02:32.810> moisturizing<00:02:33.620> at<00:02:33.740> all<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.220> mean<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.030> didn't

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
not moisturizing at all I mean I didn't

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.750 
not moisturizing at all I mean I didn't
actually<00:02:35.840> notice<00:02:36.410> any<00:02:36.770> kind<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.220> moisturizing

not<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.070> absolutely<00:02:43.070> avoid<00:02:43.540> with

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
not so this is absolutely avoid with

not deposit any kind of color therefore

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.380 
not deposit any kind of color therefore
is<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> fundamentally<00:02:51.980> useless<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.790> says<00:02:53.030> that

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
is a fundamentally useless it says that

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.750 
is a fundamentally useless it says that
it's<00:02:53.950> multi-dimensional<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.130> replenishes

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
it's multi-dimensional and replenishes

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.780 
it's multi-dimensional and replenishes
dry<00:02:56.060> hair<00:02:56.540> for<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> certain<00:02:57.830> field<00:02:58.160> well

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
dry hair for a certain field well

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.490 
dry hair for a certain field well
actually<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.180> kept<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.630> off<00:02:59.810> for<00:03:00.020> about<00:03:00.110> 10

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
actually I kept it off for about 10

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.590 
actually I kept it off for about 10
minutes<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.400> Marcel<00:03:01.820> didn't<00:03:02.150> make<00:03:02.330> any

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
minutes and I Marcel didn't make any

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.540 
minutes and I Marcel didn't make any
kind<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.960> difference<00:03:03.380> whatsoever<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:04.010> my<00:03:04.310> hair

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
kind of difference whatsoever to my hair

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.660 
kind of difference whatsoever to my hair
I'm<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.240> said<00:03:05.480> that<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.720> normal<00:03:06.070> three<00:03:07.070> pounds

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
I'm I said that a normal three pounds

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.540 
I'm I said that a normal three pounds
and<00:03:07.850> viva<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.750> masker<00:03:09.320> does<00:03:09.530> more<00:03:09.860> than<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.190> so

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
and viva a masker does more than this so

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.570 
and viva a masker does more than this so
again<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> total<00:03:11.840> nutter<00:03:12.080> avoid<00:03:12.580> how

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
again this is a total nutter avoid how

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.250 
again this is a total nutter avoid how
did<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.850> whole<00:03:14.120> set<00:03:14.420> actually<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:14.900> must<00:03:15.080> say

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
did the whole set actually I must say

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.530 
did the whole set actually I must say
that<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.500> did<00:03:15.710> write<00:03:15.980> this<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.150> actually

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
that I did write this this is actually

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.410 
that I did write this this is actually
called<00:03:17.810> brilliant<00:03:18.290> brunette<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.300> what<00:03:20.300> are

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
called brilliant brunette and what are

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.690 
called brilliant brunette and what are
we<00:03:20.450> liked<00:03:20.750> about<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:22.400> leaves

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
we liked about this is that it leaves

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700 
we liked about this is that it leaves
their<00:03:23.090> my<00:03:23.270> hair<00:03:23.540> very<00:03:23.780> soft<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.380> very<00:03:24.500> shiny

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
their my hair very soft and very shiny

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.670 
their my hair very soft and very shiny
and<00:03:25.340> that's<00:03:25.880> because<00:03:26.060> fundamentally<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.470> is

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
and that's because fundamentally this is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.550 
and that's because fundamentally this is
full<00:03:28.160> of<00:03:28.610> dometic<00:03:29.570> on<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.530> a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
full of dometic on so this is a

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.360 
full of dometic on so this is a
silicon-based<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:32.900> tend<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.260> use<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:34.010> called

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
silicon-based so I tend to use is called

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.729 
silicon-based so I tend to use is called
defreeze<00:03:35.270> by<00:03:35.660> dan<00:03:35.870> balan<00:03:36.020> bomber<00:03:36.440> which<00:03:36.590> is

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
defreeze by dan balan bomber which is

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.740 
defreeze by dan balan bomber which is
much<00:03:36.920> more<00:03:37.130> expensive<00:03:37.400> than<00:03:37.850> this<00:03:38.090> but<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.510> must

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
much more expensive than this but I must

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.680 
much more expensive than this but I must
say<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.140> this<00:03:39.410> one<00:03:39.800> it's<00:03:40.580> basically<00:03:41.570> a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
say that this one it's basically a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.770 
say that this one it's basically a
quarter<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.890> price<00:03:43.160> of<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.760> D<00:03:43.910> fries<00:03:44.239> but

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
quarter of the price of the D fries but

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.320 
quarter of the price of the D fries but
it<00:03:45.050> does<00:03:45.290> deliver<00:03:45.560> because<00:03:46.220> fundamentally<00:03:46.610> is

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
it does deliver because fundamentally is

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.960 
it does deliver because fundamentally is
just<00:03:47.780> silicon<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:49.160> other<00:03:49.459> than<00:03:49.730> three

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
just silicon so other than three

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.479 
just silicon so other than three
products<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.720> would<00:03:50.959> definitely<00:03:51.170> avoid<00:03:51.950> the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
products I would definitely avoid the

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.699 
products I would definitely avoid the
shampoo<00:03:53.060> he<00:03:53.330> doesn't<00:03:53.780> do<00:03:53.870> anything<00:03:53.930> as<00:03:54.350> it

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
shampoo he doesn't do anything as it

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.100 
shampoo he doesn't do anything as it
does<00:03:54.860> not<00:03:55.070> contain<00:03:55.459> any<00:03:55.519> kind<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:55.970> pigment<00:03:56.450> it

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
does not contain any kind of pigment it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.020 
does not contain any kind of pigment it
does<00:03:57.350> not<00:03:57.560> deposit<00:03:58.190> any<00:03:58.370> kind<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.730> color

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
does not deposit any kind of color

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.860 
does not deposit any kind of color
therefore<00:03:59.660> it's<00:03:59.810> impossible<00:04:00.769> for<00:04:00.830> this<00:04:01.190> to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
therefore it's impossible for this to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.479 
therefore it's impossible for this to
make<00:04:02.870> any<00:04:03.140> difference<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.070> tone<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.310> your

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
make any difference to the tone of your

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.199 
make any difference to the tone of your
hair<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.450> this<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.660> total<00:04:06.200> marketing<00:04:06.650> rubbish

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
hair so this is total marketing rubbish

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.060 
hair so this is total marketing rubbish
the<00:04:08.209> conditioner<00:04:08.900> again<00:04:09.350> it's<00:04:09.890> not

the conditioner again it's not

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.180 
the conditioner again it's not
nourishing<00:04:10.820> at<00:04:11.060> all<00:04:11.440> both<00:04:12.440> products<00:04:12.800> actually

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
nourishing at all both products actually

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.370 
nourishing at all both products actually
I've<00:04:13.370> got<00:04:13.580> tones<00:04:13.880> or<00:04:14.090> 10<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.480> actives<00:04:14.930> or<00:04:15.200> so

I've got tones or 10 so actives or so

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.560 
I've got tones or 10 so actives or so
they<00:04:15.530> will<00:04:15.650> strip<00:04:16.010> your<00:04:16.190> hair<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:17.180> we<00:04:17.359> don't
