like that you know one thing it's really

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.770 
like that you know one thing it's really
important<00:00:36.910> though<00:00:36.970> is<00:00:37.000> because<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:37.510> human

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
important though is because the human

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.630 
important though is because the human

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
between melee and ballistics you get a

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.890 
between melee and ballistics you get a
really<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.030> different<00:00:43.030> feel<00:00:43.240> between<00:00:43.540> a<00:00:43.660> class

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
really important with the skill tree to

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.700 
really important with the skill tree to
command<00:00:52.600> early<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:52.900> actually<00:00:53.260> augments

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
command early that actually augments

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.140 
command early that actually augments
that<00:00:53.860> it<00:00:54.040> empowers<00:00:54.400> you<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.610> do<00:00:54.700> that<00:00:54.880> further

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
that it empowers you to do that further

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.840 
that it empowers you to do that further
but<00:00:55.450> you<00:00:55.810> still<00:00:56.110> need<00:00:56.290> to<00:00:56.470> use<00:00:56.500> your<00:00:57.370> melee<00:00:57.730> and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
but you still need to use your melee and

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.190 
but you still need to use your melee and
your<00:00:57.970> guns<00:00:58.150> together<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.720> do<00:00:58.870> things<00:00:59.020> like

drop a tomato so one of the first and
more<00:01:02.860> interesting<00:01:03.420> skills<00:01:04.420> that<00:01:04.750> the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
more interesting skills that the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.359 
more interesting skills that the
commando<00:01:05.409> brings<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.830> table<00:01:05.979> for<00:01:06.250> his

commando brings to the table for his

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.399 
commando brings to the table for his
group<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.420> top<00:01:07.630> skill<00:01:07.840> here<00:01:08.020> allows<00:01:08.259> you

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
group is this top skill here allows you

group is this top skill here allows you
to<00:01:08.469> increase<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:08.740> damage<00:01:09.189> and<00:01:09.310> radius<00:01:09.670> for

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
to increase the damage and radius for

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.789 
to increase the damage and radius for
all<00:01:10.060> grenades<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.659> secondary<00:01:11.109> fire<00:01:11.320> moves<00:01:11.560> so

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
all grenades and secondary fire moves so

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.279 
all grenades and secondary fire moves so
each<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.549> different<00:01:12.670> weapon<00:01:13.119> types<00:01:13.289> have

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
each of the different weapon types have

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.749 
each of the different weapon types have
their<00:01:14.320> own<00:01:14.590> unique<00:01:14.740> secondary<00:01:15.310> fire<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
their own unique secondary fire the

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.310 
their own unique secondary fire the
rifles<00:01:16.179> actually<00:01:16.659> can<00:01:16.780> fire<00:01:16.960> grenades

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
rifles actually can fire grenades

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.510 
rifles actually can fire grenades
between<00:01:17.619> all<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.859> different<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:18.130> munitions

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
between all the different a munitions

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.429 
between all the different a munitions
and<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.759> cannons<00:01:19.569> can<00:01:20.020> do<00:01:20.109> different<00:01:20.409> things

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
and the cannons can do different things

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.649 
and the cannons can do different things
like<00:01:20.649> fire<00:01:20.890> missiles<00:01:21.310> charge<00:01:22.090> shots<00:01:22.390> for<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
like fire missiles charge shots for the

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.410 
like fire missiles charge shots for the
plasma<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.439> do<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.009> charge<00:01:24.850> heaviiy

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
plasma and do a charge heaviiy

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.719 
plasma and do a charge heaviiy
for<00:01:25.749> the<00:01:25.840> laser<00:01:26.049> guns<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:27.009> this<00:01:27.340> actually

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
for the laser guns so this actually

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:28.830 
for the laser guns so this actually
allows<00:01:27.819> you<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.119> power

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
allows you to power

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.480 
allows you to power
and<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.500> place<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.890> power<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.220> up<00:01:30.280> it's

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
and it is the place to power it up it's

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.250 
and it is the place to power it up it's
the<00:01:30.520> best<00:01:30.790> place<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.210> gives<00:01:31.299> you<00:01:31.450> radius<00:01:31.780> so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
the best place it gives you radius so

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.690 
the best place it gives you radius so
you<00:01:32.320> can<00:01:32.560> actually<00:01:32.740> group<00:01:33.010> with<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.280> commando

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
you can actually group with a commando

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.070 
you can actually group with a commando
and<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.330> know<00:01:34.420> even<00:01:34.659> if<00:01:34.750> you're<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.900> bio

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
and you know even if you're a bio

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.510 
and you know even if you're a bio
engineer<00:01:35.560> or<00:01:35.740> Berserker<00:01:36.159> you'll<00:01:36.340> suddenly

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
engineer or Berserker you'll suddenly

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.219 
engineer or Berserker you'll suddenly
have<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.850> lot<00:01:37.060> better<00:01:37.240> grenades<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:37.869> secondary

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
have a lot better grenades and secondary

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.950 
have a lot better grenades and secondary
fire<00:01:38.440> I'll<00:01:39.430> go<00:01:39.549> over<00:01:39.640> down<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.479> left<00:01:40.720> path

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
fire I'll go over down the left path

cool<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.200> cool<00:03:01.380> thing<00:03:01.590> about<00:03:01.740> that<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.280> just

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
cool the cool thing about that and just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.010 
cool the cool thing about that and just
in<00:03:02.910> case<00:03:03.120> people<00:03:03.300> don't<00:03:03.450> understand<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
in case people don't understand the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.360 
in case people don't understand the
difference<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.470> different<00:03:05.010> ballistic

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
difference in the different ballistic

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.000 
difference in the different ballistic
weapons<00:03:06.020> lasers<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.440> longer<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.770> keep<00:03:07.860> them

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
weapons lasers the longer you keep them

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.320 
weapons lasers the longer you keep them
on<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.220> enemy<00:03:08.580> they<00:03:08.820> heat<00:03:09.000> up<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.209> they<00:03:09.270> do

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
on the enemy they heat up and they do

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.449 
on the enemy they heat up and they do
more<00:03:09.570> damage<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:10.140> ballistic<00:03:10.890> are<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.130> straight

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
more damage a ballistic are you straight

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.670 
more damage a ballistic are you straight
just<00:03:11.760> damage<00:03:12.090> bands<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.600> then<00:03:12.780> your<00:03:13.200> plasma

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
just damage bands and then your plasma

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.580 
just damage bands and then your plasma
or<00:03:13.800> your<00:03:13.950> hybrid<00:03:14.340> will<00:03:14.820> type<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.120> weapons<00:03:15.590> they

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
or your hybrid will type of weapons they

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.260 
or your hybrid will type of weapons they
essentially<00:03:17.040> don't<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:17.700> much<00:03:17.850> damage<00:03:17.880> but

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
essentially don't do as much damage but

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.060 
essentially don't do as much damage but
they<00:03:18.360> do<00:03:18.480> radius<00:03:18.810> damage<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.590> by<00:03:19.709> going<00:03:19.890> down

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
they do radius damage so by going down

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.160 
they do radius damage so by going down
this<00:03:20.250> path<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:20.880> make<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.450> most<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.140> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
this path you can make the most the the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.050 
this path you can make the most the the
medium<00:03:22.800> sort<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.100> damaged<00:03:23.430> paths<00:03:23.640> with<00:03:23.910> it

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
medium sort of damaged paths with it

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.060 
medium sort of damaged paths with it
with<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.270> ballistics<00:03:24.720> become<00:03:24.989> explosive<00:03:25.320> so

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
with the ballistics become explosive so

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.590 
with the ballistics become explosive so
you<00:03:26.160> get<00:03:26.280> really<00:03:26.700> really<00:03:26.880> powerful<00:03:27.180> shots

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
you get really really powerful shots

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.290 
you get really really powerful shots
suddenly<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.520> last<00:03:29.730> noted<00:03:30.090> here

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
suddenly and then the last noted here

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.600 
suddenly and then the last noted here
just<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.170> general<00:03:31.410> gives<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> your

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
just in general gives you a your

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.520 
just in general gives you a your
ballistic<00:03:33.030> weaponry<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.020> chance<00:03:34.350> of

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
ballistic weaponry a chance of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.250 
ballistic weaponry a chance of
detonating<00:03:35.040> explosive<00:03:35.520> damage<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
detonating explosive damage the the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.289 
detonating explosive damage the the
right<00:03:37.440> path<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.549> your<00:03:38.700> plasma<00:03:39.180> or<00:03:39.269> a

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
right path is kind of your plasma or a

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.720 
right path is kind of your plasma or a
hybrid<00:03:39.510> ammunition<00:03:40.230> specialization<00:03:41.100> path

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
hybrid ammunition specialization path

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.520 
hybrid ammunition specialization path
this<00:03:42.030> adds<00:03:42.299> increased<00:03:42.750> damage<00:03:42.959> for<00:03:43.320> your

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
this adds increased damage for your

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.190 
this adds increased damage for your
plasma<00:03:43.950> ammunition<00:03:44.430> weaponry<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.870> display

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
plasma ammunition weaponry this display

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
plasma ammunition weaponry this display
this<00:03:46.410> plasma<00:03:47.190> turret<00:03:47.430> for<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.640> spider<00:03:47.880> and

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
this plasma turret for the spider and

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.460 
this plasma turret for the spider and
again<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.330> flag<00:03:48.540> would<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:48.840> radius<00:03:49.200> damage

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
again the flag would have radius damage

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.080 
again the flag would have radius damage
so<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.680> spider<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.130> really<00:03:50.459> dig<00:03:50.850> through

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
so the spider can really dig through

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.600 
so the spider can really dig through
this<00:03:51.269> town<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.570> jamming<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.530> you've<00:03:53.400> got<00:03:53.580> a

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
this town of jamming and you've got a

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.979 
this town of jamming and you've got a
chance<00:03:53.910> here<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.239> all<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.510> your<00:03:54.600> ballistic

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
chance here that all of your ballistic

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.620 
chance here that all of your ballistic
shots<00:03:55.200> will<00:03:55.440> do<00:03:55.590> additional<00:03:55.950> damage<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:57.510> your

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
shots will do additional damage for your

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.509 
shots will do additional damage for your
battle<00:03:57.870> cry<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.290> then<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:58.830> general<00:03:59.160> rifle

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
battle cry and then just general rifle

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.690 
battle cry and then just general rifle
damage<00:03:59.820> increase<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.330> right<00:04:00.480> path
