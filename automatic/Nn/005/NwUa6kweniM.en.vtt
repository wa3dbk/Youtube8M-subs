you<00:00:09.650> know<00:00:09.770> there's<00:00:09.980> subjects<00:00:10.400> where<00:00:10.580> animals

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
you know there's subjects where animals

and<00:00:13.700> I<00:00:13.820> think<00:00:14.030> this<00:00:14.180> is<00:00:14.330> one<00:00:14.510> of<00:00:14.540> them<00:00:14.750> these

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
and I think this is one of them these

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.060 
and I think this is one of them these
are<00:00:15.160> majestic<00:00:16.180> incredible<00:00:17.619> magical<00:00:18.619> often

this is a for City to are also by the
way<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.610> guys<00:01:19.910> probably<00:01:20.210> where<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.480> started

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
way you guys probably where that started

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.470 
way you guys probably where that started
it<00:01:21.140> began<00:01:21.320> in<00:01:21.470> San<00:01:21.620> Francisco<00:01:22.130> where<00:01:22.880> Adi<00:01:23.180> has

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
it began in San Francisco where Adi has

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.530 
it began in San Francisco where Adi has
their<00:01:23.780> United<00:01:24.770> States<00:01:24.980> headquarters<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.790> think

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
their United States headquarters I think

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.700 
their United States headquarters I think
as<00:01:27.110> well<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:29.000> Las<00:01:29.150> Vegas<00:01:29.510> Nevada<00:01:29.930> -

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
as well and then Las Vegas Nevada -

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.740 
as well and then Las Vegas Nevada -
today<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.250> Texas<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.940> and<00:01:32.270> focusing<00:01:32.660> on

today is Texas and and focusing on
Austin<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.290> then<00:01:33.500> you'll<00:01:33.710> conclude<00:01:34.070> in<00:01:34.190> New

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.020 
there's there's not a positive way to do
this<00:01:54.050> it's<00:01:54.650> it's<00:01:55.070> it's<00:01:55.430> just<00:01:55.700> sort<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:55.940> a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
this it's it's it's just sort of a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.880 
this it's it's it's just sort of a
practice<00:01:56.450> like<00:01:56.660> many<00:01:56.930> other<00:01:57.110> practices<00:01:57.650> let's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
practice like many other practices let's

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.160 
practice like many other practices let's
say<00:01:58.010> like<00:01:58.190> using<00:01:58.760> asbestos<00:01:59.120> you<00:01:59.870> know<00:01:59.990> it's

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
say like using asbestos you know it's

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.080 
say like using asbestos you know it's
insulation<00:02:00.680> which<00:02:00.830> was<00:02:00.980> a<00:02:01.010> great<00:02:01.310> idea<00:02:01.520> at<00:02:01.910> one

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
insulation which was a great idea at one

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.330 
insulation which was a great idea at one
point<00:02:02.300> in<00:02:02.450> history<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:03.470> know<00:02:03.590> or<00:02:03.830> lit<00:02:04.010> pipes

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
point in history you know or lit pipes

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.160 
point in history you know or lit pipes
was<00:02:04.880> terrific<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.480> we<00:02:05.570> thought<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.780> was<00:02:05.840> great

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
was terrific and we thought it was great

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.810 
was terrific and we thought it was great
and<00:02:06.350> we<00:02:06.410> loved<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.070> was<00:02:07.100> modernizing

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
and we loved it and it was modernizing

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.790 
and we loved it and it was modernizing
and<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.970> was<00:02:08.060> fabulous<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.780> now<00:02:09.349> you<00:02:09.410> know

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
and it was fabulous and now you know

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800 
and it was fabulous and now you know
it's<00:02:09.979> 2008<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.940> we<00:02:11.000> know<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> lot<00:02:11.330> more<00:02:11.540> than<00:02:11.720> we

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
it's 2008 and we know a lot more than we

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.180 
it's 2008 and we know a lot more than we
did<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.320> maybe<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.590> know<00:02:12.710> what<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:12.950> time

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
did and maybe you know what it's time

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.750 
did and maybe you know what it's time
let's<00:02:13.370> maybe

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
let's maybe

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.390 
let's maybe
let's<00:02:14.239> put<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.659> into<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.470> history<00:02:15.709> books<00:02:16.220> do

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
let's put this into the history books do

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.070 
let's put this into the history books do
you<00:02:16.580> almost<00:02:16.879> never<00:02:17.090> see<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> trainer<00:02:17.690> using

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you almost never see a trainer using

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.890 
you almost never see a trainer using
this<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:18.409> stage<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.640> reason<00:02:20.030> why<00:02:20.629> is<00:02:20.690> because

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
this on stage the reason why is because

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.710 
this on stage the reason why is because
they<00:02:21.349> use<00:02:21.470> them<00:02:21.650> off<00:02:21.769> stage<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:23.540> way<00:02:23.659> to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
they use them off stage and the way to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.990 
they use them off stage and the way to
contain<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.170> wild<00:02:24.590> animal<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.370> dominate<00:02:25.819> it

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
contain a wild animal is to dominate it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.509 
contain a wild animal is to dominate it
and<00:02:26.150> then<00:02:26.239> timid<00:02:26.569> ate<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.340> is

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
and then timid ate it and so this is

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.979 
and then timid ate it and so this is
this<00:02:28.909> is<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> mechanism<00:02:29.269> that's<00:02:29.540> often<00:02:29.959> used

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
this is a mechanism that's often used

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.600 
this is a mechanism that's often used
and<00:02:30.319> then<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.790> very<00:02:32.030> sharp<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.629> heavy<00:02:32.840> and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and then it's very sharp and heavy and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.780 
and then it's very sharp and heavy and
it<00:02:34.610> breaks<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.060> skin<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.540> elephants<00:02:35.959> which

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
it breaks the skin of elephants which

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.860 
it breaks the skin of elephants which
you<00:02:37.790> were<00:02:37.879> able<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.150> see<00:02:38.390> here<00:02:38.569> on<00:02:38.690> this
