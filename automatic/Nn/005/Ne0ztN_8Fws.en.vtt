00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hello dear friends let's 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.660
 letâ€™s lower the fox's little ones 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.460
 hole back Kirill O. 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.809
 I did not read against the knife to me 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.120
 it seems that the collaboration focus with 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.430
 someone because fox on x is still 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.810
 We counted and here are written holes 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.050
 back on if you say 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.090
 Well, actually the model is called you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.109
 do you think I take backs so small 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.800
 pocket karabite proper something like this 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.530
 it should hang judging by 7 in your pocket 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 so the system is some kind of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.739
 opening that is you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.850
 oh like that is not like 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.239
 it opens only with hands 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.940
 four-position cribs has that is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.649
 it's like bti where he is and I beg you a scoundrel 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 down up down blade right left 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.620
 arm 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.989
 actually classical for kerambit of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
 retention but again i don't understand how 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 working with karambit he hasn't thought 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.719
 some kind of pocket opening system 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.550
 because it first you take this 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 open your and then intercept 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.280
 everything basically can work but 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.720
 actually like so here we have an icon 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.110
 Yin Yang 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.110
 some little 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.660
 modified so let's say interesting 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 enough blade shape but since 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.990
 karambit she 's still a combat knife 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 a lot of some 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 stiffeners several descents 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.040
 concave descents 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.930
 more precisely they do not promise a grant for a concave edge 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.900
 that is, on such an aggressive abruptly to this 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.670
 I think there will be a barb here too 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.150
 varese is very so aggressive to participate 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.210
 fall here and on the handle the handle 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.810
 at first glance, rather ridiculous then 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.270
 eat her 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 the convex upper side is convex and 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.910
 direct internal ie it is perfect 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.470
 how to say no anatomical but 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.190
 is sitting confidently enough 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.780
 interestingly enough, well, actually 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.600
 account him still say italian knife alt 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.300
 and what a 690 classic for fax here 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.280
 by the way, the wicking of fox is just 10 on 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.020
 The handle and such a massive enough 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.989
 ring here if you did not watch our review 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.459
 on fox karaha who is there a ring it was 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.290
 fulfilled more than once met that 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.910
 ring it is made of two plates then 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.190
 There is, in principle, you can even take your hands 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.860
 if she is still some kind of special 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.590
 metal is more reliable so let's say well 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.920
 that is , you can still take it as a goal 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.540
 work well I do karambit doing them 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 so a couple of videos watched and you 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.830
 I will say I will say about its closure 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.290
 liner here generally goes level with 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.630
 handle no darts drank at all 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.610
 no to this liner he hook then 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.440
 there is he well I do not know maybe this 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.750
 done how is it security so he 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.190
 in your hand did not work out that is you 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.780
 worked roughly but also 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.810
 neatly with both hands formed 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.660
 because another roommate is possible 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.350
 Well, actually such a can 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.350
 fox companies
