00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
about his first pro fight and I think

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
about his first pro fight and I think
that<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> lot<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.070> uh<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.790> think

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that a lot to do with it but uh I think

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.920 
that a lot to do with it but uh I think
he<00:00:39.960> settled<00:00:40.379> down<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.590> lot<00:00:40.800> better<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.579> he<00:00:42.540> said

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
he settled down a lot better and he said

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.670 
he settled down a lot better and he said
look<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.739> training<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.879> far<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.960> expect

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
look good training so far and I expect

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.010 
look good training so far and I expect
him<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.070> better<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.570> took<00:00:48.840> me

he's fighting a guy with a winning
record<00:02:11.330> which<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.870> somewhat<00:02:12.379> unusual<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:12.980> a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
record which is somewhat unusual for a
