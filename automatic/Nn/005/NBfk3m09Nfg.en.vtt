00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.960 
smaller I'll do come house and I've got
a<00:03:10.140> Dalek<00:03:10.530> here<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:13.019> as<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.170> can<00:03:13.410> probably<00:03:13.440> see

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
a Dalek here and as you can probably see

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.590 
a Dalek here and as you can probably see
or<00:03:14.970> not<00:03:15.330> see<00:03:15.590> there's<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.709> big<00:03:16.980> difference<00:03:17.600> see

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
or not see there's a big difference see

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.229 
or not see there's a big difference see
they're<00:03:18.900> about<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.260> same<00:03:19.440> size<00:03:19.820> but<00:03:20.820> that's<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
they're about the same size but that's a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.940 
they're about the same size but that's a
lot<00:03:21.390> bigger<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.200> fingers<00:03:22.380> will<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.769> lot

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
lot bigger and the fingers will be a lot

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.900 
lot bigger and the fingers will be a lot
smaller<00:03:23.220> than<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:27.410> right<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:28.850> yeah<00:03:29.850> you

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
smaller than that so right so yeah you

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.750 
smaller than that so right so yeah you
do<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.390> space<00:03:30.690> some<00:03:30.930> bottom<00:03:31.320> here<00:03:31.760> used

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
do have to space some bottom here used

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.850 
do have to space some bottom here used
up<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> make<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.360> spin<00:03:33.570> all<00:03:33.750> i<00:03:33.900> dunno<00:03:34.320> doing<00:03:34.800> a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
up to make it spin all i dunno doing a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.449 
up to make it spin all i dunno doing a
way<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.100> have<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.519> cuz<00:03:36.480> I'm<00:03:36.750> i<00:03:37.280> think<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.370> is

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
good happy with what I got um I think

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.399 
good happy with what I got um I think
the<00:05:53.599> TARDIS<00:05:54.050> was<00:05:54.349> 1299<00:05:55.780> but<00:05:56.780> if<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.080> can<00:05:57.259> get

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
the TARDIS was 1299 but if you can get

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.990 
the TARDIS was 1299 but if you can get
it<00:05:57.500> anywhere<00:05:57.740> else<00:05:57.889> really<00:05:58.400> not<00:05:58.759> a<00:05:58.789> lot<00:05:58.849> of

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
it anywhere else really not a lot of

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.089 
it anywhere else really not a lot of
places<00:05:59.210> will<00:05:59.539> do<00:05:59.690> it<00:05:59.870> so<00:06:00.139> it's<00:06:00.620> quite<00:06:00.800> good<00:06:00.979> for

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
places will do it so it's quite good for

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.529 
places will do it so it's quite good for
what<00:06:01.219> it<00:06:01.280> is<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.580> then<00:06:01.699> I<00:06:01.729> think<00:06:01.969> the<00:06:02.030> book<00:06:02.240> was

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
what it is and then I think the book was

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.980 
what it is and then I think the book was
499<00:06:03.349> so<00:06:04.159> overall<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.550> didn't<00:06:05.030> spend<00:06:05.389> that<00:06:05.659> much

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
499 so overall I didn't spend that much

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.999 
499 so overall I didn't spend that much
so<00:06:06.979> about<00:06:07.580> 18<00:06:08.120> pounds<00:06:08.719> and<00:06:08.900> it's<00:06:09.500> pretty<00:06:09.830> good

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
so about 18 pounds and it's pretty good

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.189 
so about 18 pounds and it's pretty good
what<00:06:10.759> it<00:06:10.880> is<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.300> I'm<00:06:11.360> quite<00:06:11.539> happy<00:06:11.719> with<00:06:11.930> it

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
what it is and I'm quite happy with it

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.040 
what it is and I'm quite happy with it
so<00:06:12.430> um<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.820> will<00:06:14.180> try<00:06:14.360> and<00:06:14.419> do<00:06:14.510> another<00:06:14.539> unboxing

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
so um I will try and do another unboxing
