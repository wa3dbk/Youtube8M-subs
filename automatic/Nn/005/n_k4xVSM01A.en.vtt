engine electric motor you actually get a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.410 
engine electric motor you actually get a
very<00:02:17.440> good<00:02:17.530> sort<00:02:18.069> of<00:02:18.130> mid-range<00:02:18.370> torque<00:02:18.760> as<00:02:19.270> it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
very good sort of mid-range torque as it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.050 
very good sort of mid-range torque as it
were<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.470> performance<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.250> right<00:02:21.880> up

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
