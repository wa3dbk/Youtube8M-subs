00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.940
 elliot transformers micro masters battle squad so we end up with 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 microphones masters a little bit particular since it is about 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 combinations 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.139
 so already we have a plane 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.359
 here 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.849
 so that's for sure we're going this number will be so it's a little bit clumsy 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.659
 right here 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.619
 a skirt like Europe with a tank 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.619
 with this time while this functional part 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.050
 initiated 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.490
 an armored vehicle 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.180
 with the gift pack 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.040
 particularity of this range is to be able to combine and separate 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.410
 so it allows me to do things a little bit farfetched 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.090
 so the back of the plane 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.580
 with the small armored vehicle 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.990
 I take the plane on the tank 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
 the kind of butter this not with the barrel 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.940
 when you have different ligaments you can like that mix them up for 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.790
 tell a crazy little crazy stuff 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.030
 he's nice after some make it to be named payment kodo 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.170
 that irritates 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.160
 then in vehicles 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 we will put them back together and I will introduce them all 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.670
 you have the leader of the band but the back 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.000
 pretty succinct back we made out the legs i he quotes 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 we have our arms 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.130
 I will have a little independent a nice match very far from this 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.510
 over there 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.270
 abstract 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.240
 Well, while you have shown that it can turn also mounted 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.180
 feel 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 here are the legs 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.080
 the front it goes between the guns 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.440
 such a dependent jova 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.470
 live 8 the shooter finally the small independent vehicle 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.530
 you have it here always the same way abbas jean-claude pending 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.610
 arms 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.610
 except that the head this time to saint-laurent 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.940
 so we must immediately ball peaks poles apart to assemble a little 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.439
 the different vehicles between them 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.909
 the part vehicles with the barrel 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.749
 always shifting 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.049
 unfortunately the legs for the arms against the rims are in one piece 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.119
 then 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.259
 we can not wait fayard schotte 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.599
 by shifting 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.129
 that makes the focus that sense not bad 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.899
 here j 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.279
 for the legs 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.309
 you have 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.309
 a little head out and homework 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.649
 we finish with the sixth and last point of coluche 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.739
 here are the legs 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.149
 he makes herself addicted 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.189
 we retreated to 2 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.189
 and there you will see 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.899
 a rather pleasant team of trumpet-la-mort 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.699
 with actually no possibility to combine between several the series of 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:05.569
 vehicles 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.569
 come on we do not care she has a place very quickly 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:23.249
 whew
