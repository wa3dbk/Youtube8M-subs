two-wheeler mm-hmm you see it's got a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.599 
two-wheeler mm-hmm you see it's got a
couple<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.179> airplane<00:01:38.570> wheels<00:01:38.810> here<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.609> they

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
couple of airplane wheels here and they

couple of airplane wheels here and they
are<00:01:45.759> this<00:01:46.759> is<00:01:46.969> my<00:01:47.170> gyroscope<00:01:48.520> balanced<00:01:49.520> two

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
are this is my gyroscope balanced two

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.289 
are this is my gyroscope balanced two
wheeler<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.350> little<00:01:54.670> platform<00:01:55.670> with

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
wheeler and it's a little platform with

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.840 
wheeler and it's a little platform with
two<00:01:56.780> airplane<00:01:57.380> wheels<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.100> they<00:01:58.340> are<00:01:58.399> rounded

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
two airplane wheels and they are rounded

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.569 
two airplane wheels and they are rounded
wheels<00:01:59.090> they<00:01:59.390> are<00:01:59.450> not<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.869> flat<00:02:00.709> so<00:02:01.189> they

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
wheels they are not the flat so they

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.809 
wheels they are not the flat so they
will<00:02:01.759> not<00:02:01.909> balance<00:02:03.039> by<00:02:04.039> themselves

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
will not balance by themselves

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.289 
will not balance by themselves
it<00:02:04.939> takes<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.360> gyroscope<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.929> balance<00:02:06.349> it<00:02:06.500> and

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
it takes the gyroscope to balance it and

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.610 
it takes the gyroscope to balance it and
I<00:02:08.299> used<00:02:09.019> acrylic<00:02:09.229> rulers<00:02:09.890> for<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:11.319> frame<00:02:12.319> for

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
kind of bolted onto that and I tried and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.479 
kind of bolted onto that and I tried and
tried<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.760> get<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.269> work<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:04.459> never

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
tried to get this to work and it never

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.629 
tried to get this to work and it never
would<00:03:05.419> work<00:03:05.660> before<00:03:06.250> because<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.310> didn't<00:03:07.579> know

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
would work before because I didn't know

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.920 
would work before because I didn't know
the<00:03:07.790> secret<00:03:08.739> but<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.889> secret<00:03:10.549> in<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:11.630> case

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
the secret but the secret in this case

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.409 
the secret but the secret in this case
at<00:03:12.349> least<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.970> motor<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.269> the

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
at least is that the the motor and the

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.009 
at least is that the the motor and the
gyro<00:03:17.930> combination<00:03:18.739> have<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.160> be<00:03:19.280> top-heavy

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
gyro combination have to be top-heavy

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.809 
gyro combination have to be top-heavy
there<00:03:21.019> has<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> be<00:03:21.349> more<00:03:21.680> weight<00:03:21.980> on<00:03:22.220> top<00:03:22.519> of

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
there has to be more weight on top of

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.280 
there has to be more weight on top of
the<00:03:22.970> gimbal<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.230> axle<00:03:25.239> then<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.690> bottom<00:03:26.870> I

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the gimbal the axle then on the bottom I

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.170 
the gimbal the axle then on the bottom I
tried<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.160> with<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.310> very<00:03:28.549> heavy<00:03:29.169> gyroscope<00:03:30.169> and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
tried it with a very heavy gyroscope and

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.270 
tried it with a very heavy gyroscope and
it<00:03:32.180> would<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:32.569> fall<00:03:33.079> over<00:03:33.139> slowly<00:03:33.799> but<00:03:34.190> it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
it would just fall over slowly but it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.190 
it would just fall over slowly but it
would<00:03:34.400> just<00:03:34.549> fall<00:03:34.700> over<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:35.180> then<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:35.900> tried<00:03:36.169> it

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
would just fall over and then I tried it

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.420 
would just fall over and then I tried it
with<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.410> very<00:03:36.760> very<00:03:37.760> heavy<00:03:38.000> top<00:03:38.389> motor

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
with a very very heavy top motor

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.820 
with a very very heavy top motor
more<00:03:39.880> weight<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.240> here<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:41.470> would<00:03:41.590> fall

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
more weight up here and it would fall

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.830 
more weight up here and it would fall
over<00:03:41.860> but<00:03:42.340> if<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:42.640> got<00:03:42.910> into<00:03:43.210> the<00:03:43.300> sweet<00:03:43.540> spot

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
over but if I got into the sweet spot

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.700 
over but if I got into the sweet spot
which<00:03:44.170> was<00:03:44.350> right<00:03:44.590> where<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.760> zip<00:03:46.090> tie<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.710> so

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
which was right where the zip tie is so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.740 
which was right where the zip tie is so
my<00:03:47.860> center<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.340> mass<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:49.030> right<00:03:49.240> about<00:03:49.420> there

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
my center of mass is right about there

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.960 
my center of mass is right about there
which<00:03:50.020> is<00:03:50.710> about<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.580> centimeter<00:03:52.830> above<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
which is about a centimeter above the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.010 
which is about a centimeter above the
gimbal<00:03:55.900> or<00:03:56.170> above<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.650> axle<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:58.510> then<00:03:58.870> it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
gimbal or above the axle and then it

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.740 
gimbal or above the axle and then it
started<00:03:59.290> working<00:03:59.410> so<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.790> looked<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.720> looked

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
started working so I looked and I looked

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.740 
started working so I looked and I looked
I<00:04:02.200> saw<00:04:02.410> other<00:04:02.770> other<00:04:03.310> people<00:04:03.820> where<00:04:04.450> they<00:04:04.570> had

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
I saw other other people where they had

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.000 
I saw other other people where they had
built<00:04:04.990> a<00:04:05.760> self-balancing<00:04:06.760> two<00:04:07.450> wheeler<00:04:07.750> and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
built a self-balancing two wheeler and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.990 
built a self-balancing two wheeler and
but<00:04:09.010> there<00:04:09.130> were<00:04:09.190> no<00:04:09.310> details

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
but there were no details

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.940 
but there were no details
they<00:04:10.450> wouldn't<00:04:10.690> they<00:04:11.200> wouldn't<00:04:11.320> say<00:04:11.620> anything

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
they wouldn't they wouldn't say anything

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.210 
they wouldn't they wouldn't say anything
about<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:13.300> distribution<00:04:14.050> of<00:04:14.170> weight<00:04:14.440> between

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
about the distribution of weight between

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.990 
about the distribution of weight between
the<00:04:15.580> motor<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.480> gyroscope<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:18.489> I

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
the motor and the gyroscope and so I

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.660 
the motor and the gyroscope and so I
kind<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.600> discovered<00:04:20.049> on<00:04:20.140> my<00:04:20.290> own<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.920> at

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
kind of discovered on my own that at

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.730 
kind of discovered on my own that at
least<00:04:21.850> what's<00:04:22.150> working<00:04:22.450> for<00:04:22.600> me<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.230> if<00:04:23.500> you

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
least what's working for me is if you

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.760 
least what's working for me is if you
put<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> center<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.730> mass<00:04:24.910> right<00:04:25.180> about<00:04:25.420> there

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
put the center of mass right about there

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.250 
put the center of mass right about there
it<00:04:26.770> will<00:04:27.010> balance<00:04:27.280> itself<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.870> can<00:04:29.020> see

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
it will balance itself and you can see

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.120 
it will balance itself and you can see
that<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.620> top-heavy<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:32.350> will<00:04:32.560> sit<00:04:32.830> here

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
that it is top-heavy it it will sit here

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.860 
that it is top-heavy it it will sit here
but<00:04:33.640> that's<00:04:33.790> just<00:04:33.910> because<00:04:34.090> of<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.390> friction

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
but that's just because of the friction

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.720 
but that's just because of the friction
with<00:04:35.140> these<00:04:35.260> little<00:04:35.440> rubber<00:04:35.560> doohickeys<00:04:36.490> that

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
with these little rubber doohickeys that

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.270 
with these little rubber doohickeys that
I've<00:04:36.850> got<00:04:37.060> holding<00:04:37.750> on<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.050> axle<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:41.280> does

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
I've got holding on the axle so it does

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.650 
I've got holding on the axle so it does
seem<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:42.970> work<00:04:43.060> pretty<00:04:43.180> good

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
seem to work pretty good

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.650 
seem to work pretty good
it<00:04:44.410> shakes<00:04:44.770> them<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.250> shivers<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.640> bit<00:04:45.940> but

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
it shakes them and shivers a bit but

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.630 
it shakes them and shivers a bit but
that's<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.770> because<00:04:47.980> I'm<00:04:48.220> using<00:04:48.400> really

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
that's just because I'm using really

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.420 
that's just because I'm using really
cheap<00:04:49.060> materials<00:04:49.990> really<00:04:50.860> flexible

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
cheap materials really flexible

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.020 
cheap materials really flexible
materials<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.450> my<00:04:53.290> my<00:04:53.890> CD<00:04:55.200> gyroscope<00:04:56.200> is<00:04:56.590> is

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
materials and my my CD gyroscope is is

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
materials and my my CD gyroscope is is
definitely<00:04:58.030> out<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.270> balance<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.870> not

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
definitely out of balance it's not

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.980 
definitely out of balance it's not
balanced<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.190> I<00:05:00.640> believe<00:05:01.120> if<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:01.390> used<00:05:01.810> a

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
balanced so I believe if you used a

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.790 
balanced so I believe if you used a
balanced<00:05:03.060> gyroscope<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:05.290> thing<00:05:05.530> would

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
balanced gyroscope this thing would

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.960 
balanced gyroscope this thing would
wouldn't<00:05:06.550> move<00:05:06.790> at<00:05:06.940> all<00:05:07.120> when<00:05:07.960> it's<00:05:08.650> running

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
wouldn't move at all when it's running

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.830 
wouldn't move at all when it's running
but<00:05:10.229> it's<00:05:11.229> working<00:05:11.620> now<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:12.090> my<00:05:13.090> next<00:05:13.300> step<00:05:13.419> is

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
but it's working now so my next step is

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.690 
but it's working now so my next step is
to<00:05:14.250> try<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.340> control<00:05:16.950> when<00:05:17.950> because<00:05:18.370> I<00:05:18.460> want

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
to try to control when because I want

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.730 
to try to control when because I want
this<00:05:18.820> thing<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.210> move<00:05:19.419> forward<00:05:20.200> and<00:05:20.350> backwards

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
this thing to move forward and backwards

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.460 
this thing to move forward and backwards
and<00:05:20.979> I<00:05:21.760> want<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.030> try<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.330> control<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.169> the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
and I want to try to control the the

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.080 
and I want to try to control the the
weight<00:05:25.320> that<00:05:26.320> controls<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.070> precession<00:05:27.940> of

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
weight that controls the precession of

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.140 
weight that controls the precession of
the<00:05:28.419> gyroscope<00:05:29.080> itself<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:30.100> so<00:05:30.880> I'm<00:05:31.000> going<00:05:31.090> to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
the gyroscope itself and so I'm going to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.000 
the gyroscope itself and so I'm going to
have<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.330> do<00:05:31.450> that<00:05:31.660> with<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.840> counterweight<00:05:32.290> and

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
have to do that with a counterweight and

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.490 
have to do that with a counterweight and
I'm<00:05:33.370> going<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.550> mount<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.880> servo<00:05:34.750> on<00:05:34.930> top<00:05:35.140> here

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
I'm going to mount a servo on top here

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.260 
I'm going to mount a servo on top here
and<00:05:35.620> it<00:05:35.740> will<00:05:35.860> swing<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.400> counterweight<00:05:36.760> back

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
and it will swing a counterweight back

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.629 
and it will swing a counterweight back
and<00:05:37.479> forth<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:38.350> even<00:05:39.190> though<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.400> push<00:05:39.880> on<00:05:40.090> this

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
and forth so even though I push on this

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.469 
and forth so even though I push on this
it<00:05:40.999> will<00:05:41.180> counter<00:05:41.599> that<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:43.240> movement<00:05:44.240> and

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
it will counter that that movement and

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.170 
it will counter that that movement and
it<00:05:47.479> was<00:05:47.629> very<00:05:47.840> very<00:05:47.990> happy<00:05:48.499> when<00:05:48.969> and<00:05:49.969> very

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
it was very very happy when and very

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.640 
it was very very happy when and very
surprised<00:05:50.629> when<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:50.960> actually<00:05:51.349> started

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
surprised when it actually started

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.890 
surprised when it actually started
balancing<00:05:52.189> itself<00:05:52.520> so<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.659> is<00:05:53.810> doable<00:05:54.219> I

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
balancing itself so it is doable I

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.330 
balancing itself so it is doable I
wanted<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:57.050> do<00:05:57.199> it<00:05:57.379> with<00:05:57.620> some<00:05:57.889> really<00:05:58.099> cheap

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
wanted to do it with some really cheap

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.659 
wanted to do it with some really cheap
materials<00:05:59.029> like<00:05:59.330> these<00:05:59.539> CDs<00:06:00.189> so<00:06:01.189> that<00:06:01.460> maybe

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
materials like these CDs so that maybe

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.409 
materials like these CDs so that maybe
others<00:06:02.090> out<00:06:02.419> there<00:06:02.449> who<00:06:02.990> don't<00:06:03.529> have<00:06:03.770> access

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
others out there who don't have access

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.550 
others out there who don't have access
to<00:06:05.419> a<00:06:05.749> machine<00:06:05.960> shop<00:06:06.759> where<00:06:07.870> they<00:06:08.870> can<00:06:09.080> make<00:06:09.499> a

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
to a machine shop where they can make a

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.580 
to a machine shop where they can make a
nice<00:06:10.520> precision<00:06:11.210> rotor<00:06:12.129> I<00:06:13.689> wanted<00:06:14.689> to<00:06:14.870> be<00:06:15.439> able

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
nice precision rotor I wanted to be able

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.450 
nice precision rotor I wanted to be able
to<00:06:15.770> show<00:06:15.979> that<00:06:16.009> even<00:06:16.759> using<00:06:17.150> cheap<00:06:17.389> materials

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
to show that even using cheap materials

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.769 
to show that even using cheap materials
nothing<00:06:19.460> has<00:06:19.610> straight<00:06:19.969> on<00:06:20.150> here<00:06:20.360> everything

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
nothing has straight on here everything

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.890 
nothing has straight on here everything
is<00:06:20.900> kind<00:06:21.110> of<00:06:21.199> crooked<00:06:21.409> and<00:06:21.729> even<00:06:22.729> so<00:06:23.000> if<00:06:23.360> you

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
is kind of crooked and even so if you

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.990 
is kind of crooked and even so if you
get<00:06:24.110> it<00:06:24.229> balanced<00:06:24.800> just<00:06:25.099> right<00:06:25.219> this<00:06:25.759> thing

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
get it balanced just right this thing

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.860 
get it balanced just right this thing
will<00:06:26.180> still<00:06:26.710> balance<00:06:27.710> on<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:27.860> two<00:06:28.099> wheeler<00:06:28.479> so<00:06:29.479> I

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
will still balance on a two wheeler so I

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.860 
will still balance on a two wheeler so I
hope<00:06:30.229> some<00:06:30.770> other<00:06:30.919> people<00:06:31.279> will<00:06:31.490> try<00:06:31.870> this

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
hope some other people will try this

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.920 
hope some other people will try this
little<00:06:33.229> experiment<00:06:33.800> and<00:06:34.599> see<00:06:35.599> where<00:06:35.779> we<00:06:35.900> can

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
little experiment and see where we can

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.560 
little experiment and see where we can
go<00:06:36.199> from<00:06:36.319> there
