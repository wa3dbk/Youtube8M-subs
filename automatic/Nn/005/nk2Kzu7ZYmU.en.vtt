00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
we've had up until now but the prison in

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.729 
we've had up until now but the prison in
terms<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:40.089> what<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.360> prison<00:00:40.660> was<00:00:40.900> or<00:00:41.379> where

think we'll ever see the prison again in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
in and around it quickly at the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
return episode but aside from that I

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.820

mean the prison is a done location
doesn't<00:01:03.640> seem<00:01:03.970> like<00:01:04.119> we're<00:01:04.239> gonna<00:01:04.330> be<00:01:04.479> going

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
doesn't seem like we're gonna be going

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.920 
doesn't seem like we're gonna be going
back<00:01:04.930> there<00:01:04.960> it's<00:01:05.860> finished<00:01:06.820> it's<00:01:07.000> done<00:01:07.119> so

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
back there it's finished it's done so

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.630 
back there it's finished it's done so
what<00:01:08.140> would<00:01:08.290> be<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.560> next<00:01:08.830> big<00:01:09.070> location

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
what would be the next big location

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.890 
what would be the next big location
where<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.880> characters<00:01:10.240> will<00:01:10.360> stay<00:01:10.540> at<00:01:10.659> for<00:01:10.869> a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
where the characters will stay at for a

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.600 
where the characters will stay at for a
while<00:01:11.140> well<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.770> think<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.189> rest<00:01:12.369> of<00:01:12.520> this

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
while well I think the rest of this

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.070 
while well I think the rest of this
season<00:01:12.880> at<00:01:13.150> least<00:01:13.180> they're<00:01:13.630> going<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.810> kind<00:01:14.020> of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
season at least they're going to kind of

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.800 
season at least they're going to kind of
be<00:01:14.430> traveling<00:01:15.430> around<00:01:15.549> for<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.000> while<00:01:16.299> trying

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
be traveling around for a while trying

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.770 
be traveling around for a while trying
to<00:01:16.900> find<00:01:17.140> each<00:01:17.320> other<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.360> comic

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
to find each other and in the comic

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.420 
to find each other and in the comic
series<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.320> course<00:01:20.560> they<00:01:20.799> go<00:01:20.950> back<00:01:21.189> to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
series of course they go back to

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.499 
series of course they go back to
Herschel's<00:01:21.970> farm

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
Herschel's farm

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.170 
Herschel's farm
now<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:24.100> season<00:01:24.550> I<00:01:24.730> don't<00:01:24.850> know<00:01:25.030> if

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
now in this season I don't know if

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.260 
now in this season I don't know if
they're<00:01:25.330> necessarily<00:01:25.840> going<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.170> do<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.560> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
they're necessarily going to do that I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.880 
they're necessarily going to do that I
mean<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.300> guess<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.900> kind<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.350> makes<00:01:29.560> sense<00:01:29.650> that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
mean I guess it kind of makes sense that

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.620 
mean I guess it kind of makes sense that
they<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.460> they<00:01:30.580> might<00:01:30.880> want<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.180> go<00:01:31.300> check<00:01:31.330> it

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
they that they might want to go check it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.060 
they that they might want to go check it
out<00:01:31.720> or<00:01:31.870> they<00:01:31.960> might<00:01:32.140> want<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.500> see<00:01:32.710> if<00:01:32.860> it's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
out or they might want to see if it's

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.780 
out or they might want to see if it's
still<00:01:33.610> inhabitable<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.740> barn<00:01:36.310> was<00:01:36.550> burned

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
still inhabitable the barn was burned

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.640 
still inhabitable the barn was burned
down<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.210> course<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.750> house<00:01:37.900> itself<00:01:38.140> is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
down of course but the house itself is

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.410 
down of course but the house itself is
still<00:01:38.890> probably<00:01:39.190> in<00:01:39.550> pretty<00:01:39.700> good<00:01:39.940> working

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
still probably in pretty good working

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.330 
still probably in pretty good working
order<00:01:40.600> as<00:01:41.200> long<00:01:41.409> as<00:01:41.560> they<00:01:41.710> clear<00:01:41.980> it<00:01:42.010> out<00:01:42.220> of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
any Walker's that are in it they should

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.230 
any Walker's that are in it they should
be<00:01:44.290> able<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.530> take<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:44.950> back<00:01:45.070> over<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.670> use<00:01:46.060> it

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
be able to take it back over and use it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.790 
be able to take it back over and use it
for<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.420> little<00:01:46.600> while<00:01:46.720> now<00:01:47.380> how<00:01:47.500> many<00:01:47.680> episodes

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
for a little while now how many episodes

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.950 
for a little while now how many episodes
will<00:01:48.220> they<00:01:48.310> stay<00:01:48.520> there<00:01:48.700> for<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.180> would<00:01:49.720> think

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
will they stay there for I would think

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.210 
will they stay there for I would think
if<00:01:50.110> that's<00:01:50.290> where<00:01:50.530> they're<00:01:50.710> gonna<00:01:50.800> go

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
if that's where they're gonna go

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.350 
if that's where they're gonna go
probably<00:01:52.060> only<00:01:52.540> be<00:01:52.840> maybe<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.380> few<00:01:53.800> episodes

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
probably only be maybe a few episodes

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.940 
probably only be maybe a few episodes
maximum<00:01:55.360> we've<00:01:55.870> seen<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.290> prison<00:01:56.650> or<00:01:56.800> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
maximum we've seen the prison or the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.910 
maximum we've seen the prison or the
farm<00:01:57.190> quite<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.520> bit<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:59.140> know<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.500> really

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
farm quite a bit and you know I really

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.290 
farm quite a bit and you know I really
don't<00:02:00.159> think<00:02:00.220> they'd<00:02:00.430> want<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.790> have<00:02:01.150> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
don't think they'd want to have the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.120 
don't think they'd want to have the
characters<00:02:01.690> stay<00:02:01.900> there<00:02:02.140> for<00:02:02.320> all<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.710> long

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
characters stay there for all that long

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.880 
characters stay there for all that long
after<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:04.299> of<00:02:04.510> course<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:05.020> storyline<00:02:05.740> from

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
after that of course the storyline from

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.570 
after that of course the storyline from
the<00:02:06.040> comic<00:02:06.280> book<00:02:06.400> series<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:07.360> they<00:02:08.580> go

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
the comic book series is that they go

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.820 
the comic book series is that they go
out<00:02:09.610> on<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.090> road<00:02:10.239> onto<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.720> mission<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.530> then

out on the road onto a mission and then

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.860 
out on the road onto a mission and then
of<00:02:11.950> course<00:02:11.980> find<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.760> Alexandria<00:02:13.510> safe<00:02:13.810> zone

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
of course find the Alexandria safe zone

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.729 
of course find the Alexandria safe zone
which<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.370> Washington<00:02:16.000> DC<00:02:16.530> essentially<00:02:17.530> is

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
which is in Washington DC essentially is

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.119 
which is in Washington DC essentially is
a<00:02:17.769> huge<00:02:18.519> community<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.390> they've<00:02:19.900> built<00:02:20.170> you

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
a huge community and they've built you

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.280 
a huge community and they've built you
know<00:02:21.159> wall<00:02:21.549> themselves<00:02:22.239> off<00:02:22.480> essentially

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
know wall themselves off essentially

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.899 
know wall themselves off essentially
they've<00:02:23.470> actually<00:02:23.650> done<00:02:23.890> construction<00:02:24.310> and

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
they've actually done construction and

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.379 
they've actually done construction and
walled<00:02:25.810> themselves<00:02:26.440> off<00:02:26.650> from<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.099> from<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
walled themselves off from the from the

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.360 
walled themselves off from the from the
outside<00:02:28.749> world<00:02:29.079> and<00:02:29.620> they<00:02:29.829> have<00:02:30.010> gates

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
outside world and they have gates

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.740 
outside world and they have gates
basically<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.329> they

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
basically that they

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870 
basically that they
that<00:02:32.050> they<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.320> open<00:02:32.650> when<00:02:32.800> they<00:02:32.950> want<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.340> so

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
that they can open when they want to so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.220 
that they can open when they want to so
it's<00:02:34.030> actually<00:02:34.210> in<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.480> way<00:02:34.660> even<00:02:35.050> maybe

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
it's actually in the way even maybe

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.840 
it's actually in the way even maybe
better<00:02:35.590> than<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.950> prison<00:02:36.430> because<00:02:36.580> it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
better than the prison because it

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.220 
better than the prison because it
doesn't<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.210> fences<00:02:37.420> all<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> way<00:02:37.930> around

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
doesn't have fences all the way around

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.980 
doesn't have fences all the way around
it<00:02:38.740> actually<00:02:38.980> has<00:02:39.370> cement<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:40.030> know<00:02:40.180> huge

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
it actually has cement you know huge

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.460 
it actually has cement you know huge
walls<00:02:41.550> all<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.610> way<00:02:42.880> around<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.960> pretty

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
walls all the way around so it's pretty

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.780 
walls all the way around so it's pretty
well<00:02:44.680> secured<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.600> when<00:02:47.130> will<00:02:48.130> we<00:02:48.160> be<00:02:48.550> seeing

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
well secured so when will we be seeing

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.070 
well secured so when will we be seeing
that<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.120> don't<00:02:49.420> think<00:02:49.570> it's<00:02:49.660> gonna<00:02:49.780> be<00:02:49.900> anytime

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
that I don't think it's gonna be anytime

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.230 
that I don't think it's gonna be anytime
soon<00:02:50.230> no<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.800> don't<00:02:51.160> think<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.490> I<00:02:51.730> don't<00:02:52.030> think

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
soon no I don't think so I don't think

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.510 
soon no I don't think so I don't think
we'll<00:02:52.540> see<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.140> rest<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.530> season<00:02:53.740> 4<00:02:54.190> I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
we'll see that in the rest of season 4 I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.810 
we'll see that in the rest of season 4 I
think<00:02:55.180> maybe<00:02:55.540> season<00:02:56.290> 5<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.620> maybe<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
think maybe season 5 but maybe like the

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.880 
think maybe season 5 but maybe like the
end<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.150> season<00:02:58.390> 5<00:02:58.720> or<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.110> second<00:02:59.500> half<00:02:59.740> of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
end of season 5 or the second half of

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890 
end of season 5 or the second half of
season<00:03:00.100> 5<00:03:00.430> but<00:03:01.270> I<00:03:01.300> don't<00:03:01.510> think<00:03:01.690> we're<00:03:01.780> going

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
season 5 but I don't think we're going

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.199 
season 5 but I don't think we're going
to<00:03:01.959> see<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.230> anytime<00:03:02.620> soon<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.610> sounds<00:03:04.030> to

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
to see it anytime soon so it sounds to

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.000 
to see it anytime soon so it sounds to
me<00:03:04.239> like<00:03:04.390> if<00:03:04.720> they<00:03:04.840> go<00:03:04.870> based<00:03:05.350> on<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.739> books

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
me like if they go based on the books

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.070 
me like if they go based on the books
when<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:06.970> think<00:03:07.239> about<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.600> they're<00:03:07.780> probably

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
when I think about it they're probably

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.260 
when I think about it they're probably
going<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:09.130> go<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.550> farm<00:03:09.790> for<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.060> little

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
going to go to the farm for a little

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.810 
going to go to the farm for a little
while<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:11.320> find<00:03:11.860> you<00:03:12.040> know<00:03:12.160> all<00:03:12.400> kind<00:03:12.730> of

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
while and then find you know all kind of

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.580 
while and then find you know all kind of
gather<00:03:13.180> back<00:03:13.480> together<00:03:13.810> at<00:03:14.080> least<00:03:14.260> most<00:03:14.470> of

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
gather back together at least most of

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.750 
gather back together at least most of
the<00:03:14.650> group<00:03:14.830> get<00:03:15.040> back<00:03:15.220> together

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the group get back together

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.600 
the group get back together
and<00:03:15.880> just<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.840> kind<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.350> on<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.739> on<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.040> run<00:03:18.310> in

time until they finally eventually find

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.410 
time until they finally eventually find
the<00:03:23.470> Alexandra's<00:03:24.070> safe<00:03:24.280> zone<00:03:24.580> because<00:03:25.270> I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
the Alexandra's safe zone because I

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.590 
the Alexandra's safe zone because I
don't<00:03:25.480> think<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.080> farm<00:03:26.350> itself<00:03:26.770> I<00:03:27.450> think<00:03:28.450> they

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
don't think the farm itself I think they

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.140 
don't think the farm itself I think they
kind<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:29.020> know<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.100> farm<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.550> not<00:03:30.790> safe

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
kind of know that the farm is not safe

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.120 
kind of know that the farm is not safe
and<00:03:31.480> they're<00:03:32.020> probably<00:03:32.230> not<00:03:32.620> going<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:32.920> try<00:03:33.100> to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
and they're probably not going to try to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.100 
and they're probably not going to try to
fortify<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.700> farm<00:03:34.060> they<00:03:34.510> might<00:03:34.720> just<00:03:34.930> stay

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
fortify the farm they might just stay

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.930 
fortify the farm they might just stay
there<00:03:35.290> for<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.500> little<00:03:35.709> while<00:03:35.890> aside<00:03:36.670> from<00:03:36.700> that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
there for a little while aside from that

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.120 
there for a little while aside from that
the<00:03:37.269> big<00:03:37.450> spot<00:03:37.750> was<00:03:37.959> destroyed<00:03:38.380> wasn't<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:38.950> and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
the big spot was destroyed wasn't it and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.539 
the big spot was destroyed wasn't it and
I<00:03:39.700> mean<00:03:39.940> aside<00:03:40.420> from<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.780> maybe<00:03:41.200> for<00:03:42.070> Bennett

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
I mean aside from that maybe for Bennett

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.009 
I mean aside from that maybe for Bennett
could<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:42.910> another<00:03:43.120> location<00:03:43.510> or<00:03:43.750> fort

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
could be another location or fort

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.560 
could be another location or fort
benning<00:03:44.200> isn't<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:44.950> right<00:03:45.549> even<00:03:46.239> though<00:03:46.360> it

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
benning isn't it right even though it

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.600 
benning isn't it right even though it
sounds<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:46.989> that<00:03:47.140> might<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.980> was<00:03:48.130> overrun

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
sounds like that might that was overrun

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.920 
sounds like that might that was overrun
but<00:03:48.850> they<00:03:48.970> could<00:03:49.420> try<00:03:49.720> there<00:03:50.280> also<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.750> show

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
but they could try there also the show

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.080 
but they could try there also the show
wanted<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.380> go<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.530> make<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:54.010> didn't<00:03:54.340> she<00:03:54.459> so

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
wanted to go to make in didn't she so

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.910 
wanted to go to make in didn't she so
maybe<00:03:55.510> something<00:03:55.959> like<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:56.709> some<00:03:56.860> of

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
maybe something like that for some of

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.830 
maybe something like that for some of
the<00:03:56.980> characters<00:03:57.400> or<00:03:57.549> maybe<00:03:57.700> just<00:03:57.940> an<00:03:58.239> entirely

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
the characters or maybe just an entirely

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.259 
the characters or maybe just an entirely
new<00:03:59.200> location<00:03:59.769> but<00:04:00.370> in<00:04:00.489> terms<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:01.000> what<00:04:01.180> I'm

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
new location but in terms of what I'm

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.580 
new location but in terms of what I'm
thinking<00:04:01.299> if<00:04:01.900> they're<00:04:02.049> going<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.230> stay<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
thinking if they're going to stay on the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.990 
thinking if they're going to stay on the
course<00:04:02.829> of<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.070> books<00:04:03.310> which<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.700> looks<00:04:03.850> like

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
course of the books which it looks like

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.600 
course of the books which it looks like
eventually<00:04:04.780> even<00:04:05.350> as<00:04:05.709> much<00:04:05.920> as<00:04:06.100> they<00:04:06.250> bring<00:04:06.489> in

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
eventually even as much as they bring in

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.160 
eventually even as much as they bring in
new<00:04:06.640> concepts<00:04:07.329> with<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.510> governor<00:04:07.959> and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
new concepts with the governor and

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.780 
new concepts with the governor and
different<00:04:08.440> things<00:04:08.590> like<00:04:08.739> that<00:04:08.799> they're<00:04:09.579> going

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
different things like that they're going

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.220 
different things like that they're going
to<00:04:09.880> eventually<00:04:10.180> go<00:04:10.450> back<00:04:10.480> on<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:10.870> path<00:04:11.170> so

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
to eventually go back on that path so

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.250 
to eventually go back on that path so
I'm<00:04:11.620> thinking<00:04:12.040> farm<00:04:12.700> temporarily<00:04:13.329> lots<00:04:14.079> of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
I'm thinking farm temporarily lots of

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.110 
I'm thinking farm temporarily lots of
different<00:04:14.560> little<00:04:14.709> many<00:04:15.220> locations<00:04:15.640> for<00:04:16.060> a

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
different little many locations for a

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.000 
different little many locations for a
little<00:04:16.299> while<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:16.750> then<00:04:17.140> eventually<00:04:17.200> at

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
little while and then eventually at

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.310 
little while and then eventually at
maybe<00:04:18.340> halfway<00:04:18.729> through<00:04:18.970> season<00:04:19.150> five<00:04:19.540> and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
maybe halfway through season five and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.469 
maybe halfway through season five and
near<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.799> end<00:04:20.979> of<00:04:21.070> season<00:04:21.370> five<00:04:21.519> Alexandria

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
near the end of season five Alexandria

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.420 
near the end of season five Alexandria

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
safe zone anyway let me know what you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.860 
safe zone anyway let me know what you
guys<00:04:24.580> think<00:04:24.820> let's<00:04:25.030> do<00:04:25.180> some<00:04:25.390> predictions

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
guys think let's do some predictions

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.570 
guys think let's do some predictions
let's<00:04:26.080> talk<00:04:26.260> about<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.650> where<00:04:27.250> do<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.460> think

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
let's talk about it where do you think

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.040 
let's talk about it where do you think
the<00:04:27.760> characters<00:04:28.180> are<00:04:28.300> going<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.479> end<00:04:28.630> up<00:04:28.780> being

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
the characters are going to end up being

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.460 
the characters are going to end up being
is<00:04:29.200> the<00:04:29.320> next<00:04:29.590> big<00:04:29.770> location<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:32.350> know

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
is the next big location and you know

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
is the next big location and you know
how<00:04:32.590> do<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.740> think<00:04:32.860> it's<00:04:33.070> how<00:04:33.280> do<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.400> think

how do you think it's how do you think
it's<00:04:33.669> going<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.850> go<00:04:33.970> anyway<00:04:34.750> I'll<00:04:34.930> call<00:04:35.169> it

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
it's going to go anyway I'll call it

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.870 
it's going to go anyway I'll call it
here<00:04:35.470> that's<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.800> for<00:04:35.979> this<00:04:36.100> year<00:04:36.310> guys<00:04:36.400> I'll
