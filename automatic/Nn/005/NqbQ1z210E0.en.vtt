00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
always a little bit wary of it but this

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.809 
always a little bit wary of it but this
recent<00:03:14.660> price<00:03:15.079> drop<00:03:15.500> has<00:03:15.859> really<00:03:16.459> solidified

recent price drop has really solidified
me<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.629> my<00:03:17.750> thinking<00:03:18.199> um<00:03:18.319> I'm<00:03:18.859> gonna<00:03:19.129> stay

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
me and my thinking um I'm gonna stay

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.670 
me and my thinking um I'm gonna stay
away<00:03:19.489> from<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.090> from<00:03:20.389> now<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.569> I'm<00:03:21.139> gonna<00:03:21.440> go

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
away from that from now on I'm gonna go

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.930 
away from that from now on I'm gonna go
more<00:03:21.980> on<00:03:22.010> things<00:03:22.639> that<00:03:22.760> have<00:03:23.349> a<00:03:24.940> numismatic

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
more on things that have a numismatic

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.990 
more on things that have a numismatic
value<00:03:25.970> with<00:03:26.510> them<00:03:26.690> too<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:28.099> won't<00:03:28.400> ever<00:03:28.730> have

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
value with them too so I won't ever have

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.930 
value with them too so I won't ever have
to<00:03:29.060> worry<00:03:29.510> about<00:03:29.930> losing<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.949> big<00:03:31.340> portion<00:03:31.669> of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
to worry about losing a big portion of

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.899 
to worry about losing a big portion of
my<00:03:32.090> savings<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:34.010> that's<00:03:34.250> that's<00:03:34.549> where<00:03:34.790> I'm

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
my savings so that's that's where I'm

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.729 
my savings so that's that's where I'm
coming<00:03:35.329> from

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
coming from

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.420 
coming from
I<00:03:36.829> like<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.909> lunar<00:03:38.239> series<00:03:38.680> I've<00:03:39.680> had<00:03:39.979> really

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
I like the lunar series I've had really

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.360 
I like the lunar series I've had really
good<00:03:40.639> success<00:03:40.879> with<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.419> zomb<00:03:41.659> ups<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.799> I

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
good success with the zomb ups and I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.000 
good success with the zomb ups and I
haven't<00:03:43.760> delve<00:03:44.629> into<00:03:44.900> too<00:03:45.229> many<00:03:45.409> different

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
haven't delve into too many different

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.670 
haven't delve into too many different
types<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.579> semi<00:03:46.819> numismatics<00:03:47.690> or<00:03:47.900> numismatics

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
types of semi numismatics or numismatics

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.580 
types of semi numismatics or numismatics
but<00:03:49.419> those<00:03:50.419> are<00:03:50.569> what<00:03:50.690> I've<00:03:50.810> gone<00:03:50.959> after<00:03:51.229> right

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
but those are what I've gone after right

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.649 
but those are what I've gone after right
now<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:52.099> like<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.699> person<00:03:53.030> meant<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.239> lot<00:03:53.389> it's

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
now I like the person meant a lot it's

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.369 
now I like the person meant a lot it's
always<00:03:54.019> really<00:03:54.229> popular<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.810> I'll<00:03:57.139> probably

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
always really popular so I'll probably

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.640 
always really popular so I'll probably
be<00:03:57.650> looking<00:03:57.829> there<00:03:58.190> for<00:03:58.519> my<00:03:58.639> next<00:03:58.879> buys<00:03:59.349> what<00:04:00.349> a

best of both worlds I think they've with
silver<00:04:27.259> because<00:04:27.740> they<00:04:28.219> find<00:04:28.550> pre<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.509> lot<00:04:29.900> of

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
silver because they find pre a lot of

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.230

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
a very strong numismatic sort of play or

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.589 
a very strong numismatic sort of play or
value<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.319> it<00:04:36.469> also<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.759> I<00:04:38.090> just<00:04:38.330> look<00:04:38.479> at

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
value to it also and I just look at

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.679 
value to it also and I just look at
silver<00:04:38.870> slackers<00:04:39.349> newest<00:04:40.219> buys<00:04:40.879> and<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> lot<00:04:41.509> of

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
silver slackers newest buys and a lot of

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.420 
silver slackers newest buys and a lot of
them<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:42.560> know<00:04:42.650> they<00:04:42.860> seem<00:04:43.099> like<00:04:43.129> they're

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
them you know they seem like they're

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.920 
them you know they seem like they're
bullion<00:04:43.849> devices<00:04:44.330> but<00:04:44.479> they've<00:04:44.659> got<00:04:44.810> the

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
bullion devices but they've got the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.520 
bullion devices but they've got the
privies<00:04:45.319> on<00:04:45.530> them<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:46.810> those<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.080> would

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
privies on them and those I think would

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.700 
privies on them and those I think would
have<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.800> very<00:04:49.099> high<00:04:50.199> numismatic<00:04:51.199> value<00:04:51.229> down

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
have a very high numismatic value down

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.330 
have a very high numismatic value down
the<00:04:51.919> line<00:04:52.099> so<00:04:52.639> they<00:04:53.180> really<00:04:53.979> it<00:04:54.979> stops

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
the line so they really it stops

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.689 
the line so they really it stops
becoming<00:04:55.789> a<00:04:56.029> commodity<00:04:56.689> as<00:04:56.930> much<00:04:57.529> and<00:04:57.919> more<00:04:58.310> of

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
becoming a commodity as much and more of

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.790 
becoming a commodity as much and more of
a<00:04:59.169> individual<00:05:00.169> sort<00:05:01.159> of<00:05:01.250> non-replaceable<00:05:02.800> not

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
a individual sort of non-replaceable not

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.219 
a individual sort of non-replaceable not
just<00:05:04.069> exchangeable<00:05:04.819> things<00:05:05.060> as<00:05:05.330> much<00:05:05.840> if

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
just exchangeable things as much if

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.490 
just exchangeable things as much if
you've<00:05:06.830> got<00:05:07.039> a<00:05:07.069> numismatic<00:05:07.879> play<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:09.050> that's

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
you've got a numismatic play so that's

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.100 
you've got a numismatic play so that's
just<00:05:10.039> what<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.610> think<00:05:11.000> about<00:05:11.240> that<00:05:11.539> I'd<00:05:11.840> love<00:05:12.080> to

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.709 
just what I think about that I'd love to
hear<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:12.500> guys<00:05:12.529> his<00:05:12.919> opinions<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:13.789> maybe

oversimplified<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.020> few<00:05:21.289> things<00:05:21.560> but<00:05:22.340> that's

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
oversimplified a few things but that's

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.540 
oversimplified a few things but that's
what<00:05:23.210> I'm<00:05:23.389> gonna<00:05:24.020> be<00:05:24.199> doing<00:05:24.500> from<00:05:24.620> now<00:05:24.710> on<00:05:25.039> and
