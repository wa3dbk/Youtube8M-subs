what's<00:00:23.609> new<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.150> airplane<00:00:24.539> well<00:00:25.199> one

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
what's new with that airplane well one

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.660 
what's new with that airplane well one
of<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> things<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.710> we've<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:25.920> done<00:00:26.490> with

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
of the things that we've just done with

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
of the things that we've just done with
the<00:00:26.820> airplane<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.510> demonstrated<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the airplane as we demonstrated a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.070 
the airplane as we demonstrated a
performance<00:00:29.220> point<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:29.609> 5,000<00:00:30.359> miles<00:00:30.599> range

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
performance point at 5,000 miles range

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.069 
performance point at 5,000 miles range
point<00:00:31.619> 9<00:00:31.859> Mach<00:00:32.219> number<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.450> think<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.870> fact

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
point 9 Mach number and we think in fact

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.260 
point 9 Mach number and we think in fact
that<00:00:34.680> hasn't<00:00:35.040> been<00:00:35.070> done<00:00:35.430> before<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.880> aviation

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that hasn't been done before in aviation

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
that hasn't been done before in aviation
and<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> performance<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> airplane

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and so the performance of the airplane

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
and so the performance of the airplane
and<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:38.969> committed<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and what we have committed to for the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
and what we have committed to for the
customers<00:00:40.469> we've<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.040> proven<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:41.969> do

system we refer to as cabin essential

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
system we refer to as cabin essential
and<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.930> been<00:01:01.140> designed<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.890> fail

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
and it's been designed to be fail
operated<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> never<00:01:03.420> lose<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> cabin

function<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> single<00:01:05.369> failure<00:01:05.580> that's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
function with a single failure that's

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.240 
function with a single failure that's
something<00:01:06.570> new<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.140> us<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.770> change<00:01:08.100> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
something new for us it's a change in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
something new for us it's a change in
our<00:01:08.369> design<00:01:08.549> philosophy<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> think<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
our design philosophy and I think the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.420 
our design philosophy and I think the
customers<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
customers are really going to like that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
customers are really going to like that
and<00:01:11.880> you've<00:01:12.510> also<00:01:12.689> gotten<00:01:13.170> an<00:01:13.320> interesting

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and you've also gotten an interesting

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
and you've also gotten an interesting
interface<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> cabin<00:01:15.240> functions<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
interface for that cabin functions and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
interface for that cabin functions and
it<00:01:16.409> goes<00:01:16.860> back<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.250> device<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> most<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> us

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it goes back to a device that most of us

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
it goes back to a device that most of us
carry<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.720> our<00:01:18.810> pockets<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.470> yes

how<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:26.009> control<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.880> cabin<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.900> we

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
how you can control the cabin what we

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.660 
how you can control the cabin what we
were<00:01:28.140> looking<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.130> developed<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
were looking for when we developed the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.390 
were looking for when we developed the
new<00:01:29.850> cabin<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> device<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.860> was

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
new cabin was a device that was

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.819 
new cabin was a device that was
intuitive<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.659> could<00:01:33.810> control<00:01:34.229> things

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
intuitive that you could control things

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.830 
intuitive that you could control things
like<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.369> entertainment<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.090> lighting<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
like the entertainment the lighting the

at<00:02:15.420> 925<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.129> appears<00:02:17.489> as<00:02:17.700> though<00:02:17.730> we've

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
at 925 and so it appears as though we've

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.460
