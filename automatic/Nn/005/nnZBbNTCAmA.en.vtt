days ago and decided to kind of whip up

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
days ago and decided to kind of whip up
my<00:00:35.309> own<00:00:35.520> version<00:00:35.880> using<00:00:36.870> roasted<00:00:37.260> almonds<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
my own version using roasted almonds and

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.360 
my own version using roasted almonds and
some<00:00:37.980> other<00:00:39.530> ingredients<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> boost<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
some other ingredients to boost the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.880 
some other ingredients to boost the
nutritional<00:00:41.910> content<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:43.020> let's<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> look

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
nutritional content so let's take a look

00:00:43.890 --> 00:01:04.850 
nutritional content so let's take a look
at<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.040> ingredients<00:01:03.290> all<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> think

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
at our ingredients all right I think

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609 
at our ingredients all right I think
this<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> perfect<00:01:05.970> consistency<00:01:06.659> i<00:01:07.260> really

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
this is the perfect consistency i really

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.100 
this is the perfect consistency i really
like<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> smooth<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.030> obviously<00:01:09.990> if

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
like it smooth like this so obviously if

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
corn syrup so all these little sugars

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.090 
corn syrup so all these little sugars
add<00:02:47.420> up<00:02:47.630> especially<00:02:48.230> if<00:02:48.320> they're<00:02:48.470> artificial

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
add up especially if they're artificial

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.400 
add up especially if they're artificial
so<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:49.850> want<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.239> sure<00:02:50.270> that<00:02:50.690> our<00:02:51.080> efforts

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
so we want to make sure that our efforts

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.650 
so we want to make sure that our efforts
to<00:02:51.830> eat<00:02:52.160> healthy<00:02:52.520> are<00:02:52.670> being<00:02:52.880> sabotage<00:02:53.360> by

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
to eat healthy are being sabotage by

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.420 
to eat healthy are being sabotage by
stupid<00:02:54.260> little<00:02:54.410> ingredients<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:54.980> were<00:02:55.160> not
