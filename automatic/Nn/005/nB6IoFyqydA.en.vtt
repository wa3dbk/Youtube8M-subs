00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
the very first game of the race to

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.729 
the very first game of the race to
Commander<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.750> know<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:41.139> was<00:03:41.260> rather<00:03:41.440> short

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
Commander I know it was rather short

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.890 
Commander I know it was rather short
because<00:03:42.100> we<00:03:42.250> did<00:03:42.459> join<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:42.940> progress<00:03:43.180> but<00:03:43.840> I

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
because we did join it in progress but I

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.319 
because we did join it in progress but I
think<00:03:44.260> Matt's<00:03:44.530> rage<00:03:44.920> made<00:03:45.310> up<00:03:45.459> for<00:03:45.639> the<00:03:45.760> short

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
think Matt's rage made up for the short

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:57.479 
think Matt's rage made up for the short
