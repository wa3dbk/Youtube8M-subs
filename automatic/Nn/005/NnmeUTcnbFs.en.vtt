this button here and the entire

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.550 
this button here and the entire
motherboard<00:01:34.619> tray<00:01:35.450> slides<00:01:36.450> completely<00:01:37.409> out

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
motherboard tray slides completely out

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.170 
motherboard tray slides completely out
from<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> system<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:39.060> you're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
from the system so that when you're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.120 
from the system so that when you're
building<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.020> take<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> out<00:01:40.530> lay<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
building you can take this out lay it on

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.980 
building you can take this out lay it on
the<00:01:41.220> table<00:01:41.369> build<00:01:42.270> your<00:01:42.450> computer<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.869> don't

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the table build your computer you don't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.910 
the table build your computer you don't
have<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> worry<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.380> keeping<00:01:43.560> your<00:01:43.740> hands

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
have to worry about keeping your hands

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.200 
have to worry about keeping your hands
in<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.220> bumping<00:01:44.579> things<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> knocking

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
in there and bumping things and knocking

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
in there and bumping things and knocking
things<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.509> cutting<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.560> fingers<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
things over cutting your fingers like I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
things over cutting your fingers like I
always<00:01:47.640> cut<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:48.060> fingers<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.290> one

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
always cut my fingers now with this one

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.319 
always cut my fingers now with this one
I<00:01:49.619> build<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> table<00:01:50.970> it's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
I build it right here on the table it's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.700 
I build it right here on the table it's
extremely<00:01:51.840> easy<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.140> put<00:01:52.229> together<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> then

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
extremely easy to put together and then

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.929 
extremely easy to put together and then
I<00:01:52.829> slide<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> right<00:01:53.430> back<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.820> that's

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
I slide that right back in so that's

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.460 
I slide that right back in so that's
very<00:01:54.210> cool<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.659> comes<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.049> also<00:01:55.380> if

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
very cool if that comes out also if

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.020 
very cool if that comes out also if
you're<00:01:55.560> testing<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.520> laid<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you're testing I just laid this on the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.100 
you're testing I just laid this on the
table<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> was<00:01:57.540> able<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> hook<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:58.020> my

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
table and I was able to hook up my

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
table and I was able to hook up my
computer<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> power<00:01:58.860> supply<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> test

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
computer with the power supply and test

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.060 
computer with the power supply and test
everything<00:02:00.090> before<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.899> put<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> inside<00:02:01.320> so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
everything before I put it inside so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
everything before I put it inside so
that's<00:02:02.189> very<00:02:02.430> cool<00:02:02.700> let's<00:02:03.210> further<00:02:03.570> examine

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that's very cool let's further examine

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
that's very cool let's further examine
the<00:02:04.590> inside<00:02:04.770> alright<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> free<00:02:05.880> removed

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the inside alright now I free removed

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.280 
the inside alright now I free removed
the<00:02:06.299> screws<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> pull<00:02:07.259> out

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the screws because I want to pull out

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.109 
the screws because I want to pull out
the<00:02:07.500> entire<00:02:07.799> hard<00:02:08.099> drive<00:02:08.160> base<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.759> guys<00:02:08.910> can

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the entire hard drive base you guys can

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
the entire hard drive base you guys can
see<00:02:09.390> how<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.440> works<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.860> four<00:02:11.069> screws<00:02:11.550> they

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
see how that works is four screws they

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.800 
see how that works is four screws they
usually<00:02:11.790> go<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.209> side<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> four<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
usually go on this side and four on the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.430 
usually go on this side and four on the
other

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
other

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.300 
other
and<00:02:13.500> then<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> could<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:13.800> slide<00:02:14.130> this

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and then you could just slide this

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.260 
and then you could just slide this
entire<00:02:15.590> hard<00:02:16.590> drive<00:02:16.650> Bay<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.730> now

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
entire hard drive Bay out like so now

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.160 
entire hard drive Bay out like so now
you<00:02:18.360> see<00:02:18.510> right<00:02:18.630> here<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.840> front<00:02:18.930> there's
