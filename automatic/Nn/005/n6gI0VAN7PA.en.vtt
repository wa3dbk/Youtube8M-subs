00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.840
This car needs absolutely a new body!

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.560
Dear friends of Edge RC welcome back!

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.980
this week we will teach you how to make a more than perfect car body

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.500
and we do this with the pro-pilot Luca Capolongo, who's gonna explain us his pro tips!

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.340
That's right Jacopo! This week infact we are preparing a Montech body for a 1/10 touring car

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.180
This one here is a Nazda 6 3.0

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.360
a 0.6mm lexan 190mm touring car body

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.860
let's go with the cutting!

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.980
Cut all the lexan around the body

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.220
start cutting the proper body, keeping the cut along the lines molded on under the doors

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.780
In touring car bodies you have generally two lines. You have to cut the higher one

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.740
let's cut the rear bumper with a curved scissor

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.760
Once the body is cut, take the car

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.780
and apply four wingnuts on the wheels

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.980
This will perfectly center the body on the model

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.000
sign the body post horns with a pen

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.740
now we are reaming the holes in the front of the body

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.120
A little tip is to make a sign on the reamer so that you will drill holes of the same diameter, and also to know where to stop

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.840
mount the body on the front horns

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.680
and check the rear is aligned

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.640
sign the position of the rear horns

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.680
when you have drilled an mounted the body, let's check the height is right

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.600
with the pen we can sketch the circumference of the wheel

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.380
we know about the diameter, so we can point the circular cutter

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.720
to cut perfectly the wheel

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060
the body is now ready

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.100
so let's go with the rear wing

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.840
repeat the cutting operations

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.980
everything is ready, we have just to paint it!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.640
before painting, it's necessary to sand the inner side of the body with a fine sandpaper or a sponge

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.260
then, clean it with some alcohol

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.640
apply the masking films

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.660
we can now paint it!

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.660
if you are good with the aeropencil, you can have fun with it to create your personal color schemes

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.500
we are noobs, so we are going with a single color

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.140
once the paint is dried, remove the maskings

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.340
and remove the protective film from outside

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.640
we have now a wonderful, sparkling and brand new car body!

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000
It's all for this week people, I hope we gave you some inspiration

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.140
see you in a week time with a new video by Edge RC. Don't miss!
