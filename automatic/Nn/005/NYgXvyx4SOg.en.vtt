around it I found out my shop back my

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.680 
around it I found out my shop back my
small<00:01:20.220> shop<00:01:20.430> vac<00:01:20.700> has<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:23.550> end<00:01:23.670> nozzle<00:01:24.570> is

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
small shop vac has a the end nozzle is

the<00:01:24.840> same<00:01:25.020> size<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.950> heater<00:01:26.460> hose<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
the same size as the heater hose for the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.570 
the same size as the heater hose for the
for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.190> high<00:01:29.340> jet<00:01:29.580> so<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.030> wrapped<00:01:30.330> I

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
for the high jet so I just wrapped I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.710 
for the high jet so I just wrapped I
just<00:01:32.580> took<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.880> brake<00:01:33.060> line<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.420> wrapped<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
just took the brake line and wrapped it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.810 
just took the brake line and wrapped it
around<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.140> put<00:01:34.800> some<00:01:34.950> electrical<00:01:35.340> tape<00:01:35.370> on<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
around it put some electrical tape on it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.430 
around it put some electrical tape on it
so<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> wouldn't<00:01:36.120> be<00:01:36.180> too<00:01:36.240> tight<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.780> wrapped

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
so it wouldn't be too tight and wrapped

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.080 
so it wouldn't be too tight and wrapped
it<00:01:37.590> around<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.980> it's<00:01:38.070> gonna<00:01:38.190> form<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> nice<00:01:38.640> coil

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it around so it's gonna form a nice coil

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.350 
it around so it's gonna form a nice coil
I'm<00:01:39.750> gonna<00:01:39.930> cut<00:01:40.140> these<00:01:40.260> ends<00:01:40.560> off<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
I'm gonna cut these ends off and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
I'm gonna cut these ends off and
basically<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.780> splice<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.290> into<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.259 
and I fire this sucker up let it warm up
and<00:02:15.800> see<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.129> happens<00:02:16.160> I'll<00:02:16.879> be<00:02:17.000> hard<00:02:17.180> to

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
and see what happens I'll be hard to

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.640 
and see what happens I'll be hard to
know<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.629> worked<00:02:17.870> if<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.080> didn't<00:02:18.349> actually

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
know if this worked if I didn't actually

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.350 
know if this worked if I didn't actually
measure<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.220> temperature<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.879> coolant

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
measure the temperature of the coolant

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.199 
measure the temperature of the coolant
or<00:02:20.830> sorry<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.980> washer<00:02:22.280> fluid<00:02:22.400> coming<00:02:22.730> out<00:02:22.879> now

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
or sorry the washer fluid coming out now

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.140 
or sorry the washer fluid coming out now
and<00:02:23.569> when<00:02:24.319> I'm<00:02:24.440> done<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:25.430> gonna<00:02:25.580> squirt<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.060> on

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and when I'm done I'm gonna squirt it on

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300 
and when I'm done I'm gonna squirt it on
the<00:02:26.209> windshield<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:27.040> take<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.160> temperature

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the windshield and take the temperature

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.340 
the windshield and take the temperature
of<00:02:28.610> it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:46.470 

I<00:02:33.440> think<00:02:33.920> I'm<00:02:34.040> hitting<00:02:34.190> it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.770 

so<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.540> appears<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.870> be<00:02:49.450> forty<00:02:50.450> nine<00:02:50.569> point

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
so it appears to be forty nine point

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.149 
so it appears to be forty nine point
nine<00:02:51.019> degrees<00:02:51.260> Fahrenheit<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.829> will<00:02:51.950> check

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
nine degrees Fahrenheit you will check

00:02:52.159 --> 00:03:01.390 
nine degrees Fahrenheit you will check
it<00:02:52.310> afterwards<00:02:59.739> okay<00:03:00.739> off<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.069> operating

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
it afterwards okay off the operating

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.660 
it afterwards okay off the operating
temperature<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:03.129> let's<00:03:04.129> take<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.370> reading

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
temperature and let's take a reading

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:30.110 
temperature and let's take a reading
what<00:03:05.329> happens

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.460 

once<00:03:31.120> there's<00:03:31.330> about<00:03:31.420> 50<00:03:31.810> degrees<00:03:32.110> on<00:03:32.379> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
once there's about 50 degrees on the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.180 
once there's about 50 degrees on the
windshield<00:03:32.920> here<00:03:33.129> right<00:03:33.340> now<00:03:34.950> fifty<00:03:35.950> point

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
windshield here right now fifty point

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.490 
windshield here right now fifty point
four

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.970 

59<00:03:44.400> 60

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.290 

you<00:03:50.220> know

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.949 

I<00:03:54.330> mean<00:03:54.990> definitely<00:03:55.170> Perla<00:03:55.620> felix<00:03:55.980> warmer

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.630 

no<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.530> think<00:03:59.739> do<00:03:59.920> is<00:04:00.040> try<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.430> winter

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
no I think do is try it in the winter

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.839 
no I think do is try it in the winter
and<00:04:00.700> see<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:00.939> works<00:04:01.439> anyway<00:04:02.439> wasn't<00:04:02.890> hard<00:04:03.069> and

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
and see it works anyway wasn't hard and

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.020 
and see it works anyway wasn't hard and
cost<00:04:04.269> me<00:04:04.480> anything<00:04:05.310> actually<00:04:06.310> cost<00:04:06.700> me<00:04:06.819> three

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
cost me anything actually cost me three

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.130 
cost me anything actually cost me three
dollars<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.540> brake<00:04:07.750> line<00:04:07.989> but<00:04:09.750> I'll<00:04:10.750> let

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
dollars for a brake line but I'll let

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.310 
dollars for a brake line but I'll let
you<00:04:11.230> know<00:04:11.260> how<00:04:11.859> this<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.159> working
