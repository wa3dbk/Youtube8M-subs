00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
replace it because the vine that you're

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
replace it because the vine that you're
holding<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.230> main<00:00:49.500> trunk<00:00:49.829> after<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
holding right now the main trunk after a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.920 
holding right now the main trunk after a
while<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.610> stops<00:00:50.910> producing<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.660> they

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
while it just stops producing well they

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
while it just stops producing well they
get<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> little<00:00:52.260> old<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
get a little old and these all this

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
get a little old and these all this
variety<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.820> tend<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> flatten<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
variety of tend to flatten out just a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.090 
variety of tend to flatten out just a
little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> starts<00:00:55.770> losing

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
little bit and starts losing

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.700 
little bit and starts losing
productivity<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> point<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
productivity so at that point we want to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.520 
productivity so at that point we want to
replace<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.190> you're<00:00:59.520> new<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.449> actually<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> vine

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.420 
making it a for cane Kniffin it's all
pretty<00:01:34.320> straightforward<00:01:34.560> we're<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
pretty straightforward we're going to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
pretty straightforward we're going to
put<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> twist<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> last

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
put a twist of on there about the last

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.429 
put a twist of on there about the last
good<00:01:37.829> blood<00:01:38.100> button<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.750> we're<00:01:40.079> gonna<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
good blood button and we're gonna do the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.539 
good blood button and we're gonna do the
same<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.979> side

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
same on this side

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
same on this side
and<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.630> questions

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and for you this is this questions

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.050 
and for you this is this questions
probably<00:01:43.350> self-evident<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.579> why<00:01:44.850> buy

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
probably self-evident but why buy

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
probably self-evident but why buy
they're<00:01:45.270> even<00:01:45.450> tiny<00:01:45.689> why<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.259> let<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.500> kind

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
they're even tiny why just let them kind

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.530 
they're even tiny why just let them kind
of<00:01:46.770> roll<00:01:46.920> well<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.390> we

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
of roll well what we want to do is we

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
of roll well what we want to do is we
want<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> fix<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.470> vine<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> wire<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
want to fix the vine to the wire so it

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.730 
want to fix the vine to the wire so it
stays<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.119> allowing<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.880> maximize<00:01:53.880> its<00:01:54.149> Sun

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
stays up allowing it to maximize its Sun

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.899 
stays up allowing it to maximize its Sun
uptake<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.009> also<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.950> allow<00:01:58.950> us<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.430> dry<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
uptake and also to allow us to dry the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
uptake and also to allow us to dry the
vine<00:02:00.240> off<00:02:00.450> quicker<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> lessens<00:02:01.619> our<00:02:01.740> disease

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
vine off quicker and lessens our disease

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.980 
vine off quicker and lessens our disease
pressure<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.880> haven't<00:02:03.240> essentially<00:02:03.810> off

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
pressure if we haven't essentially off

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.020 
pressure if we haven't essentially off
the<00:02:04.170> ground<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:04.799> where<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> Sun<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> air

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the ground up where the Sun in the air

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.880 
the ground up where the Sun in the air
can<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.719> dries<00:02:07.350> off<00:02:07.619> quicker

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
can get to it and dries off quicker

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.119 
can get to it and dries off quicker
after<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.340> sudden<00:02:08.729> or<00:02:09.360> after<00:02:09.720> rainstorm<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
after a sudden or after rainstorm and so

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.250 
after a sudden or after rainstorm and so
once<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.550> once

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
once the once

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.449 
once the once
grapes<00:02:12.470> start<00:02:12.709> growing<00:02:13.069> they're<00:02:13.220> gonna<00:02:13.340> be

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
grapes start growing they're gonna be

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.920 
grapes start growing they're gonna be
coming<00:02:13.730> off<00:02:13.819> these<00:02:14.030> mines<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.569> you're<00:02:14.720> tying

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
coming off these mines that you're tying

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.869 
coming off these mines that you're tying
right<00:02:15.290> every<00:02:16.010> one<00:02:16.189> of<00:02:16.220> these<00:02:16.370> little<00:02:16.700> knobs

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
right every one of these little knobs

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.259 
right every one of these little knobs
are<00:02:17.299> what<00:02:17.629> we<00:02:17.720> call<00:02:17.900> buds<00:02:18.220> okay<00:02:19.220> are<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:20.150> to

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
are what we call buds okay are going to

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.910 
are what we call buds okay are going to
sprout<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.569> cane<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.379> that's<00:02:21.680> where<00:02:21.890> our

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920
