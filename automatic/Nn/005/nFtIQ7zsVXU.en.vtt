00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.060 
the army into the court they just stayed
out<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.210> feeling<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.240> same<00:01:48.600> golem<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
out here feeling the same golem over and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.260 
out here feeling the same golem over and
over<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.399> goal<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.880> hitting<00:01:51.119> his<00:01:51.240> head

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
over the goal that's hitting his head

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.230 
over the goal that's hitting his head
against<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> wall<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.409> healers<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.700> very

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
against the wall so healers are not very

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.630 
against the wall so healers are not very
good<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.840> taking<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.649> direction<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.369> go

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
good at taking the right direction to go

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.910 
good at taking the right direction to go
maybe<00:01:57.329> they<00:01:57.479> need<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.750> revamp<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> healer<00:01:58.710> AI

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
maybe they need to revamp the healer AI

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.760 
maybe they need to revamp the healer AI
it<00:01:59.759> just<00:02:00.149> picks<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> nearest<00:02:01.380> week

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it just picks like the nearest week

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.520 
it just picks like the nearest week
thing<00:02:02.189> rather<00:02:02.939> than<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.600> weakest<00:02:04.049> thing<00:02:04.140> or

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
thing rather than the weakest thing or

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
thing rather than the weakest thing or
the<00:02:04.860> weakest<00:02:05.189> thing<00:02:05.250> deep<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> base<00:02:06.200> maybe

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the weakest thing deep in the base maybe

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.570 
the weakest thing deep in the base maybe
they<00:02:07.409> could<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.680> something<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
they could do something with that and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.969 
they could do something with that and
make<00:02:08.759> healers<00:02:09.179> much<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.750> useful<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.440> think

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
make healers much more useful I think

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.270 
make healers much more useful I think
healers<00:02:11.400> also<00:02:11.849> deserve<00:02:12.180> maybe<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> ten<00:02:12.900> minute

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
healers also deserve maybe a ten minute

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.870 
healers also deserve maybe a ten minute
time<00:02:13.670> instead<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.390> know<00:02:14.890> 14<00:02:15.890> 15<00:02:16.160> minutes

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
time instead of you know 14 15 minutes

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.860 
time instead of you know 14 15 minutes
whatever<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:19.220> know<00:02:19.370> 15<00:02:20.030> minute<00:02:20.450> build<00:02:20.630> time

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
whatever you know 15 minute build time

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.590 
whatever you know 15 minute build time
it<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.400> little<00:02:22.520> bit<00:02:22.730> too<00:02:22.910> long<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
it it's a little bit too long for the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.590 
it it's a little bit too long for the
healer<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.340> now<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.370> guess<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.209> figure

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
healer and now I guess I figure

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.199 
healer and now I guess I figure
something<00:02:26.930> out<00:02:27.110> about<00:02:27.350> how<00:02:27.860> troops<00:02:28.280> calculate

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
something out about how troops calculate

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.699 
something out about how troops calculate
the<00:02:29.330> closest<00:02:29.720> target<00:02:29.900> by<00:02:30.200> deploying<00:02:30.470> that

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
the closest target by deploying that

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.949 
the closest target by deploying that
goal<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:30.980> there<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.730> wall<00:02:31.910> was<00:02:32.090> broken<00:02:32.480> you

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
goal in there so the wall was broken you

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.300 
goal in there so the wall was broken you
would<00:02:33.080> think<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.620> know<00:02:33.709> straight<00:02:34.100> line

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
would think that you know straight line

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.790 
would think that you know straight line
it<00:02:34.520> calculates<00:02:35.000> no<00:02:35.540> Archer<00:02:36.170> tower<00:02:36.350> inside<00:02:36.709> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
it calculates no Archer tower inside the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.680 
it calculates no Archer tower inside the
walls<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.130> closer<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.940> deploy<00:02:38.270> right<00:02:38.569> in

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
walls do closer to the deploy right in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.559 
walls do closer to the deploy right in
front<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.250> instead<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.850> went<00:02:41.120> all<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.540> way

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
front of it instead it went all the way

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.390 
front of it instead it went all the way
to<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.810> outside<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.410> i<00:02:42.440> guess<00:02:42.739> it<00:02:42.920> calculates

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
to the outside so i guess it calculates

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.040 
to the outside so i guess it calculates
exactly<00:02:43.910> how<00:02:44.030> far<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.360> has<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.660> walk<00:02:44.840> so

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
exactly how far it has to walk so

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.960 
exactly how far it has to walk so
calculate<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.739> go<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:46.850> it

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
calculate have to go in and then it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.400 
calculate have to go in and then it
would<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.360> go<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.989> go<00:02:48.140> get<00:02:48.260> that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
would have to go up to go get that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.170 
would have to go up to go get that
archer<00:02:48.739> tower<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.459> instead<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.850> went<00:02:49.910> for<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
archer tower so instead it went for the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.640 
archer tower so instead it went for the
one<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.450> was<00:02:50.570> outside<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.080> walls<00:02:51.320> which<00:02:51.500> was

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
one that was outside the walls which was

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.080 
one that was outside the walls which was
where<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:51.950> didn't<00:02:52.340> want<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.580> go<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:52.940> now

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
where I didn't want it to go because now

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.640 
where I didn't want it to go because now
it's<00:02:53.239> outside<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.959> walls<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.320> says<00:02:54.440> he's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
it's outside the walls and says he's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.160 
it's outside the walls and says he's
stuck<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.160> corner<00:02:55.810> decent<00:02:56.810> free<00:02:56.930> spell

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
stuck on that corner decent free spell

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.900 
stuck on that corner decent free spell
actually<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.739> got<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.250> lot<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.430> buildings<00:02:58.790> in

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
actually I got a lot of buildings in

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.650 
actually I got a lot of buildings in
there<00:02:59.500> and<00:03:00.500> my<00:03:01.280> next<00:03:01.580> free<00:03:01.760> spell<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.300> can<00:03:02.480> say

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
there and my next free spell I can say

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.850 
there and my next free spell I can say
is<00:03:02.810> not<00:03:02.959> very<00:03:03.260> decent<00:03:03.790> yeah<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:05.380> was<00:03:06.380> sort<00:03:06.739> of

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
is not very decent yeah I was sort of

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.110 
is not very decent yeah I was sort of
trying<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.190> do<00:03:07.340> something<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.880> don't<00:03:08.060> remember

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
trying to do something I don't remember

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.610 
trying to do something I don't remember
what<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.510> was<00:03:08.569> trying<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.840> do<00:03:08.930> now<00:03:09.080> but<00:03:09.350> for

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
what I was trying to do now but for

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.040 
what I was trying to do now but for
future<00:03:10.459> reference<00:03:10.970> if<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.300> ever<00:03:11.420> see<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> base

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
future reference if you ever see a base

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.590 
future reference if you ever see a base
like<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:13.190> freeze<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.880> expose<00:03:14.300> and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
like this just freeze the to expose and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.840 
like this just freeze the to expose and
the<00:03:14.810> Tesla<00:03:15.680> right<00:03:15.860> there<00:03:16.100> instead<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.670> just

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
the Tesla right there instead of just

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.380 
the Tesla right there instead of just
the<00:03:17.000> Tesla<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.660> have<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.560> 45-percent<00:03:19.160> though<00:03:19.549> so

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
the Tesla I have a 45-percent though so

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.699 
the Tesla I have a 45-percent though so
it's<00:03:20.540> going<00:03:20.750> pretty<00:03:20.810> well<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.470> a

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
it's going pretty well and this is a

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.039 
it's going pretty well and this is a
maxed-out<00:03:22.250> base<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.850> walls<00:03:23.060> are<00:03:23.299> might<00:03:23.989> as

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
maxed-out base the walls are might as

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.600 
maxed-out base the walls are might as
well<00:03:24.170> be<00:03:24.290> all<00:03:24.500> level<00:03:24.829> 11<00:03:25.100> it's<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.340> same

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
well be all level 11 it's the same

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.280 
well be all level 11 it's the same
because<00:03:25.910> level<00:03:26.209> 10<00:03:26.390> takes<00:03:26.750> three<00:03:27.110> wall
