was<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.830> my<00:02:46.950> interpretation<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.880> not<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
was just my interpretation it's not that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.680 
was just my interpretation it's not that
hard<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.450> interpret<00:02:48.810> what<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.320> need<00:02:49.530> but

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
hard to interpret what you need but

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.040 
hard to interpret what you need but
hopefully<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.380> decent<00:02:52.800> spec<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:54.050> also

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
