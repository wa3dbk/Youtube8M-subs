00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.900
 at the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.359
 how is it going to be after having approached two sailors 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.429
 and a diver for very different stories to tell 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.279
 Olympic bruno sources in the laser class 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.280
 antônio carlos to retreat the cruzeirista who gave the return to the world with the family 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.210
 we'll try to bring you the beauties of the seabed 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.210
 Brazilian said 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.410
 however nobody who is advertising and diver 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.530
 he is releasing a series of movies called idc brazil will be 18 and dvd 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.130
 risk of the Brazilian coast 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.910
 how did the idea of ​​this project 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.899
 Good, I'm a diver. 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.130
 julia the diver is a pain 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.130
 in terms of safety responding seabed 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.710
 and as in uol most people did not have access to all that beauties they 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.820
 we usually see 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.770
 I started to photograph filming of a mature woman 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.960
 from there 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.650
 tel 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.660
 the world next month 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.150
 I thought why not take these pictures 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.510
 all people know and second submarine 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.420
 and at the outset then came the idea of ​​having sex 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.009
 the top three and will leave have been released 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.259
 maria maria alice 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.190
 will be that Fernando de Noronha will speak a little bit of the first 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.740
 How are the waters of Maranhão? 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.020
 good the rural tour luiz is a place that I consider 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.020
 and many divers consider diving evereste autonomous 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.120
 because it is an unforgivable crime in the world 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.760
 that is 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.749
 tried to get people meet 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.409
 without counting the amount of average debt that exists in barcelona English 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.050
 the average depth 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.810
 is 30 meters to reach in some places reached almost 50 thousand feet 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.009
 josé on the high seas 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.399
 must be a place that there is no double fight is one of the few places in Brazil 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.679
 What makes us an advertiser? 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.689
 the sex dives drift 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.109
 we pay under the water being carried by the current 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.389
 and to the north 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.529
 on top following a buoy one day one of the divers take 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.080
 and what is the distance from the coast of Persia manalich 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.659
 it's 90 kilometers and it takes us to get up there 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.670
 the trip we did one of the trips one day sailing 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.989
 the quality not phrases that exist in the air 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.370
 ie it is considered one of the largest cemeteries vessels in the world 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.079
 one of the castaways we have a big island tanker 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.359
 and especially the transatlantic by the wave 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.500
 who did not pay with 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.129
 one thousand people on board 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.319
 and of these thousand people on board thank god the people are paulo the boat in 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.800
 that were 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 another passage 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.529
 the crowd has to think and even radiation 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.889
 the sea floor of ceará 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.609
 Ceará is actually a privileged state not only the part of 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.809
 surface 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.629
 as well as any part of the seabed 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.739
 when one of the ceará besides the castaways that also exist in the air 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.939
 had a great formation of corals and a great amount of marine life 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.269
 in fact, ceará is one of the largest electricity producers in brazil 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.889
 after thrashing on the Hawaiian channel which is a 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.539
 in the place she currently 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.409
 it is deep are more than 40 meters 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.859
 we dived site called middle lane state park 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.439
 and obviously from the ship the ship was taken 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.459
 german submarine 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.459
 during the Second World War 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:06.090
 He leaves and detonates the diver. 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.189
 he met paradisiac archipelago of fernando de noronha-pe 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.259
 what do you show on this third dvd of the series 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.659
 in fact it is not only divers but in general 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:18.959
 all people 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.430
 decided in Norway shows us the main tourist attractions of the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.249
 archipelago cultural aspects and we get a bit of history 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.890
 and then there is the sea issue 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.050
 the bottom of the sea defend tomorrow is really a blessed place ee 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.080
 mainly to the local efec 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.569
 exist 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.879
 it's the very big differential 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.490
 one of the most local taxi driver today 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.870
 tomorrow 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.030
 I consider 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.499
 altogether three desserts of doubts 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:56.039
 it is a really beautiful place despite being a local dive to its 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.830
 advanced diving because you have to enter 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.729
 but it's not up to us 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.930
 but it is a local and descriptive because the amount of fish and marine life 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.319
 who gave up inside those caves 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.240
 it really impressive 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.099
 in this movie that we did on yahoo in some points mainly like 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.379
 escaped and the irc - I needed and one of the divers stepped with their hands 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.879
 is to get a little to the side if you left to open that curtain of fish 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.099
 say so 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.100
 there are obviously 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.050
 the dolphins who 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.259
 because they actually use the area 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.999
 during a given model of the part of the day with the procreate and then 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:43.879
 they go with the high seas without counting turtles and me several species of 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.279
 fish 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.809
 this is not a reality you will never know everything because with every trip 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.470
 What does the person do there? 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.560
 presented a novelty so I never dated I believe it's the place 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:02.429
 not only with people being able to go more who has the possibility flag that 

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.599
 and live 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.040
 and the next dvd of idc brazil series 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.669
 where is it going to be 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.800
 we are already working on the pre-production of the 4th title 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.990
 that is going to be done here in Rio de Janeiro, we intend to show the whole 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.610
 river coast from the green coast obviously the city of the river 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.610
 of january hees and gains ground of one of the sides 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:33.909
 garrincha and santa cruz 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:37.150
 gold in rio de janeiro pan in class j24 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.279
 maya full three world championship 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:45.110
 in June of that year in sardinia italy in training already started in little 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.099
 he started playing as a training sock 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:52.199
 I wanted and dexia crew of antenna 1 that is the vitino that 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.889
 beautiful defense of martinez 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.869
 he is going to sail the Italian boat manufacturer 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:01.139
 and then the American who makes the candles pressed tactical tourism 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.080
 then however the crew very good 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.490
 the best material is donated the class 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.389
 so we have to train to make one in the championship 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.199
 will remain strategy 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.639
 or we have new gift techniques 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:19.580
 but it was as if to win in the world cent with a good the world something to 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.900
 more then 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.740
 This novel from nine to 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.780
 the crew's way is a bit different too 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.539
 so we'll get there to dispute the championship 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.649
 how does the deployment of three more pieces make you more aggressive 

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:32.559
 in the championship 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:36.689
 in the aije cornell cooperative effective cct take care because you can not be 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:37.699
 very aggressive 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.280
 will be some exhibitions vera and would arrive of aerial ball re-released when 

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.839
 if you have a crew of an activist helps a lot 

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.909
 that his head is over 

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:50.479
 passes in the mind and kings so you already position yourself a little bit better 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:52.120
 but 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.310
 if not can be very aggressive in why the championship version with 70 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.169
 shacks 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:59.610
 then along to the championship and inter 12 regattas 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.610
 If you want to average 

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:04.159
 come back soon 

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:06.320
 however aboard the east orissa sailboat 

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.120
 You will see in the square and the block. 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.770
 do not go away
