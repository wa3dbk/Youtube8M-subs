all over it it even got some fungus and
as<00:01:16.150> you<00:01:16.299> can<00:01:16.420> see<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.869> has<00:01:17.200> just<00:01:17.530> kept<00:01:17.829> on<00:01:18.040> going

and<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:18.939> not<00:01:19.299> stopping<00:01:19.780> we<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:20.860> tomatoes

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
and it is not stopping we have tomatoes

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.530 
and it is not stopping we have tomatoes
all<00:01:21.430> over<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> place<00:01:21.850> wherever<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.329> look

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
all over the place wherever you look

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.179 
all over the place wherever you look
there<00:01:22.810> would<00:01:22.960> be<00:01:22.990> some<00:01:23.320> small<00:01:23.740> ones<00:01:23.890> growing

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
there would be some small ones growing

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.950 
there would be some small ones growing
and<00:01:24.909> apparently<00:01:25.390> it's<00:01:25.540> growing<00:01:25.720> like

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
and apparently it's growing like

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.530 
and apparently it's growing like
clusters<00:01:26.680> as<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.070> can<00:01:27.250> see<00:01:27.430> here<00:01:27.850> those

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
clusters as you can see here those

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.450 
clusters as you can see here those
little<00:01:31.540> benches<00:01:31.899> here<00:01:32.200> those<00:01:32.860> are<00:01:33.100> clusters

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
little benches here those are clusters

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.789 
little benches here those are clusters
of<00:01:33.610> tomatoes<00:01:34.119> are<00:01:34.270> growing<00:01:34.600> as<00:01:34.780> well<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.290> then

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
of tomatoes are growing as well and then

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.440 
of tomatoes are growing as well and then
we<00:01:35.950> have<00:01:36.130> red<00:01:36.460> around<00:01:36.790> so<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.060> can<00:01:37.180> see<00:01:37.270> some

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
we have red around so you can see some

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.639 
we have red around so you can see some
of<00:01:37.479> them<00:01:37.689> are<00:01:37.869> ready<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.200> pick<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.530> we're

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
of them are ready to pick and we're

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:39.870 
of them are ready to pick and we're
probably<00:01:38.829> going<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.130> be<00:01:39.220> doing<00:01:39.399> that<00:01:39.670> today

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
probably going to be doing that today

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.160 
probably going to be doing that today

was just a bad tomato because it was

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.100 
was just a bad tomato because it was
very<00:02:28.800> slow<00:02:29.040> growing<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:30.240> didn't<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.660> well<00:02:30.870> at

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
very slow growing it didn't do well at
