00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:08.109
 There were two blessings to the Chinese people. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.290
 It's called Buddhism in China. 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.390
 Political turmoil continues. The country is divided. 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:19.630
 Buddhism plunges in earnest in Chinese history 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:23.470
 On the occasion of the Opium War that took place in 1840 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:29.230
 Specs will wash completely 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:33.010
 To learn quickly without the Western-length save the nation from now when something 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:39.399
 I started learning Western ideas. 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:43.989
 In Western philosophy , the philosophy of 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:48.789
 Where did Nozah save the philosophical site? 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:54.579
 In the natural yiraeyo confirmed by jjyon experience in intellectual history Specifications 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:01:00.690
 When I opened up the modern world, I came down to the world with a worldview or experience. 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.690
 The modern philosopher Nozai can feel this secret plot. 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.329
 haha 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.780
 Aggression 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.120
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.180
 Yesterday compares East and West in starch time 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:44.270
 The reason for comparing modern and modern is 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:50.869
 To clarify what the characteristics of the Anonymous philosophy are . 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.810
 That philosopher, because unprotected in front of various companies also like the Lao 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.380
 So rarely so. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.360
 In what context is the philosophy of Nozai 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:07.969
 I also want to make it clear that there is a structure. 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:14.090
 Bc've had a long talk Uh 500,000 years ago, which stopped in here yet 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:17.900
 I am doing such a tedious task to compare the incense direction 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.980
 Mm 2 The Opium War story 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:29.060
 And again, we talked about Buddhism. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 Oh, on second thought now I am going to go back and still ended up talking a fairly large 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.549
 Uh, it's a pretty big story. 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:42.500
 It was so much without thinking of it 4 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.670
 Oh, what should I say for a few months with only one topic coming out? 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.859
 They are 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:53.430
 It almost took us about an hour or so in a short time 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:56.060
 Well, we all feel like a big accomplishment. 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.640
 4 The 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.599
 Yeah, now that I'm talking first, yes. 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.090
 Oriental philosophy is a discipline itself. 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:14.200
 I'll give it to you. 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:20.769
 A boom of Oriental evil in the East 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:24.900
 The Oriental evil boom in the direction from the direction was actually started in the Orient 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.900
 I actually started in the West 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.920
 Hey, even before the time lived a life where I resolved 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:40.849
 The West had a lot of interest in Oriental, especially China. 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.560
 But then, as a heterogeneous other with a mysterious number that is too different from the cleansing 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.430
 It was the Orient. 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:53.510
 But this time now this happened sector 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:57.409
 Thoroughly, the people in section 3 have some of their own 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.750
 Are they all have 1 or more, then new breakthrough in 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:05.100
 Why is it so important to be able to find out what kind of wisdom it is related to? 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.610
 Because of 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:13.800
 What I've Leibniz then solved when a party 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.430
 Specifics People's interest in trends evolved qualitatively differently 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.810
 I have it 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.430
 character 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:29.000
 Shine people 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:31.940
 That is that until very recently that capitalism quite reasonable and remove one 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.070
 I saw that it was the pinnacle of beauty. 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:44.509
 So capitalism developed, but it did not develop. 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:47.060
 People the world of sex rational approach maturity of some of its rationality, its society 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:51.979
 It's possible. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:56.120
 So , you know the sociologist Max Weber. 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:05:01.460
 Fake Chinese or Indian 5 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:07.190
 The reason why capitalism did not develop in Judea 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:12.500
 It is because of two Christian ethics that Protestantism that to do so now 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:18.500
 So did talk of rationality which the Western people have that they 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.580
 Because they are developing well candle capitalism, they are fairly rational 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:27.470
 Social High 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:30.440
 I thought I had a rational philosophy, but suddenly in Asia 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.310
 Uh-huh . Every dragon was born. 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:38.310
 But this 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:42.720
 The economic development of Asia seems quite unfamiliar to Westerners 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:46.580
 How are you going in a society without Christian ethics 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.610
 Does the rat mouse appear so quickly? 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:56.270
 It's not just about capitalism. 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:59.330
 In the West, yet the teeth 7 have already been phloem but the philosophy is reached a limit 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:04.790
 The transplant was fairly strong. 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:10.350
 In a situation where it is becoming stronger that philosophical limitations have been reached , 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:14.520
 We are making economic development in the Orient with other cars. 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:20.639
 Yeah, specs, people actually look at this as a surprise. 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:26.519
 In fact, what kind of new competitors do they have in mind ? 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:32.789
 And if you go back a little bit of history, 

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:35.039
 It took a period not so long But now the good jockey period gilrian 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:39.149
 I remember that memory well. 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:43.889
 The economies in the East occupied 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:49.379
 At this time, the now western people now began to have interest in this trend 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.609
 It is now going to be the same moment that the Oriental baby has come into being worldwide 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:55.289
 Will 

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:57.860
 Now these people are now focusing on Confucian Concentration Jack here now 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.860
 I got it.
