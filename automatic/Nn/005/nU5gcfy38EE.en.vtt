00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
then just do it again it's kind of a

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.840 
then just do it again it's kind of a
pain<00:05:28.910> in<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.060> ass<00:05:29.300> getting<00:05:29.990> told<00:05:30.200> no<00:05:30.320> but<00:05:30.850> that

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
pain in the ass getting told no but that

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.400
