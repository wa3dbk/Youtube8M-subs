 You will stay close and then he will not 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.800
 I agree 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.840
 I was always looking down 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.060
 travadinha I can not think now some 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.180
 computer thing you will mark the option 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.230
 client server is near 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.360
 leave pattern is why it is standard but it is 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.560
 the pattern is close 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.180
 here it was here i recommend it so lets 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.100
 but if you have there in the other 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.920
 installation in the case citation has 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.680
 changed the directory is to change the 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.750
 location where you are installed you change here 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.880
 it is also that they seek change 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.060
 but in my case I did not change anything then 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.350
 it is in the standard what was installed beauty 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.350
 click on install made you wait 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.670
 below some things before installing 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:48.170
 okay is very quick installation because eta 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:52.710
 except some modification is not a 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:55.410
 it 's not something that can explain is not something 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.660
 too heavy for even the heavy even 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.120
 servers that have one night by the way already 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.700
 told you to download the files 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.960
 heavy times depending I will close the 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.960
 google chrome for not weighing too much 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.420
 I think I'll take a whack at 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.740
 video here paulo because it's taking so long 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.660
 enough already and now I'm back to 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.060
 I'm almost finished installing it 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.470
 finished when the installation is complete 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:31.430
 left the option to run mt at a 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.990

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.130
 opening a window appears in this story 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.700
 is smaller because I'm recording and 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:58.340
 it probably was not going to show 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:01.520
