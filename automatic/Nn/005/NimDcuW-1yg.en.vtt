here<00:03:39.030> now<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.959> actually<00:03:40.140> use<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> little<00:03:40.739> bit

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
here now I actually use a little bit

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.530 
here now I actually use a little bit
more<00:03:40.860> than<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.280> cup<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.579> cheese<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:41.970> total<00:03:42.360> here

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.130 
because I like lots of cheese and I
could<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:44.670> again<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.239> would<00:03:45.299> put<00:03:45.659> even

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
could do this again I would put even

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.250 
could do this again I would put even
more<00:03:46.170> cheese<00:03:46.650> than<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:46.980> did<00:03:47.870> because<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.019> find

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
more cheese than I did because I find

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.380 
more cheese than I did because I find
the<00:03:49.349> top<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.950> lasagna<00:03:50.610> noodles<00:03:50.909> get<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> bit

the top so the lasagna noodles get a bit

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.869 
the top so the lasagna noodles get a bit
dry

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879
