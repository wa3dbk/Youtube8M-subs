00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
juggernauts juggernauts I as you might

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.870 
juggernauts juggernauts I as you might
know<00:06:51.940> I'm<00:06:52.270> making<00:06:52.600> five<00:06:52.870> of<00:06:53.170> these<00:06:53.290> guys<00:06:53.590> now

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
know I'm making five of these guys now

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.440 
know I'm making five of these guys now
these<00:06:55.450> take<00:06:55.950> so<00:06:56.950> much<00:06:57.160> time<00:06:57.550> and<00:06:57.730> effort<00:06:58.120> to<00:06:58.270> do

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
these take so much time and effort to do

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.620 
these take so much time and effort to do
it<00:06:59.170> is<00:06:59.410> crazy<00:06:59.890> time<00:07:00.340> now<00:07:01.180> that<00:07:01.210> might<00:07:01.600> be

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
it is crazy time now that might be

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.900 
it is crazy time now that might be
pretty<00:07:01.900> expensive<00:07:02.320> that's<00:07:02.710> because<00:07:03.100> I'm<00:07:03.340> hand

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
pretty expensive that's because I'm hand

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.720 
pretty expensive that's because I'm hand
sanding<00:07:04.660> this<00:07:04.960> hand<00:07:05.890> painting<00:07:06.160> it<00:07:06.370> I<00:07:06.490> probably

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
sanding this hand painting it I probably

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.600 
sanding this hand painting it I probably
have<00:07:06.970> to<00:07:07.120> use<00:07:07.150> up<00:07:07.570> probably<00:07:08.500> about<00:07:08.890> just<00:07:09.430> for

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
have to use up probably about just for

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.980 
have to use up probably about just for
all<00:07:09.790> these<00:07:09.940> juggernauts<00:07:10.390> probably<00:07:10.750> one

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
all these juggernauts probably one

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.770 
all these juggernauts probably one
little<00:07:11.560> thing<00:07:11.740> of<00:07:11.860> testers<00:07:12.280> dark<00:07:13.120> gray<00:07:13.360> paint

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
little thing of testers dark gray paint

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.080 
little thing of testers dark gray paint
to<00:07:14.350> paint<00:07:14.500> all<00:07:14.710> this<00:07:14.860> armor<00:07:15.100> and<00:07:15.730> I<00:07:15.850> have<00:07:15.970> to

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
to paint all this armor and I have to

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.390 
to paint all this armor and I have to
custom<00:07:16.540> glue<00:07:16.840> I<00:07:16.870> have<00:07:17.200> to<00:07:17.380> paint<00:07:17.740> I<00:07:18.010> have<00:07:18.160> to

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
custom glue I have to paint I have to

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.940 
custom glue I have to paint I have to
sand<00:07:18.730> all<00:07:19.540> that<00:07:19.930> takes<00:07:20.260> someone<00:07:20.590> shot<00:07:20.740> I<00:07:20.800> have

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:20.950 
sand all that takes someone shot I have

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.250 
sand all that takes someone shot I have
to<00:07:21.040> custom<00:07:21.370> mold<00:07:21.610> these<00:07:21.790> kneepads<00:07:22.420> all<00:07:22.840> that

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:23.260 
to custom mold these kneepads all that

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.500 
to custom mold these kneepads all that
takes<00:07:23.500> time<00:07:23.830> and<00:07:24.280> it<00:07:25.000> would<00:07:25.120> be<00:07:25.240> really

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
takes time and it would be really

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.980 
takes time and it would be really
expensive<00:07:25.900> but<00:07:27.540> therefore<00:07:28.540> I'm<00:07:28.750> probably

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
expensive but therefore I'm probably

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.080 
expensive but therefore I'm probably
only<00:07:29.200> going<00:07:29.350> to<00:07:29.530> make<00:07:29.650> five<00:07:29.980> ever<00:07:30.370> so<00:07:30.850> if<00:07:30.970> you

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.090 
only going to make five ever so if you

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.100 
only going to make five ever so if you
want<00:07:31.240> to<00:07:31.300> pick<00:07:31.450> these<00:07:31.540> up<00:07:31.720> they'll<00:07:31.930> probably

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110 
want to pick these up they'll probably

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.860 
want to pick these up they'll probably
go<00:07:32.350> up<00:07:32.530> in<00:07:32.680> value<00:07:32.710> because<00:07:33.240> they're<00:07:34.240> just<00:07:34.480> the

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
go up in value because they're just the

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.800 
go up in value because they're just the
cool<00:07:35.140> figure<00:07:35.710> I<00:07:35.740> have<00:07:35.950> to<00:07:35.980> say<00:07:36.250> so<00:07:36.600> again<00:07:37.600> it

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:37.810 
cool figure I have to say so again it

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.600 
cool figure I have to say so again it
would<00:07:37.960> look<00:07:38.140> a<00:07:38.230> lot<00:07:38.380> cleaner<00:07:38.560> like<00:07:39.190> this<00:07:39.220> was

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
would look a lot cleaner like this was

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.430 
would look a lot cleaner like this was
my<00:07:39.760> first<00:07:40.030> try<00:07:40.390> so<00:07:40.840> it<00:07:41.020> would<00:07:41.140> look<00:07:41.260> a<00:07:41.320> lot

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 
my first try so it would look a lot

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.490 
my first try so it would look a lot
better<00:07:41.500> but<00:07:42.100> yeah<00:07:42.850> so<00:07:43.420> that's<00:07:43.810> pretty<00:07:44.110> much<00:07:44.260> it

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.500 
better but yeah so that's pretty much it

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.260 
better but yeah so that's pretty much it
