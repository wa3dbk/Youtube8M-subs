00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.540
 right in the heart of Verona in the middle 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.670
 street between piazza herbs square bra ie 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 short and flour and here in the pizzeria 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 court flour today host us francesco 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.970
 and claudia that in addition to a great pizza 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.010
 they also make their own cooking recipes 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.689
 Mediterranean today as you have prepared 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.290
 claudio agli were prepared gods 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.300
 scialatielli with friarielli 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.190
 scialatielli and friarielli are almost one 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.590
 tongue twisters are not ours 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.079
 cooking because they come from the south 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.289
 precisely from Naples the pasta is one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.719
 durum wheat pasta fresh pasta that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.760
 it resembles a bit of short spaghetti if 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 we had to transport it to our area 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.510
 it would be similar to a beagle but those 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 I am an egg pasta this one not 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 it is egg pasta and durum wheat pasta 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.149
 which is seasoned with the broccoli that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 they are practically turnip greens that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.049
 still have to germinate as it does a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.720
 claudia prepare them for their i 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.670
 clean geo broccoli boiled in water 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.850
 lightly salted I sautéed 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 garlic oil garlic anchovies po di 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.270
 chili pepper and some tomatoes I made 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.979
 put in friarielli in the pan 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.360
 sautéed in the cooking water of the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.659
 trl or put the pasta to cook 56 minutes 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.509
 cooking is drained and thrown all a 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.740
 saute sispa of the whole and we have 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.810
 put some toast which is called the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.299
 poor cheese and this is it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.759
 beautiful to add to the end of 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.430
 flat because it is simply bread 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.649
 grated toasted with just barely one 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.119
 some oil in a non-stick pan but 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.219
 something else we have to say about this 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.380
 recipe for example the broccoli are 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.840
 very young turnip tops indeed 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.690
 we hardly even have the flower for 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.920
 choose them 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.600
 nor should we look precisely at that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.610
 the inflorescence is very green very much 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.140
 small and that has not begun to 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.120
 take a yellow tinge because 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.980
 otherwise it would be witnessed by 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.030
 beginning of unification and the product 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.670
 it would be hard 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.590
 another thing to use the stem if that 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.480
 the knife does not yield so you can hear a 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.580
 bit hard could only be due 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.710
 to the surface of the stem which can be 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.180
 peeled and the heart can be kept 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.790
 which instead is always very soft 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.800
 another important thing to evaluate i 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.900
 cherry tomatoes cherry tomatoes they have in 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.270
 this moment really tastes 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.120
 particular because they are very good 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.430
 despite we say we are not 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.960
 still in the summer season but the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.570
 southern are right now 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.040
 products in large quantities and also are 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.720
 very good and remember that under the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.640
 item there are so many nutrients 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.440
 very useful in our body 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.840
 here is that this recipe mind mind 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.030
 perfectly understands with the fibers the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.980
 vegetable pasta then starches 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.990
 present in the dish and also that bit of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.390
 animal proteins that they are 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.670
 given by the anchovies that give precisely a 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.680
 remarkable taste for which one can also 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.020
 avoid excessively water wages 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.000
 of salts sauce powder in salt comes to us 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.040
 already from the anchovies we remember how 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.500
 we are trying to lower the quantity 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.910
 of sodium chloride which is present on the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.010
 Our table showing all 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.050
 days in our diet 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.670
 finally it takes the right wine or 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.220
 what we put ourselves for this dish 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.940
 together we put a bardolino of the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.010
 our area 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.200
 therefore we remain in the area with the bardolino 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.360
 which is not too strong yes 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.680
 company perfectly with this 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.540
 vegetable dish but as always 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.239
 remember to keep on your table 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.950
 the water but above all not only of 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.350
 keep it on your table but also of 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.150
 drink it also during the day because it is 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.660
 essential for our body to 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.660
 our food
