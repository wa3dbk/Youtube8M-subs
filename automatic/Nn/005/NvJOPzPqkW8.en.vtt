00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
often as they are right but the funny

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
often as they are right but the funny
thing<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.320> people<00:00:28.349> rarely<00:00:28.949> wonder<00:00:29.519> what

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
thing is that people rarely wonder what

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
thing is that people rarely wonder what
a<00:00:30.060> star<00:00:30.480> sign<00:00:30.779> really<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
a star sign really is if you see a

figure now from any other point in space

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
figure now from any other point in space
they<00:00:53.640> look<00:00:53.820> nothing<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.600> figure<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
they look nothing like this figure and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
they look nothing like this figure and
are<00:00:55.469> no<00:00:55.590> relation<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> each<00:00:56.340> other<00:00:56.579> whatsoever

space<00:01:14.580> facts<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:15.270> here's<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:15.960> light<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
space facts well here's one light has a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.890 
space facts well here's one light has a
finite<00:01:17.280> speed<00:01:17.700> right<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> takes<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.750> certain

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
finite speed right so it takes a certain

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.870 
finite speed right so it takes a certain
amount<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.350> time<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.950> from<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.340> place<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
at the Sun you're looking at the Sun

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
at the Sun you're looking at the Sun
from<00:01:24.270> 7-8<00:01:24.750> minutes<00:01:24.990> ago<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.650> mean<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
from 7-8 minutes ago I mean look at the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.740 
from 7-8 minutes ago I mean look at the
stars<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> could<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.970> looking<00:01:27.119> millions<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
stars you could be looking millions of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
stars you could be looking millions of
years<00:01:27.960> into<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> past<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.220> means

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
years into the past what this also means

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.429 
years into the past what this also means
is<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.090> nothing<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.750> faster<00:01:30.780> than

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
is that if nothing can go faster than

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.399 
is that if nothing can go faster than
light<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.220> say<00:01:32.490> 25<00:01:33.420> years<00:01:33.720> old<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
light and you are say 25 years old that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.010 
light and you are say 25 years old that
you<00:01:34.530> technically<00:01:35.070> only<00:01:35.369> exist<00:01:35.880> within<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.390> 25

scam well my guess would be that you
need<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:14.550> gullible<00:02:14.910> people<00:02:15.330> people<00:02:15.780> that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
need very gullible people people that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.410 
need very gullible people people that
are<00:02:16.110> either<00:02:16.350> scan<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.370> actually<00:02:17.880> go<00:02:18.060> as<00:02:18.120> far<00:02:18.390> as

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
are either scan to actually go as far as

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.970 
are either scan to actually go as far as
to<00:02:18.540> take<00:02:18.780> their<00:02:18.990> money<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.410> why<00:02:19.530> does<00:02:19.650> filter

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
to take their money so why does filter

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.440 
to take their money so why does filter
from<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> start<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.670> make<00:02:20.850> sure<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.300> her

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
from the start and make sure to do her

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.120 
from the start and make sure to do her
the<00:02:21.540> only<00:02:21.720> people<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.500> target<00:02:22.950> because

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the only people that you target because

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.070 
the only people that you target because
other<00:02:23.370> people<00:02:23.700> falling<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.300> those<00:02:24.450> males<00:02:24.690> or

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
other people falling for those males or

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.810 
other people falling for those males or
precisely<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.950> people<00:02:26.250> they<00:02:26.370> want<00:02:26.580> at<00:02:26.790> least

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.190 
precisely the people they want at least
that's<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.330> imagine<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.810> reason<00:02:28.080> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
that's what I imagine the reason is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.080 
that's what I imagine the reason is
because<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.770> know<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.190> decided<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.700> when

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
because you know I decided that when

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.540 
because you know I decided that when
people<00:02:30.240> writing<00:02:30.690> these<00:02:30.780> males<00:02:31.080> are<00:02:31.459> kind<00:02:32.459> of

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
people writing these males are kind of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.130 
people writing these males are kind of
retarded<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.450> kind<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.720> all<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> have
