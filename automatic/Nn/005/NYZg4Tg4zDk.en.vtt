anything else there's this little voice
in<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.340> back<00:00:54.520> of<00:00:54.550> my<00:00:54.760> head<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.060> keep<00:00:55.180> saying

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
in the back of my head to keep saying

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.600 
in the back of my head to keep saying

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
look at the mirror Matt look at the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.880 
look at the mirror Matt look at the
mirror<00:00:58.470> well<00:00:59.470> one<00:00:59.770> of<00:00:59.890> those<00:00:59.950> times<00:01:00.310> was<00:01:00.550> me

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
mirror well one of those times was me

mirror well one of those times was me
nevertheless<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:03.340> decided<00:01:03.670> not<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.880> look<00:01:04.089> in

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
nevertheless I decided not to look in

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.970 
nevertheless I decided not to look in
the<00:01:04.270> mirror<00:01:04.300> for<00:01:04.660> a<00:01:04.720> whole<00:01:04.809> week<00:01:05.020> so<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.830> keep

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
the mirror for a whole week so to keep

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.380 
the mirror for a whole week so to keep
my<00:01:06.100> mind<00:01:06.310> off<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.730> I've<00:01:06.790> decided<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.150> clean<00:01:07.330> up

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
my mind off and I've decided to clean up

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.940 
my mind off and I've decided to clean up
your<00:01:07.450> tools<00:01:07.630> man<00:01:07.810> man<00:01:08.290> I<00:01:08.320> was<00:01:08.530> only<00:01:08.680> joking

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
your tools man man I was only joking

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.490 
your tools man man I was only joking
before<00:01:09.280> perhaps<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:10.810> maybe<00:01:10.960> see<00:01:11.140> my<00:01:11.260> problem

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
before perhaps we maybe see my problem

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.440 
before perhaps we maybe see my problem
and<00:01:11.770> behind<00:01:12.010> every<00:01:12.190> joke<00:01:12.580> there's<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.210> kernel

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
and behind every joke there's a kernel

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.100 
and behind every joke there's a kernel
of<00:01:13.630> truth

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
of truth

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:25.140 
of truth
so<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:22.150> is<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.979> kernel<00:01:24.340> tooth<00:01:24.610> that's<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.940> great

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
so it is the kernel tooth that's a great

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.870 
so it is the kernel tooth that's a great
expression<00:01:25.479> now<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.260> remember<00:01:26.619> that<00:01:26.920> kernel

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
expression now to remember that kernel

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.780 
expression now to remember that kernel
of<00:01:28.150> truth<00:01:31.920> hey<00:01:32.920> Matt<00:01:33.100> what's<00:01:33.280> up<00:01:33.340> buddy<00:01:33.550> hey
