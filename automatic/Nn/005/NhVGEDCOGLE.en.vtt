00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.859 
sure that that's in there and centered
before<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.310> actually<00:01:52.490> punch<00:01:52.909> into<00:01:53.210> punch

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
before I actually punch into punch

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.289 
before I actually punch into punch
you<00:01:54.470> just<00:01:55.030> twist<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.509> handle<00:01:56.960> clockwise<00:01:58.299> and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
you just twist the handle clockwise and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.090 
you just twist the handle clockwise and
it<00:01:59.420> does<00:01:59.570> not<00:01:59.810> take<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.140> lot<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.409> strength<00:02:00.740> at

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
it does not take a lot of strength at

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.999 
it does not take a lot of strength at
all<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:02.060> unscrew<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:03.229> release<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.799> you

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
all and to unscrew to release it you

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.240 
all and to unscrew to release it you
just<00:02:04.220> go<00:02:04.369> counterclockwise

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
just go counterclockwise

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.590 
just go counterclockwise
so<00:02:06.790> now<00:02:06.970> I've<00:02:07.450> got<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.660> hole<00:02:07.960> in<00:02:08.200> my<00:02:08.350> flower<00:02:08.710> and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
so now I've got a hole in my flower and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.700 
so now I've got a hole in my flower and

going to line it up with my other

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.450 
going to line it up with my other
earring<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.750> I've<00:02:13.810> already<00:02:13.990> created

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
earring that I've already created

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.760 
earring that I've already created
because<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.520> want<00:02:15.670> them<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:15.970> even<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
because I want them to be even and that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.110 
because I want them to be even and that
looks<00:02:17.980> about<00:02:18.100> even<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.670> me<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:18.910> I'm<00:02:18.970> going<00:02:19.090> to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
looks about even to me so I'm going to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.550 
looks about even to me so I'm going to
take<00:02:19.240> my<00:02:19.420> pin<00:02:20.010> hold<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.310> place<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.900> now<00:02:23.140> to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
take my pin hold it in place and now to

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.020 
take my pin hold it in place and now to
make<00:02:23.680> sure<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:24.010> see<00:02:24.220> my<00:02:24.370> mark<00:02:24.580> I'm<00:02:24.790> going<00:02:24.910> to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
make sure I can see my mark I'm going to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.700 
make sure I can see my mark I'm going to
swirl<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:26.050> bit<00:02:26.200> because

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
swirl it just a little bit because

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.240 
swirl it just a little bit because
that's<00:02:26.830> gonna<00:02:26.980> be<00:02:27.160> covered<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:30.040> could<00:02:30.190> be

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
that's gonna be covered it could be

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.850 
that's gonna be covered it could be
really<00:02:30.610> hard<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.320> do<00:02:32.380> see<00:02:32.710> this

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
really hard to see but I do see this

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.210 
really hard to see but I do see this
right<00:02:33.100> there<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.380> want<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.620> use<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:35.740> sharpie

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
right there if you want to use a sharpie

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.740 
right there if you want to use a sharpie
marker<00:02:36.250> or<00:02:36.670> something<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.120> can<00:02:37.300> do<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.600> it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
marker or something you can do that it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.470 
marker or something you can do that it
might<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> little<00:02:38.110> easier<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:39.480> goes

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
might be a little easier to see goes

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.880 
might be a little easier to see goes
right<00:02:40.900> there<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.410> that's<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.800> be

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
right there and that's going to be

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.620 
right there and that's going to be
perfect<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.520> now<00:02:43.030> I'm<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.240> take<00:02:43.450> this

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
perfect so now I'm going to take this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.770 
perfect so now I'm going to take this
piece<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:45.030> really<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.600> kind

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
piece and really you have to just kind

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.020 
piece and really you have to just kind
of<00:02:46.810> be<00:02:47.410> careful<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.040> look<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.910> be<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
of be careful and look at this to be a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.449 
of be careful and look at this to be a
little<00:02:49.240> easier<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.600> screw<00:02:49.840> down<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.380> tip<00:02:50.650> so

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
little easier to screw down the tip so

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.680 
little easier to screw down the tip so
that's<00:02:51.580> almost<00:02:52.030> ready<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.330> touch<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.600> blank

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
that's almost ready to touch the blank

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.720 
that's almost ready to touch the blank
and<00:02:55.690> then<00:02:56.020> scoot<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.590> on<00:02:56.740> in<00:02:59.459> it's<00:03:00.459> probably

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and then scoot it on in it's probably

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.690 
and then scoot it on in it's probably
hard<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.150> see<00:03:01.300> on<00:03:02.020> camera<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.310> am<00:03:03.430> just

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
hard to see on camera but I am just

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.670 
hard to see on camera but I am just
going<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:07.000> grip<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.320> not<00:03:08.440> going<00:03:08.620> to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
going to grip it but I'm not going to

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.759 
going to grip it but I'm not going to
punch<00:03:08.860> it

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
punch it

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.870 
punch it
but<00:03:11.769> grip<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.070> enough<00:03:12.310> they<00:03:12.430> can<00:03:12.610> move<00:03:12.730> it

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
but grip it enough they can move it

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:23.179 
but grip it enough they can move it
around<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:17.050> see<00:03:17.230> them<00:03:17.410> right<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.860> my<00:03:18.040> dot

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.819 

that<00:03:24.189> looks<00:03:24.430> good<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.879> me

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
that looks good to me

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.970 
that looks good to me
and<00:03:26.829> I'm<00:03:27.069> going<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.459> punch<00:03:27.790> through<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:29.650> like

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
and I'm going to punch through just like

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.759 
and I'm going to punch through just like
that<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.340> was<00:03:30.430> very<00:03:30.610> easy<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:34.709> now<00:03:35.709> to

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that it was very easy to do now to

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.100 
that it was very easy to do now to
connect<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.250> two<00:03:36.400> pieces<00:03:36.819> together<00:03:37.110> I'm

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
connect the two pieces together I'm

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.679 
connect the two pieces together I'm
going<00:03:38.379> to<00:03:38.500> take<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.709> screw<00:03:39.120> put<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.239> through<00:03:40.480> the

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
going to take a screw put it through the

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:47.130 
going to take a screw put it through the
flower<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.819> also<00:03:42.870> through<00:03:43.870> my<00:03:44.019> blank<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:47.019> now

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
flower and also through my blank and now

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.059 
flower and also through my blank and now
we<00:03:47.200> want<00:03:47.409> to<00:03:47.470> screw<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.920> nut<00:03:48.129> onto<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.609> back

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.140 

and<00:03:54.069> we're<00:03:54.190> just<00:03:54.220> going<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.519> screw<00:03:54.970> it<00:03:55.000> down

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
and we're just going to screw it down

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.360 
and we're just going to screw it down
now<00:03:55.389> you<00:03:55.450> see<00:03:55.720> I'm<00:03:55.840> actually<00:03:56.230> pressing<00:03:56.889> the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
now you see I'm actually pressing the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.879 
now you see I'm actually pressing the
two<00:03:57.549> pieces<00:03:57.879> together<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.720> screw<00:03:59.049> so<00:03:59.739> I'm

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
two pieces together and the screw so I'm

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.210 
two pieces together and the screw so I'm
trying<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.340> hold<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.760> actual<00:04:00.909> screw<00:04:01.420> steady

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
trying to hold the actual screw steady

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.339 
trying to hold the actual screw steady
as<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.400> wind<00:04:03.639> this<00:04:03.879> down<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.930> want<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.200> make

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
as I wind this down and you want to make
