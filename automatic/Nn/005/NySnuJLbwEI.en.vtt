00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello, I'm alfonso, we're more 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.709
 known as the former world champion of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.230
 fifa 12 and here I bring you some tips 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.790
 to improve your game this time 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.790
 I want to explain how to defend 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.290
 centers and how to defend the corners in 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.630
 how to defend the centers before 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.360
 start we can also put the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.090
 air values 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.250
 what people usually do wrong and I 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.930
 I did wrong at the time is that we have 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.910
 a lot of session to squeeze the X always 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.530
 where the X the player more than 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.540
 despejan tries to give a pass with the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.490
 head with which it is very feasible that 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.059
 is the dead ball goes to the opponent and we 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.440
 I ended up scoring a goal. My advice is 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.989
 a way that I use a lot and how 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.610
 you can see if you see the end of afju like 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.860
 cleared all the aerial colors is very 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.750
 difficult to be on a goal occasion what 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.770
 what we would do would be with the player 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.570
 selected when the opponent center 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.790
 we will press the sprint button plus the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.560
 button to clear in my case circle and 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.840
 with this the player would go with more impetus 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.059
 and force the ball what would make 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.130
 take to decide some way by 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.780
 in front of the other player or with more 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.450
 force and abort that occasion of 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.729
 danger 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.250
 then complementarily this 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.620
 We talk about cuts as the sega 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.110
 goalie 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.080
 I have some imaginary lines of 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.160
 area in defense the goalie could 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.810
 take as limits until the clubs until 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.470
 the first stick and the second stick never 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.750
 beyond and to a limited point 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.600
 between the penalty spot and the area 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.310
 small that point would be pretty much a 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.630
 fourth one third of the distance of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 penalty point was small 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.630
 we could only get this the goalkeeper and 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.630
 until the two clubs, given that if 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.410
 we get more and if we take it out very 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.690
 crazy 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.210
 the goalkeeper will not arrive they will close the exit 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.670
 and that costs us normal 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.200
 I hope you have served these 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.119
 indications on how to defend 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.850
 centers and we see ourselves playing about 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.000
 matches on the lv.es page up 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.000
 then
