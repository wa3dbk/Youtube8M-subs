00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.160
 Hello everyone today received such 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.160
 let's see the package inside 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.920
 so inside quadcopter is some kind of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.810
 new model and desperate 3d x4 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.490
 very interesting quadrocopter as soon as 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 I saw on the bank de advertising this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.060
 I immediately wanted it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 order so what 's all the same 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.289
 the uniqueness of this model looks like it is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.210
 the first quadcopter who can fly 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910
 to believe in that is we start it with the screws 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
 up and then turn the screws 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 to the bottom of the flight is likely to continue 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.570
 air motors will have to shut down and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.940
 will start to rotate in the other direction 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.940
 and so see what is in the box 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:59.390
 here he is handsome what a very small 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.320
 lay aside dimensions while i'm away 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 let's see what he has in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.420
 complete by the way a little background I 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.280
 chan is the own brand of wangu yes then 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 There is on other stores mostly this 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.570
 products do not find so look at 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.509
 complete set standard charger 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.670
 the device is such a little white connector 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.270
 I do not advise to leave unattended this 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 exercise 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 two kinds of sticks are sharp and there are 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.400
 such are pretty sticky sticks of course i 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 I advise you to use sharp stacks with 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.350
 they can have more control 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.509
 quadcopter equipment small 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 There is no size of antenna by the way . 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 principle for such models it is not for us 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.990
 it is strongly necessary to complete four 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.329
 spare screws with that they have here 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 such a thick profile is likely he 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.680
 need to be able 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.670
 stop and restart correctly 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 motors in the air 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 This is the construction we will see 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.090
 what I have with the right button on 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 the instrument can flip with 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.710
 using these three buttons you can 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.540
 switch expenses 2060 one hundred percent with 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.790
 right side of us to there is a button which 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.770
 turn on turn on the lights and until I 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.840
 I see no information about how everything 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.480
 Still it is interesting to translate it into 3d mode 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.180
 maybe this class is not flip and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.260
 perform and goes into 3d mode by 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.740
 pressing this button 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.290
 adjusted to the side and move on to 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.910
 inspection of the quadric itself, he has such 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.100
 average size you can compare it with 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.200
 such quadcopters as jersey thousands 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.530
 and get riddy 022 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.460
 it is powered by a standard battery 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.880
 capacity of 300 milliamps per hour has 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.000
 33 grams is pretty low 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.350
 weight for model of this size 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.520
 I install the battery and produce 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.830
 first switching on the bottom of us 4 LEDs 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.650
 two red at the back and two blue at the front 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.270
 no more LEDs on this model 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.620
 not 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.540
 I'll try to remove the top cover after all 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.270
 There are two more LEDs on the board 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.840
 front Here we have this board in bike 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.940
 principle normal for quadcopter for 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.550
 30 dollars but from time to time all the same 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.530
 I advise you to remove the cover and watch 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.480
 how are your wires soldered because 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.640
 quadcopter is such a model which 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.980
 falls and from this can easily be afraid 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.390
 some contacts 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.580
 set the cover back let's go to 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.970
 the equipment is powered by 4 fingers 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.630
 The battery has such a small 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.630
 crank 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.390
 perform standard unlocking 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.900
 motors and try a little twist 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.900
 motors 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.700
 Quad pretty cutting even at minimal 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.530
 expenses 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.970
 imagine what we will do on 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.780
 one hundredth expenditure is an interesting model of course 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.540
 so it turns on and off 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.850
 backlight from the remote and now try 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.970
 how this quadcopter flies in 3d 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.970
 mode 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.000
 now it takes off normally and 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.320
 now its just turning over and 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.970
 quadrics continues to fly face 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.610
 interesting of course it turns out possible in 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:08.070
 his gyro automatically switch 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:10.080
 the direction of rotation of the motors will try 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.470
 see which side are spinning now 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:21.990
 motors allow black back screw 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:24.210
 spinning clockwise in such 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:29.370
 mode, he also turns us clockwise 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.290
 the arrow is really a gyroscope 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.150
 automatically switches the rotation 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.280
 motor the other way on the page 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.200
 product I watched flights on this model 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.120
 on the street and he behaves in the air 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.260
 pretty interesting though 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.669
 difference from most standard 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.130
 treasures that only have 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.210
 roll over and return to 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.890
 initial position 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.840
 this quadrocopter with flip 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.090
 turn the screws down and 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.280
 stays in that position until you 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.990
 do another flip in full review i 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.060
 show you how it flies on the street 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.400
 it was unpacking and overview 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.260
 quadrocopter i tea 3d x4 shop 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.510
