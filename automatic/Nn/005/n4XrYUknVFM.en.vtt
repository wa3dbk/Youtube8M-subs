irritation my aggravation away but it's

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.130 
irritation my aggravation away but it's
also<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> give<00:01:30.299> me<00:01:30.420> energy<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> same

also going to give me energy at the same

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.069 
also going to give me energy at the same
time<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.610> what's<00:01:32.850> different<00:01:33.180> about<00:01:33.450> eastern

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
time so what's different about eastern

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.080 
time so what's different about eastern
and<00:01:34.290> western<00:01:34.439> herbology<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.939> they're

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and western herbology is that they're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
and western herbology is that they're
very<00:01:36.119> specific<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> properties<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.950> are

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
very specific on the properties that are

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120 
very specific on the properties that are
created<00:01:38.490> once<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.939> inside<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.799> by<00:01:40.950> taking

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
created once it's inside me so by taking

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
created once it's inside me so by taking
