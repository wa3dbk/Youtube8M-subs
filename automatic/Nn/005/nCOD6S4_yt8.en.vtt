00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
freaking plastic so I I'm hoping that we

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.569 
freaking plastic so I I'm hoping that we
can<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.469> use<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.710> mass<00:00:52.920> rank<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> rip<00:00:53.550> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
can just use some mass rank and rip it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.220 
can just use some mass rank and rip it
like<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.059> did<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> box<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:55.020> cool

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
