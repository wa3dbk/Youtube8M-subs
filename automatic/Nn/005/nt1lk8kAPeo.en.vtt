so<00:00:17.480> this<00:00:17.630> is<00:00:17.750> future<00:00:18.080> I've<00:00:18.200> been<00:00:18.410> dying<00:00:18.710> to

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
so this is future I've been dying to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.680 
so this is future I've been dying to
test<00:00:19.220> ever<00:00:19.580> since<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:20.029> first<00:00:20.270> day<00:00:20.450> I<00:00:20.480> heard

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
test ever since the first day I heard

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.840 
test ever since the first day I heard
about<00:00:20.810> it<00:00:21.080> it's<00:00:21.230> called<00:00:21.500> follow<00:00:22.040> me<00:00:22.369> so

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
about it it's called follow me so

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.080 
about it it's called follow me so
basically<00:00:23.240> it's<00:00:24.020> like<00:00:24.140> incense<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:25.220> airplane

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090

basically it's like incense the airplane
rather<00:00:26.330> than<00:00:26.510> follow<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.900> set<00:00:27.350> of<00:00:27.529> waypoints<00:00:28.100> I

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
rather than follow a set of waypoints I

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.520 
rather than follow a set of waypoints I
can<00:00:28.430> have<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.640> follow<00:00:28.880> me<00:00:29.150> follow<00:00:29.720> this<00:00:29.990> GPS

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
can have it follow me follow this GPS

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.560 
can have it follow me follow this GPS
unit<00:00:30.920> now<00:00:31.400> this<00:00:31.550> is<00:00:31.670> Utes<00:00:31.850> benefits<00:00:32.270> behind

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
unit now this is Utes benefits behind

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.780 
unit now this is Utes benefits behind
this<00:00:32.720> of<00:00:32.930> course<00:00:33.200> you<00:00:33.440> can<00:00:33.739> drag<00:00:34.160> round<00:00:34.460> and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
this of course you can drag round and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.130 
this of course you can drag round and
how<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:34.910> airplane<00:00:35.239> fall<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.570> you<00:00:35.720> can<00:00:35.960> walk

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
how the airplane fall of you can walk

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.360 
how the airplane fall of you can walk
around<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.530> applicant<00:00:36.950> volume<00:00:37.160> that'd<00:00:37.250> be

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
around the applicant volume that'd be

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.400 
around the applicant volume that'd be
awesome<00:00:37.520> but<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.330> big<00:00:38.510> thing<00:00:38.540> about<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.989> USA

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
awesome but the big thing about the USA

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.439 
awesome but the big thing about the USA
trip<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:40.070> what<00:00:40.370> if<00:00:40.489> for<00:00:40.699> some<00:00:40.730> reason<00:00:41.300> the

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
trip is what if for some reason the

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:42.850 
trip is what if for some reason the
waypoints<00:00:41.930> aren't<00:00:42.080> working<00:00:42.379> we've<00:00:42.620> got<00:00:42.770> to

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
waypoints aren't working we've got to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.579 
waypoints aren't working we've got to
change<00:00:43.010> course<00:00:43.370> for<00:00:44.059> some<00:00:44.239> reason<00:00:44.659> could<00:00:45.440> we

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
change course for some reason could we

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.350 
change course for some reason could we
kitchen<00:00:46.010> could<00:00:46.280> be<00:00:46.339> just<00:00:46.550> say<00:00:46.670> follow<00:00:46.970> me<00:00:47.239> and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
kitchen could be just say follow me and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.910 
kitchen could be just say follow me and
the<00:00:47.449> airplane<00:00:47.720> fall<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.140> chase<00:00:48.470> vehicle

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
the airplane fall is the chase vehicle

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.200 
the airplane fall is the chase vehicle
and<00:00:49.280> then<00:00:49.460> that<00:00:49.640> would<00:00:49.790> make<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.030> whole

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
and then that would make that whole

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.969 
and then that would make that whole
process<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.600> lot<00:00:50.690> simpler<00:00:51.080> you<00:00:51.589> know<00:00:51.620> in<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
process a lot simpler you know in the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.469 
process a lot simpler you know in the
event<00:00:52.220> that<00:00:52.280> they<00:00:52.430> need<00:00:52.580> to<00:00:52.610> happen<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.360> let's

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:53.479 
event that they need to happen so let's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:12.109 
event that they need to happen so let's
try<00:00:53.720> it<00:00:53.750> out

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.830 

there<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> far<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.149> looks<00:01:15.179> good<00:01:15.509> looks

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
there it is so far it looks good looks

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.120 
there it is so far it looks good looks
like<00:01:15.929> it's<00:01:16.049> following<00:01:16.380> me<00:01:16.469> just<00:01:16.679> fine

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
like it's following me just fine

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
like it's following me just fine
okay<00:01:17.609> now<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> real<00:01:18.060> test<00:01:18.359> is<00:01:18.679> let's<00:01:19.679> have<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
okay now the real test is let's have to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
okay now the real test is let's have to
track<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> car<00:01:20.460> let's<00:01:20.729> move<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> car<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> now

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
track the car let's move the car so now

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.919 
track the car let's move the car so now
it's<00:01:25.740> updating<00:01:26.069> with<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.219> little<00:01:26.399> green<00:01:26.549> dot
