00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.960
 speaks guys tutorials hh all right 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 You, I'm dependent on the non-channel. 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.210
 wise 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 I'm here to record them try 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.750
 answer some questions about my 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.410
 I work my channel 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 well my question is how to get the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.340
 Channel does not know love you did not know 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 started in 2012 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.570
 When do you approve more to do here? 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.960
 looking for a company and searching there 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.090
 enough and I just got one thing 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.220
 liked the stadium with something that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.220
 It's also very good that the internet there I 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.570
 I started doing curiosity was so 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.920
 Marcelo was born in Canada in 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.050
 video gave more work to be 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 produced good that I remember is movie 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.210
 gave more work until today were two 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.580
 because it was a video of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.370
 five minutes néné edit 25 thousand of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.170
 material gives a lot of inmetro work 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.570
 also worked hard because it was a 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.540
 small and very extensive increased by about 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.810
 of eight days of recording then 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.659
 these two videos that gave more work 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.909
 you can probably see by clicking 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.880
 here or here you can watch the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.609
 video that credits gaza integrated by 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 there for you who should produce more 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.200
 of the band was the same as my imac 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.329
 makeup while I gave it to him 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.159
 I thought I was pulling, it 's cool, I was filming 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.700
 everything is shared with the staff of the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.539
 I went there and travel included the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.579
 is winding 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.500
 I also believe you can stay in the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.829
 and watching the videos of the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:02.009
 text on average takes time to 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.329
 make a channel video with a role 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.340
 also relative 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.000
 usually we search for 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.830
 several weeks and has full support has to 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.500
 record believe around 20 a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.590
 average of three weeks to four hours 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.980
 there is nothing closed nor 31 green time 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:25.100
 in which better than the opinion channel 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.100
 with 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.200
 I really like the video thanks to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
 and I think they 're video of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.320
 well done a very cool theme a match 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.320
 very good 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.960
 have a time, you would like to put the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.830
 channel does not pose a problem 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.530
 copyright have their picture taken by 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.750
 which is quite complicated to work and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.000
 the simpsons also because the nintendo 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.060
 teaches us the road had the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.990
 channels and bet on darmstadt cause of 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.400
 simpsons 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:09.620
 So these are two themes that we are 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:11.750
 holding on to the step is the correct problem of 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.400
 vaginal canal launch this year a channel 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.570
 who will spend one million enrolled this 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.570
 this year is our goal 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:25.790
 and you were really inspired by the channel 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.110
 I debuted girl that's it 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.110
