well<00:00:47.340> before<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.239> only<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> few

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
well before that this is only a few

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.210 
well before that this is only a few
weeks<00:00:48.690> ago

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.560 

so<00:00:58.220> I<00:00:58.250> thought<00:00:58.490> we've<00:00:59.060> got<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.270> kind<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.480> go<00:00:59.540> a

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
so I thought we've got to kind of go a

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.970 
so I thought we've got to kind of go a
little<00:00:59.750> bit<00:00:59.930> on<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.080> nostalgia<00:01:00.410> front<00:01:00.830> but

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
little bit on the nostalgia front but

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.650 
little bit on the nostalgia front but
also<00:01:01.190> got<00:01:01.490> to<00:01:01.580> find<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.880> best<00:01:02.060> bits<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.390> music

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
also got to find the best bits of music

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.990 
also got to find the best bits of music
because<00:01:03.250> you've<00:01:04.250> got<00:01:04.400> this<00:01:04.489> great<00:01:04.730> sort<00:01:04.970> of

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
because you've got this great sort of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.830 
because you've got this great sort of
orchestra<00:01:05.480> and<00:01:06.970> so<00:01:07.970> yeah<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:08.210> just<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.630> did<00:01:08.780> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
orchestra and so yeah I just so I did a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.090 
orchestra and so yeah I just so I did a
bit<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:08.990> work<00:01:09.080> on<00:01:09.290> trying<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.560> get<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.860> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
bit of work on trying to get the the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.950 
bit of work on trying to get the the
list<00:01:10.340> together<00:01:10.580> of<00:01:10.820> what<00:01:11.000> we<00:01:11.210> play<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.780> then

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
list together of what we play and then

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.210

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
ever since then it's just been more of a

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.010 
ever since then it's just been more of a
not<00:01:13.760> mechanical<00:01:14.270> but<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:14.660> so<00:01:14.750> you've<00:01:14.870> got<00:01:14.990> it
