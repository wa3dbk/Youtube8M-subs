00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.259
 hello welcome well as ya 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.939
 announcement earlier in another video as 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.190
 I'm going to upload a series of videos that go 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.980
 to deal with what is the subject of 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.260
 vitamins and their application where 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.689
 we can find and what properties 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.859
 have I'm going to start with what is the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:24.220
 vitamin well the vitamin is a 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.409
 vitamin that has action in several in 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.509
 several parts of our body has 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.189
 well then it has an action on 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.460
 our view has an action on 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.410
 our skin has an action too 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.540
 on the bones on the mucous membranes on 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.130
 the soft tissues and therefore it is a 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.240
 vitamin that is very interesting and that the 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.870
 we can ingest 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.260
 to see externally we can 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.570
 find in two in two sheds one 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.790
 would be the retinoic acid and the other would be 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.130
 what is retinol many people 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.930
 they are afraid to use retinol but 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.300
 we can buy retinol in 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.670
 any in any not enough 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.330
 creams in any perfumery and not 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.290
 presents that after we have then 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.750
 negative repercussions on the skin 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.390
 because I tell you it's an alcohol derived from 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.270
 what is the withdrawal of what is the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.250
 vitamin and what is more aggressive 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.900
 and this can only be applied by watering 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.270
 which are therefore methodologists or 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.710
 certain doctors then if this 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.190
 can still apply retinoic acid 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.820
 and retinoic acid itself that this one can 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.740
 have therefore more dangers let's put the case 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.200
 on the skin at different 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.610
 concentrations well then it would be 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.560
 Well, after a lot is left 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.890
 profitability in the skin and a lot 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.560
 photosensitivity that's why I tell you that the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.300
 retinol you can use it as a 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.230
 normal way there is no 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.660
 danger 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.570
 but the others do that retinoic acid 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.070
 is another question and then yes what 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.440
 we have to go to a professional 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.450
 the aesthetic because it's interesting then 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.100
 the use of these derivatives of the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.880
 vitamin because what is the vitamin 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.650
 Well then it makes an action blocker 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.290
 what is an enzyme called cabbage 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.390
 kinase this enzyme what it does is 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.250
 destroy the collagen fibers the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.730
 What collagen gives to the skin is like 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.560
 the foundations or the foundations bases of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.750
 our cutaneous electricity over 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.180
 our wrinkles and I tell you what it does 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.640
 the slokar vitamin this enzyme that what 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.190
 what it does is destroy it I do not know if it has 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.850
 explained well I hope so and then 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.890
 that's why it's interesting that we can 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.440
 apply or take what is the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.510
 vitamin in food we can 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.280
 so find in a vitamin the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.050
 we can find that in such fruits 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.069
 like the mango the peach the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.799
 apricot 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.469
 also in tomatoes vegetables like 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.870
 brussel sprouts the spinach also 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:55.719
 we can find it in the yolk of what 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.180
 which is an egg in the butter in 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:03.420
 cheeses in fatty fish or in the liver 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.790
 but good and I tell you that we can 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.819
 well, take it this way 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.439
 and I do not expect anything to be of any help 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.349
 to make these videos if you want 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.329
 check what I'm going to put the web page that 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.909
 until now, I had not put it on 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.829
 section that is going to be called healthy life and 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.989
 this is where you are going to find all the 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.150
 information about what I am 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.230
 commenting now as well 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.970
 when you talk about exactly one food 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.799
 then you will find there because 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.840
 example in the masks you embed 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.750
 you will find it there in the section 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.609
 that is called healthy life nothing I hope that 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.439
 this is helpful and see you in the 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.439
 next video until goodbye soon
