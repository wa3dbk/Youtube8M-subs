xbox 360 used to do this and he's

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.740 
xbox 360 used to do this and he's
definitely<00:03:29.770> using<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.520> here<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:31.000> magnitude

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
definitely using it here in magnitude

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.940 
definitely using it here in magnitude
ting<00:03:31.960> which<00:03:32.110> is<00:03:32.260> really<00:03:32.440> good<00:03:32.620> because<00:03:32.680> I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
ting which is really good because I

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.400 
ting which is really good because I
didn't<00:03:33.280> know<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.400> worked<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.330> maybe<00:03:34.570> I<00:03:34.720> might

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
didn't know that worked so maybe I might

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.050 
didn't know that worked so maybe I might
incorporate<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:36.070> little<00:03:36.310> bit<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.670> on<00:03:36.790> my

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
and here we go and come on cap tree o

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.080 
and here we go and come on cap tree o
for<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:47.740> can<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.250> believe<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.580> i<00:03:48.760> think<00:03:48.880> i

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
for one can you believe that i think i

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.600 
for one can you believe that i think i
went<00:03:49.210> over<00:03:49.360> to<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:50.440> they<00:03:50.680> are<00:03:50.920> not<00:03:51.100> over<00:03:51.430> one

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
went over to that they are not over one

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.160 
went over to that they are not over one
because<00:03:51.850> i<00:03:51.880> was<00:03:52.030> actually<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.450> only<00:03:52.570> path

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
because i was actually the only path

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.780 
because i was actually the only path
that<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.410> actually<00:03:53.530> threw<00:03:53.860> he<00:03:54.070> actually<00:03:54.220> almost

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
that I actually threw he actually almost

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.730 
that I actually threw he actually almost
acne<00:03:55.390> or<00:03:55.540> sack<00:03:55.750> me<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:55.990> the<00:03:56.080> last<00:03:56.260> one<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.560> here

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
acne or sack me on the last one and here

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.860 
acne or sack me on the last one and here
we<00:03:56.860> go<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.640> as<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.820> guys<00:03:57.910> can<00:03:58.120> see<00:03:58.180> here<00:03:58.630> this

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
we go so as you guys can see here this

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.590 
we go so as you guys can see here this
could<00:03:59.050> have<00:03:59.170> been<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.320> harder<00:04:00.040> game<00:04:00.370> if<00:04:00.760> he

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
could have been a harder game if he

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.030 
could have been a harder game if he
would<00:04:01.720> have<00:04:01.780> definitely<00:04:01.990> converted<00:04:02.680> that<00:04:02.800> one

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
would have definitely converted that one

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.090 
would have definitely converted that one
but<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:04.330> was<00:04:04.510> 17<00:04:04.930> 14<00:04:05.350> so<00:04:05.500> now<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.680> feel<00:04:05.920> like<00:04:05.950> I

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
but it was 17 14 so now I feel like I

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.380 
but it was 17 14 so now I feel like I
got<00:04:06.220> pretty<00:04:06.430> much<00:04:06.640> control<00:04:07.060> since<00:04:07.300> he's

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
got pretty much control since he's

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.180 
got pretty much control since he's
having<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.690> hard<00:04:07.870> time<00:04:07.930> stopping<00:04:08.350> my<00:04:08.620> run<00:04:08.920> and
