00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.240
 very good everyone i 'm joselu 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.250
 Welcome to a new episode of the mode 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.359
 race with joselu and good here you are 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.280
 seeing the first offer that has 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.639
 arrived in this summer market and it's 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.379
 of espanyol and I will reject it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.689
 basically because if we get 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.850
 ascend with the tenerife because we will be 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.279
 in the same league so I do not want to have 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.220
 the two series in the same league in the 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.930
 bbva league in this case there you can see the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.330
 second offer that comes to us friends and is 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.160
 from the bbv league to also from the betis 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.100
 so I'm going to reject it for the same 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.480
 and there you are seeing an offer 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.090
 new that has arrived is finishing 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.470
 already to the market we are on day 30 and you can 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.720
 See what a great team like Bilbao is 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.210
 offers us more salary than the previous ones 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.400
 but equally friends I want to try 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.760
 another league because this league also the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.860
 I did already in fifa 13 good friends here 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.920
 you can see the offer that I just got 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.290
 on the last day of transfers day 31 of 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.930
 August and it's from the swansea city of 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.850
 england of the premier league offer 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.280
 much less money than the others but 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.740
 that does not matter, the important thing is that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.470
 joselu is going to play in the premier league 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.840
 is a league that is the league to which 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.720
 I wanted to go basically and it's also a 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.680
 team that I quite like a team 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.540
 that plays well football that has 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.789
 enough Spaniards on the team now 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.500
 with jose Luis you will have one more and it is a 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.210
 team where I think that joselu can 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.850
 fit well there you can see your self 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.979
 ensures the new signing good there is 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.310
 Jose Luis with his new kit 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.310
 new club 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.720
 and there you are seeing the objectives that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.490
 they ask us here in their in if you can see from 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.740
 average valuation they ask us at least 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.250
 a goal of 6 we are asked to score 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.380
 seven times create 30 and percentage of 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.899
 passes completed 71 I think they are 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.149
 quite acceptable objectives and 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.229
 easy to get for joselu and good 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.509
 Now I'm going to change the 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.250
 hairstyle to joselu a new club you have to 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.950
 put in a new look by tradition 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.170
 you can see that they are left in the middle 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.569
 length and I liked this that you are 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.090
 seeing here this mohican hairstyle I 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.220
 I think that joselu looks pretty good 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.640
 with this new beard also that makes you 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.930
 already a little more mature let's say and well the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.390
 dorsal I also think that I'm going to 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.549
 change because 26 is like the number 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.590
 of canterano and see what he puts there 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.810
 new friends from the river 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.330
 plate for 2,500,000 is what you paid 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.849
 the swansea by joselu and you can see that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.340
 now it's worth 2,700,000 has gone up a bit 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.330
 of price and good I think little the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.340
 true 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.260
 Well folks the time has come already 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.910
 debut with our new team with the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680
 swansea and joselu will start in eleven 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.350
 initial in this game that we play 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.570
 away from home against the flipbook town a 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.400
 capital one cap party I think that 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.950
 is the first round or the second as 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.750
 much was the league already with a couple of 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.190
 matches started but good 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.590
 let's try friends to make a good 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.390
 debut control to joselo the ball in the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.880
 frontal makes the feint prepares the shot 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.500
 joselu bounces in the defense that penalty has 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.780
 had children on the first occasion 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.710
 let's keep pushing friends the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.480

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.950

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.220

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.800
 prepares the shot hits him joselu golazo 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.200
 joselo's friend is that they go up more 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.230
 one in far shots and in power of 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.440
 shot there is joselu celebrating what I say 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.760
 hello friends go debut first party of 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.250
 joselu with the des gens 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.830
 how he presses and how well he steals the ball 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.200
 in defense the truth sleeps and brings out 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.820
 joselo an impressive shot from 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.970
 out of the area as you are watching 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.850
 that hits him shots came the goalie 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.820
 it also seems to have few reflections 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.340
 but he is also a real goal and 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.170
 we could not spend anything better friends 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.450
 debut and scoring is always amazing and 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.130
 also taking into account that still 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.570
 José has to adapt the premier 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.060
 league because it comes from Argentina is a 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.370

 put it as before with thread or it hits or 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.170
 he stopped it again the goalkeeper gets 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.180
 in joselu let's try who 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.970
 happens because the whip hits him but 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.980

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.490
 check that the goalie goes out there they go to 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.150

 the wilfried banjo ball was that he hits 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.529

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.359

 again a very good recovery of 

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:08.949
 joselu who is very attentive pressing 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:11.409
 wants to win the egg in the team and 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:14.049

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.729
 licking the stick controls puts the ball 

00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:18.339

 the party already in our favor fix that 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:32.109
 comes from a ibón and how it controls joselu and 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.389
 as he defines calmly with class 

00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:36.819
 with quality set to point is of 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.279
 bounce in the buddy but luckily 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.439
 he gets it dodge fixes it seems that 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.869
 There is a pipe to the partner and the goalkeeper 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.989
 Well, what little can he do? 

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:48.819
 looking at the ball and watching as joselu 

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:50.529
 just scored his second goal in the 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.689
 party there is celebrating what joselu 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.729
 how fast has he adapted to the 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.729
 swansea two goals already in this capital one 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:00.370
 cap and whistle the referee the end of the 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.160
 debut grandiose party 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.960
 with the swansea that gives you the victory and 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.090
 we went to the next round of this 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.490
 capital one that can be a 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.520
 competition where we have to get 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.050
 away so friends great josé debut 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.000
 Luis Perez that from now 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.440
 enter into the plans of the coach myself 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.990
 I think with this game he has 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.750
 won there you are seeing that it is 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.430
 going up plus one in speed has taken off 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.770
 a 9 with 6 rating of the match 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.460
 great match of joselu with that double 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:34.150
 has also given two key passes 90% in 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.770
 passes has been like I say a great debut and 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.780
 there you can see the news that says that 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.539
 joselu shines in his debut in the swansea 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.610
 city and you can see also that laudrup 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.889
 said that as what your light has 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.560
 a lot of quality so well let's hope 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.889
 enter your plans and play how many more 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.020
 matches better to keep progressing and 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.280
 get to make jose the crack 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.590
 let's hope that he triumphs here in the 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.960
 sweansea in the premier league I think 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.150
 that we can fit very well in this 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.850
 team so as I say let's hope that 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.889
 the outlook wants to see us get out and good 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.300
 in the next episode in this way 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.860
 you will see the debut 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.840
 but at the premiere we will play a match 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.490
 at home against the stoke city there I am 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.069
 watching the message from manager joselu 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.449

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:19.440
