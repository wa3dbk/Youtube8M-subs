00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.180
 very first hand easy yes right 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 everything right now does not lie 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.579
 yes sometimes you are so brutally and 3 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.440
 then afterwards they come and then the sign that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.309
 knowing became very careful 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 so that I also in my single 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 considered already in him he felt it was 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.110
 while you did research on the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.670
 rest of the lawn 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.940

 switch that with this one 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.220
