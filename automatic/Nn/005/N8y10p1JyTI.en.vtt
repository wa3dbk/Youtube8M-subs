00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.349 
is good okay fine let's say you have a
facial<00:03:16.010> spasm<00:03:16.780> okay<00:03:17.889> if<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:19.190> doctor<00:03:19.579> injected

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
facial spasm okay if the doctor injected

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.110 
facial spasm okay if the doctor injected
a<00:03:20.449> teeny-weeny<00:03:21.079> amount<00:03:21.919> of<00:03:22.099> botulinum<00:03:22.549> toxin

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
a teeny-weeny amount of botulinum toxin

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.509 
a teeny-weeny amount of botulinum toxin
into<00:03:23.479> the<00:03:23.840> spasm<00:03:24.349> it<00:03:24.829> would<00:03:25.159> paralyze

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
into the spasm it would paralyze

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.330 
into the spasm it would paralyze
suspense<00:03:25.909> maybe<00:03:26.120> be<00:03:26.239> cured<00:03:26.739> well<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:28.040> sounds

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
suspense maybe be cured well that sounds

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.770 
suspense maybe be cured well that sounds
great<00:03:28.459> for<00:03:28.699> them<00:03:28.819> but<00:03:29.180> isn't<00:03:29.419> that<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.629> a

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
great for them but isn't that just a

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.759 
great for them but isn't that just a
tiny<00:03:30.079> bit<00:03:30.409> incredibly<00:03:30.889> dangerous<00:03:32.019> yes<00:03:33.019> very

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
tiny bit incredibly dangerous yes very

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.309

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
dangerous but soon people realize that

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.439 
dangerous but soon people realize that
