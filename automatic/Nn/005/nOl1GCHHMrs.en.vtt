nifty<00:01:29.240> little<00:01:29.390> red<00:01:29.810> light<00:01:30.049> which<00:01:30.229> flashes

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
nifty little red light which flashes

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.340 
nifty little red light which flashes
when<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:30.920> ready<00:01:31.189> but<00:01:32.000> um<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.049> can<00:01:33.200> leave

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
when it's ready but um so you can leave

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.810 
when it's ready but um so you can leave
it<00:01:33.409> for<00:01:33.799> like<00:01:33.920> five<00:01:34.100> minutes<00:01:34.340> or<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:34.579> let<00:01:34.729> it

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
it for like five minutes or so let it

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.270 
it for like five minutes or so let it
get<00:01:34.880> really<00:01:35.270> really<00:01:35.420> super<00:01:35.720> hot<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.290> that's

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
get really really super hot and that's

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.499 
get really really super hot and that's
usually<00:01:37.460> for<00:01:37.880> me<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.000> think<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.360> best

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
usually for me I think it's the best

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.810 
usually for me I think it's the best
because<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.020> hotter<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.640> less<00:01:40.640> you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
because the hotter it is the less you

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.760 
because the hotter it is the less you
have<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:40.970> run<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:41.329> through<00:01:41.570> your<00:01:41.689> hair<00:01:41.960> if<00:01:42.590> you

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
have to run it through your hair if you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.200 
have to run it through your hair if you
have<00:01:42.890> thin<00:01:43.130> hair<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:43.369> guess<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.850> could<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.090> an

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
have thin hair I guess that could be an

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.910 
have thin hair I guess that could be an
issue<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.600> can<00:01:44.720> which<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:44.960> lower<00:01:45.229> heat

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
issue so you can which is lower heat

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.929 
issue so you can which is lower heat
temperature<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.310> think<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.579> cool<00:01:46.729> that<00:01:46.790> you

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
temperature I think it's cool that you

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.789 
temperature I think it's cool that you
can<00:01:47.030> control<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.450> heat<00:01:47.600> on<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.899> for<00:01:48.470> me<00:01:48.590> I've

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
can control the heat on this for me I've

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.460 
can control the heat on this for me I've
really<00:01:49.189> thick<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:50.000> care<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.329> coarse<00:01:50.899> hair<00:01:51.200> um

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
really thick the care and coarse hair um

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.800 
really thick the care and coarse hair um
so<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.700> put<00:01:53.000> on<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.180> highest<00:01:53.450> setting<00:01:53.689> room

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
so I put on the highest setting room

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.090 
so I put on the highest setting room
this<00:01:53.899> way<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.079> like<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.350> run<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.680> through<00:01:54.890> maybe

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
this way I like to run it through maybe

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.210 
this way I like to run it through maybe
once<00:01:55.399> twice<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:56.750> get<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:57.020> nice<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:57.500> straight

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
once twice to get it nice and straight

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.620 
once twice to get it nice and straight
so<00:01:59.090> another<00:02:00.079> thing<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:02.270> part<00:02:02.509> can

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
so another thing is that this part can

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.149 
so another thing is that this part can
get<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:02.930> bit<00:02:03.079> warm<00:02:03.380> but<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.040> do<00:02:04.130> my

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
get a little bit warm but I just do my

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.289 
get a little bit warm but I just do my
best<00:02:04.369> not<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.520> touch<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.090> they<00:02:05.180> have

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
best not to touch it and they have

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.639 
best not to touch it and they have
certain<00:02:05.479> gloves<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:06.110> just<00:02:06.290> wear<00:02:06.439> regular

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
certain gloves and you just wear regular

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.080 
certain gloves and you just wear regular
gloves<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.280> kind<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.460> protect<00:02:07.610> your<00:02:07.880> hands

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
gloves to kind of protect your hands

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
gloves to kind of protect your hands
from<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:09.560> heat<00:02:09.739> of<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.040> and<00:02:10.369> what<00:02:11.329> else

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.170 

it's<00:02:14.920> got<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> pretty<00:02:15.310> long<00:02:15.519> cord<00:02:15.909> which<00:02:16.060> is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
it's got a pretty long cord which is

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.430 
it's got a pretty long cord which is
nice<00:02:16.299> some<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.540> them<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:16.930> cords<00:02:17.200> aren't<00:02:17.349> that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
nice some of them the cords aren't that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.809 
nice some of them the cords aren't that
long<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:17.799> it's<00:02:17.950> hard<00:02:18.129> to<00:02:18.220> move<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.610> from

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
long so it's hard to move it from

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.899 
long so it's hard to move it from
different<00:02:19.330> uh<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.980> know<00:02:21.099> outlets<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.730> things

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
wetter and gets new york humidity it'll

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.650 
wetter and gets new york humidity it'll
curl<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.579> little<00:03:42.669> bit<00:03:43.000> but<00:03:43.329> it's<00:03:43.510> actually

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660

a<00:03:45.910> small<00:03:46.120> piece<00:03:46.329> like<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.720> be<00:03:46.750> quite

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
a small piece like this to be quite

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.689 
a small piece like this to be quite
honest<00:03:47.230> i<00:03:47.379> use<00:03:47.560> bigger<00:03:47.799> pieces<00:03:48.069> because<00:03:48.400> flat

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
honest i use bigger pieces because flat

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.610 
honest i use bigger pieces because flat
iron<00:03:48.910> really<00:03:49.150> works<00:03:49.389> well<00:03:49.480> when<00:03:50.109> i<00:03:50.199> use<00:03:50.319> a<00:03:50.379> huge

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
iron really works well when i use a huge

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.349 
iron really works well when i use a huge
apiece<00:03:50.949> sometimes<00:03:51.819> i<00:03:51.849> have<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.000> go<00:03:52.120> through

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
apiece sometimes i have to go through

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.349 
apiece sometimes i have to go through
three<00:03:52.540> or<00:03:52.690> four<00:03:52.900> times<00:03:53.079> but<00:03:53.829> that's<00:03:54.579> you<00:03:55.329> know

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
three or four times but that's you know

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.780 
three or four times but that's you know
still<00:03:55.780> cuts<00:03:55.989> down<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.199> time<00:03:56.319> significantly

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
still cuts down the time significantly

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.150 
still cuts down the time significantly
so<00:03:57.790> i<00:03:58.260> just<00:03:59.260> take<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.650> i'm<00:03:59.829> going<00:03:59.949> to<00:04:00.010> try<00:04:00.099> to

so i just take it i'm going to try to
burn<00:04:00.489> myself<00:04:00.699> it<00:04:01.629> goes<00:04:01.780> close<00:04:01.989> as<00:04:02.139> i<00:04:02.199> can

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
burn myself it goes close as i can

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.629 
burn myself it goes close as i can
without<00:04:02.500> burning<00:04:02.829> myself<00:04:02.949> you<00:04:03.400> want<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.579> be

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
without burning myself you want to be

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.259

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
nice and smooth I'll go through one more

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.189 
nice and smooth I'll go through one more
time<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:35.240> I'll<00:04:35.539> let<00:04:35.659> it<00:04:35.779> be<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.900> little<00:04:36.050> more

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
time and I'll let it be a little more

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.170 
time and I'll let it be a little more
spaced<00:04:36.949> out<00:04:37.069> this<00:04:37.460> time<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.849> there<00:04:37.939> you<00:04:38.029> go

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
spaced out this time and there you go

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.089 
spaced out this time and there you go
and<00:04:38.509> that's<00:04:39.110> all<00:04:39.319> I<00:04:39.379> need<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.680> do<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:39.919> you<00:04:39.979> can

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
and that's all I need to do and you can

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.679 
and that's all I need to do and you can
see<00:04:40.219> this<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:40.490> totally<00:04:41.060> straight<00:04:41.419> and

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
see this is just totally straight and
