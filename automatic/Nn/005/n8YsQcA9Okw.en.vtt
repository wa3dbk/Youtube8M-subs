versus<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.290> 15-inch<00:02:04.770> more<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.340> editing

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
versus the 15-inch more like editing

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.060 
versus the 15-inch more like editing
speed<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.750> know

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
speed or you know

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.910 
speed or you know
just<00:02:07.280> like<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.670> guess<00:02:08.390> any<00:02:08.630> kind<00:02:08.960> of<00:02:09.050> comparison

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
just like I guess any kind of comparison
