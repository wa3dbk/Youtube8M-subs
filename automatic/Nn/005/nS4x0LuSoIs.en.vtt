currency throughout the history I'm

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.209 
currency throughout the history I'm
gonna<00:00:08.280> go<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.580> would<00:00:08.849> say<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.150> length<00:00:09.420> but<00:00:09.719> it

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
gonna go on would say on length but it

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.030 
gonna go on would say on length but it
money<00:00:11.219> was<00:00:12.019> like<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> check<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.590> checkbook

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
money was like a check in the checkbook

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.470 
money was like a check in the checkbook
and<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.790> would<00:00:14.849> do<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.089> get<00:00:15.299> your

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and what you would do is you get your

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.380 
and what you would do is you get your
gold<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.929> gold<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> medium<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.640> gold<00:00:18.180> is

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
gold and gold was a medium so gold is

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.179 
gold and gold was a medium so gold is
one<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> currency<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.770> dollars

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
one of the currency so we have dollars

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.759 
one of the currency so we have dollars
we<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.699> euros<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.750> yet<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.590> have

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we have euros we have yet and we have

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.490 
we have euros we have yet and we have
gold<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.449> if<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.930> into<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.260> situation

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
gold and if you get into a situation

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.820 
gold and if you get into a situation
where<00:00:26.039> um<00:00:26.699> there's<00:00:27.240> an<00:00:27.390> alternative<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.260> in

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
where um there's an alternative and in

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500 
where um there's an alternative and in
this<00:00:29.010> world<00:00:29.310> where<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:29.760> looking<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.300> what

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
this world where we're looking at what

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.830 
this world where we're looking at what
are<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.810> alternatives<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.940> alternative

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
are the alternatives and the alternative

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.590 
are the alternatives and the alternative
the<00:00:33.989> best<00:00:34.380> alternative<00:00:35.190> becomes<00:00:35.640> clearly<00:00:36.329> one

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the best alternative becomes clearly one

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.530 
the best alternative becomes clearly one
thing<00:00:36.989> something<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.920> gold<00:00:38.210> there<00:00:39.210> becomes

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
thing something like gold there becomes

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.850 
thing something like gold there becomes
a<00:00:39.660> risk<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.079> now<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> doesn't<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a risk of that now it doesn't have a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.150 
a risk of that now it doesn't have a
capacity<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.660> capacity<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:43.410> moving<00:00:43.920> money

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
capacity the capacity of moving money

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940 
capacity the capacity of moving money
into<00:00:44.579> gold<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.270> large<00:00:45.600> number<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.230> extremely

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
into gold in a large number is extremely

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.729 
into gold in a large number is extremely
limited<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> players<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.350> world<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
limited so the players in the world that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.619 
limited so the players in the world that
I<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> have

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
I you know that I don't know I have

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
I you know that I don't know I have
contact<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.199> who<00:00:52.469> or<00:00:52.500> move<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.489> money

contact with who or move that money

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240 
contact with who or move that money
really<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.600> view<00:00:54.809> gold<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.379> enough<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.829> an

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
really don't view gold as enough as an

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.209 
really don't view gold as enough as an
effective<00:00:56.879> alternative<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.500> always<00:00:58.680> but

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
effective alternative but we always but

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
effective alternative but we always but
it<00:00:59.309> could<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> barometer<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> an

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
it could be a barometer and it is an

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.529 
it could be a barometer and it is an
alternative<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:02.280> smaller<00:01:02.879> amounts<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.449> money

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
alternative for smaller amounts of money

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.280 
alternative for smaller amounts of money
and<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> two<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.890> won't<00:01:05.040> go<00:01:05.369> oh<00:01:05.580> yeah<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.290> do

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and if the two you won't go oh yeah I do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.429 
and if the two you won't go oh yeah I do
I<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:08.670> well<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.030> anybody<00:01:09.720> let's<00:01:10.260> be

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
I think well I think anybody let's be

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
I think well I think anybody let's be
clear<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.890> think<00:01:11.159> anybody<00:01:11.580> who<00:01:11.850> doesn't

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
clear that I think anybody who doesn't
