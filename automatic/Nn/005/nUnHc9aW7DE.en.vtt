we'll<00:05:09.850> see<00:05:10.030> how<00:05:10.060> many<00:05:10.300> subscribers<00:05:10.450> we<00:05:10.960> can

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
we'll see how many subscribers we can

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.530 
we'll see how many subscribers we can
get<00:05:11.440> during<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.950> course<00:05:12.370> of<00:05:12.490> this<00:05:12.610> challenge
