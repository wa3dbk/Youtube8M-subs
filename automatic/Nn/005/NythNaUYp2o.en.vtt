00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 
there's an overflow dream here this is

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.170 
there's an overflow dream here this is
your<00:00:07.240> primary<00:00:07.480> dream<00:00:08.370> as<00:00:09.370> you<00:00:09.610> can<00:00:09.760> tell<00:00:09.969> what

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
your primary dream as you can tell what

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.629 
your primary dream as you can tell what
happens<00:00:10.600> is<00:00:10.780> when<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.620> condensate<00:00:12.160> fills<00:00:12.460> up

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 
happens is when the condensate fills up

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.660 
happens is when the condensate fills up
in<00:00:12.790> this<00:00:12.910> pan<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.960> water<00:00:14.280> will<00:00:15.280> flow<00:00:15.550> through

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
in this pan the water will flow through

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.320 
in this pan the water will flow through
here<00:00:16.320> flow<00:00:17.320> out<00:00:17.560> and<00:00:18.130> go<00:00:18.340> into<00:00:18.550> where<00:00:19.210> it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
here flow out and go into where it

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.090 
here flow out and go into where it
either<00:00:19.509> exits<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.140> house<00:00:20.289> being<00:00:20.650> like<00:00:20.890> we're

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
either exits the house being like we're

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.400 
either exits the house being like we're
in<00:00:21.220> a<00:00:21.310> basement<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.779> going<00:00:23.109> into<00:00:23.289> your

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
in a basement it's going into your

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.050 
in a basement it's going into your
condensate<00:00:24.039> pump<00:00:24.310> because<00:00:24.640> we're<00:00:24.820> below

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
condensate pump because we're below

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.029 
condensate pump because we're below
grade<00:00:25.359> we<00:00:25.660> mechanically<00:00:26.350> have<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.650> pump<00:00:26.890> this

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
grade we mechanically have to pump this

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.009 
grade we mechanically have to pump this
water<00:00:27.340> out<00:00:27.640> because<00:00:28.150> your<00:00:28.510> system<00:00:28.869> is

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
water out because your system is

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.019 
water out because your system is
actually<00:00:29.230> below<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.710> grade<00:00:29.890> outside<00:00:30.340> but

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
actually below the grade outside but

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.280 
actually below the grade outside but
what<00:00:31.269> happens<00:00:31.630> is<00:00:31.779> there's<00:00:31.930> really<00:00:31.960> no<00:00:32.260> easy

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
what happens is there's really no easy

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.130 
what happens is there's really no easy
way<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:33.550> get<00:00:33.699> inside<00:00:33.879> here<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.420> flush<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.870> pin

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
way to get inside here to flush that pin

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.260 
way to get inside here to flush that pin
so<00:00:35.800> I<00:00:35.830> brought<00:00:36.160> some<00:00:36.370> stuff<00:00:36.489> with<00:00:36.820> us<00:00:36.940> today<00:00:37.120> to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
so I brought some stuff with us today to

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.910 
so I brought some stuff with us today to
show<00:00:37.510> you<00:00:37.570> why<00:00:37.840> this<00:00:37.899> is<00:00:38.079> here<00:00:38.380> one<00:00:38.590> thing<00:00:38.739> that

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
show you why this is here one thing that

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.880 
show you why this is here one thing that
they're<00:00:39.040> going<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.280> do<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:40.290> right<00:00:41.290> now<00:00:41.320> you<00:00:41.530> can

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
they're going to do is right now you can

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.610 
they're going to do is right now you can
see<00:00:42.100> this<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:43.000> an<00:00:43.149> overflow<00:00:43.420> this<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.500> only

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
see this is an overflow this is only

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.779 
see this is an overflow this is only
used<00:00:44.980> if<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.899> drain<00:00:47.739> pan<00:00:47.920> itself<00:00:48.250> cannot<00:00:48.610> get

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
used if the drain pan itself cannot get

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.150 
used if the drain pan itself cannot get
the<00:00:48.879> water<00:00:49.059> out<00:00:49.500> using<00:00:50.500> that<00:00:50.680> in<00:00:50.920> another

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
the water out using that in another

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.639 
the water out using that in another
means<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.730> we're<00:00:51.910> able<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.270> forcefully<00:00:52.989> pull

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
means is we're able to forcefully pull

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.430 
means is we're able to forcefully pull
water<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.399> flush<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:55.360> out

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
water in and flush this out

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.709 
water in and flush this out
the<00:00:56.800> system<00:00:57.160> is<00:00:57.219> running<00:00:57.430> right<00:00:57.699> now<00:00:57.910> what

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
the system is running right now what

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.229 
the system is running right now what
this<00:00:58.930> union<00:00:59.289> is<00:00:59.559> here<00:00:59.860> for<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.879> gives<00:01:01.090> us

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
this union is here for is that gives us

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.240 
this union is here for is that gives us
a<00:01:01.360> chance<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.719> look<00:01:01.960> inside<00:01:02.140> there<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:03.039> look

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
a chance to look inside there and look

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.740 
a chance to look inside there and look
and<00:01:03.430> see<00:01:03.550> if<00:01:03.640> there's<00:01:03.820> any<00:01:04.000> debris<00:01:04.330> blocking

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
and see if there's any debris blocking

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.650 
and see if there's any debris blocking
the<00:01:05.050> exit<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.530> this<00:01:05.680> drink<00:01:06.009> so<00:01:06.250> anytime<00:01:07.180> that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
the exit of this drink so anytime that

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.649 
the exit of this drink so anytime that
you<00:01:07.810> see<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.229> this<00:01:09.040> union<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:09.970> here<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.360> open

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
you see this this union is here to open

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.140 
you see this this union is here to open
up<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.900> drain<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.710> allows<00:01:11.920> access<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:13.000> look

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
up the drain to allows access to look

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.800 
up the drain to allows access to look
inside<00:01:13.360> let's<00:01:14.170> just<00:01:14.350> show<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.530> real<00:01:14.860> quick

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
inside let's just show you real quick

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.899 
inside let's just show you real quick
let's<00:01:16.810> we<00:01:17.260> build<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.650> this<00:01:17.890> way<00:01:18.070> not<00:01:18.580> kind<00:01:18.850> of

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
let's we build this this way not kind of

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.780 
let's we build this this way not kind of
makes<00:01:19.090> sense<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.740> hard<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:21.070> pour<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.430> you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
makes sense it's hard to pour that you

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.940 
makes sense it's hard to pour that you
got<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.000> lot<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.270> electrical<00:01:22.750> controls<00:01:23.320> here<00:01:23.619> we

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
got a lot of electrical controls here we

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.649 
got a lot of electrical controls here we
don't<00:01:24.070> want<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.340> be<00:01:24.430> pouring<00:01:24.790> water<00:01:24.970> all<00:01:25.330> down

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
don't want to be pouring water all down

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.570 
don't want to be pouring water all down
inside<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.200> controls<00:01:26.590> that's<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.310> reason

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
inside the controls that's the reason

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.289 
inside the controls that's the reason
for<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.850> extension<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:29.200> pump<00:01:30.119> funnel<00:01:31.119> here

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
for the extension the pump funnel here

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.830 
for the extension the pump funnel here
what<00:01:31.840> we're<00:01:31.990> doing<00:01:32.229> now<00:01:32.409> is<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:34.150> is<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> steady

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
what we're doing now is this is a steady

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
what we're doing now is this is a steady
drip<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:36.670> slow<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.090> fill<00:01:37.420> up<00:01:37.600> very<00:01:38.409> slow<00:01:38.710> to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
drip very slow to fill up very slow to

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.789 
drip very slow to fill up very slow to
come<00:01:39.070> out<00:01:39.479> pressure<00:01:40.479> washer<00:01:40.780> basically<00:01:41.710> what

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
come out pressure washer basically what

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:42.780 
come out pressure washer basically what
we're<00:01:41.920> doing<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.159> we're<00:01:42.369> just<00:01:42.520> put

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
we're doing is we're just put

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.540 
we're doing is we're just put
little<00:01:43.000> bit<00:01:43.120> of<00:01:43.210> force<00:01:43.830> behind<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:45.130> water<00:01:45.340> as

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
little bit of force behind the water as

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.600 
little bit of force behind the water as
it<00:01:45.700> goes<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.650> did<00:01:47.800> now<00:01:48.010> was<00:01:48.220> we<00:01:48.400> just

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
it goes in what we did now was we just

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.240 
it goes in what we did now was we just
manually<00:01:48.940> poured<00:01:49.330> water<00:01:49.480> in<00:01:49.810> back<00:01:50.650> flush<00:01:51.010> the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
manually poured water in back flush the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.580 
manually poured water in back flush the
pan<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.790> allows<00:01:52.510> for<00:01:52.780> drainage<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.260> come<00:01:53.440> out

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
pan that allows for drainage to come out

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.800 
pan that allows for drainage to come out
through<00:01:53.830> here<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:55.030> can<00:01:55.180> hear<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.450> kindness

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
gonna watch the flow of the water as it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.930 
gonna watch the flow of the water as it
comes<00:02:51.370> through<00:02:52.019> okay<00:02:53.280> now<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.459> see<00:02:54.790> the

comes through okay now you can see the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.000 
comes through okay now you can see the
state<00:02:55.269> how<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.140> comes<00:02:56.380> through<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.680> as<00:02:56.830> that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010

flow of water coming out you can tell
that<00:03:08.860> from<00:03:09.040> where<00:03:09.790> exits<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.480> drain<00:03:10.750> all<00:03:11.410> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
that from where exits the drain all the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.979 
that from where exits the drain all the
way<00:03:11.769> back<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.160> here<00:03:12.370> we're<00:03:12.850> doing<00:03:13.060> okay<00:03:13.390> it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
yeah and that's because we flushed it

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.740 
yeah and that's because we flushed it

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
doing this periodically every year it's

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.920 
doing this periodically every year it's
gonna<00:03:19.870> make<00:03:20.049> sure<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.350> stays<00:03:20.620> clear<00:03:20.920> okay
