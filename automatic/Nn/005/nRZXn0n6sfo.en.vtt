 dratuti friends with you evgeny force 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.719
 See agrarian skype and hope you 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.820
 like this wonderful empty hall 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.160
 what could be better when all the cars on 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.289
 in their places of view everything is neat everything 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.999
 spaced out as required and not that 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.220
 nothing prevents 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:28.570
 well now let's see how 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.570
 the way i did 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 Well 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.050
 and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.379
 we 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.780
 so what 's really all about it 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.550
 because all the cars I carried the place 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.110
 outlined cleared it cool now 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.390
 can be engaged further 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.860
 the industrialization of further magic is very 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.960
 a lot of cool interesting with us 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.060
 Epiphany to be transferred to me 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.250
 there are sheets of paper on which is lined 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.260
 and all the drawings where what will be the schemes where 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.690
 what kind of rooms will be all of us 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.760
 sure to show you in our series in 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.520
 next series we will deal 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.260
 a variety of interesting things as well 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.750
 probably what we will be minutes 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.330
 the near future yes of course quite a while 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.280
 we did not look into the book of quests here 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.050
 actually from the book of quests we are next 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.670

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.900
 goodbye hope you liked that 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.840
 small time lapse which for you 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.480
 cooked behind the scenes some left 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.600
 the number of hours that went on shooting 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.310
 but the result is hopefully worth it 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.380
 As for the card I am constantly asking 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.940
