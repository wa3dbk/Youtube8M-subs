 channel today we are here to do the first 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.919
 of alvaro morata informs you that you are 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.110
 deserved this card no one knows the 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.579
 because anyway we are not here to 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.460
 to argue but to speak of this 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.089
 player that shows up with 79's 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.300
 rating 79 of speed 79 of shooting 58 of 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.909
 passage 70 seats 30 defense and 69 of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.430
 physical have immediately talked about this 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.220
 player at 79 speed than in game 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.900
 they become 77 of acceleration and eighty 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.309
 then click this speed 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.400
 player is a player who has one 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.670
 let's say discreet speed 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.690
 under the sufficiency because in any case not 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.060
 is a player who takes the ball 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.590
 having the defenders in front of him if he succeeds 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.530
 however at speed jumps 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.100
 no he only manages to leave if 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.480
 let's say it is or running so it already has 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.640
 carburetor or otherwise it is already beyond 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.440
 of defenders and therefore still succeeds 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.360
 to leave does not succeed in making to learn 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.990
 all I'm off guard but 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.570
 however he manages to get in the door 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.940
 in short, therefore, a speed of 70 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.660
 it seemed to me even less I don't know if it is 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.390
 however for the acceleration but it is 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.890
 really really slow to fuel and 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.070
 however its maximum speed is not 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.800
 a lot of shooting 79 shots that don't 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.560
 they become 85 lim placement 85 of 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.590
 finalization 80 of enhanced 60 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.740
 vote them the distance 76 pulls them 58 of 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.100
 rigor we finally see some stats 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.660
 very powerful the most beautiful thing that is me 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.370
 liked this player is the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.370
 placement in the sense that it has it 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.140
 the spirit of the attacker did those 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.709
 the ones in front of the defenders for then 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.020
 starting on the offside wire and 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.520
 to fit into these spaces in short 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.140
 what did I really like 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.920
 so much of this player of this 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 player 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.700
 shoots into the area if it is facing the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.209
 so let's say goalkeeper player 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.640
 and it surely always leads to succeed 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.400
 mark 85 for purposes of action is seen already 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.890
 side seats if a little diagonal to do more 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.540
 fatigue out of area unless he has 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.680
 that stroke of genius like having summer 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.150
 in the clips it does not have a great long shot e 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.940
 does not have a great shooting power like 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.430
 seems to be 80 of potentati Roma the shooting from 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.079
 out of area is not 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.500
 everything I expected from reading the 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.500
 short dribbling statistics 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.079
 at 76 di rimini ingame they become 64 le 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.150
 agile taxes 55 the balances at 76 of 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.489
 reflexes 80 of ball control 78 of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.790
 pure dribbling this two player 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.920
 stars but stability 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.920
 then I didn't like it in dribbling 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.599
 not at all because the first thing anyway 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.000
 that a player must have is against 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.090
 blades agility he control ball at 80 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.569
 as statistics but in the game I don't 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.909
 I am found and at 64 am agility and value 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.939
 really very low very low because 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.060
 it takes a long time to turn around to do 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:30.219
 any move as an amusing skill 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.010
 you can pretend to trust the trust 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:35.049
 of the shot or in any case move the ball 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.150
 with his now these things he knows how to do but 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.760
 however it really is a player it seems 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.250
 heavy as a player ie I don't think so 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.530
 all this is tank but in play 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.219
 it really seems to me really 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.709
 heavy passages 65 division 63 of 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.859
 cross 58 of short passages 39 of 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.000
 then long effect passages 80 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.090
 excellent vision of this player e 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.579
 great steps I expected less 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.510
 however, I found myself a lot 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.810
 well I used it in 4 4 2 then 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.189
 however, he was always a couple in the sign 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.329
 his right hand left anyway 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.120
 the attacker while on the other side 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:16.659
 there was always an exterior, however, a la 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.549
 he was spinning support and he needs a 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.699
 Another player next to him alone 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.400
 not for statistics fails 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.650
 in any case, to stand out in short to get noticed 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.900
 while having a companion also sentence 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.289
 holding with the steps by making 12 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.409
 in short, he knows what I liked enough 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:38.560
 physical elevation 64 echo strength 83 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.659
 the aggressiveness of the physical is me 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.860
 really liked very little 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:46.919
 because on head dead sometimes 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.370
 he took it sometimes not then anyway 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.460
 this player is not 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.300
 a player for whom there are 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.340
 let's say some powerful pros you can say 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.080
 ah well come on it's not all I'm of the player 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.280
 however it is fast it knows everything about the catore 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.500
 but a great shot that I do n't know type 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.850
 quagliarella or klose is not everything 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.310
 I'm a player but still a great one 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.780
 header then etc. this 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:16.160
 in short, the player is not standing out 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:19.040
 very much anyway to do a little 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.320
 summary of the pros and cons 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.050
 surely among the pros we will find 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.430
 the finalization as I said is the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.440
 positioning that I liked 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.389
 really really very much 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.370
 between the against the dribbling and of 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.610
 consequently agility ball control and the 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.440
 two star skills while with 2 against 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.280
 I liked the physique as I said 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.139
 little end vote of this player 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.900
 unfortunately I can't give it 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:48.169
 sufficiency because not the statistical one 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.229
 however that characteristic for the 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.300
 which one can say ok anyway a 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.940
 good player I didn't like dying 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.120
 had up to 5 vote upgrade from his 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.500
 nif card with 6 but only for the change of 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.500
 card color for anyway 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:10.099
 I really didn't like it as a course 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.919
 you can find it at 15k on ps 18k on xbox 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.960
 so however almost at the scart price 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.330
 you're not going to spend that much if you do 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.729
 you want to try then guys I take the 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.440
 video if you have tried it if you want it 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.090
 try it if you find it tell me facts 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.810
 learn me the comments as you will be 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.060
 as a view of the sum novel 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.099
 atmospheres below 100 I like about 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.280
 public tomorrow the player review of 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:37.070
 mertens really informs player 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.760

 player then I wait for tomorrow's outcome 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.550
