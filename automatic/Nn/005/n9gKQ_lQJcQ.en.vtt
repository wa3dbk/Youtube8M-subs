inside the car is running through the
body<00:00:45.930> molding<00:00:46.410> which<00:00:46.590> I'll<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> later

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
body molding which I'll do that later

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
back down to your amp now once we have

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.080 
back down to your amp now once we have
our<00:01:03.510> red<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.670> our<00:01:05.820> positive

our red which is will be our positive

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.780 
our red which is will be our positive
from<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> battery<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.680> need<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> ground<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
from the battery we need a ground to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060 
from the battery we need a ground to
complete<00:01:09.180> our<00:01:09.210> circuit<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> ground<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
complete our circuit so the ground you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.539 
complete our circuit so the ground you
just<00:01:11.130> take<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.440> closest<00:01:13.440> frame<00:01:14.100> bolt

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549

want to do is bring give the amp and
audio<00:01:27.240> source<00:01:28.220> since<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.580> stock<00:01:30.119> unit

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
audio source since you have a stock unit

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.539 
audio source since you have a stock unit
you're<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.320> most<00:01:31.950> likely<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you're not going to be most likely you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.080 
you're not going to be most likely you
will<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.260> RCA<00:01:34.260> inputs<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.729> what<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> did

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
will not have RCA inputs so what I did

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.149 
will not have RCA inputs so what I did
here<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:37.229> sure<00:01:37.260> you<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.590> an<00:01:37.710> amp<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.130> a

put<00:02:14.190> wire<00:02:14.430> splitters<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:17.120> connect

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
put wire splitters in there and connect

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.330 
put wire splitters in there and connect
as<00:02:18.240> such<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.080> right<00:02:19.260> now<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:19.680> used<00:02:20.070> these<00:02:20.280> I

as such so right now I just used these I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.360 
as such so right now I just used these I
wouldn't<00:02:21.060> recommend<00:02:21.300> using<00:02:21.600> these<00:02:21.870> house

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.820 
wouldn't recommend using these house
house<00:02:23.370> plugs<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.620> they're

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
house plugs there is do because they're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.490 
house plugs there is do because they're
the<00:02:26.010> residents<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.850> cars<00:02:27.060> Mike<00:02:28.050> Aziz

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the residents and cars Mike Aziz

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.520 
the residents and cars Mike Aziz
actually<00:02:28.950> unscrew<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:30.290> you'd<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.470> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
actually unscrew it and you'd have a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.820 
actually unscrew it and you'd have a
horrible<00:02:32.160> sound<00:02:32.700> quality<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:34.230> I'll<00:02:34.500> later

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
horrible sound quality but I'll later

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.920 
horrible sound quality but I'll later
either<00:02:35.130> saw<00:02:35.460> those<00:02:35.790> later<00:02:36.120> or<00:02:36.390> clamp<00:02:36.750> them

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
either saw those later or clamp them

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.660 
either saw those later or clamp them
together<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.220> quick<00:02:38.430> fix

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
together but this is just a quick fix

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.810 
together but this is just a quick fix
make<00:02:39.240> sure<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.160> everything<00:02:41.160> worked<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
make sure that the everything worked and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.680 
make sure that the everything worked and
then<00:02:42.540> last<00:02:42.810> thing<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.140> want<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
then last thing you want is the the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.650 
then last thing you want is the the
power<00:02:45.900> from<00:02:46.320> your<00:02:46.440> amp<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.060> hooked<00:02:48.300> up<00:02:48.450> to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
power from your amp to be hooked up to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.310 
power from your amp to be hooked up to
your<00:02:48.890> your<00:02:49.890> subs<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.910> case<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.840> a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
your your subs in this case this is a a

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.790 
your your subs in this case this is a a
2<00:02:53.310> channel<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.510> went<00:02:54.720> ahead<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.200> instead

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
2 channel and I went ahead and instead

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.640 
2 channel and I went ahead and instead
of<00:02:55.860> using<00:02:56.670> both<00:02:57.000> channels<00:02:57.540> I'm<00:02:57.690> only<00:02:57.840> using

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
of using both channels I'm only using

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.240 
of using both channels I'm only using
one<00:02:59.750> one<00:03:00.750> speaker<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.470> went<00:03:02.010> ahead<00:03:02.100> and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
one one speaker so I went ahead and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.580 
one one speaker so I went ahead and
bridged<00:03:02.610> them<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.090> here's<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.870> diagram<00:03:04.080> tells

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
bridged them and here's a diagram tells

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.229 
bridged them and here's a diagram tells
you<00:03:04.770> how<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.950> bridge<00:03:05.220> them<00:03:05.400> therefore<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.090> get

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
you how to bridge them therefore you get

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.140 
you how to bridge them therefore you get
more<00:03:06.680> more<00:03:07.680> power<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.160> yourselves<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.880> better

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
more more power to yourselves and better

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.449 
more more power to yourselves and better
sounding<00:03:09.540> quality<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.950> guys<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.310> any

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
sounding quality if you guys have any

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.240 
sounding quality if you guys have any
