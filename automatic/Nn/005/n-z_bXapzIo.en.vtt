medieval mini builds and in this episode
I'm<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.120> show<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> how<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> build<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
I'm going to show you how to build a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.440 
I'm going to show you how to build a
small<00:00:35.809> house<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.170> hovel<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.700> called

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.260 

where<00:00:42.450> did<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.630> put<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
where did I put it it is

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.130 
where did I put it it is
so<00:00:46.930> it's<00:00:47.080> just<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.380> woman<00:00:47.830> larbert<00:00:48.310> house

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.540 

very<00:00:54.800> simple

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.510 

so<00:01:01.090> let's<00:01:01.300> get<00:01:01.420> on<00:01:01.510> this<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.530> plant<00:01:02.800> this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
so let's get on this is the plant this

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.390 
so let's get on this is the plant this
is<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:05.100> go<00:01:06.100> where<00:01:06.250> sheep

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.250 

so<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.600> bun<00:01:10.870> and<00:01:11.550> we'll<00:01:12.550> start<00:01:12.850> off

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so this is a bun and we'll start off

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.230 
so this is a bun and we'll start off
with<00:01:14.260> building<00:01:14.680> your<00:01:15.040> spruce<00:01:15.460> logs<00:01:15.670> up<00:01:16.360> by<00:01:16.750> 4<00:01:18.240> 1

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
with building your spruce logs up by 4 1

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:33.590 
with building your spruce logs up by 4 1
2<00:01:19.270> 3<00:01:19.510> 4<00:01:22.620> 10<00:01:23.620> 4<00:01:23.920> corners

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.649 

and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:34.290> joining<00:01:34.710> them<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.220> top<00:01:35.659> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and then joining them up at the top the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:51.730 
and then joining them up at the top the
sideways<00:01:37.080> looks

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.780 

now<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.400> can<00:01:52.640> make<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:54.200> roof<00:01:54.409> by<00:01:55.340> doing<00:01:55.759> this

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
now you can make the roof by doing this

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.120 
now you can make the roof by doing this
ship<00:01:56.180> which<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:58.360> one<00:01:59.360> two<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.990> three<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:01.070> you

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
ship which is one two and three so you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.649 
ship which is one two and three so you
do<00:02:01.340> one<00:02:01.610> two<00:02:02.500> three<00:02:03.820> until<00:02:04.820> again<00:02:05.090> then<00:02:05.450> one

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
do one two three until again then one

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.929 
do one two three until again then one
and<00:02:05.930> then<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.229> take<00:02:06.439> out<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.799> triangle<00:02:07.729> shape

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
and then you take out the triangle shape

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.839 
and then you take out the triangle shape
in<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.239> center<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:09.349> so<00:02:09.729> there<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.789> go

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
in the center like so there you go

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.110 
in the center like so there you go
that's<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.269> frame<00:02:15.519> now<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.580> place<00:02:16.880> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
that's the frame now you place the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.900 
that's the frame now you place the
magenta<00:02:17.810> walk<00:02:19.450> up<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.910> stone<00:02:22.910> bricks

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
magenta walk up now so it stone bricks

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.120 
magenta walk up now so it stone bricks
all<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.180> way<00:02:26.269> around

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.280 

it's<00:02:29.850> getting<00:02:30.090> dark<00:02:30.360> again<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:30.960> believe

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
it's getting dark again that I believe

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.000 
it's getting dark again that I believe
it<00:02:33.050> probably<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.380> line<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.310> n<00:02:35.820> star<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.380> web

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
it probably a line of n star in the web

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.740 
it probably a line of n star in the web
chimney<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.430> going<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> go<00:02:41.270> now<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.330> get<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
chimney is going to go now you get the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.800 
chimney is going to go now you get the
magenta<00:02:43.230> wall<00:02:44.480> fill<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.020> taller<00:02:47.810> leave

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
magenta wall fill in this I taller leave

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.890 
magenta wall fill in this I taller leave
a<00:02:48.840> gap<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.290> window<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.770> here<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:51.660> this
