a day which is incredible no by IBM is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.260 
a day which is incredible no by IBM is
to<00:03:48.959> build<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.350> petaflop<00:03:49.980> computer<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.000> fits

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
to build a petaflop computer that fits

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.170 
to build a petaflop computer that fits
on<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:51.510> desk<00:03:52.080> but<00:03:52.530> you're<00:03:52.740> 2060<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.030> if

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
on your desk but you're 2060 so if

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.360 
on your desk but you're 2060 so if
you're<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:54.420> what<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.080> petaflop<00:03:55.650> computer

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
you're like what is a petaflop computer

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.250 
you're like what is a petaflop computer
well<00:03:56.670> it's<00:03:56.790> an<00:03:56.850> extremely<00:03:57.180> powerful<00:03:57.510> computer

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
well it's an extremely powerful computer

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.050 
well it's an extremely powerful computer
and<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.800> current<00:03:59.220> size<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.760> petaflop

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
and the current size of a petaflop

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.150 
and the current size of a petaflop
computer<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.990> about<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.470> size<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.950> football

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
computer is about the size of a football

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.740 
computer is about the size of a football
field<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.970> as<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.270> see<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.450> will<00:04:03.510> get

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
field so as you can see you will get

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.570 
field so as you can see you will get
something<00:04:04.110> from<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.320> football<00:04:04.530> field<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.490> the

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
something from a football field to the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.610 
something from a football field to the
size<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.150> your<00:04:06.270> desk<00:04:06.510> oh<00:04:06.750> thanks<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.230> IBM

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
size on to your desk oh thanks to IBM

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.050 
size on to your desk oh thanks to IBM
and<00:04:07.800> it's<00:04:07.830> computer<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.430> runs<00:04:08.459> on<00:04:08.790> liquid

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
and it's computer that runs on liquid

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.420 
and it's computer that runs on liquid
blood<00:04:09.570> kind<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.530> weird<00:04:10.739> but<00:04:11.010> all<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.280> talk

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
blood kind of weird but all this talk

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.979 
blood kind of weird but all this talk
about<00:04:11.489> computerized<00:04:12.300> blood<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.900> everything

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
about computerized blood and everything

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.780 
about computerized blood and everything
kinda<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.650> have<00:04:13.739> thought<00:04:13.980> given<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.520> ability

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
kinda you have thought given the ability

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.570 
kinda you have thought given the ability
to<00:04:15.150> actually<00:04:15.330> plug<00:04:15.840> your<00:04:16.260> brain<00:04:16.650> into<00:04:17.220> your

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
to actually plug your brain into your

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.880 
to actually plug your brain into your
computer<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.209> like<00:04:18.450> access<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.200> maybe<00:04:19.590> save

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
computer and like access it maybe save

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.460 
computer and like access it maybe save
files<00:04:20.310> move<00:04:20.850> files<00:04:21.270> around<00:04:21.540> would<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.320> want

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
files move files around would you want

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.140 
files move files around would you want
to<00:04:22.530> be<00:04:22.590> able<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.860> do<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:23.250> let<00:04:23.760> me<00:04:23.790> know<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.120> the
