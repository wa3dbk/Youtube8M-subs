 love you all and mom and very often 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.059
 they says them doing a review from the times 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 look and so on but do not forget 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.320
 and about what allows us to play our 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 loved ones and mother with comfort 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240
 I mean specialized 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.699
 peripherals and speech today 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.789
 It will be about two such stray and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.910
 both are from razer first device 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.099
 and mum keyboard razer Anansi what in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.610
 this keyboard is so cool let's 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 watch 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 the device comes in quite 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.760
 a weighty box waiting for us 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.980
 device and some waste paper 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.980
 plus stickers with company logos 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.140
 the first thing striking forked 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.969
 usb cable with nylon braid 1 of it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.750
 the end feeds directly to itself 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.059
 keyboard 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.780
 but the second is needed to highlight 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.350
 keys 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.840
 Yes, and you can even play in the dark but alas 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.260
 for the sake of such luxury you have to sacrifice 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.810
 Already 2 ports can not be helped 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.970
 in addition to the standard razer key set 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.150
 anansi and is equipped with a number of additional 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.030
 the buttons are fully by the way programmable 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.750
 they are located on the right and below under 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.299
 space bar 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.729
 each of these keys can be assigned 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.950
 absolutely any action or command 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.110
 You can do it by the word on the fly 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.409
 All that is needed is a way 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.420
 press fn + right alt 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.909
 one that is specifically designed for 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.619
 macro recordings on digital 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.369
 the corresponding unit will light up 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.770
 indicator 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.320
 telling you that the recording mode is supposedly 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.280
 included further we clamp the right to us 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.710
 keyboard shortcut 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.229
 for example, call the task manager control 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.200
 alt delete and click again on 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.509
 anton + right alt followed by red 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 the indicator will flash as if to say 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.979
 us 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.649
 and now the tissue is pierced on programmable 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.439
 the key you want to assign 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.410
 this action is generally simple and extremely 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.450
 convenient to assign commands to find or other 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.760
 keys can be and using proprietary 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.040
 software pharmacist son who by the way 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.660
 allows you to customize and button illumination 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 your razer anansi 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.090
 and this is the way backlight as much as 16 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.670
 millions of shades so choose 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.920
 will be from which moreover in the keyboard 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 provides and so -called gaming 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.500
 mode 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.900
 disabling some distracting buttons 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.000
 and shortcut keys besides all 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.040
 advantages have razer anansi 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.930
 and a number of controversial moments that are not 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.220
 quite shortcomings even just 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.860
 certain nuances 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.849
 which should get used first it 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.370
 corporate font 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.440
 English layout if before you 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.349
 the first few didnâ€™t see him 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.620
 days will be a little confused but then 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.630
 by itself get used to the second right side 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.239
 programmable keys I for example 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.849
 man always played on ordinary 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.920
 standard keyboards used that most 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.560
 right button I'm on so well 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.989
 lays down my little finger is left shift 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.600
 which is often used as a single 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.120
 them so in multiplayer games and first 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.790
 time I intuitively put it in the same 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.700
 the most familiar place where just 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.140
 shift auravisor anansie and no instead 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.739
 it has a button here 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.569
 modifier m4 but again I repeat it 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.549
 rather not a disadvantage but rather 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.250
 keyboard feature requiring 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.440
 a certain addiction in the rest 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.180
 razer anansi good game 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.880
 keyboard with a nice spruce 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.160
 noticeable soft-touch button cover when 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.670
 this is not much rattling having 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.840
 good move and next gamers hiv 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.599
 however none 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.519
 he means as the company razer declares 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.459
 Great partner for your new 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.060
 keyboard will become another device from 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.940
 of the company 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.940
 namely gaming and mother mouse razer naga 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.660
 one of the main advantages leg 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.790
 is its shape which is perfect 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.730
 suitable for a person with an average 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.470
 hand size however for a child or 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.840
 girls with a smaller brush 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.970
 the mouse may not seem the best 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.919
 decision so as in that case 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.889
 reach for some extra 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.330
 buttons will not be very convenient 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.850
 less hand ordinary 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.580
 the average man falls for 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.860
 razer naga is just perfect nameless 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.760
 finger securely fixed on special 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.490
 notches on the right 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.710
 tits retracts rubberized insert 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.900
 In short, the hand does not get tired out swells 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.720
 even after a long playing time 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.820
 checked personally what's up functional 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.039
 the keys that they have a leg and enough a two 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.650
 first this digital block from the left 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.810
 device side in us about such a unit 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.910
 may be responsible for say the quick panel 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.550
 access to with your character 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.860
 which is quite convenient but just like in 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.200
 case with razer anansi buttons you can with 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.780
 ease reassign used all 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.729
 the same razer strongly alas to reconfigure 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.460
 can not unless the highlight here she 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.000
 exceptionally bright green with one 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.440
 you can disable it altogether 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.810
 continuing to talk about buttons is worth 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.479
 mention and two more keys under the wheel and 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.580
 Of course, the wheel itself is supplied and 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.020
 comfortable rubber surface which 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.539
 almost completely eliminates 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.330
 chance of slipping off his finger 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.320
 besides the wheel plays a role and 2 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.440
 additional buttons 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.250
 squeeze bread and right touch 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.440
 please you indicators 8200 now what 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.780
 let you scan for top to play what 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.240
 anything especially where itâ€™s needed 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 clear positioning of the mouse and from 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.569
 deficiencies can only be noted 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.669
 digital block and there is nothing wrong with it 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.460
 100 sometimes playing some say 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.710
 3d shooter Tulu shootings and the finger 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.270
 the case will burn one of the buttons in 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.360
 the result is not arbitrary 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.639
 there is a change of weapons but again to 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.159
 it is worth interrupting nonetheless 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.819
 a bunch of leg and anansie really 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.279
 is good 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:11.339
 ergonomics of hiv auxiliary masks 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:13.259
 very convenient cloud software in the face of razer 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.209
 synapse allowing with ease 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:19.669
 customize all your razer device 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:19.669
 in one word is extremely nice
