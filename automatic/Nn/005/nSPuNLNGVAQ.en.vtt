in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> 3-meter<00:01:14.010> event<00:01:14.479> because<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.630> not

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
in the 3-meter event because it's not

what<00:01:16.200> my<00:01:16.350> focus<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.560> know

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
what my focus is really on so you know

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
what my focus is really on so you know
it<00:01:19.770> could<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> future<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it could be in the future that I I

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.899 
it could be in the future that I I
specialize<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.110> those<00:01:22.470> events<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:23.759> that's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
specialize on those events well that's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.010 
specialize on those events well that's
why<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> ask<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.750> mean<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
why I was going to ask I mean do you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
why I was going to ask I mean do you
think<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.290> three<00:01:25.619> meter<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.159> good<00:01:26.400> enough<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
think that three meter is good enough to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
think that three meter is good enough to
maybe<00:01:27.960> dabble<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.650> international<00:01:29.340> events

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
maybe dabble in international events

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.130 
maybe dabble in international events
coming<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:30.000> um<00:01:30.950> well<00:01:31.950> right<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:32.810> I'm<00:01:33.810> only

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
ability to do well considering our dizer

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.100 
ability to do well considering our dizer
a<00:03:06.840> little<00:03:07.590> more<00:03:07.739> difficult<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:09.150> definitely

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
a little more difficult and I definitely

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.870 
a little more difficult and I definitely
think<00:03:10.470> weren't<00:03:10.709> contention<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.400> take<00:03:11.670> down

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
think weren't contention to take down

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.830 
think weren't contention to take down

individual platform um you know the
right<00:03:48.540> team<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:48.840> guess<00:03:49.170> hasn't<00:03:49.530> come<00:03:49.709> around

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829

right team I guess hasn't come around
yet<00:03:50.100> or<00:03:50.430> hasn't<00:03:50.910> reached<00:03:51.299> their<00:03:51.540> greatest

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780

potential<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.590> um<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.700> mean<00:03:54.060> we're<00:03:54.209> looking

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
potential so um I mean we're looking
