00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.529
 you can play the world of tanks only through 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.390
 the Internet is therefore quite logical that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.500
 the tournament organizer became the leading 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.840
 internet provider 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 Jsc Rostelecom who also provided 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.830
 cups to winners and valuable prizes 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.049
 the qualifying round of the competition was held in 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
 during the week a team of 5 people in 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.800
 each figured out the relationship on the virtual 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
 battlefield advanced to the tournament finals 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 gathered in one of the computer clubs 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.269
 Circassian to determine the winner I 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.460
 I think that every player and participate 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.669
 participating in this game got a lot 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.149
 pleasure felt the taste of victory as well 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.010
 got a huge adrenaline rush I 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.660
 I think everyone was happy in the teams 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.579
 winners will be awarded prizes 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.770
 that also incentive gifts 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.829
 of course we will carry them out and in 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.829
 further 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.040
 girls encouraging our subscribers this 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.380
 will be our plan the game world of tanks itself 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.660
 based on the events of the second world war 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.070
 and those who play it say that it is not 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.379
 just a tank simulator 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.300
 but also an exciting dynamic action game with 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.129
 elements spite strategy 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.140
 somewhat animated graphics 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.119
 the game is quite realistic since 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.310
 developers have complied with all the technical 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.110
 characteristics of more than 200 models 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.240
 real-life tanks 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.100
 as well as movement and shooting physics 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.200
 combat vehicles probably therefore 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.810
 the computer world of tanks is basically 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
 battle is far from being the young players 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.830
 the question is what most attracts in 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.649
 this online game meets the captain 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.039
 teams with a concise title 45 tanks 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.509
 this 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:33.910
 this is a tank stimulus second world practice 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.460
 old tanks all many play already very 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.750
 a lot even around the world not only in kcr 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.940
 I was even surprised that 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.090
 my village where I live is not Carolyn 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.080
 Moscow people lose a lot for those not 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.130
 I know I met about 11 rudely 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.380
 saying now there will be a final that is now 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.840
 two winners who played each 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.750
 pull play finals 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.119
 do we mind try to win endeavors and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.709
 the experience of the players of team 45 and maybe 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.810
 the name after all the second world ended 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.240
 it was in forty-five gave their 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.399
 results they won kicked and became 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.040
 Rostelecom Cup Winner

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.390
