15 minutes to auto saving every two

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.900 
15 minutes to auto saving every two
hours<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.989> 15-minute<00:00:52.800> increments<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.730> that's

that's<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.370> good<00:00:56.520> idea<00:00:56.960> splits<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that's a good idea splits the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.830 
that's a good idea splits the
sensitivity<00:00:58.800> controls<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.579> an<00:01:00.239> in-game

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
sensitivity controls into an in-game

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.889 
sensitivity controls into an in-game
sensitivity<00:01:02.059> sensitivity<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.539> menu

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sensitivity sensitivity and an in menu

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.530 
sensitivity sensitivity and an in menu
sensitivity<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.280> um<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.180> way<00:01:06.299> you'll<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.450> able

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

that<00:03:43.130> but<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> guess<00:03:43.519> that's<00:03:43.549> been<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> big<00:03:44.060> deal

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
that but I guess that's been a big deal

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.449 
that but I guess that's been a big deal
um<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.810> frame<00:03:48.140> frames<00:03:48.680> would<00:03:48.920> drop<00:03:49.130> when<00:03:49.370> you

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
um the frame frames would drop when you

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.009 
um the frame frames would drop when you
get<00:03:49.640> like<00:03:49.760> near<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.120> edge<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.330> your<00:03:50.390> world<00:03:50.720> so

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
get like near the edge of your world so
