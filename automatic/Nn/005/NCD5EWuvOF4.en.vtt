and then round the back we have got a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.880 
and then round the back we have got a
normal<00:02:14.880> foot<00:02:15.090> break<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.470> operates

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
normal foot break and that just operates

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.010

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
left-hand side I'm just going to lay

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.910 
left-hand side I'm just going to lay
that<00:03:34.450> down<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:34.989> can<00:03:35.170> see<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.470> size<00:03:35.709> of

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
that down so you can see the size of

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.190 
that down so you can see the size of
that<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.790> remember<00:03:37.299> if<00:03:37.600> we<00:03:37.720> were<00:03:37.930> putting

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
that and remember if we were putting

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.199 
that and remember if we were putting
that<00:03:38.440> into<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.769> boot<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.670> take<00:03:39.850> those<00:03:39.970> rear

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
that into a boot and take those rear

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.680 
that into a boot and take those rear
wheels<00:03:40.480> off<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.959> would<00:03:41.170> make<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.709> smaller

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
wheels off it would make it smaller

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.559 
wheels off it would make it smaller
