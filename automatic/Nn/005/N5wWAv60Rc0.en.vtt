00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.359
 hello girls are the boys 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.319
 fortunately for some 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.169
 unfortunately for others everything 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.469
 it depends as we see the step if we see it 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:17.670
 half full or half empty and the summer 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.650
 has almost reached its end already 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.109
 many of the children return or 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.019
 will return soon to school and for 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.289
 ende decreases the visits the exits to 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 the beach and the pool to the parks and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.090
 those alerts that we give in the sun that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.890
 they tend to burn our hair and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.560
 neskas and I will not share a recipe 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:47.640
 which is excellent is great for 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:51.960
 we retrieve our hair from the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.880
 Sunburn is a homemade recipe and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.300
 the ingredients are super easy to 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.690
 get and it 's tomato because we take a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.690
 juice 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.920
 He did not play that we come we me and I 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.710
 made but in tomato in symptoms of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 cool that's the game that I took from 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.450
 tomato tomato as ripe as possible 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 tomato while more mature then more played 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:26.610
 we liquefy it and that mixture and that mixture the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.610
 mix with aloe vera or salt juice 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.910
 aloe vera is better to catch itself 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.350
 remove it from the stalk and use it well if the 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:41.399
 we liquefy together with the tomato and then 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.380
 we make a mix like this with this here 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.369
 I have the juice of tomatoes 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.369
 the aloe 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.610
 and the ingredient I would say would be what 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.610
 no way 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.900
 mix this combination and put a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.090
 little bit creamier so you do not 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.790
 we can apply on the hair and it's 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.030
 shampoo 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.870
 can be any shampoo I know how 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.270
 use this since that is that good position and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.140
 recommended for hair that has 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:25.520
 highlight the blonde hair as it helps 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:29.310
 remove that did that as a tan 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.160
 our blond what 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.959
 it tends to happen when we are seeing 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.569
 sun or with chlorine from the pool or by 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.980
 that it's been a while since we gave ourselves 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.590
 the color and we need to keep it 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.459
 I know that many of us have hair 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.090
 smooth or dry I know we do not like it very much 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.370
 use shampoo but those days you do not touch 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.920
 use the shampoo to clean our 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.220
 scalp and remove all 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.890
 products is excellent to do this 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.810
 combination and much more in the summer already 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.410
 end of summer to go recovering 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.019
 our hair from the rays of the sun and I 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.810
 I applied it is super easy to do the 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.360
 mix you put it leave it 15-20 minutes 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.840
 minimum after the head is washed 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.690
 of the guaguas logo with lots of water 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.820
 and it conditions your hair so that 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.360
 so naturally as always 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.120
 you make the tomato is very good for the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.580
 burn not only from our 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.360
 hair but also from our skin 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.370
 the tomato has ingredients that help 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.580
 with the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.060
 with the healing of the burn 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:53.080
 just like everything so we know the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.780
 aloe and has been used for years i 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.930
 I would say centuries for burns then 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.360
 what better than combining the two and 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.430
 applying it to our hair to 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.409
 recover from the burns not 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.269
 only from the sunburn but 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.420
 also of the wood of vic of 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:14.620
 highlights and chemical dyes is very 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.650
