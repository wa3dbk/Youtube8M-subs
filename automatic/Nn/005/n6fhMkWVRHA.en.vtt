00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 I remember the first time that my father 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.270
 took my little sister emil and me to the circus 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.290
 we were very happy to finally be able to 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.940
 meet the clowns see the animals 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.970
 and above all taste the delicious 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.550
 cotton candy everyone loved the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.850
 cotton candy in the sweetest that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.699
 you could imagine at least that's what my 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.699
 father both adults and children what 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.870
 they enjoyed everyone we loved the 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.659
 Games and attractions were incomparable 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.680
 that circus was spectacular the best 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:02.080
 everyone's circus was a shame that only 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 came to the city once in five 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.530
 years 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.550
 after walking and playing for a while 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.100
 father took me to emily to see the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.020
 7 function 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.200
 we both watched in amazement at the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.080
 trapeze artists swinging over fire and 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.060
 the funny clowns throw themselves 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.220
 valdés with cold water and running with their 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.350
 baggy trousers all over the track 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.020
 everything was perfect 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.720
 at the end of the function one of the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.790
 clowns approached my father and told him 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.000
 that we had won a special pass 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.030
 for the last function of the night but 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.920
 it was only one so only one of the two 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.409
 I could enter 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.200
 emilio we shout and we beg to be the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.220
 chosen but my father gave him the ticket 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.619
 to her for being the smallest my father 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.530
 emily told that should accompany the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.649
 clown who extended his hand and she 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.140
 happy he went with him I told my 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.659
 father that I also wanted to go but he 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.330
 he replied that not that he would take me to 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.420
 take a ride on the roller coaster and then 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.640
 we would try the famous cotton candy 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.460
 and finally know its delicious flavor 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.100
 we walk towards the great mountain but I 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.600
 I wanted to go back to the circus tent 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.180
 where my little sister sure was 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.819
 having a lot of fun so I let go of the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.480
 hand to my father and I ran out to 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.870
 there I went under the tent and what 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.209
 I saw everything hidden from the stands but that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.390
 it was not a function at least not a 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.820
 normal function the clowns the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.430
 trapeze the presenter and others 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.800
 circus workers were there but 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.640
 about their classic costumes they used 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.160
 strange dark clothes with hood 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.250
 there were many candles lit around 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.760
 of the track and there was also emily 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.310
 together with four other children 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.060
 all the children were bound by feet and 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.790
 hands on a big tub they cried 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.850
 and they tried to escape they tried to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.130
 untie their ties without any success 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.320
 all the hooded people performed songs 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.840
 strangers and they threw around the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.030
 children 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.629
 the same clown who had taken 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.030
 emily approached them and saying 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.000
 words in a strange language with a 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.180
 knife in his hand sliced ​​one by one 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.040
 each one of the children's necks myself 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.830
 I just watched in horror like blood 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.950
 it burst from his throat and fell to the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.530
 huge tub beneath them paralyzed 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.780
 because of fear I watched as they cut the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.540
 neck of my little sister who 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.269
 he soon stopped screaming and just trembled 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.270
 while she went pale and her blood 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.580
 fell down his body to the tub 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.850
 then I realized that the tub 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.400
 had a connected hose that he was wearing 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.210
 all the children's blood out 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.540
 of the carp through a small opening 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.610
 I could see where it came 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.430
 it came to a strange and huge 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.340
 machine was the cotton machine of 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.979
 sugar the mixture of blood and caramel 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.610
 evaporated they formed that spongy 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.220
 cotton ball could not believe it all 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.840
 that was horrible and macabre I did not know 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.880
 how I would tell my father what 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.860
 I had seen how I was going to tell him that my 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.139
 sister was dead 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.169
 I wanted to go out and look for him but he 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.600
 he found annoying first he yelled at me 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.550
 have run like this and for having 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.760
 cast to function 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.020
 I tried to explain what was happening 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.730
 I tried to make him turn to the 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.810
 track to see everything that was 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.190
 happening but he did not pay attention 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.770
 Taking my arm, I take myself out of the 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.400
 tent where the machine was 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.090
 of cotton he asked the seller one and 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.980
 he gave it to me I wanted to throw up my 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.440
 stomach was stirred 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.660
 obviously I did not want to try it I knew that 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.660
 the blood of emily and those other 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.110
 four children was there I could not talk 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.210
 I was very shocked and terrified 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.290
 my father plucked some cotton from 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.230
 sugar and made me try it by force 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.289
 I wanted to throw up just thinking about it but 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.569
 try it something happened 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.469
 It was the most delicious thing I had tasted 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:38.869
 in my life so sweet so soft it was 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:42.510
 perfect was just as I had it 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:44.820
 described but much better 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.280
 my father squatted next to me 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.600
 and he told me 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.729
 you must know something son 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.129

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.129
 everyone in the town we love the delicious 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:00.740
 taste of cotton candy and in return 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.760
 the good people of the circus just 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.100
 they ask for one thing 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.350
 they ask us for five children every five years 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.800
 it's a fair price for so delicious 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.260
 Manjar do not you think he said while wearing a 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.510
 piece of cotton candy to his mouth and 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.940
 savors goes frantically to 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.910
 finger licking 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.840
 my tears dried up and all the fear 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.520
 disappeared the taste was so sweet it was 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.280
 so perfect that I forgot I was 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.980
 scared I did not care anymore what I had 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.420
 seen I did not even care that my 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.020
 sister was dead 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.110
 my father was right was really worth the 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.740
 pain 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.510
 are the five children every five years to 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.350
 taste change more delicious than 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.970
 can you imagine 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.970
 that was worth it 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.210
 I remember the first time that my father 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.300
 took to the circus 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.569
 It was a day like today 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.360
 and I hope my son you understand that no 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:06.250
 you must be selfish because you must be 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.620
 glad to know that it will bring you a lot 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:14.500
 happiness to many people because in you 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:18.569

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.569
 sweetest sugar you can imagine
