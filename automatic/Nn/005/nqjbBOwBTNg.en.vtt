00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
his balance isn't the best either but

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.800 
his balance isn't the best either but
like<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.800> said<00:02:54.070> he<00:02:54.160> starts<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.820> game<00:02:55.330> what<00:02:55.630> was

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
like I said he starts in game what was

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.390 
like I said he starts in game what was
outstanding<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.770> think<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.070> was<00:02:57.190> something

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
outstanding I think it was something

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.210 
outstanding I think it was something
like<00:02:57.550> 80<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.600> game<00:02:58.870> he<00:02:59.380> just<00:02:59.620> doesn't<00:03:00.070> like

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
like 80 but in game he just doesn't like

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.310 
like 80 but in game he just doesn't like
to<00:03:00.400> stay<00:03:00.459> on<00:03:00.670> his<00:03:00.820> feet<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> balance<00:03:01.720> has<00:03:02.140> to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
to stay on his feet so a balance has to

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.920 
to stay on his feet so a balance has to
be<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.440> corn<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.730> kind<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.150> sense<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.630> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
be a corn in that kind of sense of the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.590 
be a corn in that kind of sense of the
weird<00:03:05.170> overall<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.370> great<00:03:06.790> card<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.420> like<00:03:07.570> I

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
weird overall is a great card but like I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.660
