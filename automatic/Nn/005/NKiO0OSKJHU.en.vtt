00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
and they're meaner than ever and they've

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.109 
and they're meaner than ever and they've
brought<00:00:30.099> with<00:00:30.250> them<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:30.429> force<00:00:30.699> that<00:00:30.789> can

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
brought with them a force that can

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.910 
brought with them a force that can
essentially<00:00:31.449> sink<00:00:31.840> entire<00:00:32.260> cities<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:32.830> it's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
essentially sink entire cities and it's

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.890 
essentially sink entire cities and it's
not<00:00:33.100> just<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:33.699> little<00:00:33.910> emergence<00:00:34.360> hole<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:34.809> an

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
not just a little emergence hole it's an

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.930 
not just a little emergence hole it's an
entire<00:00:35.199> city<00:00:35.500> going<00:00:35.710> down<00:00:35.949> at<00:00:36.070> once<00:00:36.309> so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
entire city going down at once so

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.939 
entire city going down at once so
humanity's<00:00:37.480> back<00:00:37.720> is<00:00:37.900> against<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.260> wall<00:00:38.350> and

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
humanity's back is against the wall and

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.320 
humanity's back is against the wall and
we<00:00:39.070> need<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.250> strike<00:00:39.610> back<00:00:39.790> against<00:00:40.239> these

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
guys so the way that we do that is by

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.369 
guys so the way that we do that is by

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.140 
to depths of the underground and they
fight<00:00:53.049> back<00:00:53.080> against<00:00:53.650> these<00:00:53.769> bad<00:00:53.949> guys<00:00:53.979> so<00:00:54.940> the
