00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
many years probably since a couple I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.310

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
phenomenal job on and I think as far as

phenomenal job on and I think as far as
I<00:00:55.469> know<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:56.100> run<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.460> about<00:00:56.550> 20<00:00:57.149> bucks<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.570> pop

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I know they run for about 20 bucks a pop

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.830 
I know they run for about 20 bucks a pop
in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> stores<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.609> got<00:00:59.609> mine<00:00:59.789> off<00:00:59.940> ebay<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.600> he

in the stores I got mine off ebay so he

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
in the stores I got mine off ebay so he

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.090 
sent me back about 25 after shipping so
I<00:01:03.239> thought<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> pretty<00:01:04.199> decent<00:01:04.589> deal

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.170 

sculpt<00:01:08.100> wise<00:01:08.250> i<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.939> really

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.670 
sculpt wise i think it's it's really
decent<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.720> i<00:01:09.750> said<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.500> an

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
decent like i said it's not it's not an

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.160 
decent like i said it's not it's not an
overly<00:01:10.950> complex<00:01:11.430> sculpt<00:01:11.930> but<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.170> looks<00:01:13.350> good

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.719 

there<00:01:19.170> doesn't<00:01:19.320> seem<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.100> any<00:01:20.430> kind

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729

muscles coming right up over top of the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.840 
muscles coming right up over top of the
joint<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.410> however<00:02:28.620> however<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.400> slide<00:02:29.670> that

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
joint so however however you slide that

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.240 
joint so however however you slide that
it<00:02:29.970> moves<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:31.740> know<00:02:31.830> kind<00:02:32.190> of

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
it moves with it and you know kind of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.900 
it moves with it and you know kind of
kind<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.670> keeps<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.140> looking<00:02:34.140> quite<00:02:34.320> natural

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910

he's got a ball jointed waste the belt

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.620 
he's got a ball jointed waste the belt
doesn't<00:02:44.400> impede<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.730> at<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.239> belt<00:02:45.420> can

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
doesn't impede that at all the belt can

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.570 
doesn't impede that at all the belt can
actually<00:02:45.959> kind<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.530> move<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.130> moves<00:02:47.340> like

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
actually kind of move so it moves like

one<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.670> my<00:03:50.760> few<00:03:51.030> gripes<00:03:51.600> able<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.989> figure<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
one of my few gripes able to figure the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.800 
one of my few gripes able to figure the
blade<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.769> actually<00:03:53.160> quite<00:03:53.310> flimsy<00:03:53.810> which

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
again I can't complain too much because

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.250 
again I can't complain too much because
it's<00:03:56.910> maybe<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.180> throwback<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.750> originals

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
it's maybe a throwback to the originals

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.340 
it's maybe a throwback to the originals
as<00:03:59.220> their<00:03:59.519> weapons<00:04:00.420> were<00:04:00.600> quite<00:04:00.810> flimsy<00:04:00.989> too

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
as their weapons were quite flimsy too

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.830 
as their weapons were quite flimsy too
but<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.519> nicely<00:04:02.760> done<00:04:03.120> it's<00:04:03.390> got<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.660> nice

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
sculpt it's got a fairly convincing

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.890

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
all cleaned up that there's a whole lot

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.020

of<00:04:32.780> paint<00:04:32.960> going<00:04:33.110> on<00:04:33.320> but<00:04:33.590> on<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.670> tips<00:04:34.880> are

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
of paint going on but on the tips are

the claws and the other knuckles and

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.800 
the claws and the other knuckles and
then<00:04:37.730> he<00:04:37.820> also<00:04:37.850> comes<00:04:38.210> with<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.420> dagger<00:04:38.630> which

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
then he also comes with a dagger which

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.380 
then he also comes with a dagger which
can<00:04:39.260> slide<00:04:39.620> into<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.160> sword<00:04:40.400> just<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.300> know

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
can slide into the sword just you know

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.820 
can slide into the sword just you know
as<00:04:41.540> you<00:04:41.630> can<00:04:41.720> see<00:04:41.870> there<00:04:42.050> it's<00:04:42.620> going<00:04:42.740> to

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
as you can see there it's going to

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.590 
as you can see there it's going to
hollow<00:04:42.980> it'll<00:04:43.250> in<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.370> middle<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:43.910> just<00:04:43.970> pops

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
hollow it'll in the middle and just pops

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.160 
hollow it'll in the middle and just pops
out<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.050> it's<00:04:45.710> done<00:04:45.890> quite<00:04:46.070> nicely<00:04:46.280> too<00:04:46.550> and

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
out and it's done quite nicely too and

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.990 
out and it's done quite nicely too and
again<00:04:48.170> it<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.740> kind<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.100> on<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.370> flimsy<00:04:49.790> side

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
again it is kind of on the flimsy side

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.150 
again it is kind of on the flimsy side
but<00:04:50.900> like<00:04:51.260> I<00:04:51.350> said<00:04:51.410> it<00:04:51.650> just<00:04:51.740> slides<00:04:51.980> right

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
but like I said it just slides right

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.000 
but like I said it just slides right
into<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.520> groove<00:04:52.790> just<00:04:53.330> like<00:04:53.450> so<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:54.620> that

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
into that groove just like so so that

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.670 
into that groove just like so so that
was<00:04:55.160> very<00:04:55.220> cool<00:04:55.630> he<00:04:56.630> also<00:04:56.750> has<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.020> small<00:04:57.440> blue

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
was very cool he also has a small blue

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.860 
was very cool he also has a small blue
piece<00:04:57.950> this<00:04:58.790> just<00:04:59.060> pops<00:04:59.300> into<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.660> side<00:04:59.840> of

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
piece this just pops into the side of

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.620 
piece this just pops into the side of
his<00:05:00.020> waist<00:05:00.970> just<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.090> that<00:05:02.180> little<00:05:02.480> hole<00:05:02.570> right

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
his waist just in that little hole right

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.520 
his waist just in that little hole right
there<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.910> then<00:05:05.900> essentially<00:05:06.260> what<00:05:06.500> that

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
there and then essentially what that

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.170 
there and then essentially what that
does<00:05:06.920> is<00:05:07.419> you<00:05:08.419> can<00:05:08.540> pop<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.780> down<00:05:09.940> into<00:05:10.940> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
does is you can pop that down into the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.780 
does is you can pop that down into the
claw<00:05:11.390> and<00:05:11.660> then<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.410> just<00:05:12.530> hangs<00:05:12.740> off<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.250> side

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
claw and then it just hangs off the side

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:22.029 
claw and then it just hangs off the side
of<00:05:13.820> his<00:05:13.970> belt<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:17.230> can<00:05:18.230> manage<00:05:18.530> it

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.949 

you<00:05:23.039> get<00:05:23.159> the<00:05:23.279> gist<00:05:23.429> of<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:23.729> anyways<00:05:24.119> it's<00:05:24.839> a

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:24.959 
you get the gist of it anyways it's a

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.239 
you get the gist of it anyways it's a
little<00:05:25.199> easier<00:05:25.349> to<00:05:25.559> actually<00:05:25.739> have<00:05:26.069> this

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:26.249 
little easier to actually have this

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:27.979 
little easier to actually have this
attached<00:05:26.699> onto<00:05:26.969> the<00:05:27.209> least<00:05:27.389> you<00:05:27.629> know<00:05:27.749> you<00:05:27.839> got

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:27.989 
attached onto the least you know you got

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.329 
attached onto the least you know you got
the<00:05:28.169> hilt<00:05:28.769> of<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:28.919> sword<00:05:29.009> and<00:05:29.219> everything

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:31.679 
bumping into his arms up but you know it

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:32.749 
bumping into his arms up but you know it
look<00:05:31.799> it's<00:05:31.949> pretty<00:05:32.159> cool<00:05:32.309> so<00:05:32.489> it<00:05:32.549> gives<00:05:32.610> you
