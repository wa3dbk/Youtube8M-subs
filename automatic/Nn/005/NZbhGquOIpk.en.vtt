00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.420 

this<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.450> me<00:01:19.630> basically<00:01:20.110> after<00:01:20.590> maybe<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.070> lot

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
this is me basically after maybe a lot

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.580 
this is me basically after maybe a lot
of<00:01:21.460> caves<00:01:21.790> see<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.420> couple<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.840> boxes<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.320> donuts

of caves see a couple of boxes of donuts

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.570 
of caves see a couple of boxes of donuts
I<00:01:24.190> mean<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:25.390> kind<00:01:25.960> of<00:01:26.020> looks<00:01:26.200> like<00:01:26.260> me<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:27.430> most

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
I mean it kind of looks like me the most

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.430 
I mean it kind of looks like me the most
impressive<00:01:27.880> part<00:01:28.240> though<00:01:28.390> is<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.750> course<00:01:28.990> came

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
impressive part though is of course came

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.109 
impressive part though is of course came
from<00:01:29.470> that<00:01:29.710> guy<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.220> he's<00:01:30.400> only<00:01:30.580> got<00:01:30.670> really

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
from that guy and he's only got really

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.240 
from that guy and he's only got really
three<00:01:31.690> moving<00:01:31.960> parts<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.770> think<00:01:33.070> that's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
three moving parts so I think that's

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
three moving parts so I think that's
that's<00:01:33.490> pretty<00:01:33.820> impressive

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that's pretty impressive

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.100 
that's pretty impressive
next<00:01:35.590> up<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.950> tough<00:01:36.310> automaton<00:01:37.060> who<00:01:37.479> doesn't

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
next up a tough automaton who doesn't

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.890 
next up a tough automaton who doesn't
deal<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.740> small<00:01:39.280> talk<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.780> our
