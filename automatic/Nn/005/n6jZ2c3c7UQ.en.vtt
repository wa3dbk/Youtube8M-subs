and<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.280> noticed<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.880> design<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.810> a

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
and I noticed that the design is a

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.960 
and I noticed that the design is a
little<00:04:16.049> bit<00:04:16.260> different<00:04:16.709> than<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.100> original

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970

Dabra<00:04:18.420> gun<00:04:18.600> but<00:04:18.870> I'll<00:04:19.560> talk<00:04:19.709> about<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:20.280> more

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
Dabra gun but I'll talk about that more

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.170 
Dabra gun but I'll talk about that more
in<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.940> review<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.830> my<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.490> far<00:04:23.700> my<00:04:23.850> one<00:04:24.060> and

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
in the review and my so far my one and

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.700 
in the review and my so far my one and
only<00:04:24.210> complaint<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:24.930> we<00:04:25.140> only<00:04:25.290> get<00:04:25.470> one

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
only complaint is that we only get one

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.780 
only complaint is that we only get one
beam<00:04:26.160> saber

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
beam saber

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.230 
beam saber
even<00:04:27.060> though<00:04:27.180> tallgeese<00:04:27.750> has<00:04:28.050> two<00:04:28.850> but<00:04:29.850> then

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
even though tallgeese has two but then

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.090 
even though tallgeese has two but then
again<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.750> probably<00:04:31.110> won't<00:04:31.410> have<00:04:31.560> them<00:04:31.680> dual

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
again I probably won't have them dual

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.490 
again I probably won't have them dual
wielding<00:04:32.640> very<00:04:33.030> much<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.840> don't<00:04:34.410> think

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
wielding very much so I don't think

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.070 
wielding very much so I don't think
it'll<00:04:34.680> be<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:34.860> big<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.310> an<00:04:35.370> issue<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
it'll be that big of an issue so that

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.750 
it'll be that big of an issue so that
about<00:04:37.260> does<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.500> for<00:04:37.680> my<00:04:37.800> unboxing<00:04:38.190> video<00:04:38.670> of

the robot dumb she told used to and with

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.870
