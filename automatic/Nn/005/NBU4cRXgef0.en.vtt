fire<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.410> that's<00:02:04.410> going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
fire here and that's going to do a

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.380 
fire here and that's going to do a
pretty<00:02:05.399> good<00:02:05.550> amount<00:02:05.819> of<00:02:05.940> damage<00:02:06.239> here
