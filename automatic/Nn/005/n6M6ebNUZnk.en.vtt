00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.910
 here is a hive that has collapsed 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.740
 in late summer say that bees 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.170
 gradually disappeared and that the Russian 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 was almost depopulated 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.250
 so it's not recommended to leave 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 empty hives abandoned in the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.000
 streets is because it can generate a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.699
 looting and possible transmission 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.039
 disease or other colony on the one hand and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.140
 on the other hand this hive interests a 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 another insect a butterfly the pit 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 ringworm that will come lay in this 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.200
 hive and the larvae are going to jacir enter 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.200
 in the street 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.300
 we see here the dallas paths of 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.540
 falseness an alarm the size of 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.970
 false ringworm quickly pendulum and the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.310
 resells eat wax 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.310
 we see here the arve in full swing 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.530
 tiny tear next to the averages 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.600
 and larger the Faust larvae 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.690
 ny have a preference for which Sir 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.570
 brood content since in the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.580
 cells there remains the network of the cocoon that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.160
 will feed its larvae so the waxes 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.619
 virgin or who have never seen a brood 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.270
 they are virtually never attacked the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.890
 post ny is not an illness it's a 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.869
 insect so there is no contagion 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 possible to be afraid ie 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.350
 can be reused then well 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.050
 obviously alongside replicators we have 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.540
 melt in addition we recovers the civ 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.190
 there is no sending to know by 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.380
 against keeping full hives 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.729
 of ringworm obviously that increases 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.130
 the pressure of these butterflies on the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.350
 ostriches 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.240
 here are syrahs melting a colony that 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.630
 is dead 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.630
 story of a failure
