protocol but what I thought of was that
I<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.989> when<00:01:04.140> I've<00:01:04.229> done<00:01:04.470> protocol

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I know that when I've done protocol

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.630 
I know that when I've done protocol
before<00:01:05.689> doing<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.110> apple<00:01:07.770> cider<00:01:07.920> vinegar<00:01:08.040> and

before doing the apple cider vinegar and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.210 
before doing the apple cider vinegar and
the<00:01:08.670> mct<00:01:09.299> shot<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:10.170> helped<00:01:10.770> me<00:01:10.979> rather

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the mct shot actually helped me rather

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
the mct shot actually helped me rather
than<00:01:11.369> hinders<00:01:11.850> me<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.659> still<00:01:13.080> wanted<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> do

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
than hinders me so I still wanted to do

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
than hinders me so I still wanted to do
it<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.220> actually<00:01:14.400> wanted<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

that's<00:03:43.139> mainly<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:43.829> just<00:03:44.130> have

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
that's mainly so that I can just have

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.680 
that's mainly so that I can just have
more<00:03:45.660> moisture<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.590> salad<00:03:47.459> if<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.239> if<00:03:48.569> I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
more moisture on the salad if I if I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.539 
more moisture on the salad if I if I
have<00:03:48.900> less<00:03:49.200> lettuce<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.919> probably<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:50.370> get

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
have less lettuce I probably just get

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.250 
have less lettuce I probably just get
away<00:03:50.609> with<00:03:50.849> one<00:03:51.060> tablespoon<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.750> do<00:03:51.870> too

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
away with one tablespoon but I do too

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.349 
away with one tablespoon but I do too
and<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:53.130> has<00:03:53.250> not<00:03:53.459> affected<00:03:53.790> may<00:03:54.030> adversely

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359
