00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 All right, good folks. 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.510
 Today I am giving continuity here to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.480
 our intel hd graphics mil series 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.980
 I had already done the skyrim episode more 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:32.759
 I had to redo small microphone 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:38.129
 I was in the world so I did what I 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.219
 try a place here I'm going to come here that I 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.190
 I can not stand being in that cave anymore 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 well guys this is the third one 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.780
 episode is from our series and the league is going to be 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.899
 four or three more I do not know 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.530
 I'm thinking of catching crase 2 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.260
 I'll try to see if it runs at all in the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.220
 My minimum, but I still do not think so. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.310
 going to change 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.150
 although the same video card 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.479
 good people how can you see the game 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.000
 apparently he is not a colleague there but he 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.799
 is running at 20 fps and looking at the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 forest is already 15 and 16 and will fall 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:32.869
 rising and falling is between 14 to 23 fps 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.869
 just there 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:45.140
 only when the freight is off 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:45.140
 then yes the fps increase 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.820
 but sit with freights 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.430
 but with freight switched off is 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.430
 This is pure pula pula. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.899
 and I know if I'm going to stay here I'll go 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.730
 have a good run, right? 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.080
 The video is a joke, I'm going to give a 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.080
 run here 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.700
 and guys, I do not promise but I think 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.310
 I will let all the statistics 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.420
 from fps in the description of the video to 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.510
 You 're going to be good, but I'll do it. 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:42.420
 even because I was looking for the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:49.620
 fps tests should for my plate I 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:55.590
 I really miss it and I will not let it go 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:58.830
 You go through this so I just go 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.269
 give a milestone network here but then this is it 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:11.910
 same people 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:17.090
 fps is in from 13 to 20 and 22 fps is not 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.090
 come from that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.459
 Good people, it's not because I 'm bad at 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.409
 look gay because even then maybe 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:37.209
 Our site is 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:41.469
 I hit my ass that the fox has fur 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:45.269
 fox, yes, earth 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.269
 the scenery is very crazy like this 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:02.960
 it is personal and personal and will speak but not 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:07.490
 there is a staff if you are not sure 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.740
 The guys I'm going to do other game place 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.370
 and if of these games 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.870
 When you come back to see video for sure. 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.450
 each gameplay will have at least 15 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:26.380
 minutes is only if you do not want 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.380
 Yes, but it is and remains open this question 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:44.740
 from here to be able to correct the wrong that is 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:47.130
 It's eating and it's personal who say 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.130
 possible 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:56.550
 I do not know if it's possible but it 's a business 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:03.570
 so play I'm going to fall on the cliff 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:07.110
 play hd on intel hd femme mil 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.110
 all at least 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.710
 So, everyone, at least, this is it. 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.980
 it's a possible thing no one can talk 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:22.600
 that is impossible is more then that is what 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:29.800
 You liked video, I'm going 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:33.420
 close and here it is and I'll see 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:42.220
 maybe my uncle already the video cards 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:43.630
 He has a friend who sells those goals. 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.870
 him I had technician 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.870
 then he 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.190
 Okay, I'm catching more. 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.000
 then it needs these components of the 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.750
 ipc 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.650
 and then he picks up this friend of his that does 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.250
 the prices but in account let's say so to 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.270
