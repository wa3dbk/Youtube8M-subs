 Y 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.100
 Y 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.330
 oh, what a community of video games 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.400
 I am dark 117 and today I bring a video 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.370
 that excites me since after many 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.100
 months at last 343 industries has released 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.380
 some information from yale or 5 thus is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.270
 game 5 has returned to the information of 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.070
 the channels and I'll start by saying what 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.989
 the information page tells us of the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.690
 game what the page says is what 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.150
 next at any time when the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.070
 transition to a new platform exists 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.640
 the opportunity to see things with a 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.309
 new perspective for us in 343 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.440
 industries the launch of the xbox one 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.940
 it was an opportunity to think about 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.549
 of what the stories we wanted 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.350
 tell how to tell them and the best 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.840
 way to push the halo franchise 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.030
 to show the player and the most 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.190
 important that combines the passion for 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.680
 halo with the vocal and informative contribution 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.080
 of our hello fans is not simply 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.900
 a game of the perennial franchise is a 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.150
 part of the xbox platform itself in 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.830
 terms of innovation and ideas to 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.270
 Sometimes it is important for people 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 they can not even play 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 and of course it's a passion and a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.780
 essential experience for two 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.360
 generations of players so we 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.719
 we asked how we started and where are we going 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.610
 get it on xbox one in the past the 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.280
 hey games have pushed him to the xbox 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.259
 forward showing the console and its 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.929
 ecosystem in entertaining ways and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.149
 innovative do a game of hey what 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.759
 runs at 60 frames per second in 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.679
 Dedicated servers with the scope of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.509
 characteristics and the scale that we have 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.950
 been dreaming for more than a 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.140
 decade is not trivial is a task that in 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.209
 343 industries we are taking very into 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.310
 serious to ensure that we deliver the 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.079
 game hey what the fans deserve and 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.480
 a game that is built from the 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.519
 foundations for xbox one 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.769
 I'm happy to reveal that halo 5 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.349
 guardians the new delivery of the mythical 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.989
 saga of the master boss will be launched on xbox 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.660
 one in the fall of 2015 in the tradition 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.299
 of all halo game since its debut in 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.700
 2001 is a great and exciting project 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.799
 hey the five guardians is an effort 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.780
 bigger than it applies to all the 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.640
 content and scope of departure 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.040
 as well as the technology in what now 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.380
 it's a new engine and more powerful than halo 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.510
 4 It is true that there are some elements 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.880
 basic carried over from the games 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.010
 previous but we have invested a great 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.990
 effort in the reorganization of our 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.060
 technology to make the most of 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.370
 hardware and the ecosystem of the xbox one 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.770
 to create worlds and experiences worthy of 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.200
 new generation is a game that 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.810
 hopes to demonstrate talent learning 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.600
 and skills of the 343 team 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.030
 industries a game that will incorporate 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.700
 things we learned from halo 4 about 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.220
 the technology the aesthetics the performance 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.410
 and the scale and perhaps more important the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.360
 understanding and embracing a community 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.640
 of players who love what lies in the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.760
 heart of this game and the potential 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.220
 unlimited halo universe and 2015 no 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.350
 it will only be the year of halo 5 guardians 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.959
 It will also be a year that offers us a 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.610
 unique opportunity the opportunity to 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.680
 invite old friends and new 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.840
 public in that universe through the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.760
 jay's television series launched it as 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.560
 a unique collaboration with steven 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.630
 spielberg and some of the best 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.060
 creative minds in the business 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.430
 a series that stand on their own 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.130
 as well as complement and enrich the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.990
 gaming experience will have more to 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.670
 share in the television series of 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.760
 Thread as close to your projected 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.850
 launch of the fall of 2015 your trip 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.650
 begins in 2014 many fans pointed out that 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.320
 was very deliberate with my phrasing in the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.900
 scenario at e3 last year I spoke 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.360
 about a trip more than a destination and 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.730
 that trip definitely begins in 2014 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.520
 with a big jump more than a small 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.470
 step we will give you much more information 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.920
 about our plans for this year in 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.959
 the e3 2014 xbox informative meeting the 9 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.480
 June and we are sure that the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.640
 halo fans will be very excited 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.520
 with the special plans that we have in 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.680
 the store so until 3 I would like 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.410
 express my gratitude to our community 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.480
 leave it massive and varied whose energy the 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.850
 enthusiasm, criticism and kindness 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.950
 they are the driving force behind what 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.160
 we do and what we hope to achieve in the 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.470
 5 guardians good guys after that 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.350
 paragraph we can see that hello 5 will come out 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.420
 in the fall of 2015 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.250
 but that not only will the spin game come out 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.800
 but also the series of 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.420
 television leave it in that same year now 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.460
 everything else about the game and more 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.610
 information I suppose they will give you in 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.830
 light 3 2014 and apart from that I want 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.720
 put some things here the first one is 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.730
 that according to the information the trip of 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.980
 Gilo would start this year with the 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.800
 launch of a new game but which 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.810
 game could be maybe it could be turn 2 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.720
 good anniversary that will answer 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.730
 until 3 x must then in some 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.920
 images shown of turn 5 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.960
 guardian are guardians you see the boss 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.360
 teacher with a quiet pose or something 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.700
 well xd but there you can see that there is also 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.100
 another spartan which I thought would be a 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.020
 full rodero some enemy exists but it 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.940
 you can see what the sign or symbol bears 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.220
 of the UN and everything we've seen 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.350
 leave it until now is that I heard it and it has 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.480
 turned bad something like a second 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.310
 This covenant will leave us in doubt as 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.470
 this new character will be something 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.900
 shocking since as cortana no longer 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.820
 is this character would be his replacement or 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.040
 it could be like a companion to the 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.000
 boss something like what he did the lee 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.950
 Ki-shik or 3rd century 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.200
 It can be an enemy or it can only be an 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.480
 common spartan that only players two 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.970
 you can use if you play me screen 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.160
 divided good after this 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.290
 information I say goodbye I hope they 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.730
 like the video den like subscribe and 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.730
 we'll see each other until next time 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.919
 by form
