00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.980
 there are two types of men who do not 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 they can be alone and those who can not 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.780
 be in pairs those who can not be 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.020
 in pairs they are subdivided into two others 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.510
 categories the disgusted and the cowboys 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.490
 those who have had experiences have had 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 traumatic to women's 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.570
 disgusting want to have experiences 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.640
 with more women than what has happened 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.070
 wrong with women he met four 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.710
 crazy and concluded that we are all crazy 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.120
 the wrong environments not all of these 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.829
 crazy how is your theory of the world going to 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.719
 go check it in reality 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 then he is waiting for you to 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.620
 mounts a chicken to run the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 disgusting on the contrary is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.250
 waiting for a new one to appear 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 run out where the left is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 single dish man the disgusting is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.460
 method tasting man is what 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.949
 he wants to taste everything the variety was 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.010
 Above quality or quantity 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.659
 yes 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.939
 that is not all weekends and 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.450
 I speak of communes but in your imagination 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.680
 could do it the possibility is there 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.180
 friends, I really tell you that it is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.920
 waste your time and yours 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.320
 energy trying to change these 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.630
 individuals two phrases for reflection 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.330
 in life you have to learn to choose the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.430
 battles and a withdrawal on time is a 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 victory in today's video I would like 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.360
 delve into one more type of man 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.460
 unknown more unknown because no 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.770
 comes out the cosmopolitan magazines or the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.710
 Modern town vignettes is the uncle 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.509
 that can not be with the man who does not 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.759
 everything can be the opposite of the 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.920
 neat has had very good experiences 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.690
 with women then he wants to be 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.060
 in a relationship always because we are 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.740
 rich is like when you are in your bed 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.479
 of winter there is hot and suddenly 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.280
 You take your foot out and it's comfortable and not how cold 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.409
 May I be the warm zone 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 the comfort zone because they like 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.409
 think relationship good loneliness 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.690
 then this guy when they leave him 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.490
 because they typically leave it this one 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.680
 grab a burning nail before 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.350
 leave someone and have a window of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.360
 single very very very brief that goes from 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.040
 a few days to a few hours 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.230
 so if you want to have a boyfriend you have 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.000
 that learn to identify it quickly 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.620
 three keys to learn to identify 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.540
 to this enemy number one to write 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.209
 describes with a purpose that is to remain 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.400
 he does not write you because he gets bored 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.100
 write to get the ego not you 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.320
 write to stay stereo today's tennis 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.470
 we see ourselves such a day at such time in such 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.870
 site is and the most important thing is the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.350
 appointment does not give you the last hour 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.060
 track number two is coursing appointments not 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.950
 It has to be a luxury restaurant 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.840
 It can be a romantic walk through the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.300
 beach or by the river but there has been there is a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.760
 thought of after a cured appointment not 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.470
 is to go to the typical bar eto'o that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.690
 coincidentally it's only five minutes away 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.350
 his house third track that I would say that 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.800
 is 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.720
 and this day he listens to you he listens to you and 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.360
 although it is not marketing will use 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.910
 that information that big data for 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.550
 optimize the user experience or 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.560
 be you the next appointment next 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.870
 appointment to be more cured you will have more 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.990
 topics of conversation will ultimately be 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.670
 better and some of you will be thinking or 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.110
 that if we've been sending a message for two years 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.150
 but he never wants me to stay is that he does not 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.800
 wants to swim with me not a friend if I do not 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.080
 I'm laughing at you this is a 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.900
 concept that to me still to this day 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.760
 it costs me it costs me I recommend you 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.650
 when you meet an uncle like that 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.110
 let you carry you let yourself go if you 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.820
 you have to enter a relationship get me 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.710
 it does not matter if you're not sure that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.080
 I do not care if you're not sure 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.850
 you want a relationship your mind I 'm going 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.770
 to explain why because like that when 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.170
 pass the time if you see that you really 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.390
 like, look how good you already have a boyfriend and 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.010
 if you do not like it then leave it alone 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.600
 do not worry about the one that will not last 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.160
 a lot of time in the market as you 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.030
 think a lot will end with the first 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.830
 I will match him or he will return with his ex 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.290
 I marry that these guys like feed 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.360

 I'm alone and I'm fine so three 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.750
 demanding devious scientists is typical 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.790
 weird as the typical one that is going to end 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.190
 living with his sister 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.020
