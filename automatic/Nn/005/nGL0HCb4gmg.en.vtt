creates new strands of hairs okay that
being<00:01:14.620> said<00:01:14.920> number<00:01:15.580> one<00:01:15.820> do<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.420> consume

being said number one do you consume
enough<00:01:17.320> protein<00:01:17.890> right<00:01:18.130> protein<00:01:18.970> is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
enough protein right protein is

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.899 
enough protein right protein is
essential<00:01:19.360> for<00:01:19.870> hair<00:01:20.380> growth<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.520> reason

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
essential for hair growth the reason

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.050 
essential for hair growth the reason
being<00:01:22.150> is<00:01:22.680> protein<00:01:23.680> is<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.010> building<00:01:24.790> blocks

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
being is protein is a building blocks

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.940 
being is protein is a building blocks
pretty<00:01:25.540> much<00:01:25.690> for<00:01:25.930> all<00:01:25.960> your<00:01:26.200> hormones<00:01:26.740> right

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
pretty much for all your hormones right

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.330

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so if you're eating a low protein diet

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.190 
so if you're eating a low protein diet
there's<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.760> know<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.909> first<00:01:31.299> place<00:01:31.810> they<00:01:32.020> can

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
there's you know a first place they can

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.100 
there's you know a first place they can
look<00:01:32.380> at<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:32.830> always<00:01:33.159> consume<00:01:33.820> good<00:01:34.540> quality

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
look at so always consume good quality

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.320 
look at so always consume good quality
proteins<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.490> depends<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:36.940> what<00:01:37.090> kind<00:01:37.119> of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
proteins so it depends on what kind of

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.330 
proteins so it depends on what kind of

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
is C these days and to couple that

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.300 
is C these days and to couple that
together<00:02:05.020> with<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.590> fact<00:02:05.799> that<00:02:05.890> we're<00:02:06.070> so

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
together with the fact that we're so

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.710 
together with the fact that we're so
stressed<00:02:06.670> out<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.600> actually

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
stressed out that it's actually

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.109 
stressed out that it's actually
depleting<00:02:08.649> vitamin<00:02:08.979> C<00:02:09.099> from<00:02:09.310> our<00:02:09.459> body<00:02:09.670> and
