00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.600 
it's it's a you get a little bit of
discoloration<00:01:06.200> whereas<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.040> Kobo<00:01:07.310> it's<00:01:07.460> very

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
discoloration whereas the Kobo it's very

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.540 
discoloration whereas the Kobo it's very
consistent<00:01:08.240> very<00:01:08.300> soft<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.230> it's<00:01:10.220> actually

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
consistent very soft and it's actually

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.080 
consistent very soft and it's actually
very<00:01:10.580> white<00:01:11.140> yeah<00:01:12.140> I<00:01:12.170> mean<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:12.770> think<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.400> lot<00:01:14.060> of

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
very white yeah I mean I think a lot of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.690 
very white yeah I mean I think a lot of
the<00:01:14.330> reason<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.050> discoloration<00:01:15.920> on<00:01:16.220> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
the reason of the discoloration on the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.810 
the reason of the discoloration on the
Sybok<00:01:17.510> is<00:01:17.780> because<00:01:18.200> most<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.830> UI<00:01:19.070> elements

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
Sybok is because most of the UI elements

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.050 
Sybok is because most of the UI elements
are<00:01:20.000> black<00:01:20.510> and<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.800> really<00:01:22.220> kind<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.640> see

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
are black and so you really kind of see

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.230 
are black and so you really kind of see
and<00:01:23.570> your<00:01:24.530> eyes<00:01:24.740> sort<00:01:25.070> of<00:01:25.190> gravitate<00:01:25.760> towards

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
and your eyes sort of gravitate towards

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.920 
and your eyes sort of gravitate towards
like<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.600> purplish<00:01:27.200> type<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:28.060> glow<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:29.630> I'm

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
like that purplish type of glow but I'm

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.010 
like that purplish type of glow but I'm
gonna<00:01:30.320> I'm<00:01:30.530> gonna<00:01:30.770> also<00:01:31.010> say<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.240> Kobo

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
gonna I'm gonna also say that the Kobo

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.710 
gonna I'm gonna also say that the Kobo
aura<00:01:33.260> it's<00:01:34.100> more<00:01:34.490> white<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:35.450> more

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
aura it's more white and it's more

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.050 
aura it's more white and it's more
evenly<00:01:36.170> distributed<00:01:36.950> even<00:01:37.250> without<00:01:37.640> because

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
evenly distributed even without because

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300 
evenly distributed even without because
these<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.420> could<00:01:38.510> see<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.840> blacks<00:01:39.170> here<00:01:40.070> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
these you could see the blacks here and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.090 
these you could see the blacks here and
those<00:01:40.910> aren't<00:01:41.150> really<00:01:41.450> looking<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.560> same<00:01:42.830> as

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
those aren't really looking the same as

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.030 
those aren't really looking the same as
the<00:01:43.430> black<00:01:43.670> sphere<00:01:44.560> exactly<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:45.860> what<00:01:45.950> we're

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
the black sphere exactly so what we're

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.130 
the black sphere exactly so what we're
gonna<00:01:46.100> do<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.520> take<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.120> to<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.600> extremities

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
gonna do is take it to the extremities

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.080 
gonna do is take it to the extremities
of<00:01:48.170> each<00:01:48.410> side<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:48.950> we're<00:01:49.100> gonna<00:01:49.220> drop<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:50.000> down

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
of each side so we're gonna drop it down

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.560 
of each side so we're gonna drop it down
all<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.540> way<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.930> bottom<00:01:51.110> as<00:01:51.970> well<00:01:52.970> as<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
all the way to the bottom as well as the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.220 
all the way to the bottom as well as the
Kobo<00:01:53.900> aura<00:01:53.950> now<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.010> can<00:01:55.250> tell<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.540> side

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
Kobo aura now you can tell that the side

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.490 
Kobo aura now you can tell that the side
book<00:01:57.410> is<00:01:57.560> still<00:01:57.830> very<00:01:58.250> bright<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:59.810> can

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
book is still very bright and that can

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500 
book is still very bright and that can
be<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.620> contributing<00:02:00.920> factor<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.550> your<00:02:02.060> battery

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
be a contributing factor to your battery

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.690 
be a contributing factor to your battery
life<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.900> lasting<00:02:03.320> as<00:02:03.380> long<00:02:03.590> whereas<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
life not lasting as long whereas the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.180 
life not lasting as long whereas the
Kobo<00:02:05.120> aura<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.840> at<00:02:06.200> its<00:02:06.380> very<00:02:06.530> lowest<00:02:06.800> which<00:02:07.070> is

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
Kobo aura is at its very lowest which is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.219 
Kobo aura is at its very lowest which is
about<00:02:07.400> 1%<00:02:07.760> and<00:02:08.209> although<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.840> may<00:02:08.959> show

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
about 1% and although it may show

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.229 
about 1% and although it may show
complete<00:02:09.830> darkness<00:02:10.129> on<00:02:10.399> camera<00:02:10.879> it<00:02:11.060> is

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
complete darkness on camera it is

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.449 
complete darkness on camera it is
actually<00:02:11.659> a<00:02:11.689> little<00:02:11.870> bit<00:02:12.049> readable<00:02:12.469> in<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
actually a little bit readable in the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.150 
actually a little bit readable in the
studio<00:02:13.819> here<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.359> keep

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
studio here so keep

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.070 
studio here so keep
mind<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.880> now<00:02:16.300> we're<00:02:16.450> gonna<00:02:16.570> turn<00:02:16.750> them<00:02:16.960> all

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
mind and now we're gonna turn them all

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.800 
mind and now we're gonna turn them all
to<00:02:17.320> 100%<00:02:19.890> now<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.400> still<00:02:21.670> see<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
to 100% now you can still see that the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.020 
to 100% now you can still see that the
Kobo<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.470> very<00:02:23.770> consistent<00:02:24.250> no<00:02:24.490> matter<00:02:24.550> where

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
Kobo is very consistent no matter where

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670 
Kobo is very consistent no matter where
you<00:02:25.240> put<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.660> bar<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:26.140> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.350> be<00:02:26.500> nice

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
you put the bar it's going to be nice

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.010 
you put the bar it's going to be nice
and<00:02:26.710> soft<00:02:27.130> nice<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.940> even<00:02:28.420> throughout<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
and soft nice and even throughout the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.080 
and soft nice and even throughout the
where<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.890> bezel<00:02:30.220> touches<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.820> device

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
where the bezel touches the device

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.940 
where the bezel touches the device
whereas<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.170> side<00:02:32.440> book<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.740> see<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
whereas on the side book you see a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.160 
whereas on the side book you see a
little<00:02:33.130> bit<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.430> darkness<00:02:33.910> at<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.120> bottom<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
little bit of darkness at the bottom the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.590 
little bit of darkness at the bottom the
light<00:02:35.440> splashes<00:02:36.100> harshly<00:02:36.430> at<00:02:36.730> time<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.390> it's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
light splashes harshly at time so it's

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.350 
light splashes harshly at time so it's
not<00:02:37.810> as<00:02:38.080> consistent<00:02:38.860> as<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.340> Kobo<00:02:39.910> aura<00:02:40.060> and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
not as consistent as the Kobo aura and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.800 
not as consistent as the Kobo aura and
note<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.500> Kobo<00:02:42.250> second<00:02:42.880> glow<00:02:43.600> light

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
note that this is Kobo second glow light

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.210 
note that this is Kobo second glow light
device<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.290> they've<00:02:44.440> had<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.620> lot<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.920> time<00:02:45.070> to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
device so they've had a lot of time to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.910 
device so they've had a lot of time to
refine<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.550> yeah<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.330> mean<00:02:46.690> Cobos<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.710> just

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
refine it yeah I mean Cobos I think just

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.810 
refine it yeah I mean Cobos I think just
a<00:02:48.010> bigger<00:02:48.220> company<00:02:48.550> with<00:02:49.090> their<00:02:49.630> huge<00:02:50.230> ebook

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
a bigger company with their huge ebook

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.540 
a bigger company with their huge ebook
ecosystem<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:53.040> constantly<00:02:54.040> putting<00:02:54.370> out

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
ecosystem and constantly putting out

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.180 
ecosystem and constantly putting out
devices<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:55.660> let's<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.470> take<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.710> look<00:02:57.010> at

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
devices so let's just take a look at

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.520 
devices so let's just take a look at
what<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.760> reading<00:02:58.120> experience<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:59.080> so

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
what the reading experience is like so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.530 
what the reading experience is like so
with<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.460> Kobo<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:00.880> mean<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.180> could<00:03:01.330> see<00:03:01.510> it

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
with the Kobo I mean you could see it

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.960 
with the Kobo I mean you could see it
text<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.260> fonts<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.920> little<00:03:03.370> bit<00:03:03.490> darker<00:03:03.940> a

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
text and fonts a little bit darker a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.570 
text and fonts a little bit darker a
little<00:03:04.180> bit<00:03:04.300> saturated<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.620> isn't<00:03:06.160> as<00:03:06.280> dark

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
little bit saturated this isn't as dark

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.730 
little bit saturated this isn't as dark
although<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.030> can<00:03:07.390> configure<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.500> I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
although you can configure it but I

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.220 
although you can configure it but I
think<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.310> Kobo<00:03:09.730> gives<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.210> just<00:03:10.480> deeper

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
think the Kobo gives you just deeper

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.130 
think the Kobo gives you just deeper
levels<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.800> configuration<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.030> make<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.780> text

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
levels of configuration to make the text

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.410 
levels of configuration to make the text
lighter<00:03:14.440> make<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.980> text<00:03:15.310> darker<00:03:15.730> right<00:03:16.180> I

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
lighter make the text darker right I

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.570 
lighter make the text darker right I
mean<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.200> front<00:03:17.620> light<00:03:17.800> device<00:03:18.370> what

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
mean with the front light device what

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.070 
mean with the front light device what
you're<00:03:18.700> trying<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> avoid<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> light

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
you're trying to avoid is the light

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.510 
you're trying to avoid is the light
bothering<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.830> it's<00:03:21.010> supposed<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.400> be

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
bothering you it's supposed to be

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.000 
bothering you it's supposed to be
seamless<00:03:21.940> whereas<00:03:22.240> on<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.590> side<00:03:23.800> book

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
seamless whereas on the on the side book

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.310 
seamless whereas on the on the side book
it's<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.280> little<00:03:24.550> too<00:03:24.730> bright<00:03:24.970> at<00:03:25.930> its<00:03:26.170> highest

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
it's a little too bright at its highest

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.410 
it's a little too bright at its highest
level<00:03:26.800> it's<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.220> it's<00:03:27.490> just<00:03:27.610> too<00:03:28.090> glaring

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
level it's just it's just too glaring

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.470 
level it's just it's just too glaring
and<00:03:28.750> you're<00:03:28.980> kind<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.040> in-your-face<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.880> you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
and you're kind of in-your-face so you

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.530 
and you're kind of in-your-face so you
have<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.690> find<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.020> comfortable<00:03:32.500> level<00:03:32.680> to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
have to find a comfortable level to

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.720 
have to find a comfortable level to
really<00:03:34.540> get<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.110> that's<00:03:35.740> about<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.280> same<00:03:36.490> as

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
really get it that's about the same as

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.770 
really get it that's about the same as
the<00:03:36.850> Kobo<00:03:37.240> right<00:03:37.690> there<00:03:38.940> yeah<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.330> mean<00:03:40.540> I

the Kobo right there yeah and I mean I
think<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.560> Kobo<00:03:42.010> gives<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> little<00:03:43.180> bit

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
think the Kobo gives you a little bit

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.560 
think the Kobo gives you a little bit
more<00:03:43.570> versatility<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.830> find<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.570> when

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
more versatility and I find that when

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.900 
more versatility and I find that when
you're<00:03:46.750> doing<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.860> brightness<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.310> slider

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
you're doing the brightness the slider

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.350 
you're doing the brightness the slider
bar<00:03:49.270> really<00:03:49.630> helps<00:03:50.400> right<00:03:51.400> where's<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:52.060> is
