00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
does a good lawyer look like how do you

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.730 
does a good lawyer look like how do you
get<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> good<00:00:11.880> lawyer<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> p.m.<00:00:13.469> and

pixhawk so what I'll do is actually talk
through<00:00:16.740> these<00:00:16.890> steps<00:00:17.160> cut<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.000> previous

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
through these steps cut to some previous

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.170 
through these steps cut to some previous
clips<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> guys<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.670> steps<00:00:20.970> that

I<00:02:05.869> did<00:02:05.960> next<00:02:06.380> was<00:02:06.590> added<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.340> GPS<00:02:07.820> compass

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
I did next was added the GPS compass

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:19.520 
I did next was added the GPS compass
stand<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.959> ran<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> test<00:02:09.860> again

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.880 

now<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.590> can<00:02:20.890> see<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.580> with<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.120> stand<00:02:22.450> our

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
now you can see that with the stand our

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.380 
now you can see that with the stand our
interference<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.040> substantially<00:02:24.790> lower<00:02:25.000> at

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
interference is substantially lower at

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.690 
interference is substantially lower at
4%<00:02:25.930> once<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.709> take<00:02:26.920> care<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.280> those<00:02:27.459> items

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
4% once you take care of those items

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.580 
4% once you take care of those items
you're<00:02:27.970> ready<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.390> get<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.810> air<00:02:29.019> but<00:02:29.349> not

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
you're ready to get in the air but not

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.949 
you're ready to get in the air but not
quite<00:02:29.920> ready<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.489> loiter<00:02:30.940> yet<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.629> I<00:02:31.660> always

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
quite ready to loiter yet so I always

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.410 
quite ready to loiter yet so I always
recommend<00:02:32.489> getting<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.610> up<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.880> stabilized

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
recommend getting it up in stabilized

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.110 
recommend getting it up in stabilized
mode<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.050> then<00:02:35.620> running<00:02:35.980> an<00:02:36.190> auto<00:02:36.400> tune<00:02:36.760> I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
mode and then running an auto tune I

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.930 
mode and then running an auto tune I
have<00:02:37.720> auto<00:02:37.989> tune<00:02:38.319> set<00:02:38.709> up<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.069> switch<00:02:39.400> on<00:02:39.640> my

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
transmitter make sure that you do this

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.910 
transmitter make sure that you do this
on<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.209> calm<00:02:43.510> day<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.110> you'll<00:02:44.560> notice<00:02:44.769> that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
on a calm day and you'll notice that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.119 
on a calm day and you'll notice that
it's<00:02:45.400> currently<00:02:45.879> tuning<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.140> roll<00:02:47.379> axis<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
it's currently tuning the roll axis and

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.820 
it's currently tuning the roll axis and
then<00:02:48.700> will<00:02:48.880> automatically<00:02:49.540> switch<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.080> the

back<00:03:09.250> down<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:10.060> can<00:03:10.209> always<00:03:10.390> feel<00:03:10.720> free<00:03:10.750> to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
back down you can always feel free to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.350 
back down you can always feel free to
tweak<00:03:11.349> those<00:03:11.560> gains<00:03:11.829> sometimes<00:03:12.579> they're<00:03:13.329> not

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
tweak those gains sometimes they're not

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.589 
tweak those gains sometimes they're not
perfect<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.319> I'll<00:03:14.470> need<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.769> go<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.099> and<00:03:15.400> adjust

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
perfect so I'll need to go in and adjust

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.210 
perfect so I'll need to go in and adjust
so<00:03:16.599> once<00:03:16.840> that's<00:03:17.019> done<00:03:17.349> you're<00:03:17.620> ready<00:03:17.799> to

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so once that's done you're ready to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.330 
so once that's done you're ready to
loiter<00:03:18.700> make<00:03:19.150> sure<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.540> got<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.959> good<00:03:20.410> GPS<00:03:21.040> fix

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
loiter make sure you got a good GPS fix

into<00:03:26.319> loiter

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.830 

we're<00:03:29.920> in<00:03:30.040> loiter<00:03:30.310> mode<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:31.450> always

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
we're in loiter mode and I always

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.140 
we're in loiter mode and I always
recommend<00:03:32.079> doing<00:03:32.680> your<00:03:33.220> initial<00:03:33.430> test<00:03:33.880> on<00:03:34.120> a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
recommend doing your initial test on a

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.750 
recommend doing your initial test on a
less<00:03:34.450> windy<00:03:34.840> day<00:03:35.019> today<00:03:35.470> there<00:03:35.920> were<00:03:36.069> about<00:03:36.100> 12

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
less windy day today there were about 12

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.960 
less windy day today there were about 12
to<00:03:37.120> 15<00:03:37.299> mile<00:03:37.780> an<00:03:37.959> hour<00:03:38.049> winds<00:03:38.470> but<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.549> you<00:03:39.790> can

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
to 15 mile an hour winds but as you can

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.970 
to 15 mile an hour winds but as you can
tell<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.540> not<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.049> first<00:03:41.260> test<00:03:41.709> and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
tell this is not the first test and

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.150 
tell this is not the first test and
loiter<00:03:42.489> held<00:03:42.880> position<00:03:43.569> and<00:03:43.780> altitude<00:03:44.410> very

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
loiter held position and altitude very

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.240 
loiter held position and altitude very
well<00:03:45.600> while<00:03:46.600> in<00:03:46.810> loader<00:03:47.049> mode<00:03:47.350> your<00:03:47.859> stick

well while in loader mode your stick

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.370 
well while in loader mode your stick
inputs<00:03:48.790> will<00:03:49.090> still<00:03:49.329> work<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.780> can<00:03:49.930> see<00:03:50.139> here

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
inputs will still work you can see here

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.099 
inputs will still work you can see here
that<00:03:50.620> I'm<00:03:50.829> giving<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.940> y'all<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.840> left

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
that I'm giving it y'all to the left

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.890 
that I'm giving it y'all to the left
just<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.130> let<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.340> spin<00:03:54.790> while<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.389> stays<00:03:55.690> in

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
just to let it spin while it stays in

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.370 
just to let it spin while it stays in
location<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.829> then<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.519> begin<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.000> yaw<00:03:58.780> back<00:03:59.049> to

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
location and then I begin to yaw back to

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:08.339 
location and then I begin to yaw back to
the<00:03:59.500> right

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.050 

so<00:04:09.349> those<00:04:09.530> are<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.770> steps<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:10.310> go<00:04:10.490> through<00:04:10.790> to

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
so those are the steps I go through to

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.210 
so those are the steps I go through to
get<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.540> good<00:04:11.750> loiter<00:04:12.020> there's<00:04:12.440> further<00:04:12.739> tuning

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
get a good loiter there's further tuning

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.280 
get a good loiter there's further tuning
you<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.520> do<00:04:13.700> but<00:04:14.060> those<00:04:14.270> will<00:04:14.510> definitely<00:04:15.080> get

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
you can do but those will definitely get
