or I'd like to show you now about the

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.370 
or I'd like to show you now about the
TMC<00:00:03.989> traffic<00:00:04.529> message<00:00:05.010> channel<00:00:06.170> may<00:00:07.170> not<00:00:07.200> be

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
TMC traffic message channel may not be

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.470 
TMC traffic message channel may not be
viewable<00:00:08.160> there<00:00:08.519> but<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.910> two<00:00:09.120> indicators

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
viewable there but I have two indicators

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.079 
viewable there but I have two indicators
here<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.379> GPS<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.219> one<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.910> says

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:12.089 
here one this is GPS and one that says

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.539 
here one this is GPS and one that says
TMC<00:00:12.660> their<00:00:13.619> indicators<00:00:14.249> are<00:00:14.400> both

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
TMC their indicators are both

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.460 
TMC their indicators are both
illuminated<00:00:15.209> meaning<00:00:15.629> i'm<00:00:15.780> receiving<00:00:16.139> both

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
illuminated meaning i'm receiving both

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.529 
illuminated meaning i'm receiving both
of<00:00:16.710> them<00:00:16.890> i<00:00:17.179> have<00:00:18.179> connected<00:00:18.510> behind<00:00:19.699> the<00:00:20.699> TMC

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
of them i have connected behind the TMC

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.349 
of them i have connected behind the TMC
antenna<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:22.949> receiving<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.460> TMC<00:00:23.759> signal

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
antenna so I'm receiving a TMC signal

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
antenna so I'm receiving a TMC signal
and<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:25.470> example<00:00:25.560> now<00:00:26.009> I'll<00:00:26.189> make<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:28.099> trip<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and for example now I'll make a trip and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.980 
and for example now I'll make a trip and
I'll<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:29.849> right<00:00:30.390> through<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> center<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
I'll go right through the center of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.790 
I'll go right through the center of
Paris<00:00:31.499> I'll<00:00:31.740> say<00:00:31.949> navigate<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.440> I'll<00:00:34.440> give

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
Paris I'll say navigate to and I'll give

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.160 
Paris I'll say navigate to and I'll give
it<00:00:35.000> let's<00:00:36.000> say<00:00:36.210> i'll<00:00:36.420> navigate<00:00:36.780> via<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:39.170> point

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it let's say i'll navigate via a point

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.720 
it let's say i'll navigate via a point
in<00:00:40.289> the<00:00:40.379> city<00:00:40.649> let's<00:00:40.980> say

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.180 

a<00:00:44.840> point<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.899> interest<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.559> city<00:00:46.800> pardon

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
a point of interest in the city pardon

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.910 
a point of interest in the city pardon
so<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> go<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.630> city<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.320> Paris

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:00.410 
so I'm going to go to the city of Paris
France<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.120> actually

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
France and right here it's actually

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.880 
France and right here it's actually
there's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.839> bar<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.290> across<00:01:01.440> our

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
there's a bar going across our

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.590 
there's a bar going across our
calculating<00:01:02.610> all<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> different<00:01:03.150> Paris's

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
calculating all the different Paris's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
calculating all the different Paris's
because<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.640> country<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.670> France

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
because actually the country of France

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240 
because actually the country of France
is<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.240> than<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.509> Paris<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.800> I'll<00:01:07.860> click<00:01:08.009> on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250

the traffic messaging channel i can say
make<00:01:47.340> sure<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.759> avoid<00:01:47.910> that<00:01:48.420> any<00:01:52.250> any<00:01:53.250> roots

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
make sure you avoid that any any roots

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.749 
make sure you avoid that any any roots
matter<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.420> fact<00:01:54.599> it<00:01:54.929> automatically<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.250> I

the device is set to avoid traffic using

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.600 
the device is set to avoid traffic using
the<00:02:05.369> TMC<00:02:06.410> information<00:02:07.410> so<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.130> there<00:02:08.369> was

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the TMC information so if there was

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.690 
the TMC information so if there was
traffic<00:02:08.970> already<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:10.200> would<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.590> avoided<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
traffic already it would be avoided you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
traffic already it would be avoided you
can<00:02:11.849> actually<00:02:12.030> see<00:02:12.239> up<00:02:12.540> here<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.930> looks<00:02:13.080> like

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
can actually see up here that looks like

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.559 
can actually see up here that looks like
there's<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.500> little<00:02:13.709> accident<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.970> here<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
there's a little accident up here and

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.500 
there's a little accident up here and
actually<00:02:16.530> my<00:02:17.010> route<00:02:17.280> does<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.849> go<00:02:18.060> through<00:02:18.360> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
actually my route does not go through it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.480 
actually my route does not go through it
but<00:02:19.200> had<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.470> done<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.370> would<00:02:21.060> have<00:02:21.150> avoided
