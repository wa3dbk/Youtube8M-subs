and hopefully it can be our day it's

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.520 
and hopefully it can be our day it's
been<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> an<00:00:39.660> up-and-down<00:00:39.930> season<00:00:40.050> for

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
been a bit of an up-and-down season for

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.350 
been a bit of an up-and-down season for
us<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.860> honest<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.820> thinking<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> league

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
us to be honest my thinking the league

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.030 
us to be honest my thinking the league
we<00:00:42.629> haven't<00:00:42.809> achieved<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.860> heights

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
we haven't achieved that the heights

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.279 
we haven't achieved that the heights
were<00:00:44.250> capable<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.120> taking<00:00:45.450> away<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> think

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
were capable of taking away that I think

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.549 
were capable of taking away that I think
the<00:00:46.440> cut<00:00:47.309> run<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> bonus<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.110> think

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the cut run is a bonus and I think

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
the cut run is a bonus and I think
that's<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.980> sort<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> set<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.550> our<00:00:50.820> season

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that's really sort of set off our season

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
that's really sort of set off our season
I<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.329> trivia<00:00:51.629> play<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.350> twice<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.710> year

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
I like trivia play them twice this year

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.700 
I like trivia play them twice this year
in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> league<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.539> I<00:00:54.539> think<00:00:54.750> miss<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
in the league but I think miss when you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.049 
in the league but I think miss when you
get<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> day<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.370> an<00:00:56.610> occasion<00:00:57.030> like

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
get to a day like this an occasion like

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.819 
get to a day like this an occasion like
this<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.620> team

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this I think it's down to it the team

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.920 
this I think it's down to it the team
which<00:00:59.010> deal<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> pressure<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
which deal with the pressure and all the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.569 
which deal with the pressure and all the
atmosphere<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> best<00:01:01.649> travel<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.219> right<00:01:02.370> now

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
atmosphere the best travel it right now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.759 
atmosphere the best travel it right now
and<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.719> feel<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> sort<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> atmosphere

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and you get feel at a sort of atmosphere

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010 
and you get feel at a sort of atmosphere
and<00:01:05.220> what<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> could<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> couple<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
