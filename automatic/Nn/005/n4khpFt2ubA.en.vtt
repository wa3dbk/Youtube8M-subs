00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
you a number for like in Halo 3 they you

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.410 
you a number for like in Halo 3 they you
were<00:04:03.520> here<00:04:03.670> 50<00:04:04.210> or<00:04:04.870> 30<00:04:05.230> or<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.500> 10-7<00:04:06.490> and<00:04:07.150> they

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
were here 50 or 30 or a 10-7 and they

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.260 
were here 50 or 30 or a 10-7 and they
gave<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.830> number<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:09.220> what<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.610> were<00:04:09.790> and

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
gave you a number of what you were and

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.150 
gave you a number of what you were and
then<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.900> can<00:04:11.080> they<00:04:11.230> don't<00:04:11.410> really<00:04:11.650> tell<00:04:11.800> you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
then this can they don't really tell you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.140 
then this can they don't really tell you
it's<00:04:12.400> weird<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.330> have<00:04:13.930> your<00:04:13.959> ear<00:04:15.150> military

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
it's weird so you have your ear military

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.240 
it's weird so you have your ear military
rank<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.930> think<00:04:17.410> I'm<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.680> sergeant

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
rank so I think I'm like a sergeant

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.340 
rank so I think I'm like a sergeant
grade<00:04:18.400> 2<00:04:18.630> starting<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> create<00:04:19.840> one<00:04:20.049> or<00:04:20.170> one<00:04:20.320> of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
grade 2 starting to create one or one of

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.010 
grade 2 starting to create one or one of
those<00:04:20.500> two<00:04:20.709> rights<00:04:20.920> and<00:04:21.040> then<00:04:21.690> they<00:04:22.690> give<00:04:22.900> you

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
those two rights and then they give you

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.310 
those two rights and then they give you
like<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.230> random<00:04:23.620> four-digit<00:04:24.370> number<00:04:25.110> next<00:04:26.110> to

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
like a random four-digit number next to

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.530 
like a random four-digit number next to
your<00:04:26.470> arena<00:04:26.800> link<00:04:27.130> now<00:04:27.790> there's<00:04:27.970> only<00:04:28.030> two

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
your arena link now there's only two

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.180 
your arena link now there's only two
things<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:28.870> arena<00:04:29.140> team<00:04:29.500> doubles<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.070> team

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
things that arena team doubles and team

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.530 
things that arena team doubles and team
so<00:04:30.370> that's<00:04:30.640> all<00:04:30.730> I<00:04:30.760> have<00:04:30.850> there<00:04:31.240> yet<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:32.100> I

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
so that's all I have there yet and I

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.900 
so that's all I have there yet and I
don't<00:04:34.540> know<00:04:34.900> what<00:04:35.320> your<00:04:35.500> numbers<00:04:35.890> mean<00:04:36.220> I'm

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
don't know what your numbers mean I'm

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.370 
don't know what your numbers mean I'm
still<00:04:37.180> trying<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.480> figure<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:37.750> out<00:04:37.930> I'm<00:04:38.169> sure

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
still trying to figure that out I'm sure

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.630 
still trying to figure that out I'm sure
I'll<00:04:38.440> figure<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.710> out<00:04:38.830> by<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.160> time<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:39.520> guys

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
I'll figure it out by the time you guys

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.980 
I'll figure it out by the time you guys
service<00:04:40.030> but<00:04:40.960> my<00:04:41.140> number<00:04:41.200> is<00:04:41.740> like<00:04:41.890> 1500<00:04:42.990> and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
service but my number is like 1500 and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.840 
service but my number is like 1500 and
I'm<00:04:44.080> like<00:04:44.290> thinking<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:45.970> number<00:04:47.850> your

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
I'm like thinking is that number your

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.610 
I'm like thinking is that number your
ranking<00:04:49.240> out<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.480> everybody<00:04:49.900> was<00:04:50.050> playing<00:04:50.260> so

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
ranking out of everybody was playing so

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.320 
ranking out of everybody was playing so
like<00:04:50.740> one<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.250> best<00:04:51.400> I<00:04:51.610> really<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:52.030> couldn't

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
like one is the best I really I couldn't

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.030 
like one is the best I really I couldn't
tell<00:04:52.510> you<00:04:52.630> what<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.810> means<00:04:52.930> I'm<00:04:53.680> sure<00:04:53.919> I'll

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
tell you what it means I'm sure I'll

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.750 
tell you what it means I'm sure I'll
figure<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.280> out<00:04:54.340> eventually<00:04:54.630> um<00:04:56.520> tying<00:04:57.520> into

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
figure it out eventually um tying into

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.340 
figure it out eventually um tying into
the<00:04:57.910> things<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.360> don't<00:04:58.419> like<00:04:58.690> about<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:59.169> game

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
the things I don't like about the game

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.520 
the things I don't like about the game
they<00:05:00.220> added<00:05:00.669> a<00:05:00.760> new<00:05:01.080> thing<00:05:02.080> with<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.350> way<00:05:02.470> you

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
they added a new thing with the way you

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.230 
they added a new thing with the way you
shoot<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:03.370> some<00:05:03.930> accuracy<00:05:04.930> circles<00:05:05.560> so<00:05:06.240> when

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
shoot it some accuracy circles so when

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.810 
shoot it some accuracy circles so when
you're<00:05:07.390> shooting<00:05:07.600> like<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.460> battle<00:05:09.460> rifle<00:05:09.790> or

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
you're shooting like the battle rifle or

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.670 
you're shooting like the battle rifle or
what's<00:05:10.360> called<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.600> DMR<00:05:11.140> and<00:05:11.260> this<00:05:11.350> game<00:05:11.530> is

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
what's called the DMR and this game is

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.140 
what's called the DMR and this game is
pretty<00:05:11.830> somewhere<00:05:12.130> though<00:05:12.430> when<00:05:13.060> you're

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
pretty somewhere though when you're

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.690 
pretty somewhere though when you're
shooting<00:05:13.360> that<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:14.680> circles<00:05:15.130> get<00:05:15.280> bigger<00:05:15.490> and

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
shooting that the circles get bigger and

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.090 
shooting that the circles get bigger and
bigger<00:05:15.729> as<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.150> shoot<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.260> as<00:05:17.470> you<00:05:17.500> shoot<00:05:17.950> it

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
bigger as you shoot so as you shoot it

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.469 
bigger as you shoot so as you shoot it
becomes<00:05:18.370> harder<00:05:18.729> and<00:05:18.760> harder<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.330> more

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
becomes harder and harder and more

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.750 
becomes harder and harder and more
accurate<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.740> your<00:05:20.950> bullet<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.520> going<00:05:21.669> to

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
accurate that your bullet is going to

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.270 
accurate that your bullet is going to
hit<00:05:21.970> where<00:05:22.210> you're<00:05:22.360> shooting<00:05:22.540> it<00:05:22.750> at<00:05:22.840> so<00:05:23.280> I've

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
hit where you're shooting it at so I've

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.440 
hit where you're shooting it at so I've
come<00:05:24.940> across<00:05:25.919> gunfights<00:05:26.919> where<00:05:27.100> I<00:05:27.130> have<00:05:28.030> first

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
come across gunfights where I have first

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.230 
come across gunfights where I have first
shot<00:05:28.570> on<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:29.440> guy<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.520> I'll<00:05:30.700> get<00:05:30.910> them<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.120> no

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
shot on a guy and I'll get them to no

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.700 
shot on a guy and I'll get them to no
shields<00:05:31.720> and<00:05:31.930> I'll<00:05:31.990> try<00:05:32.229> and<00:05:32.260> shoot<00:05:32.530> them<00:05:32.590> in

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
shields and I'll try and shoot them in

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.010 
shields and I'll try and shoot them in
the<00:05:32.740> head<00:05:32.830> with<00:05:33.070> my<00:05:33.160> DMR

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
the head with my DMR

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.230 
the head with my DMR
shoot<00:05:34.259> him<00:05:34.319> four<00:05:34.560> times<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:35.190> every<00:05:36.000> single

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
shoot him four times and every single

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.450 
shoot him four times and every single
bowl<00:05:36.539> will<00:05:36.750> mess<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.169> then<00:05:37.289> he'll<00:05:37.500> just<00:05:37.620> come

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
bowl will mess and then he'll just come

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.499 
bowl will mess and then he'll just come
up<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.789> beat<00:05:38.940> me<00:05:39.060> down<00:05:39.210> twice<00:05:41.180> which<00:05:42.180> is<00:05:42.360> that

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
up and beat me down twice which is that

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.180 
up and beat me down twice which is that
one<00:05:42.720> knowing<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:43.379> just<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:44.009> feel<00:05:44.370> like<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.919> brings

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
one knowing I just I feel like it brings

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.450 
one knowing I just I feel like it brings
in<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.520> luck<00:05:47.789> factor<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:49.009> shooting<00:05:50.009> a<00:05:50.099> gun<00:05:50.250> no

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
in a luck factor to shooting a gun no

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.309 
in a luck factor to shooting a gun no
not<00:05:50.610> really<00:05:50.819> I<00:05:51.060> liked<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.629> whole<00:05:51.810> gum<00:05:51.990> skill

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
not really I liked the whole gum skill

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.040 
not really I liked the whole gum skill
part<00:05:52.590> and<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.759> luck<00:05:53.970> factor<00:05:54.000> is<00:05:54.599> just<00:05:54.840> whether

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050
