at<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> collegiate<00:00:28.619> level<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:29.039> he<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.340> in

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
at the collegiate level can he do it in

at the collegiate level can he do it in
the<00:00:29.880> pros<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.900> definitely<00:00:31.019> can<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.769> I

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the pros I think it definitely can and I

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.620 
the pros I think it definitely can and I
think<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> reason<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.579> Watkins<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
think the reason that Watkins is the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
think the reason that Watkins is the
number<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.020> receiver<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.559> NFL<00:00:34.710> Draft<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
number one receiver in the NFL Draft is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.010 
number one receiver in the NFL Draft is
that<00:00:35.460> he<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.760> change<00:00:36.030> games<00:00:36.360> every<00:00:36.719> time<00:00:36.899> he

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that he can change games every time he

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.840 
that he can change games every time he
has<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> ball<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.410> his<00:00:37.620> hands<00:00:37.950> unlike<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> lot

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
has the ball on his hands unlike a lot

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
has the ball on his hands unlike a lot
of<00:00:39.030> receivers<00:00:39.570> who<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:39.840> they<00:00:39.870> catch<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
of receivers who when they catch the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.319 
of receivers who when they catch the
ball<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:41.100> run<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:41.760> they<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.120> break

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
ball they run up right they don't break

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.569 
ball they run up right they don't break
tackles<00:00:42.600> Sammy<00:00:43.050> Watkins<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> rare<00:00:43.950> guy<00:00:44.250> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
tackles Sammy Watkins is a rare guy and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.610 
tackles Sammy Watkins is a rare guy and
that<00:00:44.910> he<00:00:44.969> gets<00:00:45.180> his<00:00:45.329> shoulders<00:00:45.809> down<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.379> he

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that he gets his shoulders down and he

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529 
that he gets his shoulders down and he
runs<00:00:46.829> aggressively<00:00:47.550> through<00:00:47.760> contact<00:00:48.210> which

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
runs aggressively through contact which

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.580 
runs aggressively through contact which
helps<00:00:48.809> them<00:00:48.899> break<00:00:49.079> tackles<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
helps them break tackles and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
helps them break tackles and
consistently<00:00:50.160> gain<00:00:50.460> yards<00:00:50.910> after<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> catch

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
consistently gain yards after the catch

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
consistently gain yards after the catch
I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> other<00:00:52.559> added<00:00:53.039> bonus<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
I think the other added bonus when you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
I think the other added bonus when you
look<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.879> Watkins<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.480> many<00:00:54.780> receivers<00:00:55.199> when

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
look at Watkins is many receivers when

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.990 
look at Watkins is many receivers when
they<00:00:55.829> catch<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> ball<00:00:56.399> they're<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:56.670> quick

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
they catch the ball they're not quick

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
they catch the ball they're not quick
turning<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.510> field<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:58.170> sort<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> catch<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
turning up field they sort of catch it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
turning up field they sort of catch it
look<00:00:59.190> around<00:00:59.489> figure<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> out<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.120> go

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
look around figure it out and then go

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.389 
look around figure it out and then go
Watkins<00:01:01.109> does<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> great<00:01:01.620> job<00:01:01.649> gets<00:01:02.219> it

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
Watkins does a great job gets it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.810 
I think when you look at Darren Sproles
you<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.890> bit<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> blueprint

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
for how this guy can be used he's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
for how this guy can be used he's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
dynamic in the open field he can make

guy his route running an explosion out
of<00:01:58.049> his<00:01:58.140> cuts<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.680> separated<00:01:59.430> him<00:01:59.549> from

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
of his cuts really separated him from

then<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> add<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.670> his<00:02:02.820> hands<00:02:03.270> his

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
then when you add in his hands his

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.959 
then when you add in his hands his
explosion<00:02:04.590> after<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> catch<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.790> take

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
explosion after the catch to just take

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.969 
explosion after the catch to just take
plays<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> distance<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.049> outrun<00:02:07.530> angles<00:02:07.860> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
plays the distance and outrun angles I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.680 
plays the distance and outrun angles I
think<00:02:08.280> NFL<00:02:08.640> teams<00:02:08.849> are<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.239> excited<00:02:09.479> about

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
think NFL teams are really excited about

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.410 
think NFL teams are really excited about
what<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.440> become<00:02:10.560> as<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
what you will become as a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.460 
what you will become as a
rookie<00:02:11.660> they're<00:02:11.810> probably<00:02:12.050> going<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.380> be<00:02:12.440> a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
rookie they're probably going to be a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.020 
rookie they're probably going to be a
little<00:02:12.740> bit<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.980> ups<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.280> downs<00:02:13.370> making<00:02:13.880> that

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
little bit of ups and downs making that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.610 
little bit of ups and downs making that
jump<00:02:14.270> but<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.720> think<00:02:14.959> when<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.170> look<00:02:15.200> longer

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
jump but I think when you look longer

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.589 
jump but I think when you look longer
than<00:02:16.040> his<00:02:16.190> ability<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.670> make<00:02:16.849> plays<00:02:17.030> after<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
than his ability to make plays after the

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.600 
than his ability to make plays after the
catch<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.410> ability<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.920> make<00:02:19.099> plays<00:02:19.310> as

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
catch and this ability to make plays as

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.309 
catch and this ability to make plays as
a<00:02:19.640> returner<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.360> think<00:02:20.780> he's<00:02:20.870> got<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.050> lot<00:02:21.290> of

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
a returner I think he's got a lot of

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.229 
a returner I think he's got a lot of
potential<00:02:21.709> upside<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.310> be<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.459> game-changer<00:02:22.730> at

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
potential upside to be a game-changer at

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.490 
potential upside to be a game-changer at
the<00:02:23.300> next<00:02:23.510> level<00:02:23.660> well<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:23.989> see<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.319> video

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the next level well you see the video

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.979 
the next level well you see the video
there<00:02:24.950> he<00:02:25.160> certainly<00:02:26.030> passes<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.599> eyeball

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
there he certainly passes the eyeball

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.449 
there he certainly passes the eyeball
