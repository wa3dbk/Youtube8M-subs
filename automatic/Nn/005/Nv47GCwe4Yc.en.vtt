00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
a 60 amp ESC there is a built in BC so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.729 
a 60 amp ESC there is a built in BC so
you<00:02:11.879> don't<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.239> worry<00:02:12.420> about<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
you don't have to worry about that

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.280 
you don't have to worry about that
you<00:02:14.010> will<00:02:14.190> need<00:02:14.340> bullet<00:02:14.760> connectors<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
you will need bullet connectors the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.020 
you will need bullet connectors the
motor<00:02:16.500> does<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:17.040> bullet<00:02:17.879> connectors

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

already<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.110> would<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.349> need<00:02:19.650> it

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
already on it so you would just need it

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.459 
already on it so you would just need it
for<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> ESC<00:02:20.840> there<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:21.959> no<00:02:22.109> battery

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469

our<00:02:26.560> banana<00:02:26.950> connectors<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.670> why<00:02:27.820> we<00:02:27.970> include

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
our banana connectors and why we include

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.540 
our banana connectors and why we include
them<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.780> they'd<00:02:29.470> rather<00:02:29.650> them<00:02:29.890> not<00:02:30.100> be<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.370> so

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
them and they'd rather them not be on so

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.150 
them and they'd rather them not be on so
what<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.790> did<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.540> left<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.900> up<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.350> to

horns extra screws you know obviously if

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.830 
horns extra screws you know obviously if
in<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.920> foam<00:02:51.130> plane<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.580> can't<00:02:51.850> screw<00:02:52.240> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
in a foam plane you can't screw the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.990 
in a foam plane you can't screw the
servos<00:02:53.200> down<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.650> fuselage<00:02:54.100> but<00:02:54.400> let's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
servos down to the fuselage but let's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.820 
servos down to the fuselage but let's
see<00:02:55.120> if<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.810> balsa<00:02:56.230> plane<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.680> want

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
see if it's a balsa plane and you want

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.290 
see if it's a balsa plane and you want
to<00:02:56.890> screw<00:02:57.130> them<00:02:57.220> down<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.520> got<00:02:57.670> screws<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.120> do

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
to screw them down you got screws to do

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.290 
to screw them down you got screws to do
that<00:02:58.860> because<00:02:59.860> typically<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.520> my<00:03:00.640> EDF<00:03:01.060> they're

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
that because typically on my EDF they're

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.450 
that because typically on my EDF they're
always<00:03:01.420> glued<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.960> so<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.950> you're<00:03:03.130> covered

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
remember me doing a review on that while

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.270 
remember me doing a review on that while
back

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
back

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.580 
back
but<00:03:24.790> personally<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.690> enjoy<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.320> plane

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
but personally I enjoy that plane

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.950 
but personally I enjoy that plane
handles<00:03:27.100> great<00:03:27.340> at<00:03:27.520> all<00:03:27.640> speeds<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.390> this

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
handles great at all speeds and this

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.110 
handles great at all speeds and this
would<00:03:29.290> definitely<00:03:29.470> be<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:29.920> hop<00:03:30.250> up<00:03:30.460> motor<00:03:30.730> let's

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
would definitely be a hop up motor let's

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.940 
would definitely be a hop up motor let's
say<00:03:31.270> about<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.660> kit<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.530> know<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.680> wanted

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
say about the kit and you know I wanted

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.830 
say about the kit and you know I wanted
to<00:03:33.010> get<00:03:33.130> electronics<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.970> ,<00:03:34.270> would<00:03:34.540> work

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
to get electronics this , would work

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.050 
to get electronics this , would work
perfectly<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.560> there<00:03:35.710> would<00:03:36.460> also<00:03:36.610> work<00:03:36.850> in

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
perfectly in there would also work in

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.600 
perfectly in there would also work in
the<00:03:37.150> RC<00:03:37.480> Lander<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:38.140> 70<00:03:38.770> millimeter<00:03:39.190> series

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
hard work has been done for you I you

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.320 
hard work has been done for you I you
got<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.620> put<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:38.950> in

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
got to do is put it in

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.450 
got to do is put it in
if<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.570> did<00:04:41.750> get<00:04:41.930> these<00:04:42.110> combos<00:04:42.560> really<00:04:43.310> all

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
if you did get these combos really all

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.010 
if you did get these combos really all
you<00:04:43.610> would<00:04:43.760> need<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.210> complete<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.750> plane

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
you would need to complete the plane

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.379 
you would need to complete the plane
let's<00:04:45.860> see<00:04:46.100> let's<00:04:46.699> see<00:04:46.910> maybe<00:04:47.270> some

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
let's see let's see maybe some

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.780 
let's see let's see maybe some
extensions<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:49.070> reason<00:04:49.310> we<00:04:49.400> didn't<00:04:49.610> include

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
extensions the reason we didn't include

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.520 
extensions the reason we didn't include
that's<00:04:50.060> because<00:04:50.240> every<00:04:50.600> plane<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:51.050> different

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
that's because every plane is different

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.710 
that's because every plane is different
servos<00:04:52.220> are<00:04:52.370> in<00:04:52.430> different<00:04:52.580> locations<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:53.389> you

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
servos are in different locations so you

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.600 
servos are in different locations so you
might<00:04:54.169> need<00:04:54.290> some<00:04:54.530> extensions<00:04:55.100> to<00:04:55.280> go<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.460> your

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
might need some extensions to go to your

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.450 
might need some extensions to go to your
receiver<00:04:55.970> if<00:04:56.720> they<00:04:56.900> don't<00:04:57.080> reach<00:04:57.460> remember

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
receiver if they don't reach remember

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.840 
receiver if they don't reach remember
your<00:04:58.610> bullet<00:04:58.910> plugs<00:05:00.130> your<00:05:01.130> connector<00:05:01.639> and

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
your bullet plugs your connector and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.230 
your bullet plugs your connector and
your<00:05:02.479> battery<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:03.860> have<00:05:04.010> all<00:05:04.160> if<00:05:04.760> you<00:05:04.910> get<00:05:05.030> all

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
your battery you have all if you get all

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.670 
your battery you have all if you get all
those<00:05:05.360> things<00:05:05.419> you're<00:05:05.780> pretty<00:05:06.050> much<00:05:06.199> covered

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
those things you're pretty much covered

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.040 
those things you're pretty much covered
so<00:05:06.860> really<00:05:07.190> all<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:07.340> need<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.729> buy<00:05:07.880> is

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
so really all you need to buy is

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.560 
so really all you need to buy is
connectors<00:05:09.460> maybe<00:05:10.460> an<00:05:10.610> extension<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.360> a

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
connectors maybe an extension and a

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.939 
connectors maybe an extension and a
battery<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.169> you're<00:05:12.350> good<00:05:12.560> to<00:05:12.710> go

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
battery and you're good to go

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.590 
battery and you're good to go
you're<00:05:13.310> all<00:05:13.460> covered<00:05:13.699> on<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.030> electronic

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
you're all covered on the electronic

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.600 
you're all covered on the electronic
side<00:05:14.780> all<00:05:15.320> you<00:05:15.380> got<00:05:15.590> to<00:05:15.680> do<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:15.979> glue<00:05:16.340> down<00:05:16.550> the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
side all you got to do is glue down the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.730 
side all you got to do is glue down the
EDF<00:05:17.150> unit<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.600> recommend<00:05:18.020> gluing<00:05:18.289> it<00:05:18.380> down<00:05:18.410> with

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
EDF unit I recommend gluing it down with

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.100 
EDF unit I recommend gluing it down with
five-minute<00:05:19.280> epoxy<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:19.940> use<00:05:20.300> very<00:05:20.600> little<00:05:20.960> of

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
five-minute epoxy but use very little of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.810 
five-minute epoxy but use very little of
it<00:05:21.199> so<00:05:21.620> if<00:05:21.710> ever<00:05:21.860> you<00:05:22.010> do<00:05:22.220> need<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.520> take<00:05:22.669> the

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
it so if ever you do need to take the

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.310 
it so if ever you do need to take the
unit<00:05:23.060> out<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.330> could<00:05:23.479> easily<00:05:23.660> tear<00:05:24.139> it<00:05:24.229> out

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
unit out you could easily tear it out

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.110 
unit out you could easily tear it out
same<00:05:24.919> with<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.130> servos<00:05:25.490> very<00:05:25.760> little

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
same with the servos very little
