as<00:01:19.479> family<00:01:19.899> use<00:01:20.110> cameras<00:01:20.619> could<00:01:21.009> last<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.430> a

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
as family use cameras could last you a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520 
as family use cameras could last you a
very<00:01:21.550> long<00:01:21.850> time<00:01:22.420> they<00:01:22.690> were<00:01:22.750> very<00:01:22.990> robust

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
very long time they were very robust

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.380 
very long time they were very robust
they<00:01:23.770> weren't<00:01:24.070> made<00:01:24.220> obsolete<00:01:24.610> very<00:01:25.060> quickly

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
they weren't made obsolete very quickly

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.840 
they weren't made obsolete very quickly
and<00:01:25.780> we<00:01:26.140> liked<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.380> idea<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.580> could

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
and we liked the idea that you could

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.050 
and we liked the idea that you could
even<00:01:28.330> on<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.720> sort<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.259> less<00:01:29.979> expensive<00:01:30.640> level

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
even on a sort of less expensive level

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.170 
even on a sort of less expensive level
create<00:01:31.570> images<00:01:32.080> as<00:01:32.350> good<00:01:32.830> as<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.180> professional

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
create images as good as a professional

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.870 
create images as good as a professional
could<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:35.020> know<00:01:35.140> professional<00:01:35.950> 16<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
could so you know professional 16 and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.109 
could so you know professional 16 and
family<00:01:37.270> 16<00:01:37.660> were<00:01:38.050> not<00:01:38.229> too<00:01:38.500> different<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.190> now

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
family 16 were not too different and now

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.080 
family 16 were not too different and now
with<00:01:40.420> digital<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.680> consumer<00:01:42.220> level<00:01:42.490> quality

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.300 
with digital the consumer level quality
and<00:01:43.450> professional<00:01:44.290> quality<00:01:44.770> have<00:01:44.979> become

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
and professional quality have become

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.070 
and professional quality have become
vastly<00:01:45.580> different<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.450> wanted<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.899> help

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
vastly different and we wanted to help

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.910 
vastly different and we wanted to help
bridge<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.410> gap<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.649> main

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
bridge that gap and that's the main

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.430 
bridge that gap and that's the main
reason<00:01:50.950> we<00:01:51.399> did<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:51.700> but<00:01:51.909> also<00:01:52.180> there's<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.170> lot

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
reason we did it but also there's a lot

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.620 
reason we did it but also there's a lot
of<00:01:53.470> vintage<00:01:54.130> lenses<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.060> accessories<00:01:55.140> and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
peripherals that aren't being used that

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.370 
peripherals that aren't being used that
are<00:02:00.760> very<00:02:00.880> very<00:02:01.150> high<00:02:01.360> quality<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.049> we<00:02:02.140> wanted

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
are very very high quality and we wanted

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.310 
are very very high quality and we wanted
to<00:02:02.440> give<00:02:02.650> a<00:02:02.680> new<00:02:03.010> life<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.850> these<00:02:04.390> products
