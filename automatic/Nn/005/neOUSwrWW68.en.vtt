 Hello, this is Dr. Solomon 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.660
 martÃ­nez I'm in charge of the 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.120
 department of functional medicine and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.090
 hormone replacement therapy here in 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.520
 Functional medicine wellness clinic 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.640
 is responsible for the study of the origin of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.130
 things is to say go to those sciences 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.890
 basic again to be able to do 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.230
 medicine nowadays many of our 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.930
 foods are already contaminated or already 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.680
 they are manipulated by the hand of man 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.930
 they have chemical things they have hormones 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.930
 among other substances that at the time of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.979
 reach our body through the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.070
 stomach of the intestine are gone 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.870
 disintegrating and the molecules that treat 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.830
 of going through that barrier 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.809
 Gastrointestinal create an inflammation 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.860
 this inflammation triggers that the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.610
 immune system is activated and can 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610
 cause a disease 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.090
 the main problem in this in these 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.550
 cases is not treating that disease and 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.780
 symptoms but is to try the door of 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.180
 input that is the device 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.420
 gastrointestinal to treat the device 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:21.490
 gastrointestinal tract there are five R's of 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.860
 repair the first ere is the r of 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.440
 remove what we are going to do with 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.690
 This first ere we are going to remove all 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.180
 those food substances between 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.210
 other things that may be causing 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.990
 our intestine an inflammation the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.960
 second r is to replace once 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.080
 that we replace and remove some things 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.780
 let's give the intestine other 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.720
 elements to be able to help 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.960
 desinflamar and later with a 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.610
 third r which is re inoculate let's give 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.090
 probiotics will recognize all our 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.390
 intestinal flora the fourth the fourth ere 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.030
 called to repair and this is already based on a 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.780
 balanced feed and also base 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.750
 of some others 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 to finish repairing our 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.100
 intestine and that is functioning 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.220
 properly and not let filter 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.520
 substances that can perpetuate or 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.420
 cause another one is inflammation the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.220
 last r is rebalance this ere i think 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 which is the most important thing and I think that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:37.600
 the man a lot of it has lost is 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:41.080
 also include prayer meditation with 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.590
 your education awareness among others 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.510
 things to get to this r we need 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.640
 not only the support or the strength of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.739
 will that one have but also the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.630
 support from a professional who takes care 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.140
 and have this ability to be able to guide 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.750
 and to be able to direct the patient and 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.360
 remember not only is to be 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.280
