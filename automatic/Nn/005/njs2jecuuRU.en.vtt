00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
is probably one of the clearest and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.799 
is probably one of the clearest and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
this one for a while and I just got it

this one for a while and I just got it
out<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.260> her<00:00:16.410> inventory<00:00:17.300> what<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.600> I've

the bottom and I have it filled with 12
ounces<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.699> water<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.269> started<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
ounces of water I just started it and

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.450 
ounces of water I just started it and
it's<00:00:29.369> been<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.000> probably<00:00:31.009> 20<00:00:32.009> seconds

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it's been going for probably 20 seconds

it's been going for probably 20 seconds
30<00:00:32.610> seconds<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.170> water<00:00:34.350> has<00:00:34.680> already

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
30 seconds now and the water has already

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
30 seconds now and the water has already
started<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> boil<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.270> pipe<00:00:36.480> it's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
started to boil in this pipe it's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
started to boil in this pipe it's
already<00:00:37.050> started<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.559> movement<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> we

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
already started to get movement in it we

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.160 
already started to get movement in it we
don't<00:00:38.879> quite<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> boil<00:00:39.660> yet<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.050> it's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
don't quite have a boil yet but it's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.930 
don't quite have a boil yet but it's
pretty<00:00:40.320> close

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.180 

okay<00:00:47.629> if<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:48.289> want<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.469> see<00:00:48.620> how<00:00:48.710> clear<00:00:49.010> the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
okay if you want to see how clear the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.049 
okay if you want to see how clear the
spot<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.699> this<00:00:49.879> lens<00:00:50.120> is<00:00:51.280> I'm<00:00:52.280> gonna<00:00:52.489> zoom<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:52.910> i

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
spot on this lens is I'm gonna zoom in i

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.630 
spot on this lens is I'm gonna zoom in i
don't<00:00:53.269> have<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.629> lens<00:00:53.899> at<00:00:54.110> optimal<00:00:54.769> its

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
don't have this lens at optimal its

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.029 
don't have this lens at optimal its
optimal<00:00:56.149> focal<00:00:56.539> point<00:00:59.440> but<00:01:00.440> if<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:00.769> see

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
optimal focal point but if you see

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.160 
optimal focal point but if you see
there's<00:01:01.219> like<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.430> shadow<00:01:02.390> in<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.750> lower<00:01:02.930> right

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
there's like a shadow in the lower right

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.410 
there's like a shadow in the lower right
hand<00:01:03.199> corner<00:01:03.469> of<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.920> spot<00:01:04.220> what<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.239> is

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
hand corner of the spot what that is is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.870 
hand corner of the spot what that is is
that<00:01:05.449> as<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.720> cloud<00:01:06.140> that<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.440> about<00:01:06.790> maybe<00:01:07.790> a

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
that as a cloud that is about maybe a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.120 
that as a cloud that is about maybe a
mile<00:01:08.210> from<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.659> Sun<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.229> it's<00:01:09.649> actually

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
mile from the Sun and it's actually

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.350 
mile from the Sun and it's actually
casting<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.890> entire<00:01:13.250> image<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.909> sky<00:01:14.030> on

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
casting the entire image of the sky on

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.529 
casting the entire image of the sky on
there<00:01:14.740> most<00:01:15.740> for<00:01:16.009> now<00:01:16.100> lenses<00:01:16.549> won't<00:01:17.000> do<00:01:17.299> this

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
there most for now lenses won't do this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.060 
there most for now lenses won't do this
because<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.080> optics<00:01:18.500> just<00:01:18.740> aren't<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
because the optics just aren't that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.859 
because the optics just aren't that
perfect<00:01:19.520> but<00:01:19.670> this<00:01:19.789> particular<00:01:19.940> one<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.630> quite

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
perfect but this particular one is quite

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.389 
perfect but this particular one is quite
amazing<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.470> think<00:01:21.679> you<00:01:21.770> could<00:01:21.890> probably<00:01:21.979> use

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
amazing I think you could probably use

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.809 
amazing I think you could probably use
this<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:24.159> whatever<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.429> want<00:01:25.640> home

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
this for whatever you want home

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.230 
this for whatever you want home
projection<00:01:26.390> anything<00:01:26.869> but<00:01:27.429> that's<00:01:28.429> uh<00:01:28.670> that's

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
projection anything but that's uh that's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.690 
projection anything but that's uh that's
a<00:01:29.390> very<00:01:29.600> rare<00:01:30.500> thing<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.950> see<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:31.460> shows

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
a very rare thing to see and it shows

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.020 
a very rare thing to see and it shows
just<00:01:31.729> how<00:01:32.149> clear<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.659> powerful<00:01:32.810> this<00:01:33.229> lenses

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
just how clear and powerful this lenses

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.139 
just how clear and powerful this lenses
okay<00:01:35.030> we're<00:01:35.210> exactly<00:01:35.479> two<00:01:35.840> minutes<00:01:35.990> in<00:01:36.319> and

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
okay we're exactly two minutes in and

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.419 
okay we're exactly two minutes in and
this<00:01:38.149> pipe<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.659> out<00:01:38.899> exposed<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.830> elements

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
this pipe is out exposed to the elements

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.850 
this pipe is out exposed to the elements
so<00:01:41.330> there's<00:01:41.509> wind<00:01:41.810> blowing<00:01:42.170> across<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.710> right

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
so there's wind blowing across it right

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.809 
so there's wind blowing across it right
now<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:45.039> can<00:01:46.039> see<00:01:46.190> how<00:01:46.280> well<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.610> water

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
now and you can see how well the water

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:53.660 
now and you can see how well the water
is<00:01:46.970> boiling<00:01:47.179> in<00:01:47.450> there

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 

this<00:01:54.330> lens<00:01:54.600> would<00:01:54.780> work<00:01:54.960> perfect<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.619> any

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
this lens would work perfect for any

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
this lens would work perfect for any
steam<00:01:56.040> applications<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.090> anything<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
steam applications or anything like that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.770 
steam applications or anything like that
if<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:59.280> realistically<00:02:00.210> probably<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
if it you realistically probably do a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.389 
if it you realistically probably do a
gallon<00:02:01.229> gallon<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.920> half<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> full

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
gallon gallon and a half to a full

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.020 
gallon gallon and a half to a full
raging<00:02:03.149> boil<00:02:03.770> without<00:02:04.770> insulation<00:02:05.280> maybe<00:02:05.759> two

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
raging boil without insulation maybe two

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
raging boil without insulation maybe two
gallons<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.600> insulation<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.830> this

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
gallons with insulation on this

00:02:07.979 --> 00:03:10.850 
gallons with insulation on this
particular<00:02:08.280> lens

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860
