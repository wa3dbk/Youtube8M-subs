00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:08.169 
helmet when starting to draw a helmet

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.390 
helmet when starting to draw a helmet
you<00:00:09.169> know<00:00:09.259> it's<00:00:09.410> normally<00:00:09.860> about<00:00:09.889> the<00:00:10.160> shape

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400

basic<00:00:12.620> shape<00:00:12.650> and<00:00:13.160> we'll<00:00:13.490> just<00:00:13.639> do<00:00:13.789> kind<00:00:14.030> of

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
basic shape and we'll just do kind of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.340 
basic shape and we'll just do kind of
like<00:00:14.269> a<00:00:14.299> an<00:00:14.690> egg-shaped<00:00:16.330> just<00:00:17.330> like<00:00:17.480> that<00:00:18.490> and

like a an egg-shaped just like that and

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.330 
like a an egg-shaped just like that and
so<00:00:21.350> then<00:00:21.710> you're<00:00:22.340> starting<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:22.730> draw<00:00:23.030> like

have like a an eye hole right here then
they'll<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.000> like<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.210> little<00:01:34.479> opening<00:01:34.930> for

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
they'll have like a little opening for

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:57.870 
they'll have like a little opening for
the<00:01:35.260> chin<00:01:37.020> kind<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.080> like<00:01:38.229> this

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:25.320 

shade<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.869> in<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.110> little<00:01:59.380> bit

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.420 

so<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:27.260> lights<00:02:27.440> kind<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.800> coming<00:02:28.069> from<00:02:28.190> right

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
so the lights kind of coming from right

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.050 
so the lights kind of coming from right
here<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.990> will<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.319> all<00:02:30.700> shaded<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.790> little

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
here so this will be all shaded a little

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.550 
here so this will be all shaded a little
bit

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.640 

and<00:02:40.100> we<00:02:40.190> got<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.459> feathers<00:02:40.940> right<00:02:41.209> here<00:02:41.780> so

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
and we got the feathers right here so

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.910 
and we got the feathers right here so
kind<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.130> like<00:02:43.310> look<00:02:43.580> like<00:02:43.760> this

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.270 

so<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.870> kind<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.080> see<00:02:52.290> where<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> where

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
so you can kind of see where the where

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.820 
so you can kind of see where the where
the<00:02:53.370> face<00:02:53.610> would<00:02:53.850> be<00:02:54.140> you'd<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.350> like<00:02:55.500> an<00:02:55.650> eye

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
the face would be you'd have like an eye

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.000 
the face would be you'd have like an eye
like<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.430> here<00:02:57.380> right<00:02:58.380> there<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.890> then

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
like right here right there and then

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.000 
like right here right there and then
like<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.400> chin<00:03:00.090> would<00:03:00.270> probably<00:03:00.600> come<00:03:00.870> down

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
like the chin would probably come down

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.270 
like the chin would probably come down
all<00:03:02.010> right<00:03:02.250> here<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.660> anyway<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:05.010> your

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
all right here so anyway this is your

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.490 
all right here so anyway this is your
your<00:03:05.819> basic<00:03:06.150> shape<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:08.510> anything<00:03:09.510> gladiator

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
