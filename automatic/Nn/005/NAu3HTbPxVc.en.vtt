 So you can meet my Facebook Instagram Twitter and Ball Plus 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.610
 There is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.760
 Hi, I want to start with Eto'o on the market today is a calm manner Tower 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.360
 Let 's take a quick look at it. 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.630
 Yogeo tablet-to-many's the kind of dog is that one version of Eno is not doedeo 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.750
 There are two things there at the same time, the 13 inches 18 inches 13 inches 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.020
 If you have a projector but the projector is not 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.070
 Lynch's what keeps most other models, let's speakers to the car once here 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.170
 I have two. 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.980
 It's okay to eat your thumb. It's not big . It's just as good as it sounds . 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.890
 It's not. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.540
 It is expected to have 8 inch flash underneath the display . 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.200
 It's okay, and there's a 1.0-megapixel front-facing camera, 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.780
 There are key Power key while charging Come clean here and the fire 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.870
 Microphone usb port can be used as usb otg 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.440
 You can also charge it, but since it is the charger side, 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.880
 It's good for mental health sseusineunge here, and volume keys 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.129
 It was good in a long time should not be charged as an anchor product in here it reminds parties to the left 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:09.270
 It is integrated and has a phone side and it has to be delivered. 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:15.390
 Its cylindrical shape is very thin. It is considerably thinner, 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 Let's do a great job . Let's go. Let's go. 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.180
 Itguyo the camera here teuraenseo Id 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.860
 In that 372 contains a z Atom jet Then 3745 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.490
 Clearance are two groups ie contains the lcd and 32 into groups by reservation c 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.409
 I guess it's just a standard Windows tablet specification. 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.450
 There is an error logo, the constitution here is a little aunt feeling there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.860
 The scratches are not going well. 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.260
 Oh, I do not want to leave it special anyway. 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.780
 This opens, ego 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.950
 When you open the yoreotge yogeo look inside here give a slush here sludge 3 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.220
 Mike sd Kass here is like a tubular Here is the wisem card 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.370
 I'll go in. Let me have a look at the preservation of lt in Korea. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.180
 That's why I did not show up. 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.830
 do not have 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.640
 This way there is also what keeps the overall size of fine geundeyeo Friend 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.330
 I can be a little irritable. I can have parsley, but let's go inside first. 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.750
 In the interior is the first Windows 8.1 into itjyo m 8 points Read 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.850
 Bet core Windows 8.0 million more than in naahjyeotji still rotate screen 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.840
 There are minor issues, such as getting caught. 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.630
 But the problem is that there is not a lot of apps to tell you. 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.470
 Taste've heard a lot now also create and subway 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.950
 Google Maps, but of course it is somewhat party Yoda source part, 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.880
 I'm still not revealed, but the app by comparing Trang andoeji Hunter More 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.810
 right 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.530
 The advantage of the Windows Tablet is that it is Windows 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.510
 In fact, because her pc's point p when I'm going back to the old shop 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.380
 It's 32 on top of that. 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.140
 Also woven apps are in fact to be a little awkward because the app is also called Back 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.250
 The 61 pieces inde we told you that this is a program that you at any moment 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.970
 I have a story about an icon, but I'm stuck with an app . 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.510
 Anyway, I'm getting into the existing Windows application. 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.410
 Be the first one existing Windows applications, touch-friendly not play even beat Roger 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:09.260
 In Windows 8.1 , I increase the completion after touching the existing Windows app. 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.470
 There were other measures, such as increasing the size of the letters , but there were also hard-coded Apple 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.970
 Basically, it is inconvenient because it is not quantity when touching. Very inconvenient 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.810
 Because I'm the Windows tablet about 12 inches 13 inches is the minimum monthly last.Should 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.640
 Nowadays you can use these outdated Windows apps in desktop mode 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.050
 I can use the Indian medicine if I have to. 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.330
 So unless you have a specific reason for this , 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.600
 I think you'll have to connect the keyboard. 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.560
 Otherwise, the earlier letter now to the match mode 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.100
 As it will somehow outside this app are the Tower mode with Matt tablet models 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.760
 As you said earlier apps are offered a towel m mode, the app is also much the app itself 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:49.260
 Not receive the master's horrifying level come to the store let me see what 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.250
 Let's take a look at popular treatments Popular Free Igo Popular free apps 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:58.320
 This is why the number of apps in the top of the tower is so frankly bloated, 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:01.769
 It assumed the big screen and annoying example made things 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.480
 Manhattan's tablet just kids doing here'll manage to see by the YouTube app 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.470
 It can not be too natural to be absent . 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.489
 I do not have much room to use if I go a little bit like this. 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:15.150
 What just Google Maps Katta Butter Third Party High Line 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.810
 What I try to show Crystal Red Line Dance Well here also passed little fucker.Come 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.900
 Also great buteon down from 112 just past might go down, so 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.410
 It's still like this. Well, what about the Indian tablet? 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.030
 What specifications do not over doing exceptionally born of windows tablet What is not suddenly 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.389
 Or sixteen rams, or 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:35.430
 I do not want to tell you anything . 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.770
 Intel's same platform is rated well and delivers the same performance 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.520
 Software is included Haha Just like in Windows 8.1 Easy Pauli 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.850
 I have a try. 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.850
 This is why you ve tell by the biggest feature of this friend put out 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:50.100
 This line can not I talk to think that reservations Ole tools 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:54.419
 This cylindrical type is actually a cylindrical type with many functions 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.090
 But basically this is that I did as a perfect angle is now chaenggin 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.600
 In just presented its yoreotge me what this is 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.990
 It looks like Apple keyboard look somehow so perfect is just one 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.770
 Basically this is why I have an angle, so why not use a virtual keyboard 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.930
 They also may not be any typing typing with the virtual keyboard, just read on 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:15.150
 Even easier to see. 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.510
 Of course, if you just turn on the yogeo in this position it has spread out so yogeol 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.870
 please 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:23.100
 You can adjust the angle and adjust the angle more or less. 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:27.450
 Of course, you can not do that. 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.100
 It 's easy to read when you look at it like this, and the angle is well controlled. 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.919
 To think 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.790
 I judge it. Well, it's pretty good that you do not push it until it's closed to some extent. 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.620
 Hold on well. 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.669
 So why do not you just sit down and have eight bears so just sit on the interch 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.880
 I dig it. 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.830
 This is surprisingly much easier than you think. And this is the third step. 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.160
 That's what's been added to Taller. 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.350
 All to walk in place mop that is not called predecessor put into words framed 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.400
 It seems like it was not long ago, but is it good of the electronic thing? 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:06:01.020
 It is just 20 minutes and put the same tablet geureongeot party looks just train 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:04.050
 In the spring, we find something like a hanger. 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.479
 When I look at the video I see the remote preliminaries I never saw the young hanger 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:11.520
 That's what it's worth to do it. 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:14.580
 Well, I did not actually think about it, 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.139
 I saw that it seemed pretty good. 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:23.180
 So this way. 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:26.539
 There are two meanings. First, you grab that first and leave something. 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:30.139
 I am very satisfied with the practical part of giving an angle here . 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:35.419
 This is something like this, and now the portability is going to lose some money. 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:38.419
 That's why it's a little bit of a fight with those two fighting dashes 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.669
 Or see what is comfortable writing in design as it is also not a favorite 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.999
 Or could it be 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:48.680
 This is extremely practical, especially doegeodeunyo holding the phone in hand anyway, calling such 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:53.449
 Looks like a tower, but we're always comfortable with something. 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:56.059
 I have a lot of things to put on the floor to see that this practicality is enough 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:07:00.770
 I think I can call it a small six innovation. 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:04.819
 But you will need to decide whether I was in the middle of how to take the balance 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:08.029
 What I want to be thankful to see the extent damages portability 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:11.180
 It is also unfortunate that I would be going to the window to pick went to review today 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:14.779
 So for those of you who are modeling the community, Lenovo is here 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.159
 Android also went with them exactly the same specification contains some Saki andoeseo Quebec 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:19.669
 That's why. 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:23.169
 It looks like the Android model is going to make a lot more sense. 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:26.629
 It is largely because of the window, I see that there is no meaningful form factor 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:31.459
 I think you should make your decision in Korean. 

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:34.849
 Shah was the pitcher of Lenovo yogeo turbines continue selecting stickers to draft up yogeol 

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:36.499
 I heard only the best cuts stand by the way, how really good chance that the Acid Value 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:40.459
 I do not know. It's pretty hard. 

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:43.249
 But I think after that to continue putting its push to come up this year is what 

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:46.550
 I think I'm getting pretty good stuff. 

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:50.930
 I think this bridge is much better than I thought. I liked it. 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.469
 Battery enough to 6400 what future lovable display more satisfaction doing okay 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.589
 It's losing. 

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:58.969
 1 I think it would be a good idea to buy Andre the Car 

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:59.839
 Now Leo Appearance Tablo Chi secure line, we forget aneuni end ribeun 9 dokhage 

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:04.209
 Drink 

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:04.209
 Next time, I'll see you in another review.
