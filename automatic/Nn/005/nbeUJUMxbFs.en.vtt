just adding a little bit of vinegar to
your<00:01:43.829> donut<00:01:44.189> batter<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:45.030> bind<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
your donut batter will bind with a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.840 
your donut batter will bind with a
baking<00:01:46.170> soda<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> makes<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.310> chemical

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
baking soda and it makes this chemical

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
baking soda and it makes this chemical
reaction<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.750> allow<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> donuts<00:01:49.710> to

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:51.900 
really messing all of your hands this is
a<00:03:50.799> really<00:03:51.070> important<00:03:51.340> step<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.670> roll<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:51.880> back

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
a really important step to roll it back

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.120 
a really important step to roll it back
and<00:03:52.299> then<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:53.019> pick<00:03:53.200> one<00:03:53.530> corner<00:03:54.010> that

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
and then just pick one corner that

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.610 
and then just pick one corner that
you're<00:03:54.280> going<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.430> aim<00:03:54.610> for<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:56.230> that's<00:03:56.380> the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
you're going to aim for so that's the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.110 
you're going to aim for so that's the
corner<00:03:56.920> I'm<00:03:57.010> going<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.519> I'm<00:03:57.610> going<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.820> put<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
corner I'm going so I'm going to put the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.030 
corner I'm going so I'm going to put the
dough<00:03:58.299> in

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.650 

so<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.370> put<00:04:04.550> about<00:04:04.700> half<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.180> batter<00:04:05.360> in

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
so just put about half the batter in

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.120 
so just put about half the batter in
because<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.260> don't<00:04:06.410> want<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.590> over<00:04:06.709> flowing

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
because you don't want it over flowing

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.220 
because you don't want it over flowing
and<00:04:07.489> then<00:04:08.030> squeeze<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.630> all<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.930> way<00:04:09.020> down

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
and then squeeze it all the way down

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.630 
and then squeeze it all the way down
into<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.680> corner<00:04:10.069> and<00:04:10.330> then<00:04:11.330> cut<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.930> tip<00:04:12.170> off

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
into the corner and then cut the tip off

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.240 
into the corner and then cut the tip off
about<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.910> size<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:15.349> width<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.800> the

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
about the size of the width of the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.220 
about the size of the width of the
circle<00:04:16.940> for<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.209> doughnut<00:04:17.540> rings<00:04:17.750> this

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
circle for the doughnut rings this

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.280 
circle for the doughnut rings this
should<00:04:18.470> begin<00:04:18.850> so<00:04:19.850> now<00:04:20.060> another<00:04:20.870> really

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
should begin so now another really

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.050 
should begin so now another really
important<00:04:21.739> part<00:04:21.919> about<00:04:22.130> piping<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.000> know

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
important part about piping and I know

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.879 
important part about piping and I know
I'm<00:04:23.210> piping<00:04:23.540> out<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.840> plastic<00:04:24.320> bag<00:04:24.530> but

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
I'm piping out of a plastic bag but

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.330 
I'm piping out of a plastic bag but
trust<00:04:25.190> me<00:04:25.310> just<00:04:26.090> twist<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:26.900> this<00:04:27.860> will<00:04:28.070> prevent

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
trust me just twist it this will prevent

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.250 
trust me just twist it this will prevent
it<00:04:28.520> from<00:04:28.550> coming<00:04:28.970> out<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.240> wrong<00:04:29.270> end<00:04:29.389> okay

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
it from coming out the wrong end okay

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.290 
it from coming out the wrong end okay
here<00:04:30.560> we<00:04:30.650> go<00:04:30.680> so<00:04:31.400> I'm<00:04:31.460> just<00:04:31.520> going<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.910> pipe<00:04:32.150> it

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
here we go so I'm just going to pipe it

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.930 
here we go so I'm just going to pipe it
in<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.510> circular<00:04:32.810> motion<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.770> when<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.729> two

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
in a circular motion and when the two

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.480 
in a circular motion and when the two
ends<00:04:35.330> meet<00:04:35.570> just<00:04:35.600> push<00:04:36.110> down<00:04:36.139> and<00:04:36.919> press<00:04:37.250> back

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
ends meet just push down and press back

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.409 
ends meet just push down and press back
up<00:04:38.200> one<00:04:39.200> batch<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.590> batter<00:04:39.710> should<00:04:40.100> make<00:04:40.250> about

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
up one batch of batter should make about

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:57.340 
up one batch of batter should make about
1214<00:04:41.419> Donuts<00:04:41.870> isn't<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:42.740> easy<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:57.050> if<00:04:57.229> you
