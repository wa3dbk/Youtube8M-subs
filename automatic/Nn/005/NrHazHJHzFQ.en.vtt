you're looking to build and you can work

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
you're looking to build and you can work
out<00:01:01.710> an<00:01:01.980> estimate<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
out an estimate of what it's going to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.920 
out an estimate of what it's going to
cost

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
cost

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
cost
it<00:01:03.989> might<00:01:04.199> sound<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.710> simple<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.909> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it might sound really simple and it is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.270 
it might sound really simple and it is
but<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.500> surprised<00:01:07.920> how<00:01:08.189> many

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
but there you do surprised how many

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.490 
but there you do surprised how many
people<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.150> no<00:01:09.540> idea<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.409> much

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
people out there have no idea how much

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
people out there have no idea how much
is<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> cost<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> build<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> gives

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
is going to cost to build and this gives

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
is going to cost to build and this gives
you<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.570> good<00:01:12.600> understanding<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.409> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530

that<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.680> help<00:01:19.890> people<00:01:20.540> calculate<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.960> cost

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that can help people calculate the cost

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
that can help people calculate the cost
of<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> new<00:01:22.500> home<00:01:22.710> before<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.580> seriously

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
into the design phase a lot of people

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.429 
into the design phase a lot of people
out<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> look<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> know

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
really in for how much is realistic at

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
really in for how much is realistic at
this<00:01:35.310> stage<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.790> nothing<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.299> there
