these next pieces that you're going to
put<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.979> steel<00:01:14.189> frames<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.760> facing

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
put in and the steel frames are facing

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
put in and the steel frames are facing
upwards<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> I'll<00:01:17.009> show<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.250> why<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
upwards and I'll show you why in a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.200 
upwards and I'll show you why in a
little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:18.000> once<00:01:18.930> those<00:01:19.110> two<00:01:19.140> corners<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.799> in

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
little bit once those two corners are in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.830 
little bit once those two corners are in
you<00:01:21.210> put<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:22.080> pieces<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> steel<00:01:23.840> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you put in these two pieces of steel and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
you put in these two pieces of steel and
you<00:01:24.930> finish<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> framework<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.460> once<00:01:26.729> we

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you finish out the framework and once we

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
you finish out the framework and once we
do<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.000> we're<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.659> ahead<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.950> put

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
do that we're going to go ahead and put

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.719 
do that we're going to go ahead and put
in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> rest<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> pegs

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.370 

so<00:01:34.729> now<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:34.909> finish<00:01:35.270> doing<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.600> outside<00:01:35.990> frame

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
so now we finish doing the outside frame

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.899 
so now we finish doing the outside frame
of<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.619> rack<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.100> as<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:37.579> mentioned<00:01:37.880> before

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
of the rack and as I mentioned before

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.539 
of the rack and as I mentioned before
you<00:01:38.180> want<00:01:38.539> these<00:01:38.750> Center<00:01:39.229> openings<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.430> up

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
you want these Center openings to be up

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.529 
you want these Center openings to be up
and<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.759> reason<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:41.090> we're<00:01:41.180> going<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.360> put

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
and the reason is we're going to put

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.480 
and the reason is we're going to put
these<00:01:41.630> middle<00:01:41.990> frame<00:01:42.229> pieces<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.039> they

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
these middle frame pieces in and they

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.460 
these middle frame pieces in and they
really<00:01:43.520> need<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.090> connect<00:01:44.600> one<00:01:45.110> into<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
really need to connect one into the

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.880 
really need to connect one into the
other

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
other

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.999 
other
again<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.640> creating<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:47.179> X<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.890> we

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
again it's creating this X so that we

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.969 
again it's creating this X so that we
can<00:01:49.189> hum<00:01:49.939> those<00:01:50.179> pegs<00:01:50.479> right<00:01:51.289> into<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.649> center

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
can hum those pegs right into the center
