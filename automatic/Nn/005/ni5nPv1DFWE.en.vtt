00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.610
 hello to all and all and morgane and 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.490
 I'm back to introduce you 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.059
 measures therefore from December 26 to 28 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.590
 December 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.400
 so for those who would ask 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.800
 because I know there is still 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.630
 some worries about playstation I am 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.060
 on xbox conquered that's why I 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.370
 could connect me without worry yesterday I had 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.400
 the same problems a good on the xbox 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:33.079
 was not spared with the chamois 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.210
 squad so on is here position we have 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.820
 already seen anyway so what is 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.010
 they'll rarely see later on yom 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.210
 titans tells us new version the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.789
 last week's names the claws 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.289
 lady carats that I find very pretty the 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.899
 symbiote akilov age that I had missed 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.229
 the first time and that suddenly I think 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.679
 take this week since this is his 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:57.260
 dlc version ie with 447 of 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.179
 max defense and 36.2 light level 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.739
 max that will allow me to spend 31 even 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.069
 32 if the raid goes well this 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.589
 week 

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:07.190
 as you know I was not there early 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.960
 week and finisterrae called 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.780
 noland millions dhs in original version 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.800
 so I believe directly in 331 of attac 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.880
 max who is so a sniper maybe 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.490
 equipped in the location of tears 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.110
 main it's interesting increases 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.520
 the damage of precision the frags 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.230
 realized with this weapon we do not hear me 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.540
 not temporarily yielding the damage 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.490
 inflicted on the next target 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.090
 ok also old and that's it 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.540
 pleases 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.600
 he has a pretty cool old school style to 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.380
 the old there he is he is pretty cool 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.720
 visually 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.040
 I like the fact that all these weapons 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.440
 exotic every time stands out 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.090
 really a lot of each other and 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.060
 all have a very particular style the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.700
 installs in the subway 2033 or other I 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.710
 do not know with the little wood side his 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.470
 stats good we saw better one of course 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.630
 since we do not have the 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.050
 automatic reloading or that kind of 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.150
 things 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.670
 he calls a loader of 6 so that 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.530
 it's pretty cool we'll compare it to 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.130
 them yves to my boyfriend with the tool 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.560
 multifunction bravo so we're not going to 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.510
 compare of identity that he has a good 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.480
 reload speed an annex door 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.950
 in range I think it's something 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.550
 interesting thing if you do not have 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.590
 still in my sniper 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.630
 interesting in high school and of course he 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.230
 will not dethrone our famous icebreaker 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.350
 talk about his reloading 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.640
 automatic return on or again the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.320
 new lamarthe au noir I had 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120
 the opportunity to try it out really 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.650
 annoying that precision damage and 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.720
 the fact that they recharge without 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.970
 need them would not retreat 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.010
 the divisors it's pretty mind-blowing 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.800
 so he will miss this little side 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.850
 easy reload but I think it 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.980
 is still interesting 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.510
 we then of course have an exotic glow 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.960
 we do not have an exotic gram this 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.700
 week I 'm sending new panicked I 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.110
 think it'll come back worry 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300
 not maybe they do tests of 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.800
 settings etc 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.080
 and then the increases of what we 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.730
 may have 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.390
 so the different titan helmet 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.790
 fire heart in solar so that's okay 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.820
 to please those kong at the terminal that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.170
 go to the 331 it rises it remains 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.040
 one of the best if not the best 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.240
 launches rockets 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.140
 even though funk roma is very very good 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.360
 supreme council that was already the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.880
 last week m of thunder blow 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.950
 his mom I'm already seen in 331 so 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.959
 it's cool all is well I do not need 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.480
 to increase it last words that 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.560
 it's pretty cool that's the red death 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.120
 it's been a long time since we've heard 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.980
 speak I like this weapon more 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.610
 I can not wait for her to come back 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.940
 available I love his little side a 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.190
 little bit how I forgot our hearts 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.930
 the fair is that's it except that everyone 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.220
 is a bit inspired by a thematic 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.860
 it may be me but for example on 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.130
 I think it hurts a lot 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.540
 and the diaraf after that is my 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.620
 birthday and blow me 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.390
 personally this week I'm going 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.390
 increase elderberry what I have as to 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.709
 level 300 max so I spent 331 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.900
 but as you see it will take g 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.670
 cumulate some small lumens do that 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.950
 should not be much complicated the 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.150
 blue plasma engine telemetry and 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.900
 purple plasma motor we'll say so 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.850
 so here I take the headphones 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.700
 let's be crazy it's going to be all of a sudden 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.990
 this piece so if I can cumulate 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.700
 10 pieces knowing that in fact I'm going in 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.139
 to have nine in their epic of the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.509
 week 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.499
 that's so I'll also take our 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.629
 heaths billon funds finisterrae and if 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:37.120
 I have the opportunity to do it 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.189
 demo of this rifle I tried to do that 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.870
 tomorrow for you to see her 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.969
 make the decision before buying 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.069
 tomorrow where tonight besides if everything happens 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.759
 okay so that's it so I hope that 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:51.370
 it will please you is not it and that 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.229
 you are going to have the equipment that 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.460
 you wish and as for me I 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.240
 found very quickly on the chain 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.240
 for many more videos
