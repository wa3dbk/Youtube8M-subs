bar here on your Jeep JK it fits 2007

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.250 
bar here on your Jeep JK it fits 2007
through<00:00:33.989> 2012<00:00:34.739> Jeep<00:00:35.160> JK's<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.079> one<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
through 2012 Jeep JK's and one of the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.660 
through 2012 Jeep JK's and one of the
reasons<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.649> changing<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> because

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
reasons for changing this out is because

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.310 
reasons for changing this out is because
the<00:00:38.790> factory<00:00:39.239> one<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.719> weak<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.170> very

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the factory one is so weak and is very

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
the factory one is so weak and is very
prone<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> bending<00:00:41.219> when<00:00:41.760> you're<00:00:41.940> off-roading

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
prone to bending when you're off-roading

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.850 
prone to bending when you're off-roading
this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> lowest

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
this is actually one of the lowest

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.650 
this is actually one of the lowest
points<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> Jeep<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.239> usually<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
points on the Jeep and it's usually the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.090 
points on the Jeep and it's usually the
first<00:00:45.870> thing<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> smack<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
first thing it's going to smack into the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
first thing it's going to smack into the
rocks<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.489> any<00:00:47.610> other<00:00:48.030> obstacles<00:00:48.570> tree<00:00:48.840> stumps

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
rocks or any other obstacles tree stumps

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.470 
rocks or any other obstacles tree stumps
etc<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> does<00:00:50.579> smack<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.059> those

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
etc when it does smack into those

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060 
etc when it does smack into those
obstacles<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> bend

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
obstacles it's going to get a bend

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.590 
obstacles it's going to get a bend
inside<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.760> as<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.879> gets<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> bend

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
inside it and as it gets that bend

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990 
inside it and as it gets that bend
inside<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.530> doesn't<00:00:55.920> become<00:00:56.219> useful

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
inside it it then doesn't become useful

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.270 
inside it it then doesn't become useful
anymore<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> cause<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> toes<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
anymore it's going to cause the toes of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430 
anymore it's going to cause the toes of
the<00:00:59.340> Jeep<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.670> come<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> tow<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the Jeep to come in and as the tow the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.290 
the Jeep to come in and as the tow the
Jeep<00:01:01.620> comes<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.129> by<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.640> mean<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> actual

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
Jeep comes in by that I mean the actual

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.350 
Jeep comes in by that I mean the actual
tire<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.719> facing<00:01:04.680> themselves<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.460> these

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
tire is facing themselves in as these

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.880 
tire is facing themselves in as these
phase-in<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> cause<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> vehicle

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
phase-in it's going to cause the vehicle

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.140 
phase-in it's going to cause the vehicle
to<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> death<00:01:08.460> shake<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.850> you're<00:01:09.000> driving
