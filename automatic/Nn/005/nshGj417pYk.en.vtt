00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
where you have to go into a separate

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
where you have to go into a separate
playlist<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.850> order<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> play<00:00:57.359> these<00:00:57.600> maps<00:00:57.899> or

is<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> follow<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> same<00:00:59.879> map

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is it going to follow in the same map

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.509 
is it going to follow in the same map
rotation<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.280> know

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
rotation of what we have now we do know

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.270 
rotation of what we have now we do know
that<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:03.300> follows<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> same<00:01:04.440> map<00:01:04.710> rotation

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that it follows in the same map rotation
