00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
like a good game and if i don't really

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.950 
like a good game and if i don't really
like<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> chamber<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.780> don't<00:00:54.780> it's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
like one of the chamber I don't it's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.630 
like one of the chamber I don't it's
just<00:00:54.989> me<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.500> don't<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.579> I

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
because I guess usually weapons with me

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.710 
because I guess usually weapons with me
is<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.070> i'll<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.340> winning<00:02:26.610> by<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.510> don't
