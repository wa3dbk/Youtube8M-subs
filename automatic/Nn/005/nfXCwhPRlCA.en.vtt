00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.319 

Camacho<00:00:46.219> I've<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.460> read<00:00:47.640> mine<00:00:47.850> yet<00:00:48.120> but

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
Camacho I've not read mine yet but

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.540 
Camacho I've not read mine yet but
probably<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:51.649> as<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:55.550> it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
probably will and as you can see it's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
probably will and as you can see it's
much<00:00:56.699> bigger<00:00:56.940> material<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.780> higher<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.289> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
much bigger material much higher up this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.549 
much bigger material much higher up this
just<00:00:59.039> sticks<00:00:59.280> counter<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> top<00:01:00.469> of<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
just sticks counter to the top of the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:10.450 
just sticks counter to the top of the
toe<00:01:01.739> box<00:01:02.270> this<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> sits<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:07.610> and

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
toe box this kind of sits in there and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.120 
toe box this kind of sits in there and
this<00:01:11.460> material<00:01:11.869> on<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> foam<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this material on this is just a foam so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.170 
this material on this is just a foam so
it's<00:01:14.310> probably<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.700> little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.030> more

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it's probably a little bit more

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's probably a little bit more
comfortable

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
comfortable

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.100 
comfortable

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.539 
this is although this is really thin
well<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.530> less<00:01:19.740> durable<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.340> won't

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
well it's a lot less durable this won't

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.230 
well it's a lot less durable this won't
