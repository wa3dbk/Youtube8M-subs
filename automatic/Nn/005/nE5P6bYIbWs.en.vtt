00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.650
 never say or how you still 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.900
 have to learn to play the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.280
 bass guitar to bridges what is this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.809
 we play guitar 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.100
 it's just doing rhythmic things 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.410
 disagree open bar deals is 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.430
 accompanied in improvised arpeggios on the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.529
 hunting back composed of metal 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.859
 symphonic or something else can be ok 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.670
 Okay 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.670
 we'll see that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 so that's a question that a lot 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 many beginners may be posing 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.010
 even every beginner 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.019
 how long is it okay 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 take to know how to play the guitar or 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.989
 more precisely how many times 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.399
 time it's going to take me to master 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.570
 the rhythms and says how much you have to in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.549
 take to control the bars and where 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.370
 how much water does it take to insert this 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.659
 that you want to do at his place there 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.489
 unfortunately we can not answer 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.699
 to this question why 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.989
 and already because it's going to depend on 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.759
 working time that you spend on 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.530
 your guitar and I'm not talking about time 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.270
 working in terms of day week 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 or two months I'm talking about time of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.869
 work in terms of time per day 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.090
 precisely because if you work 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.479
 not me three hours a day for a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 year 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.440
 well you will have learned a lot more 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 that if you work ten minutes by 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.490
 day for five years so already there there is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 a huge thing to see is that we 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.950
 can not talk about contracts and in term 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.929
 weeks but rather in terms of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.240
 time per day so already that if it changes 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.069
 you can put six months or a month 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 to learn the same safe thing in 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.100
 as long as you go there every day 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.200
 the other thing is that it also depends 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.250
 of your goals as we saw in the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.289
 brief introduction 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.509
 if you want control and 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.590
 jazz improvisation is a lot 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.509
 a lot more work 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 necessary that just learn 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.060
 some open chords and make a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.520
 rhythmic on 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.780
 in addition to that we must also talk about the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.700
 quality of your work because of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 we do not really work hard 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.789
 a little deconcentrated we are not very 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.410
 clean 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.819
 we do not care a bit and at 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.989
 contrary sometimes we work super 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.060
 seriously and we are progressing a lot 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.890
 faster like that so the quality your 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.239
 work will also influence the time that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 you will pass to learn a 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.400
 particular technique and finally he 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.599
 must also mention your abilities there 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.709
 in which are softer with others 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.269
 an action more experience than 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.760
 others in other areas or in 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.410
 other instruments and suddenly some 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.920
 will simply learn faster 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.290
 that others 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.670
 and suddenly the conclusion to all that is 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.349
 that if you wonder how many 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.860
 time I will need to take such 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.959
 or something 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.489
 Well, we can not answer you 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.459
 depend on far too much of 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.260
 factors many of which are unknown and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.489
 we can not give you an answer 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.930
 some will take a month to do 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.030
 something off that odometer six 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.500
 months to learn the same thing but 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.739
 the thing you have to remember in everything 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.850
 that's because we do not care what 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.230
 count it's not the time you 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.490
 go to take this or that 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.240
 thing what matters is that you are going 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.620
 to finish by 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.510
 know how to do it that's the most 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.120
 important that you put it a month or 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.220
 six months it should not change anything 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.050
 for sure it's sometimes a little bit 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.150
 demotivating to say to myself oh my god I m 6 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.620
 months before you can do that but 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.120
 it's even more demotivating to tell oneself 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.530
 Well, but it takes me too long 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.030
 so I do not it is better to put 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.350
 time to take something and know the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.850
 do not do it at all 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.150
 it does not matter if other people they 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.170
 arrive faster than you do not care 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.540
 the bottom line is that you 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.370
 learn to do it so I insist 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.600
 on it if you are a beginner and that 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.650
 you panic a bit because you 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.180
 the impression of not moving very fast 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.250
 where you feel about your goals 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.590
 are very far it does not matter 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.790
 take a step back anyway 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.200
 even if you slowly learn 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.040
 learn anyway every day 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.910
 know how to do things that you do not 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.740
 did not know how to do the day before 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.090
 and little by little you will know how to do 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.420
 of the guitar and that's all that 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.430
 account 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.080
 so take a little courage a little bit of 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.690
 motivation forget about these issues of 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.750
 goal time and it's just 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.040
 work progress improved you and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.330
 before you report it 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.980
 will know how to do things absolutely 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.780
 awesome and you will amaze yourself 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.140
 so here's his last little tip for 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.220
