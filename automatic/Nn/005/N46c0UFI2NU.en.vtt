or maybe a Monday morning but you know
all<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:04.860> took<00:02:05.219> from<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> beta

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
all I really took from the beta

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.429 
all I really took from the beta
even<00:02:06.450> though<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.570> didn't<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> play<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
even though I didn't get to play it that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.969 
even though I didn't get to play it that
much<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:08.000> well<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.390> least<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.500> think

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
much was well at least to what I think

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.270 
much was well at least to what I think
about<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.310> game

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
about the game

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.930 
about the game
I<00:02:12.340> think<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.550> aim-down-sights<00:02:13.330> really<00:02:14.170> slow

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I think the aim-down-sights really slow

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.490 
I think the aim-down-sights really slow
the<00:02:15.940> movement<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> game<00:02:16.870> feels<00:02:17.140> kind<00:02:17.410> of

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the movement in the game feels kind of

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.260 
the movement in the game feels kind of
sluggish<00:02:17.800> somebody<00:02:18.370> mentioned<00:02:18.819> in<00:02:18.940> my<00:02:19.120> video

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
sluggish somebody mentioned in my video

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.110 
sluggish somebody mentioned in my video
it<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:20.290> feels<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.800> more<00:02:21.610> sluggish

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
it it feels like a more sluggish

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.760 
it it feels like a more sluggish
battlefield<00:02:22.660> 3<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.290> thought<00:02:23.470> about<00:02:23.620> all

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
battlefield 3 and I thought about all

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.620 
battlefield 3 and I thought about all
that<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.040> know<00:02:24.160> that's<00:02:24.580> pretty<00:02:24.790> true<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.300> it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
that you know that's pretty true like it

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.830 
that you know that's pretty true like it
it<00:02:25.780> does<00:02:26.050> feel<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.290> way<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:28.060> don't<00:02:28.569> know

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
it does feel that way and I don't know

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.840 
it does feel that way and I don't know
I'm<00:02:29.500> kind<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.010> judging<00:02:30.190> off<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.640> map

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
I'm kind of just judging off of the map

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.610 
I'm kind of just judging off of the map
but<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.510> does<00:02:31.630> kind<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.930> seem<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.350> it's<00:02:32.560> gonna

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
but it does kind of seem like it's gonna

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.610 
but it does kind of seem like it's gonna
be<00:02:33.330> can't<00:02:34.330> really<00:02:34.480> tell<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.720> if<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.380> game<00:02:35.530> is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
be can't really tell you if the game is

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.410 
be can't really tell you if the game is
gonna<00:02:35.770> be<00:02:35.920> more<00:02:36.130> campy<00:02:36.610> ER<00:02:36.640> or<00:02:37.000> if<00:02:37.209> it's<00:02:37.330> gonna

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
gonna be more campy ER or if it's gonna

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.050 
gonna be more campy ER or if it's gonna
be<00:02:37.600> fast<00:02:37.840> paced<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.520> tend<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.790> more
