00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
that we put in there so ye should be

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.880 
that we put in there so ye should be
giving<00:00:46.710> us<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.300> signal<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> isn't<00:00:49.050> we're

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.200 
giving us a signal but it isn't we're
gonna<00:00:49.980> see<00:00:50.160> what's<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
gonna see what's going on with this to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
gonna see what's going on with this to
see<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> fixed<00:00:52.100> I'm<00:00:53.100> just

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
see if we can get it fixed I'm just

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
see if we can get it fixed I'm just
going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> switch<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> off<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.600> we'll

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
going to switch it off and then we'll

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.020 
going to switch it off and then we'll
move<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.079> that

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
move on from that

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.010 
move on from that
ok<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.960> problem<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:59.120> we<00:01:00.120> had

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
ok then with the problem that we had

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
ok then with the problem that we had
with<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.590> I've<00:01:01.680> managed<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
with this what I've managed to do is

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.230 
with this what I've managed to do is
this<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.350> called<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.430> connect<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this the so called there is connect the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.649 
this the so called there is connect the
number<00:01:06.450> 7<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.010> connector<00:01:09.000> goes<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.420> for

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
number 7 that the connector goes on for

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
number 7 that the connector goes on for
the<00:01:09.750> antenna<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> component<00:01:11.939> above<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.390> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the antenna the component above it is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
the antenna the component above it is
there<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> components<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
there the components of the right of it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
there the components of the right of it
is<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> component<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> left<00:01:18.140> wasn't

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
is the component to the left wasn't

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.719 
is the component to the left wasn't
there<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.890> bridged<00:01:20.310> there

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
there so what of them is bridged there

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.960 
there so what of them is bridged there
are<00:01:20.850> solder<00:01:21.270> joints<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.430> I'm<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.790> switch

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
are solder joints I I'm going to switch

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.240 
are solder joints I I'm going to switch
back<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.900> what<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
back on now to see what we get with the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
back on now to see what we get with the
signal<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.880> we'll<00:01:27.000> move<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> okay<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:27.869> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
signal and we'll move on okay what we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.530 
signal and we'll move on okay what we
have<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.159> phone<00:01:29.549> switched<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
have here then is the phone switched and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.480 
have here then is the phone switched and
back<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.070> signal<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> o2

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
back are and the signal on the o2

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
back are and the signal on the o2
network<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> UK<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.150> least<00:01:36.420> looking

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
network in the UK at least looking

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.249 
network in the UK at least looking
better<00:01:37.909> it's<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.060> between<00:01:39.240> 1<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> 2<00:01:39.930> bears

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
better it's going between 1 and 2 bears

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.359 
better it's going between 1 and 2 bears
on<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:41.790> o2<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.930> working<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> around<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.979> area

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
on the o2 now working it around the area

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.380 
on the o2 now working it around the area
where<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> computer<00:01:45.960> room<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.820> it's<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
where the computer room is it's up to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.050 
where the computer room is it's up to
about<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.170> Tamar<00:01:49.439> 3<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.729> phone

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
about it can be on Tamar 3 on a phone

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
about it can be on Tamar 3 on a phone
that's<00:01:51.270> ok<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:52.890> too<00:01:53.070> bad<00:01:53.280> it's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that's ok so that's not too bad it's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.639 
that's ok so that's not too bad it's
certainly<00:01:54.000> an<00:01:54.450> improvement<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.470> you'll

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
certainly an improvement now if you'll

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.359 
certainly an improvement now if you'll
notice<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:56.360> it's<00:01:57.409> got<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> cydia<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.219> cuz

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
notice here it's got a cydia on it cuz
