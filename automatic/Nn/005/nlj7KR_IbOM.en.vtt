chain at the end of your row so let's

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.540 
chain at the end of your row so let's
say<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> want<00:00:27.599> 10<00:00:27.810> stitches<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.500> chain<00:00:28.830> 10<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.460> I'm

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
say I want 10 stitches I chain 10 so I'm

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.010 
say I want 10 stitches I chain 10 so I'm
going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.760> chain<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.000> more<00:00:31.669> okay<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:33.329> Tunisian

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
going to chain one more okay in Tunisian

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.900 
going to chain one more okay in Tunisian
I'll<00:00:34.500> go<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> back<00:00:35.190> loop<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> back

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
I'll go in the back loop in the back

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.049 
I'll go in the back loop in the back
bump<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.890> I'm<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> skip

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
bump but for this one I'm going to skip

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.709 
bump but for this one I'm going to skip
two<00:00:39.390> chains<00:00:40.489> just<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.850> top<00:00:42.120> loop<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
two chains just go in that top loop of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.549 
two chains just go in that top loop of
the<00:00:43.200> V<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.870> then<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> draw<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the V and then I'm going to draw up a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.880 
the V and then I'm going to draw up a
loop<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.660> want<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> yarn<00:00:49.289> over<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> draw

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
loop and then want to yarn over and draw

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.119 
loop and then want to yarn over and draw
through<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:52.070> go<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> next<00:00:53.730> stitch<00:00:55.129> draw

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
through one go into the next stitch draw

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.110 
through one go into the next stitch draw
the<00:00:56.190> loop<00:00:56.610> yarn<00:00:57.539> over<00:00:57.960> draw<00:00:58.190> through<00:00:59.190> one<00:01:02.120> go

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the loop yarn over draw through one go

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.440 
the loop yarn over draw through one go
into<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.570> next<00:01:03.750> stitch<00:01:04.760> drop<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> loop<00:01:06.090> yarn

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
into the next stitch drop a loop yarn

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
into the next stitch drop a loop yarn
over<00:01:06.900> draw<00:01:07.110> through<00:01:07.680> one

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
over draw through one

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.850 
over draw through one
so<00:01:08.610> basically<00:01:09.030> we're<00:01:09.240> making<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.630> little

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
so basically we're making these little

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.090 
so basically we're making these little
single<00:01:10.860> chains<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> base<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.420> our<00:01:12.540> loops

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.830 

and<00:01:17.100> we're<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> across<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and we're going to do that across the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.280 
and we're going to do that across the
whole<00:01:18.869> row<00:01:23.060> that's<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.360> first<00:01:24.600> half<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.110> our

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
whole row that's the first half of our

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.359 
whole row that's the first half of our
stitch<00:01:26.390> now<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.689> we're<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.369> this

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
stitch now what we're going to do this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
stitch now what we're going to do this
is<00:01:29.579> what<00:01:29.729> makes<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> different

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
is what makes it different

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
is what makes it different
regular<00:01:32.490> Tunisian<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.270> would<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.630> work

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
regular Tunisian we would just work

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
regular Tunisian we would just work
these<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:38.689> draw<00:01:39.689> through

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
these off you know we would draw through

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.749 
these off you know we would draw through
one<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.860> through<00:01:41.100> two<00:01:41.310> all<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> way

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
one and then through two all the way

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.899 
one and then through two all the way
across<00:01:42.259> for<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.409> extended<00:01:43.979> stitch<00:01:44.250> or<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
across for this extended stitch or the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.109 
across for this extended stitch or the
high<00:01:45.329> stitch<00:01:46.250> but<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.579> we're<00:01:47.759> using<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
high stitch but because we're using a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
high stitch but because we're using a
double-ended<00:01:48.570> hook<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.170> want<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
double-ended hook and we want to use a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.749 
double-ended hook and we want to use a
reef<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> reversible<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:52.340> got<00:01:53.340> some

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
reef do a reversible thing I got some

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.149 
reef do a reversible thing I got some
green<00:01:54.060> yarn<00:01:54.390> here

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.410 

and<00:01:58.659> we<00:01:59.659> can<00:02:00.020> our<00:02:00.439> work<00:02:00.770> around<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:01.789> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and we can our work around so that the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.830 
and we can our work around so that the
tail<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:03.079> coming<00:02:03.409> off<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.770> right<00:02:04.689> and<00:02:05.689> the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
tail is coming off the right and the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.229 
tail is coming off the right and the
wrong<00:02:06.020> sides<00:02:06.380> facing<00:02:06.590> because<00:02:07.579> it's<00:02:07.939> going<00:02:08.149> to

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
wrong sides facing because it's going to

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.419 
wrong sides facing because it's going to
be<00:02:08.330> reversible<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.380> we're<00:02:10.069> just<00:02:10.190> going<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
be reversible and we're just going to

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.520 
be reversible and we're just going to
catch<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.759> yarn<00:02:12.340> draw<00:02:13.340> through<00:02:13.670> one<00:02:14.530> yarn

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
catch that yarn draw through one yarn

with this green chain one and then you
go<00:02:50.060> into<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.480> next<00:02:50.709> vertical<00:02:51.709> bar<00:02:52.780> drop<00:02:53.780> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
go into the next vertical bar drop a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.030 
go into the next vertical bar drop a
loop<00:02:54.140> chain<00:02:55.069> one<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.780> do<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.110> all<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.440> way

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
loop chain one you do this all the way

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.229 
loop chain one you do this all the way
across<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.790> row<00:02:59.200> just<00:03:00.200> like<00:03:00.380> we<00:03:00.560> did<00:03:00.739> with<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
across the row just like we did with the

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.440 
across the row just like we did with the
first<00:03:02.239> color<00:03:06.609> and<00:03:07.609> I'm<00:03:07.730> showing<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.209> this

I<00:03:10.370> made<00:03:10.400> was<00:03:10.850> with<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.359> novelty<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.410> yarn

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
I made was with a novelty of the yarn

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:22.210 
I made was with a novelty of the yarn
pie<00:03:14.389> stitch<00:03:14.930> or<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.260> extended<00:03:21.220> Tunisian

pie stitch or the extended Tunisian

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.870 
pie stitch or the extended Tunisian
stitch<00:03:22.370> now<00:03:22.730> I'll<00:03:22.880> go<00:03:23.000> under<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.630> tail<00:03:24.880> of

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
stitch now I'll go under the tail of

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.349 
stitch now I'll go under the tail of
this<00:03:26.269> color<00:03:26.540> want<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.810> go<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.109> last<00:03:27.350> bar

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
this color want to go in that last bar

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.059 
this color want to go in that last bar
and<00:03:29.359> drop<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.840> loop<00:03:31.329> so<00:03:32.590> I'm<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.859> turn

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
and drop the loop so I'm going to turn

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.979 
and drop the loop so I'm going to turn
it<00:03:34.310> around<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:35.920> if<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.459> keep<00:03:37.730> your<00:03:38.600> one<00:03:38.810> ball

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it around now if you keep your one ball

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.930 
it around now if you keep your one ball
yarn<00:03:39.319> on<00:03:39.530> one<00:03:39.709> side<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.190> other<00:03:40.340> ball<00:03:40.609> on<00:03:40.819> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
yarn on one side and other ball on the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.620 
yarn on one side and other ball on the
other<00:03:40.970> side<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:42.680> kind<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.130> easier<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.760> do

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
other side it's kind of easier to do

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.699 
other side it's kind of easier to do
your<00:03:44.810> turnover<00:03:45.910> okay<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:48.019> slide<00:03:48.380> it<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.680> the

your turnover okay you slide it to the

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.780 
your turnover okay you slide it to the
other<00:03:48.920> end<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.280> your<00:03:49.340> hook<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:52.100> just<00:03:52.310> pick

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
other end of your hook and you just pick

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.670 
other end of your hook and you just pick
up<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:55.370> other<00:03:55.549> yarn<00:03:55.959> don't<00:03:56.959> pull<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:57.170> down<00:03:57.440> too

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
up the other yarn don't pull it down too

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.280 
up the other yarn don't pull it down too
tight<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.760> know<00:03:58.849> lose<00:03:59.090> elasticity<00:03:59.720> on<00:04:00.139> the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
tight you know lose elasticity on the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170 
tight you know lose elasticity on the
edges<00:04:00.650> here<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.700> don't<00:04:01.849> want<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.000> too

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
the carried loop drill thing like that

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.240 
the carried loop drill thing like that
and<00:05:07.900> make<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:08.930> chain<00:05:09.350> one<00:05:09.590> don't<00:05:09.860> forget<00:05:09.920> to

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
and make that chain one don't forget to

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.720 
and make that chain one don't forget to
do<00:05:10.340> that

make it tight enough that you don't have
a<00:05:29.360> big<00:05:29.540> loop<00:05:29.810> on<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.170> end

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
a big loop on the end

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.700 
a big loop on the end

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
you drop a lip and then yarn over and

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.430 
you drop a lip and then yarn over and
draw<00:05:36.860> through<00:05:37.040> to<00:05:38.290> see<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:41.870> you<00:05:42.140> see<00:05:42.290> how

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
draw through to see so that you see how

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.680 
draw through to see so that you see how
that<00:05:42.500> loop<00:05:42.860> is<00:05:43.040> kind<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.460> list<00:05:43.730> but<00:05:43.970> it's<00:05:44.150> not

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
that loop is kind of list but it's not

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.890 
that loop is kind of list but it's not
too<00:05:45.050> loose<00:05:46.300> that<00:05:47.300> comes<00:05:47.540> with<00:05:47.690> practice

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
too loose that comes with practice

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:56.140 
too loose that comes with practice
getting<00:05:48.320> that<00:05:48.410> right<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:51.470> let<00:05:52.280> off<00:05:53.650> okay<00:05:55.150> and

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
getting that right and let off okay and

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.930 
getting that right and let off okay and
then<00:05:56.419> we<00:05:56.570> go<00:05:56.690> back<00:05:56.900> across<00:05:58.720> chain<00:05:59.720> one<00:06:00.940> under

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
then we go back across chain one under

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.490 
then we go back across chain one under
the<00:06:02.060> loop<00:06:02.300> pull<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.050> up<00:06:03.850> chain<00:06:04.850> one<00:06:05.950> loop<00:06:07.360> loop

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
the loop pull it up chain one loop loop

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.780 
the loop pull it up chain one loop loop
chain<00:06:09.500> 1<00:06:09.530> I<00:06:09.950> want<00:06:10.280> to<00:06:10.430> do<00:06:12.160> one<00:06:13.160> more<00:06:13.340> row<00:06:13.580> after

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
chain 1 I want to do one more row after

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.409 
chain 1 I want to do one more row after
this<00:06:14.590> so<00:06:15.590> we<00:06:15.740> can<00:06:15.950> get<00:06:16.040> a<00:06:16.100> real<00:06:16.400> good<00:06:16.430> idea<00:06:16.970> what

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
this so we can get a real good idea what

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.030 
this so we can get a real good idea what
this<00:06:17.600> looks<00:06:17.840> like<00:06:17.930> okay<00:06:18.380> I<00:06:18.410> went<00:06:18.650> through<00:06:18.919> that

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
this looks like okay I went through that

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.580 
this looks like okay I went through that
last<00:06:19.310> loop<00:06:19.550> plus<00:06:20.030> the<00:06:20.240> carried<00:06:20.479> chain<00:06:21.020> by<00:06:21.530> the

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
last loop plus the carried chain by the

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.909 
last loop plus the carried chain by the
carried<00:06:22.310> string<00:06:24.040> roll<00:06:25.040> it<00:06:25.190> up<00:06:26.590> now<00:06:27.590> see<00:06:27.770> when

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
carried string roll it up now see when

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.460 
carried string roll it up now see when
you<00:06:28.010> carry<00:06:28.310> your<00:06:28.550> yarn<00:06:29.140> you'll<00:06:30.140> have<00:06:30.320> these

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
you carry your yarn you'll have these

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.090 
you carry your yarn you'll have these
floats<00:06:30.860> on<00:06:31.160> the<00:06:31.220> ends<00:06:32.350> but<00:06:33.350> you<00:06:33.500> don't<00:06:33.680> have<00:06:33.860> to

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
floats on the ends but you don't have to

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.090 
floats on the ends but you don't have to
cut<00:06:34.340> and<00:06:34.550> draw<00:06:34.940> in<00:06:35.210> your<00:06:35.240> tail<00:06:35.630> every<00:06:35.950> time<00:06:36.950> you

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
cut and draw in your tail every time you

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.700 
cut and draw in your tail every time you
change<00:06:37.310> color<00:06:37.700> I<00:06:38.030> almost<00:06:38.960> forgot<00:06:39.410> to<00:06:39.560> do<00:06:39.680> my

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
change color I almost forgot to do my

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.810 
change color I almost forgot to do my
chain<00:06:40.070> one<00:06:40.310> at<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.640> end<00:06:40.760> here<00:06:41.200> there<00:06:42.200> we<00:06:42.380> go

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
chain one at the end here there we go

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
chain one at the end here there we go
now<00:06:43.820> turn<00:06:44.479> it<00:06:44.720> around<00:06:44.810> I<00:06:45.700> have<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:47.180> color<00:06:47.600> on

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
now turn it around I have the color on

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.810 
now turn it around I have the color on
the<00:06:47.960> right<00:06:48.140> the<00:06:48.350> other<00:06:48.380> on<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:48.740> left<00:06:48.770> now<00:06:49.760> you

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
the right the other on the left now you

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.080 
the right the other on the left now you
look<00:06:50.060> at<00:06:50.210> this<00:06:50.419> you<00:06:51.320> can<00:06:51.350> see<00:06:51.680> this<00:06:51.860> one<00:06:52.130> the

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
look at this you can see this one the

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.830 
look at this you can see this one the
green<00:06:53.360> is<00:06:53.570> more<00:06:53.750> dominant<00:06:54.229> and<00:06:55.450> then<00:06:56.450> on<00:06:56.630> this

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
green is more dominant and then on this

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.600 
green is more dominant and then on this
side

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:05.190 

the<00:07:01.080> wine<00:07:02.080> color<00:07:02.350> is<00:07:02.650> more<00:07:02.950> dominant<00:07:04.140> so<00:07:05.140> you

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
the wine color is more dominant so you

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.410 
the wine color is more dominant so you
continue<00:07:05.710> doing<00:07:06.040> that<00:07:06.430> and<00:07:06.700> you'll<00:07:06.910> have<00:07:06.940> a

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
continue doing that and you'll have a

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.110 
continue doing that and you'll have a
striped<00:07:07.930> scarf<00:07:08.490> with<00:07:09.490> these<00:07:09.730> long<00:07:11.130> or<00:07:12.130> high

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
striped scarf with these long or high

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.270 
striped scarf with these long or high
stitches<00:07:13.810> I<00:07:16.530> still<00:07:17.530> think<00:07:17.770> they<00:07:17.890> would<00:07:18.070> I

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 
stitches I still think they would I
