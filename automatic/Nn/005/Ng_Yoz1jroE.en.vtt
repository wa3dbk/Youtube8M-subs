 [music] 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.870
 again guys sean don't call me here 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.179
 to talk about maybe 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.460
 the coolest stuff on mwc 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.199
 This is a manâ€™s pocket watch 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 am they called earlier shaft from see 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.920
 there are wooden panels on 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.260
 Presentations here are companies like 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.390
 samsung are being treated and announce phones 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.820
 of metal and glass and these hours 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.119
 wood panels also they can be 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.759
 ceramic tin brass 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.960
 these back panels can actually 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.850
 I will change here because 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 slightly pull you away from the smartphone 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.920
 thanks to the form factor here will be 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.770
 less message on the screen immediately visible 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.930
 what's the unique design on the back here 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.460
 parts of the device have a camera and it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.170
 there is a very interesting camera function 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.190
 can be turned earlier like this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.989
 for approaching and focusing mom on them 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
 reports that the camera in the mass version 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.530
 will be comparable to the camera in iphone 5 or 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.140
 iphone 5s 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.270
 i.e. this is a pretty good camera 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.130
 which will work well with weak 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 she will have a decent light 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.630
 permission we have an early prototype but 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 version of what will hit the market later in this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.610
 year will be very similar to her football and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 they also want to charge it with 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.799
 new yes biceps on ruoff 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.650
 which will allow manoyan to use 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.979
 various panels cling on key rings and so 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.590
 further chitin they design with 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.060
 leather cover for your device screen 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.990
 so they will become more like 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.790
 traditional pocket watches from basic in 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 overall every corner of this device 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.320
 although there are no corners here so every corner 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.619
 will be different in work from ordinary 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.360
 smartphones it at about 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.850
 using the card itself will offer you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.400
 more scenic route with 7 that is all 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.050
 will look more attractive 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.760
 all this will not be the shortest and 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.650
 convenient way to get to the point 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.330
 destination 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.240
 I would say what to do do 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.210
 victorian style there are different kefir 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.890
 blood and now we just look at deme 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.930
 but you can say that the device 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.810
 created focusing on past centuries 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.930
 This is a very cool thing to keep it comfortable. 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.790
 hands it is a light device will be a little 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.060
 changed to market 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.010
 used to work with firefox os and when 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.080
 they will be the end of the year the cost will be 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.200
 slightly lower than any separated 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.580
 flagship phone for example ah background 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.250
