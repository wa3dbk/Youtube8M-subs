brighter<00:01:43.290> hunt<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.740> she<00:01:43.799> said<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:45.149> uh<00:01:45.259> anyways

don't<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:52.590> i<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.549> because<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
till I get a MOAB I don't know how long

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.700 
till I get a MOAB I don't know how long
it<00:02:23.970> would<00:02:24.030> take<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.510> haven't<00:02:24.960> really<00:02:25.050> tried<00:02:25.410> for

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
it would take I haven't really tried for

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.010 
it would take I haven't really tried for
one<00:02:25.830> yet<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.310> tried<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> couple<00:02:27.300> times<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.870> got

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
one yet I tried a couple times and got

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.770 
one yet I tried a couple times and got
close<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:29.100> don't<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.270> haven't

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
close but I don't know I just haven't

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.030 
close but I don't know I just haven't
got<00:02:30.960> around<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:31.830> I've<00:02:31.890> been

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
got around to it because I've been

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.530 
got around to it because I've been
learning<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.460> game<00:02:32.580> winning<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.090> guns<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
learning the game winning the guns and

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
learning the game winning the guns and
stuff<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.800> think<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.130> about

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
stuff like that so I think it's about

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.240 
stuff like that so I think it's about
time<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.610> start<00:02:35.760> doing<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.190> said

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
time to start doing that so like I said

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.210 
time to start doing that so like I said
I<00:02:38.430> think<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.850> might<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.900> live<00:02:40.200> comms<00:02:40.500> post

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
I think I might just do live comms post

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.580 
I think I might just do live comms post
every<00:02:41.610> game<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> series<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.380> starts

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
getting too long I may just cut it down

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.310

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
powered off my xbox didn't think

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.140 
powered off my xbox didn't think
anything<00:06:33.660> of<00:06:33.870> it<00:06:34.040> and<00:06:35.040> when<00:06:35.790> you<00:06:35.880> power<00:06:36.090> off

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
anything of it and when you power off

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.780 
anything of it and when you power off
your<00:06:36.270> Xbox<00:06:36.900> like<00:06:37.169> I<00:06:37.260> said<00:06:37.470> it's<00:06:37.790> essentially

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
your Xbox like I said it's essentially

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.219 
your Xbox like I said it's essentially
the<00:06:38.820> same<00:06:39.060> as<00:06:39.120> dashboarding<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.870> cuts<00:06:40.110> your

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
the same as dashboarding it cuts your

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:40.800 
the same as dashboarding it cuts your
connection

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
connection

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.300 
connection
doesn't<00:06:41.260> have<00:06:41.350> a<00:06:41.380> chance<00:06:41.560> to<00:06:41.800> save<00:06:42.040> anything

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.610 
doesn't have a chance to save anything
and<00:06:43.270> I<00:06:43.540> think<00:06:43.780> that's<00:06:43.960> what<00:06:44.110> happened<00:06:44.470> it

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620
