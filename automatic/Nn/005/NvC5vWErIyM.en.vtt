00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.330
 smart but what do you think of 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.810
 other administrators of the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.810
 server 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:33.109

 good when which road the first volt 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:55.219
 who played minecraft when we have 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.949
 serious played on our server there 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.439
 he dragged morfeo and remember 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:03.199
 having completely destroyed his home 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:12.560
 that he had built because I exploded the 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:16.699
 hot clipper the summer of 2011 for 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.549
 legend's fault is an orgy entered me 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:31.159
 tell why you decided to open a 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:35.359
 public server but new cartel but 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.189
 because I think that everything is different from more and 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.560
 then we had in mind to do so many 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:43.639
 things that, however, those who I group players i 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.720
 lighthouses and the e-mail era there is no real 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.090
 motivation was a project we have 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.900
 decided to start it then with the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.709
 patronage of animedb then the project is 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.979
 went ahead separating from that of b 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.680
 g it is yet a lot to the project 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:05.930
 arrived up to what today that 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.049
 advice you would give to a player just 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:18.560
 entered servers never use the 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:19.130
 word to read the cats you want that 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.140
 thing 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.780
 of the Alpine troops even if they did not risk it 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.440
 to be if it happens with me but if I will 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.780
 too particularly and then cobas and that 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.130
 we will respect the mind you have fun if 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.660
 must of course ask the pass 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.520
 what would you say the players that 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.480
 ask to become is the for 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.800
 server moderators or administrators 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.900
 the important thing to use ours 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.070
 commands to have the program 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.940
 installed to produce 12 and know 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.670
 exactly of our server that has a 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.980
 right channeled design you are 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:04.100
 this can become what it is 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:07.400
 today I'd say do it because it's not always 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.560
 as funny as we usually don't 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.960
 we never play 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.309
 but what I find them capable of 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.669
 while cassinate weapons believe them 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:21.469
 feel happy if I could have one 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.779
 only thing you would say to all 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:29.889
 players defined as bimbiminkia present 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:29.889
 within the servers of the list of 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:42.110
 and nothing would understand 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:43.369
 the drawings of the goats that you could see one 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.899
 word goat 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:52.309
 the interview is over here 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:54.770
 add something a little lying 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:57.080
 the interview does not even finish well 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.360
 here to thank all of you who are 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.379

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.379
