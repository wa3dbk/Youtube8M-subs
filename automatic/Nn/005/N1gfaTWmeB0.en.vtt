slides<00:01:15.590> right<00:01:15.740> out<00:01:17.590> those<00:01:18.590> are<00:01:18.770> stuck

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
slides right out those are stuck

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.910 
slides right out those are stuck
together<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.369> little<00:01:19.550> bit<00:01:23.410> obviously<00:01:24.410> three

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
together a little bit obviously three

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.130 
together a little bit obviously three
arrows<00:01:25.250> isn't<00:01:25.610> many<00:01:25.820> but<00:01:26.240> right<00:01:26.750> off<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.990> bat

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
arrows isn't many but right off the bat

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.170 
arrows isn't many but right off the bat
I'm<00:01:27.320> happy<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.979> took<00:01:28.220> very<00:01:28.760> little<00:01:28.910> effort

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
I'm happy that took very little effort

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.430 
I'm happy that took very little effort
to<00:01:29.390> get<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.720> arrows<00:01:29.869> out<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:32.509> decoy<00:01:33.259> is

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
to get the arrows out the decoy is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.139 
to get the arrows out the decoy is
self-healing<00:01:33.920> or<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.280> target<00:01:34.640> self-healing

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
self-healing or the target self-healing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.160 
self-healing or the target self-healing
so<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.509> comes<00:01:35.690> right<00:01:35.840> back<00:01:35.960> together

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
so it comes right back together

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.920 
so it comes right back together
obviously<00:01:37.009> I'll<00:01:37.580> know<00:01:37.729> more<00:01:37.940> after<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.390> I<00:01:38.509> keep

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
obviously I'll know more after I I keep

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.690 
obviously I'll know more after I I keep
shooting<00:01:39.170> through<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.470> summer<00:01:39.800> but<00:01:40.160> so<00:01:40.460> far

so<00:01:40.759> good<00:01:42.160> again<00:01:43.190> I've<00:01:43.580> had<00:01:44.030> mixed<00:01:44.270> results

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
so good again I've had mixed results

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.740 
so good again I've had mixed results
with<00:01:45.070> full-sized<00:01:46.070> deer<00:01:46.460> targets<00:01:46.940> but<00:01:47.600> this

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
with full-sized deer targets but this

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.270 
with full-sized deer targets but this
one<00:01:47.930> seems<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.259> be<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> good<00:01:48.590> one<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:48.830> if<00:01:49.130> you're

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
one seems to be a good one so if you're

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.270 
one seems to be a good one so if you're
looking<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:50.240> shoot<00:01:50.869> at<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.050> life-sized<00:01:51.530> target

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
this summer the redhead deer target

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.620 
this summer the redhead deer target
looks<00:01:55.039> like<00:01:55.190> it's<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.369> hard<00:01:55.550> one<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.729> beat<00:01:55.940> good

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
looks like it's a hard one to beat good

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.990 
looks like it's a hard one to beat good
luck<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:56.930> year
