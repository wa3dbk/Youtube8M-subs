was<00:06:00.900> very<00:06:01.140> good<00:06:01.350> i<00:06:01.650> had<00:06:02.070> cancer<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.580> few<00:06:02.670> years

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
was very good i had cancer a few years

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.200 
was very good i had cancer a few years
ago<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.630> i<00:06:04.080> felt<00:06:04.410> what<00:06:04.650> Megan<00:06:05.160> centers<00:06:05.430> do<00:06:05.610> is

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
ago and i felt what Megan centers do is

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.030 
ago and i felt what Megan centers do is
something<00:06:06.600> that<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.870> didn't<00:06:07.350> really<00:06:07.560> get<00:06:07.770> at

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
something that I didn't really get at

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.560 
something that I didn't really get at
the<00:06:08.160> time<00:06:08.430> and<00:06:08.640> therefore<00:06:09.000> I<00:06:09.180> thought<00:06:09.420> it's

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
the time and therefore I thought it's

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.740 
the time and therefore I thought it's
very<00:06:09.990> worthy<00:06:10.560> cause<00:06:10.980> to<00:06:11.400> support<00:06:11.750> we've

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
very worthy cause to support we've

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.440 
very worthy cause to support we've
