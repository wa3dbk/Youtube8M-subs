freezing<00:00:35.250> cold<00:00:35.460> water<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.630> depends

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
freezing cold water and that all depends

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.319 
freezing cold water and that all depends
that<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.250> tells<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.670> how<00:00:38.790> gummy<00:00:39.210> the
