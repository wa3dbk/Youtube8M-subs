00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.240
I’ve been asked a lot of times why I became
a mechanic and people are surprised to hear

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.000
me say it’s because I’m an environmentalist.
But the fact of the matter is a mechanic is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.529
actually a very environmentally conscious
job. Mechanics do a lot of recycling. A lot

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.380
of used auto parts are reused and reused again
sometimes.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.910
Consider this: if a vehicle is operating at
its best it’s polluting at its least. And

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.250
if it’s not leaking – it’s not leaking
into the environment.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.829
Mechanics do a lot of recycling. Ranging from
the oil and the filters that are drained out

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.900
of vehicles to car parts you know tires are
resold, things like an air compressor, a power

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.829
steering pump, a starter being bought from
a scrap yard and put into a service vehicle

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.720
because it’s going to save you some money.
There’s all kinds of things that are recycled

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.110
out of your car from the engine oil, to the
coolant, to brake fluid, steering fluid, that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.440
kind of thing. Tires, I myself have bought
used tires at the scrap yard to save money.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.530
What else? A hood, glass – you can pull
glass out of… I have also many times bought

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.811
used starters, used alternators, used power
steering pumps… so my point is: there’s

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:19.789
all kinds of things you can recycle off of
your car and that are recycled – there’s

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.319
a huge industry around recycling the parts
out of automobiles and trucks.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.929
Now mechanics, in Canada anyway, tend to make
a pretty good income when you compare them

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.639
to the other “blue collar” trades. Well
the pay’s pretty good but you know the fact

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:39.659
is a mechanic has to make an enormous investment
in tools in order to do his job well. Employers

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.579
are no longer willing to put those tools in
their businesses so it’s up to the mechanic

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.529
to outfit himself. It can cost a lot of money
to make sure you’ve got all the tools that

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:53.520
you’re going to need to meet the demands
of everyday work. Bu the investment is totally

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.630
worth it.
With the right tools and the right knowledge

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.659
you can save a lot of money by repairing things
on your own and doing stuff for yourself instead

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.729
of having to either throw something away and
buy another one or take it in to some expensive

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.000
place and have it repaired.
So a mechanic is a consummate repairman. He’s

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.700
required to have all kinds of skills under
his belt. He’s required to know about electrical

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.640
systems as well as electronics. He’s required
to know about plumbing, to know about hydraulics.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.430
For sure a mechanic needs to know about a
lot of different things ranging from how to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.790
weld to know about physics for that matter.
For instance a mechanic needs to understand

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.590
the physical properties of gases when pressurized,
liquids when pressurized, things like that.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.070
In order to troubleshoot electronic systems
a mechanic needs to be able to understand

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.560
the systems. He needs to know what a transistor
is, what a semi-conductor is, what a diode

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.510
is and how it functions where to find them
and how to troubleshoot them.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.340
A mechanic needs a certain amount of carpenters’
skills as well. You might need to build a

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.110
wooden gantry sometimes in order to lift an
engine out of a boat, for instance.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.790
It’s important to know about paint and epoxy
and how to do basic bodywork so that you can

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.160
do repairs to vehicles yourself – again
without having to send things out or for being

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.760
able to do it for other people for fun and
profit.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.230
Think about the fact that there are machines
absolutely everywhere you turn and that they

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.660
aren’t going away any time soon. But besides
that who do you think is going to be working

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.610
on the electric machines of the future? There
are all kinds of electric vehicles already

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.670
on the road today and the warehouses of the
world are full of DC and AC electric forklifts

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.010
and they’re not being worked on by guys
in white lab-coats, I can tell you that.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.830
Because of the amount of training you need
to be able to do your job effectively and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.900
it’s becoming more complicated to become
a mechanic all the time.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.870
This is the service manual for the car I was
driving ten years ago.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.750
This is the service manual for the car I’m
driving today. And it’s ten years old, by

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.492
the way. Yeah, so they’re getting a little
more complicated.

00:04:01.492 --> 00:04:08.670
So a mechanic is required to know a lot more
than is traditionally understood. Often they’re

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.270
referred to as “Grease Monkeys“. One of
the great things about being a mechanic is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.430
that feeling of self-reliance, of being able
to repair things yourself. Not having to make

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.829
appointments at shops and show up on time
and wait for days sometimes for them to do

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.180
the repairs. You know what’s wrong. You
go get the parts you need. You put it together.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.780
You save an awful lot of money.
Yeah for certain it can be frustrating at

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.240
times but there’s an immense satisfaction
at the end of the day of having been able

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.520
to revive a machine that didn’t run.
Besides being a halfway decent welder, and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.300
carpenter and plumber and electrician, you’re
going to need to be a crackerjack machine

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.360
operator and have an air endorsement on your
driver’s licence.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.770
So if you’re thinking of a new career path
for yourself the fact is being a mechanic

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.240
actually is an environmentally friendly job:
helping save the environment by ensuring that

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.250
vehicles burn less fuel and leak less.
You can save an awful lot of money by repairing

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.959
things yourself and that’s the whole point
of this series and this website.
