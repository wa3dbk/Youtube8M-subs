00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
you can see the steam coming up through

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.010 
you can see the steam coming up through
the<00:00:07.319> vent<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.890> middle<00:00:08.360> that<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.690> good

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020 
the vent in the middle that is a good

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.799 
the vent in the middle that is a good
steady<00:00:10.320> stream<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:11.010> steam<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.450> want<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
steady stream of steam so you want to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.980 
steady stream of steam so you want to
set<00:00:13.080> your<00:00:13.200> timer<00:00:13.379> for<00:00:13.559> 10<00:00:13.889> minutes<00:00:14.219> now

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
set your timer for 10 minutes now

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:31.609 
set your timer for 10 minutes now
after<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.039> can<00:00:17.190> pick<00:00:17.310> your<00:00:17.460> way<00:00:17.580> home

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.530 

our<00:00:32.040> canner<00:00:32.310> has<00:00:32.610> been<00:00:32.790> dancing<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.360> 10

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
our canner has been dancing for 10

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
our canner has been dancing for 10
minutes<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.220> and<00:00:35.220> now<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> put<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
minutes now and now I'm going to put the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.900 
minutes now and now I'm going to put the
weight<00:00:36.390> on

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.150 

No

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.810 

now<00:00:48.710> it'll<00:00:49.710> start<00:00:49.950> coming<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.310> the<00:00:50.460> crusher

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
now it'll start coming up the crusher

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.110 
now it'll start coming up the crusher
now<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.770> weight<00:00:52.950> starts<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.520> jiggle<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
now and as the weight starts to jiggle I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
now and as the weight starts to jiggle I
will<00:00:54.660> slowly<00:00:54.840> turn<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.230> temperature<00:00:55.530> down

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
will slowly turn the temperature down

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.850 
will slowly turn the temperature down
until<00:00:56.790> it<00:00:56.910> gets<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.240> just<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.600> steady<00:00:57.990> slow

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
until it gets to just a steady slow

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.350 
until it gets to just a steady slow
steady<00:00:59.250> rocking<00:01:01.970> you<00:01:02.970> don't<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> turn

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
steady rocking you don't want to turn

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.860 
steady rocking you don't want to turn
the<00:01:03.480> temperature<00:01:03.630> down<00:01:03.840> too<00:01:04.199> quickly<00:01:04.520> because

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
the temperature down too quickly because

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.690 
the temperature down too quickly because
you<00:01:06.870> don't<00:01:07.020> want<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.230> to<00:01:07.350> stop<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:08.550> then

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you don't want it to stop because then

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
you don't want it to stop because then
you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> turn<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> temperature<00:01:09.720> back<00:01:09.840> up

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
you have to turn the temperature back up

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.960 
you have to turn the temperature back up
and<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.920> know<00:01:10.980> wait<00:01:11.160> longer<00:01:11.370> for<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> start

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and you know wait longer for it to start

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.390 
and you know wait longer for it to start
again<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.800> weight<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.190> this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
again you can see the weight is this

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160 
again you can see the weight is this
starting<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.820> Biddle<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.690> I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.050> turn

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
starting to Biddle now I'm going to turn

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.870 
starting to Biddle now I'm going to turn
it<00:01:16.320> down

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.400 

okay<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:20.940> I've<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.540> my<00:01:21.720> temperature<00:01:22.080> turned

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
okay so I've have my temperature turned

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.320 
okay so I've have my temperature turned
down<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.680> little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
down a little bit and as you can see the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.010 
down a little bit and as you can see the
weight<00:01:24.660> it's<00:01:24.900> just<00:01:25.229> gently<00:01:25.590> jiggly

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.750 

the<00:01:32.500> camera<00:01:32.830> looks<00:01:33.040> like<00:01:33.190> it's<00:01:33.370> making<00:01:33.549> a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
the camera looks like it's making a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.250 
the camera looks like it's making a
little<00:01:34.000> bit<00:01:34.119> faster<00:01:34.630> than<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.869> actually<00:01:35.020> is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
little bit faster than it actually is

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.320 
little bit faster than it actually is
but<00:01:36.070> it's<00:01:36.190> just<00:01:36.280> slowly<00:01:36.580> rocking<00:01:36.970> back<00:01:37.299> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
but it's just slowly rocking back and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.109 
but it's just slowly rocking back and
forth<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:38.740> I'm<00:01:38.890> just<00:01:39.130> going<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.490> set<00:01:39.760> my<00:01:39.790> timer

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
forth now I'm just going to set my timer

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.070 
forth now I'm just going to set my timer
for<00:01:40.240> 40<00:01:40.840> minutes

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.520 

and<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.880> good<00:01:49.060> idea<00:01:49.120> obviously<00:01:49.900> don't

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
and it's a good idea obviously don't

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.310 
and it's a good idea obviously don't
leave<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.950> house<00:01:51.130> while<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.790> on<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.330> say

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
leave the house while this is on I say

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.350 
leave the house while this is on I say
where<00:01:53.620> I<00:01:53.650> can't<00:01:53.920> hear<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.340> because<00:01:54.790> if<00:01:55.240> it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
where I can't hear it because if it

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.630 
where I can't hear it because if it
starts<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.690> speed<00:01:56.050> up<00:01:56.290> or<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:57.430> if<00:01:57.550> the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
starts to speed up or like if the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.520 
starts to speed up or like if the
pressure<00:01:57.820> starts<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.270> get<00:01:58.390> too<00:01:58.570> hot<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.410> will

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
pressure starts to get too hot you will

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.720 
pressure starts to get too hot you will
hear<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.010> little<00:02:00.190> wait<00:02:00.430> it'll<00:02:01.090> rock<00:02:01.360> faster

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
hear that little wait it'll rock faster

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.460 
hear that little wait it'll rock faster
so<00:02:03.730> I<00:02:03.760> can<00:02:04.030> work<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.510> kitchen<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.140> can<00:02:05.320> work

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
so I can work in the kitchen I can work

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.500 
so I can work in the kitchen I can work
this<00:02:05.710> in<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.070> living<00:02:06.400> room<00:02:06.550> here<00:02:06.820> as<00:02:07.090> long<00:02:07.360> as

this in the living room here as long as

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.970 
this in the living room here as long as
I<00:02:07.600> can<00:02:07.750> care<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.440> continue<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:08.860> with

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
I can care it I can continue on with

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.580 
I can care it I can continue on with
anything<00:02:09.310> else<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.880> keep<00:02:10.780> my<00:02:10.960> ear<00:02:11.110> open<00:02:11.410> for

anything else and keep my ear open for

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.670 
anything else and keep my ear open for
it<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:15.250> hang<00:02:15.460> our<00:02:15.610> timers<00:02:16.090> gone<00:02:16.330> off<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.500> now

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
all I'm going to do is turn off the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.760 
all I'm going to do is turn off the
temperature<00:02:21.720> now<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:23.140> want<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.530> let<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
temperature now you just want to let the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.700 
temperature now you just want to let the
canner<00:02:24.040> sit<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:25.060> come<00:02:25.390> down<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.260> pressure<00:02:26.500> on

canner sit and come down and pressure on

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.300 
canner sit and come down and pressure on
its<00:02:26.890> own

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
its own

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.700 
its own
don't<00:02:27.790> take<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.180> weight<00:02:28.390> off<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.780> top<00:02:28.990> don't

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
don't take the weight off the top don't

the<00:05:18.370> time<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.820> don't<00:05:18.910> have<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.390> problem<00:05:19.780> with

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
the time I don't have a problem with

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.930 
the time I don't have a problem with
that<00:05:19.930> so<00:05:20.350> for<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.860> odd<00:05:20.980> jar<00:05:21.310> I'll<00:05:21.520> just<00:05:21.670> put<00:05:21.880> it

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
that so for the odd jar I'll just put it

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.220 
that so for the odd jar I'll just put it
in<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.060> fridge<00:05:22.270> because<00:05:22.720> sometimes

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
in the fridge because sometimes

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.140 
in the fridge because sometimes
reprocessing<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.460> gets<00:05:24.640> a<00:05:24.730> little<00:05:24.940> mushy

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
reprocessing it it gets a little mushy

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.270 
reprocessing it it gets a little mushy
but<00:05:26.110> for<00:05:26.260> something<00:05:26.410> like<00:05:26.560> strawberry<00:05:27.130> jam

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
but for something like strawberry jam

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.680 
but for something like strawberry jam
and<00:05:27.550> that's<00:05:27.610> not<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.880> problem<00:05:30.360> anyway<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:31.420> I

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
and that's not a problem anyway so I

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.540 
and that's not a problem anyway so I
hope<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.080> can<00:05:32.230> see<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.440> canning<00:05:32.950> peas<00:05:33.160> and

hope you can see that canning peas and
any<00:05:34.000> other<00:05:34.180> vegetable<00:05:34.690> is<00:05:34.810> actually<00:05:35.170> very

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
any other vegetable is actually very

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.700 
any other vegetable is actually very
easy<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:36.330> aside<00:05:37.330> from<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.810> time<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.290> takes<00:05:38.500> in

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
easy and aside from the time it takes in

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.070 
easy and aside from the time it takes in
the<00:05:38.860> canner<00:05:39.160> it's<00:05:39.850> actually<00:05:40.540> less<00:05:40.750> work<00:05:41.050> than

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
the canner it's actually less work than

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.130 
the canner it's actually less work than
doing<00:05:41.500> something<00:05:41.860> like<00:05:41.890> strawberry<00:05:42.430> jam<00:05:43.140> so
