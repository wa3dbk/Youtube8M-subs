okay<00:00:00.510> I'm<00:00:00.630> inserting<00:00:01.050> my<00:00:01.380> mold<00:00:01.680> as<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.700> can

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay I'm inserting my mold as you can

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.910 
okay I'm inserting my mold as you can
see<00:00:03.060> I've<00:00:03.210> done<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> burnout<00:00:03.870> here<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.440> wax<00:00:04.650> is

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
see I've done a burnout here the wax is

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.680 
see I've done a burnout here the wax is
no<00:00:05.130> longer<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.700> there<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.089> there's<00:00:06.240> an<00:00:06.299> open

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
no longer in there and there's an open

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.290 
no longer in there and there's an open
cavity<00:00:07.429> for<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.519> metal<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.030> be<00:00:09.179> pushed<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
cavity for my metal to be pushed in to

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.440 
cavity for my metal to be pushed in to
tighten<00:00:12.300> those<00:00:12.450> up<00:00:13.340> what<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> normally<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:15.150> is

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
tighten those up what I normally do is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.960 
tighten those up what I normally do is
light<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.199> torch<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.880> metal<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:17.940> still<00:00:18.119> hot

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
light the torch that metal is still hot

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.320 
light the torch that metal is still hot
get<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.090> ready<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.510> melt<00:00:21.720> again<00:00:23.060> your<00:00:24.060> metal

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
get it ready to melt again your metal

get it ready to melt again your metal
cools<00:00:24.539> down<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:25.050> bit<00:00:25.260> while<00:00:25.619> you're

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
cools down a little bit while you're

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.000 
cools down a little bit while you're
grabbing<00:00:25.949> your<00:00:26.250> class<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:27.029> okay

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
grabbing your class that's okay

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.310 
grabbing your class that's okay
just<00:00:29.010> reheat<00:00:29.460> it

takes a good amount of time to get used

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.770 
takes a good amount of time to get used
to<00:00:55.400> what<00:00:55.820> your<00:00:55.940> metal<00:00:56.210> needs<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.570> look<00:00:56.720> like

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780

to what your metal needs to look like
before<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.530> insert<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.220> into<00:00:58.460> your<00:00:58.700> mold<00:00:59.410> it's

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
before you insert it into your mold it's

before you insert it into your mold it's
not<00:01:00.620> completely<00:01:01.190> molten<00:01:01.580> you<00:01:02.420> end<00:01:02.600> up<00:01:02.750> with<00:01:02.930> a

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
not completely molten you end up with a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.080 
not completely molten you end up with a
incomplete<00:01:04.250> casting<00:01:05.770> if<00:01:06.770> it's<00:01:06.979> over<00:01:07.400> heated

or<00:01:08.330> boiled<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.979> end<00:01:10.190> up<00:01:10.280> with<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.490> lot<00:01:10.640> of

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
or boiled you end up with a lot of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.730 
or boiled you end up with a lot of
porosity<00:01:11.090> which<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.690> basically<00:01:12.080> little<00:01:12.410> holes

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
porosity which is basically little holes

porosity which is basically little holes
in<00:01:13.220> your<00:01:13.520> casting<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:16.310> other<00:01:16.520> many<00:01:16.880> other

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
in your casting and other many other

in your casting and other many other
issues<00:01:17.330> which<00:01:17.840> can<00:01:17.930> arise<00:01:18.940> here<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:19.970> little

graphite stick and stir it up make sure

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.230 
graphite stick and stir it up make sure
it's<00:01:36.120> all<00:01:36.270> molten<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.290> together<00:01:41.210> before<00:01:42.210> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's all molten and together before you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
it's all molten and together before you
go<00:01:43.190> now<00:01:44.190> what<00:01:44.370> I'm<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:46.619> shake<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
go now what I'm going to do is shake it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.100 
go now what I'm going to do is shake it
up<00:01:48.590> drop<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.800> pen<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.510> basically<00:01:51.900> when

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
up drop that pen and it's basically when

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.780 
up drop that pen and it's basically when
I<00:01:52.140> let<00:01:52.410> this<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.800> it's<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.280> shoot<00:01:53.580> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
I let this go it's going to shoot that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:04.370 
I let this go it's going to shoot that
metal<00:01:54.090> into<00:01:54.510> my<00:01:54.660> cavity<00:02:03.050> sterling<00:02:04.050> silver

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
metal into my cavity sterling silver

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.949 
metal into my cavity sterling silver
usually<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.950> takes<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.310> few<00:02:05.340> seconds<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.119> cool

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.590 

once<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.110> hits<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.739> flask<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.940> pretty

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
once it hits that flask it's a pretty

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.140 
once it hits that flask it's a pretty
much<00:02:12.810> taking<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.320> shape<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.130> find<00:02:15.060> out

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
much taking the shape and you find out

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.979 
much taking the shape and you find out
what<00:02:15.330> your<00:02:15.480> ended<00:02:15.690> up<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:15.989> there

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.899 

let<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.709> spin<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.069> usually<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:24.610> let<00:02:24.819> it

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
let it spin I usually just let it

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.479 
let it spin I usually just let it
complete<00:02:25.269> spinning<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.019> cool<00:02:26.530> naturally

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
complete spinning so it cool naturally

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.199 
complete spinning so it cool naturally
and<00:02:28.769> then<00:02:29.769> we<00:02:29.890> remove<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.250> flask<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:31.060> I

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
and then we remove that flask that I

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.300 
and then we remove that flask that I
just<00:02:31.420> shot<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:31.810> metal<00:02:32.110> into<00:02:32.439> and<00:02:32.739> quench<00:02:33.159> it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
just shot that metal into and quench it

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.760 
just shot that metal into and quench it
in<00:02:33.430> some<00:02:33.640> water<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:35.189> pull<00:02:36.189> out<00:02:36.340> your<00:02:36.519> piece
