00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
out for a little bit of a lot and the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.650

main thing I found is that mainly for

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.569 
main thing I found is that mainly for
these<00:00:35.840> roads<00:00:36.230> because<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.920> turns<00:00:37.160> are<00:00:37.399> not

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
these roads because the turns are not

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.970 
these roads because the turns are not
really<00:00:37.880> compact<00:00:38.420> there<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.690> lot<00:00:38.840> longer<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:39.530> has

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
really compact there a lot longer it has

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.800 
really compact there a lot longer it has
trouble<00:00:40.489> doing<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.820> distances<00:00:41.450> between<00:00:41.480> the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
trouble doing the distances between the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.840 
trouble doing the distances between the
turns<00:00:42.050> but<00:00:42.260> on<00:00:42.380> the<00:00:42.560> really<00:00:42.830> sharp<00:00:43.070> turns<00:00:43.280> it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
turns but on the really sharp turns it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.280 
turns but on the really sharp turns it
does<00:00:44.060> okay<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.450> know<00:00:44.660> it's<00:00:44.840> not<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.140> greatest

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.990 
the cars power all the way to the max
because<00:01:42.409> i'm<00:01:42.740> more<00:01:43.010> of<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.190> power<00:01:43.430> drifter<00:01:43.820> and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
because i'm more of a power drifter and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.450 
because i'm more of a power drifter and
then<00:01:44.540> um<00:01:44.780> though<00:01:45.320> how<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:45.860> control<00:01:46.400> that

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
then um though how you control that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.330 
then um though how you control that
power<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:47.090> by<00:01:47.390> tuning<00:01:47.960> your<00:01:48.080> gears<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.190> that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
power is by tuning your gears so that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.219 
power is by tuning your gears so that
they<00:01:49.520> are<00:01:49.549> effective<00:01:50.030> now<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.270> gear<00:01:50.900> tuning

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
they are effective now the gear tuning

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.179 
they are effective now the gear tuning
you're<00:01:51.350> going<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.560> see<00:01:51.650> there<00:01:51.830> isn't<00:01:52.159> like

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
you're going to see there isn't like

search<00:02:06.170> drift<00:02:06.560> search<00:02:07.400> tunes<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.000> my<00:02:08.599> tune<00:02:08.810> is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
search drift search tunes and my tune is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.949 
search drift search tunes and my tune is
going<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.709> ray<00:02:10.159> drift<00:02:10.819> obviously<00:02:11.510> under

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
going to be ray drift obviously under

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.130 
going to be ray drift obviously under
the<00:02:12.110> drift<00:02:12.470> category<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:14.360> and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
the drift category so that is that and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.989 
the drift category so that is that and
just<00:02:15.799> look<00:02:15.980> at<00:02:16.099> all<00:02:16.159> those<00:02:16.340> upgrades<00:02:16.730> look<00:02:16.879> at

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:16.999 
just look at all those upgrades look at

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.709 
just look at all those upgrades look at
me<00:02:17.090> going<00:02:17.329> at<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:17.629> full<00:02:18.139> speed<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:19.279> a<00:02:19.310> boss<00:02:19.790> so

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
me going at it full speed like a boss so

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:21.600 
me going at it full speed like a boss so
um

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
um

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.160 
um
I'm<00:02:22.610> basically<00:02:23.060> just<00:02:23.180> upgrading<00:02:23.959> everything

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
I'm basically just upgrading everything

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.290 
I'm basically just upgrading everything
about<00:02:25.040> all<00:02:25.190> increased<00:02:25.610> shifting<00:02:26.060> speeds

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
about all increased shifting speeds

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.059 
about all increased shifting speeds
because<00:02:26.450> one<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:26.959> my<00:02:27.050> things<00:02:27.110> when<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.620> drift<00:02:27.920> is

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
because one of my things when I drift is

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.920 
because one of my things when I drift is
sometimes<00:02:28.550> depending<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.180> how<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.480> am<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.840> a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
sometimes depending on how I am in a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.570 
sometimes depending on how I am in a
turn<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.379> need<00:02:30.560> more<00:02:30.739> power<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.099> little<00:02:31.430> less

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
turn if I need more power a little less

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.530 
turn if I need more power a little less
I<00:02:31.849> have<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> tendency<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.860> shifting<00:02:33.860> mid<00:02:34.099> turns

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
I have a tendency of shifting mid turns

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.240 
I have a tendency of shifting mid turns
wall<00:02:35.540> drifting<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.680> something<00:02:37.010> that

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
wall drifting so that is something that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.420 
wall drifting so that is something that
I<00:02:37.640> want<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.569> have<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> bit<00:02:39.440> more<00:02:39.470> control<00:02:40.010> over

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
I want to have a bit more control over

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.270 
I want to have a bit more control over
if<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.299> know<00:02:41.390> what<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.540> mean<00:02:41.569> because<00:02:42.280> it

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
if you know what I mean because it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.610 
if you know what I mean because it
allows<00:02:43.670> me<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.299> have<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.930> bit<00:02:45.140> more<00:02:45.170> power<00:02:45.500> or

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
allows me to have a bit more power or

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.440 
allows me to have a bit more power or
have<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.950> bit<00:02:46.190> less<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.819> lot<00:02:46.940> easier<00:02:47.120> to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
have a bit less and it's a lot easier to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.180 
have a bit less and it's a lot easier to
control<00:02:47.720> all<00:02:48.230> your<00:02:48.470> power<00:02:48.680> if<00:02:48.950> you're<00:02:49.069> in

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
control all your power if you're in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.059 
control all your power if you're in
second<00:02:49.549> gear<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.599> turn<00:02:50.890> obviously<00:02:51.890> could

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
second gear and a turn obviously could

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.440 
second gear and a turn obviously could
probably<00:02:52.280> take<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.670> turn<00:02:52.849> in<00:02:53.060> third<00:02:53.299> gear

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
probably take that turn in third gear

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.580 
probably take that turn in third gear
because<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:53.840> enough<00:02:54.049> power<00:02:54.200> but<00:02:54.500> you

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
because you have enough power but you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.020 
because you have enough power but you
have<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.739> lot<00:02:54.799> more<00:02:55.130> chance<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.579> spinning<00:02:55.640> out

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
have a lot more chance of spinning out

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.309 
have a lot more chance of spinning out
and<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:56.299> coming<00:02:56.599> out<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.870> turn<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.170> need

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
and then coming out of the turn you need

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.370 
and then coming out of the turn you need
more<00:02:57.440> power<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.130> shift<00:02:58.430> up<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.760> third<00:02:58.970> and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
more power so you shift up the third and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.960 
more power so you shift up the third and
just<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.440> give<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.680> an<00:03:00.769> idea<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.130> how<00:03:01.370> amazing

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
just to give you an idea of how amazing

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.500 
just to give you an idea of how amazing
this<00:03:02.750> drift<00:03:03.410> tune<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.250> manage<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.209> think

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
this drift tune is is I manage I think

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.819 
this drift tune is is I manage I think
this<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.690> also<00:03:06.019> due<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.379> fact<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.650> there

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
this is also due to the fact that there

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.039 
this is also due to the fact that there
wasn't<00:03:06.980> route<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.730> traffic<00:03:08.120> on<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.390> map<00:03:08.540> one

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
wasn't route of traffic on the map one

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.600 
wasn't route of traffic on the map one
of<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.290> things<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.650> really<00:03:09.680> wish<00:03:10.250> they<00:03:10.430> would

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
of the things I really wish they would

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.190 
of the things I really wish they would
give<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.209> an<00:03:11.299> option<00:03:11.450> two<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.930> turn<00:03:12.079> off

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
give you an option two is to turn off

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.259 
give you an option two is to turn off
the<00:03:12.319> traffic<00:03:12.650> ignore<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.099> turn<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.700> was<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
the traffic ignore that turn that was a

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.460 
the traffic ignore that turn that was a
bad<00:03:14.480> one<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:15.319> um<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.739> get<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.390> twenty-three

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
bad one but um I get a twenty-three

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.720 
bad one but um I get a twenty-three
twenty-four<00:03:18.470> thousand<00:03:19.040> skill<00:03:19.280> points<00:03:19.549> going

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
twenty-four thousand skill points going

that's without cashing it in I end up
crashing<00:03:22.840> typical<00:03:23.840> me<00:03:23.959> because<00:03:24.379> well<00:03:24.709> you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
crashing typical me because well you

crashing typical me because well you
know<00:03:25.069> when<00:03:25.670> you're<00:03:25.790> drifting<00:03:26.090> like<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.510> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
know when you're drifting like this the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.539 
know when you're drifting like this the
only<00:03:26.959> way<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.920> up<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.250> by

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
only way really to up is by

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.580 
only way really to up is by
crashing<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.030> see<00:03:29.209> right<00:03:29.359> here<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:30.380> just

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
crashing you see right here it is just

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.949 
crashing you see right here it is just
some<00:03:30.799> amazing<00:03:31.370> drifting<00:03:31.850> this<00:03:32.060> car<00:03:32.359> honestly

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
some amazing drifting this car honestly

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.110 
some amazing drifting this car honestly
it<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.680> stock<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.190> really<00:03:34.489> nice<00:03:34.639> drifting

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
it in stock is a really nice drifting

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.819 
it in stock is a really nice drifting
car<00:03:35.299> you<00:03:35.480> give<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.810> bit<00:03:35.959> more<00:03:35.989> power<00:03:36.380> you

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
car you give it a bit more power you

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.740 
car you give it a bit more power you
lower<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.730> suspension<00:03:37.880> make<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:38.569> a<00:03:38.599> little

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
lower the suspension make it a little

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.660 
lower the suspension make it a little
lighter<00:03:38.989> do<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.470> couple<00:03:39.799> changes<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.400> tires

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
lighter do a couple changes to the tires

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.610 
lighter do a couple changes to the tires
the<00:03:41.060> gear<00:03:41.299> is<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> pressure<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.109> you<00:03:42.560> know

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the gear is the pressure and you know

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.710 
the gear is the pressure and you know
what<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:43.010> get<00:03:43.190> yourself<00:03:43.370> a<00:03:43.730> really<00:03:44.209> nice<00:03:44.389> drip

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
what you get yourself a really nice drip

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.780 
what you get yourself a really nice drip
card<00:03:44.959> because<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.590> really<00:03:45.889> handles<00:03:46.400> itself

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
card because it really handles itself

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.000 
card because it really handles itself
really<00:03:47.030> well<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.660> has<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> tendency<00:03:48.200> obviously

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
really well it has a tendency obviously

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.440 
really well it has a tendency obviously
like<00:03:49.190> any<00:03:49.370> other<00:03:49.609> car<00:03:49.790> if<00:03:49.910> you<00:03:50.000> gave<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.299> too

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
like any other car if you gave it too

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.110 
like any other car if you gave it too
much<00:03:50.599> power<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.500> will<00:03:51.859> spin<00:03:52.220> out<00:03:52.400> but<00:03:52.849> if<00:03:52.970> you

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
much power it will spin out but if you

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.229 
much power it will spin out but if you
leave<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.569> let<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.989> be<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.500> will<00:03:55.160> do<00:03:55.459> incredibly

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
leave it let it be it will do incredibly

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.860 
leave it let it be it will do incredibly
well<00:03:56.359> um<00:03:57.730> or<00:03:58.730> else<00:03:59.120> what<00:03:59.450> has<00:03:59.569> been<00:03:59.720> happening

because I have the VIP BOS and so just
look<00:04:30.430> at<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.700> this<00:04:30.850> car<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.420> really<00:04:31.930> good<00:04:32.140> it

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
look at it this car is really good it

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.500 
look at it this car is really good it
keeps<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.740> drips<00:04:32.980> going<00:04:33.310> on<00:04:33.520> at<00:04:34.150> all<00:04:34.300> times

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
keeps the drips going on at all times

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.000 
keeps the drips going on at all times
and<00:04:34.810> what's<00:04:35.050> really<00:04:35.290> nice<00:04:35.410> about<00:04:35.470> how<00:04:35.950> the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
and what's really nice about how the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.250 
and what's really nice about how the
gears<00:04:36.310> are<00:04:36.460> tuned<00:04:36.640> is<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:37.150> you're<00:04:37.870> gonna<00:04:37.960> see

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
gears are tuned is that you're gonna see

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.110 
gears are tuned is that you're gonna see
me<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.440> couple<00:04:38.740> times<00:04:38.830> while<00:04:39.310> exiting<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.910> turn

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
me a couple times while exiting a turn

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.330 
me a couple times while exiting a turn
I'll<00:04:40.390> shift<00:04:40.720> up<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.050> third<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.620> because<00:04:42.130> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
I'll shift up the third and because the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.550 
I'll shift up the third and because the
shifting<00:04:42.670> is<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:42.970> quick<00:04:43.210> in<00:04:43.360> this<00:04:43.510> car<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.930> won't

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
shifting is so quick in this car I won't

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.260 
shifting is so quick in this car I won't
have<00:04:44.800> any<00:04:45.040> loss<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.460> power<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.790> i'll<00:04:45.910> keep<00:04:46.090> my

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
have any loss of power and i'll keep my

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.670 
have any loss of power and i'll keep my
drift<00:04:46.540> schooling<00:04:46.870> which<00:04:46.990> allows<00:04:47.230> me<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.530> do

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
drift schooling which allows me to do

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.100 
drift schooling which allows me to do
transitions<00:04:48.220> between<00:04:48.370> these<00:04:49.090> long<00:04:49.390> turns<00:04:49.780> the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
transitions between these long turns the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.900 
transitions between these long turns the
straights<00:04:50.410> where<00:04:50.650> i<00:04:50.740> do<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.190> bit<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.460> bobbing

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
straights where i do a bit of bobbing

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.330 
straights where i do a bit of bobbing
and<00:04:52.000> weaving<00:04:52.060> like<00:04:52.510> this<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.990> then<00:04:53.890> where<00:04:54.310> i

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
and weaving like this and then where i

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.240 
and weaving like this and then where i
basically<00:04:54.940> go<00:04:55.270> flat<00:04:55.750> out<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.170> straight<00:04:56.500> while

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
basically go flat out and straight while

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.830 
basically go flat out and straight while
not<00:04:57.460> flat<00:04:57.700> out<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.000> straight<00:04:58.240> where<00:04:58.450> i<00:04:58.540> go<00:04:58.810> on

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
not flat out and straight where i go on

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.810 
not flat out and straight where i go on
the<00:04:59.050> corners<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.650> i<00:05:00.010> do<00:05:00.070> some<00:05:00.370> cheeky<00:05:00.610> stuff

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.310 
the corners and i do some cheeky stuff
like<00:05:01.000> right<00:05:01.180> here<00:05:01.330> i<00:05:01.360> shifted<00:05:01.840> up<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.110> third

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
like right here i shifted up the third

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.140 
like right here i shifted up the third
coming<00:05:02.620> on<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:02.830> corner<00:05:03.040> look<00:05:03.340> at<00:05:03.490> me<00:05:03.580> now

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
coming on that corner look at me now

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.580 
coming on that corner look at me now
join<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.540> straight<00:05:04.810> i'm<00:05:04.990> able<00:05:05.170> to<00:05:05.380> do<00:05:05.470> my

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
join the straight i'm able to do my

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.110 
join the straight i'm able to do my
bobbing<00:05:05.920> and<00:05:05.980> weaving<00:05:06.040> which<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:06.820> completely

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
bobbing and weaving which I completely

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
bobbing and weaving which I completely
messed<00:05:07.480> up<00:05:07.750> 23<00:05:08.680> files<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:09.190> skill<00:05:09.400> points<00:05:09.760> not

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
messed up 23 files and skill points not

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.120 
messed up 23 files and skill points not
including<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.200> multipliers<00:05:11.620> which<00:05:11.740> is

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
including the multipliers which is

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.800 
including the multipliers which is
pretty<00:05:12.280> good<00:05:12.520> if<00:05:12.700> you<00:05:12.790> included<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.330> time<00:05:13.510> 6

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
pretty good if you included the time 6

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.470 
pretty good if you included the time 6
multiplied<00:05:14.170> that's<00:05:14.380> like<00:05:14.530> 120,000<00:05:15.520> which<00:05:16.240> is

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
multiplied that's like 120,000 which is

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.630 
multiplied that's like 120,000 which is
pretty<00:05:16.870> darn<00:05:17.110> good<00:05:17.230> if<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.590> ask<00:05:17.740> me<00:05:17.920> look<00:05:18.430> how

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
pretty darn good if you ask me look how

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.980 
pretty darn good if you ask me look how
smooth<00:05:18.970> this<00:05:19.180> thing<00:05:19.450> goes<00:05:19.630> around<00:05:19.840> the

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
smooth this thing goes around the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.170 
smooth this thing goes around the
corners<00:05:20.290> and<00:05:20.530> also<00:05:21.160> like<00:05:21.400> any<00:05:21.640> other<00:05:21.850> drift

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180

can do is go around in a donut and
discarded<00:05:27.490> as<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.730> in<00:05:27.910> a<00:05:28.000> magnificent<00:05:28.750> way

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
discarded as that in a magnificent way

plants<00:05:31.480> you<00:05:32.380> can<00:05:32.410> either<00:05:32.650> do<00:05:32.890> it<00:05:33.010> in<00:05:33.100> first

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
plants you can either do it in first

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.980 
plants you can either do it in first
gear<00:05:33.490> but<00:05:34.030> first<00:05:34.360> gears<00:05:34.600> a<00:05:34.660> bit<00:05:34.750> more

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
gear but first gears a bit more

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.250 
gear but first gears a bit more
restraint<00:05:35.440> on<00:05:35.560> well<00:05:36.040> it's<00:05:36.250> it's<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:37.260> little

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
restraint on well it's it's a little

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.630 
restraint on well it's it's a little
less<00:05:38.560> pleasant<00:05:38.830> because<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.340> have<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.520> do<00:05:39.610> a

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
less pleasant because you have to do a

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.610 
less pleasant because you have to do a
lot<00:05:39.820> more<00:05:39.880> correcting<00:05:40.540> because<00:05:41.350> you're

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
lot more correcting because you're

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.350 
lot more correcting because you're
sometimes<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.280> little<00:05:42.430> bit<00:05:42.730> short<00:05:43.030> on<00:05:43.150> power

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
sometimes a little bit short on power

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.740 
sometimes a little bit short on power
and<00:05:43.600> so<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.620> have<00:05:45.220> to<00:05:45.400> force<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:46.000> rear<00:05:46.600> of<00:05:46.630> the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
and so you have to force the rear of the

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.360 
and so you have to force the rear of the
car<00:05:46.960> out<00:05:47.080> if<00:05:47.260> you<00:05:47.380> do<00:05:47.500> in<00:05:47.620> second<00:05:47.980> gear<00:05:48.100> all<00:05:48.280> you

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
car out if you do in second gear all you

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.410 
car out if you do in second gear all you
have<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.580> do<00:05:48.730> is<00:05:48.820> a<00:05:48.850> bit<00:05:49.000> more<00:05:49.180> throttle

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
have to do is a bit more throttle

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.620 
have to do is a bit more throttle
control<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:49.840> lot<00:05:50.080> less<00:05:50.290> steering<00:05:50.710> management

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
control a lot less steering management

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.010 
control a lot less steering management
so<00:05:52.630> yeah<00:05:52.780> guys<00:05:52.990> that<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:54.090> Mercedes<00:05:55.090> c63
