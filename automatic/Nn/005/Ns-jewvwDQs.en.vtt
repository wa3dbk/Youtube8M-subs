00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 people since it the Christmas season that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.400
 at Christmas time a little bit 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.020
 I wanted to be on the road 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.220
 on my main channel a format 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.599
 try something else I always 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.790
 my second channel but do that 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.710
 thought a lot has to do with film 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.670
 I'm here professionals just out and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.529
 let me know if it is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.029
 interesting finds yes or no but that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.250
 wanted to see monthly and that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.810
 is it the films challenge team 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.760
 I have a challenge on a second channel 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.820
 roczen already made the first 14 times 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.289
 sometimes as quasi here or quasi with 15 times 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 and that is a pile of movies from mine 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 collection 20 films are often right 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.460
 current release and I will be this 20 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 movies have quasi discuss on tempo 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.270
 for 200 seconds time as profi ten 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.559
 I have an app in front of me in seconds 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.850
 the noise is every ten seconds 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.440
 I do not want to prove that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.969
 can not only white sheep anyway 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 ten seconds from a film to act and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.539
 People usually like the format 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.340
 Two start the one they have fast 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.949
 Abriss on current blu ray release and 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 the second is who else is guilty of suffering 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.160
 that I can talk so fast 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.719
 we can switch it off directly in this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.070
 challenge preaches twice as fast 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.840
 that it is incredibly exhausting 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.829
 so just start now and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.300
 no i have the movies simple 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.650
 I understand the sequence I know 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.090
 do not try for a long time on the pile 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.460
 to watch so I do not necessarily know 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.020
 what awaits me and as I said 20 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.659
 I wish I had a lot of fun watching movies 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 have fun on it and then 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.689
 just before coming down because it is always 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.320
