00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.650
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.920
 of trail running review this time from 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 the author fair 2013 in germany for 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.230
 present exclusively this new 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.860
 model of the French house Solomon as 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.950
 you are seeing called ix screen here 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.470
 you can see it within the new concept 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.960
 of slippers inside the new 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.239
 collection of shoes called city 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.130
 trail as you can see in this part of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.590
 here a concept of sneakers a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.730
 collection destined to the three to the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.970
 three easier 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.000
 to runners looking for cushioning 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.460
 above and comfort above maybe 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.489
 of benefits to run on about 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.730
 land as we say simple we are going to 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.540
 start seeing these ex screen as 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.550
 you can see it is some shoes that we 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.170
 remember they can remind us perhaps to 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.920
 a concept in x referral for example or 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.490
 even fixed cross max 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.100
 Flex pretty easy and has a sole 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.229
 rather with little prominent tacos 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.720
 look at all this part of here these 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.509
 taquitos that we have already seen in many 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.860
 occasions in the French house and a 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.220
 part 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.480
 outside of another type of is created 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.340
 always from the front to 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.600
 favor a shift towards 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.240
 forward and from half to back the taco 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.210
 in the other direction to prevent the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.210
 skid especially on the descents 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.150
 notice that it has a kind of tendon or 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.140
 It really is the tendon and what it does 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.650
 is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.680
 give one as a kind of nerve this 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.020
 tendon also make the bending be 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.750
 rather more progressive is a tendon that 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.460
 I think it's softer than others that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.070
 Other tendons from other models of 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.520
 Solomon 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.530
 let's see now the part of the mean 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.080
 sole fixes enough material 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 cushioning pretty profile not so much 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.280
 as in other models of this same 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.400
 73 collection that we have seen 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.640
 but despite this, there is still 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.550
 enough cushioning material as you see 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.580
 profile here 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.810
 It is not excessive in the back 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.650
 neither is it toxic in the front 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.500
 it has been sought to go more stuck to the ground 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.290
 also approaching a little bit to fashion or 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.920
 more minimalist trend and therefore 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 the drop is not going to be very expressive 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.130
 I think it's going to go around 68 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.780
 drop millimeters this shoe these 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.440
 ix we write upper as always home 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:01.250
 French taking advantage of the bands a bit 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.860
 what do they do for image to close 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.770
 all the shoe with a system 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.620
 Adapted from tensor that is stored inside 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.360
 from the pocket as usual 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.570
 and the front always with the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.880
 sensitive system c's also used 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.160
 in the old cross max for example a 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.340
 system that adapts to the width of the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.390
 standing and pressing in this part of here 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.700
 you have very open very breathable 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.920
 let's see now I'm going to show you a 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.160
 little inside of these 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.540
 hicks screen 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.540
 he managed to open them 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.920
 set as in this concrete model is 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.550
 notice the seams are seen all 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.050
 the seams are in contact at the foot 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.420
 this will logically be tested for 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.290
 see how they work and pretty quilted 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.720
 forceful in all the part of the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.610
 inside of the heel just like a 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.830
 pretty high structure as you can 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.880
 see the template of these six screen 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.190
 it's simple from the French house itself and 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.410
 in this case technology is not used 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.990
 olite for this model 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.920
 therefore friends within the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.830
 city ​​trail collection one of the 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.350
 components of this collection is this 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.000
 ix screen shoe analyzed as 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.710
 always for bringing running review 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.710
 puntocom see you in the next
