00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 he saw that I am hashish and today I 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.020
 I bring a tag 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.840
 This attack has been nominated by Silvia 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.310
 of the channel miss grooming and the truth 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.140
 is that lately I have been nominated 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.630
 lots of afternoons so I'll try 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.310
 do it little by little but this is the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.950
 first that I wanted to do because it was 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.809
 also the fastest has very few 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.850
 questions that as she says 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.059
 It would be better if they had added more 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.950
 questions but well I'll go what 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.039
 Disney movie was the last one that 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.079
 You saw good, I suppose the 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.949
 last disney movie that I saw was 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.409
 frozen like everyone because the 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.940
 last or the last one that they have taken out and 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.190
 well, frozen 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.469
 What was it you liked about it the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.210
 true that what I liked most about the 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.649
 relationship between the sisters because 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.310
 normally the disney movies 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.520
 usually go as a boy and girl couple and 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.860
 see a relationship between sisters that is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.710
 very cool the truth because it is something 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.509
 new and it seemed very cool to me that the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.750
 disney character would you choose as 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.119
 pet because the truth is that there are many 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.229
 that he would choose as a pet but for 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.229
 example I will say 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 I already know the chameleon of entangled and I 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.230
 love is super funny super 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.020
 fun and I love what is your 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.800
 favorite movie because my movie 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.800
 favorite is entangled that is the new 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.650
 so to speak but it has a lot of essence 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.900
 of the old movie and the truth is 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.229
 I like a lot to me especially 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.869
 protagonist is that I feel very 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.270
 identified not but I do not know related 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.310
 with her I do not know why and I think that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.290
 answer the next question that is 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.149
 what prince or princess they sit with 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.490
 more identified good then with 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.369
 rapunzel what disney song is your 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.970
 favorite because I think that my song 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.330
 worthy and favorite is that of dala lalÃ­n 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.310
 the one of an ideal world threw me hours and 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.020
 hours singing that song with my cousin 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.150
 I remember a city of aladdin and the 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.610
 another one of jamming and we started singing 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.850
 a lot of time and I loved this 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.980
 song is that it's super magical and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.440
 getting excited today sometimes I get the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.540
 I also put to listen to them 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.370
 what moment you would have liked to live in 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.370
 person 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.670
 I suppose almost every end of 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.010
 the movies because they are all super 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.720
 nice but a moment that I love 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.820
 a lot is that of 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.820
 the little mermaid in the boat 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.310
 sorry for my bad song and more because 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.490
 estimated from the throats but good 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.400
 this song I liked a lot and the 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.680
 moment that seems very magical to me though 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.020
 then fall out of the boat but good 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.060
 if they had followed the boat it is that 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.830
 moment is very nice to live it and 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.930
 questions remain about seven and I 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.510
 it seems very ugly to leave it in odd number 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.260
 I do not know why but those things to me do not 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.750
 like 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.810
 I'm going to add a question to make it 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.959
 number 8 which would be which character of 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.860
 Cindy, you wanted me to be your friend or 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.860
 I was in your life 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.280
 I do not think I would be super good the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.650
 genius of the lamp because it is very 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.680
 fun and I think we would take 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.450
 good but sometimes a little silly 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.190
 but good 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.500
 I believe that if the genius of the lamp of 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.000
 Aladdin and well that was all for the 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.370
 Today's video I hope you liked it 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.460
 very much and be attentive because 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.830
 soon I have to upload 3 more packs 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.530
 it certainly has forgotten me I have 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.440
 that nominate some people I'm going to 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.360
 nominate I intuit that I do not know if he has done 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.260
 This tag but good for me just in case 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.090
 nominated she nominated beauty sun land 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.709
 natal and olvera that I also nominated 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.070
 to a tag that I say I have to 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.660
 do so I now nominated her to this 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.450
 I hope you liked the tag very much 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.010

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.139
