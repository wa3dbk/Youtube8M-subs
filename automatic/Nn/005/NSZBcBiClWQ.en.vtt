the<00:00:40.700> play<00:00:40.880> main<00:00:41.149> thing<00:00:41.450> is<00:00:41.630> and<00:00:41.840> it<00:00:42.410> reduces

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
the play main thing is and it reduces

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.710 
the play main thing is and it reduces
the<00:00:43.040> reliance<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:43.700> I've<00:00:43.910> got<00:00:44.090> on<00:00:44.239> my<00:00:44.420> index

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
the reliance that I've got on my index

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.920 
the reliance that I've got on my index
finger<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:46.280> that<00:00:46.309> my<00:00:47.210> other<00:00:47.300> fingers<00:00:47.660> can

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
finger so that my other fingers can

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.670 
finger so that my other fingers can
support<00:00:48.290> it<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.620> I'm<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:50.870> know<00:00:50.930> guitar

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680

playing<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:51.980> more<00:00:52.160> fluent<00:00:52.520> because<00:00:52.790> you've

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
playing is more fluent because you've

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.570 
playing is more fluent because you've
got<00:00:53.120> use<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.330> more<00:00:53.690> fingers<00:00:54.190> so<00:00:55.190> what<00:00:55.520> I've
