00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.600
 the parents of the bride were friends of 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.280
 Mary and Jesus and their new disciples 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.280

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.870

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.180
 everyone is drunk they take out the leftovers 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.629
