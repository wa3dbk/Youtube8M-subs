00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello dear , today I show you how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 to bake her delicious jam cookies 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.040
 can and if that interests you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.630
 then stay tuned that way 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.730
 then all the ingredients are hers 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.500
 but do not need fear I write 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.460
 I indicated the whole length again in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.049
 the infobox 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.390
 I have the whole here now 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 ingredients mixed together still sees that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.210
 no longer I have to do that now 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 of course with my hands 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.029
 knead it does not make mixa 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.029
 because the next man can do it alone 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 not at least not mine and then 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.050
 I show the day x when he is done 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.420
 that is then she learns so must 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 that will look like and I will 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 the whole not now, right here on 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.420
 and because I do not have any and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.180
 Although I have then just be on me 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.739
 little piece of cardboard a heart in a row 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 sign because I would like that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.489
 Heart to be the most important 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.920
 it is that in the middle also 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.410
 a heart is what you cut out of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 world war in the middle so seen one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.289
 should have a point like wordpress 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.090
 See what I mean by my finished house 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.309
 Of course, now I have to go to the dough 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.140
 roll out and before that comes quite nice 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.990
 much more on the counter with it all 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.659
 does not stick 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.670
 there should not really save 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.470
 Last day again in the whole life 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.420
 chosen so that it really no longer 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.840
 I get stuck from outside to inside 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 this plate sticks and to it 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 Of course, I also have free choice 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.820
 pull out to want the whole thing now 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.280
 and of course that also has to be thorough 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 crept in with flour so that looks 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.100
 whole 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.259
 the wellness of gold is quite nice 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.689
 a lot of time and now put it here 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.880
 with turrets or my doll 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.920
 on the dough and just snowing with it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.420
 this knife here as you have seen 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.380
 I now the first click here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.060
 pronounced 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.799
 these are the front pages now 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.450
 backs are of course without even 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.640
 before I put you in the oven 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 I have one more here 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.100
 tablespoon of cream with an algae 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.110
 mixed and would these dough pieces still 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 brush with the machines 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.899
 are golden and now comes the whole 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.520
 look at the oven at 212 minutes 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.209
 the biscuits come out of the oven 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 come 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.349
 As you can see I have no own here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.670
 dry because you just in the 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.830
 after all, does not see because you 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.549
 right on this half packed on it 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.290
 become 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.610
 And of course, that still lacks the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.780
 jam and we have to do that now 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.329
 first broken 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.180
 as I said that the allowance boil up and 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.860
 I've got a jam 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.239
 because the simple without pieces is me 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.650
 think it just better on the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.160
 places is if he is not a bit 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.680
 rauxel 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.630
 if you have like he has it piece 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.549
 would like to have pour then follow 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.220
 Of course you are welcome to do it all 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.260
 load others and so liquid is the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.180
 jam when we bought it 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.980
 and now you can so beautiful-like clicks 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.069
 elapse first speak the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.530
 jam on the biscuit so the top 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.299
 Half of it sticks to it 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.299
 pape burger stuck on 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.330
 the 1 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.190
 and the television is ready the cookies 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.450
 then in hindsight I have that 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.080
 whole now with powdered sugar 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.270
 sprinkled and the same all on 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.490
