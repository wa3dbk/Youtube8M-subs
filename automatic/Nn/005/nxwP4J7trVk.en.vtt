00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
um it's a 5.99 gigabyte which is

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.559 
um it's a 5.99 gigabyte which is
actually<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> six<00:03:54.090> gig

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
actually a six gig

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.320 
actually a six gig
just<00:03:55.080> like<00:03:55.200> my<00:03:55.380> emachines<00:03:55.980> eat<00:03:56.280> hour<00:03:56.519> or<00:03:56.910> my

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
just like my emachines eat hour or my

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
um it has 3.58 use face on it and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.110 
um it has 3.58 use face on it and
there's<00:04:07.110> 2.41<00:04:08.010> gigabytes<00:04:08.580> of<00:04:08.670> free<00:04:08.790> space

there's 2.41 gigabytes of free space

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.000 
there's 2.41 gigabytes of free space
left<00:04:09.420> that's<00:04:09.930> used<00:04:10.140> face<00:04:10.350> by<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.620> way<00:04:10.799> if<00:04:10.890> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
left that's used face by the way if I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.259 
left that's used face by the way if I
said<00:04:11.190> free<00:04:11.400> space<00:04:13.579> alright<00:04:16.579> okay<00:04:17.609> it's

which<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.850> obviously<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:28.229> code<00:04:28.440> works<00:04:28.680> for

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
which is obviously the code works for

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.510 
which is obviously the code works for
intel<00:04:29.280> celeron<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.840> has<00:04:31.020> 127<00:04:32.010> megabytes

intel celeron and it has 127 megabytes
of<00:04:32.640> RAM<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:35.419> that's<00:04:36.419> cool<00:04:40.910> this<00:04:41.910> thing<00:04:42.180> really

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
of RAM so that's cool this thing really

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.480 
of RAM so that's cool this thing really
doesn't<00:04:42.840> have<00:04:43.110> anything<00:04:43.289> that<00:04:43.680> much<00:04:44.039> on<00:04:44.280> it

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
doesn't have anything that much on it

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:51.530 
doesn't have anything that much on it
but<00:04:44.520> it's<00:04:44.910> still<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.870> good<00:04:46.350> computer
