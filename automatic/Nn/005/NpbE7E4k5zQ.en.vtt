 console the developers when they 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.299

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.329

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.570
 played about ten minutes so I'm leaving 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.640
 to say in my opinion about it 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.739
 lie I never tested on the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.890
 trunk and sonic at the summer olympics 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.180
 and winter is good I play four this 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.819
 that hurts me is still that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.080
 robotic is as fast as one 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.060
 swings of robotnik 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.459
 we want an opinion on the game need for 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.890
 speed carbon attention the graphs are 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.560
 limit to his ps2 for a console of 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.600
 new generation tech of jaws in 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.340
 more empowered with the standby swell 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.340
 an art makes the donkey amnesties but 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.410
 it's not french that this game let's tap 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.200
 the sapes I do by sega is a game 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.440
 party game with one to one but you know 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.430
 that figure the goal for example where from 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.620
 you have to race 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.540
 you have to hit the duvet in fact 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.630
 google table on the table 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.049
 obama by producing young people 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.570
 she's called young the doors of a 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.970
 character even zone 2 and 3 wise and 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.010
 just at home of course I'm a big 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.359
 bird fan given two on 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.970
 threats and nothing beats the versions 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.630
 raimon arcade rabbits show moron show is the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.160
 true manna has no more morons 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.450
 and I would add kirby morons show 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.590
 until then difference and clusters 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.720
 different mini games 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.819
 the only difference I mean 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.980
 it's graphism level them I believe that 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.510
 you contradicted yourself cerebral academy game 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.609
 ugly but excellent just like the game 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.120
 ds and just like you too in syria 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.480
 streamer chronicles or a game 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.280
 to play very good very good very well we 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.110
 learns a lot about the story of two 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.819
 years cvg would this one be white or 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.360
 rather this big case no arguments 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.569
 tonio like jim so this one stand 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.250
 in the heart but chained fucking we do not have 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.010
 that this fuck of the day has 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.569
 good maneuverability with the wiimote 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.970
 I was a little skeptical before 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.459
 to play but I would point out that I 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.549
 am misled geometry wars galaxies 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.379
 this one compared to bastien I decided there 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.239
 downstairs it's a game on xbox live arcade and 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.040
 the euro put on on wii but it's more 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.900
 ugly and when you think about it that's why 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.729
 I prefer the a36 and the ps3 rather 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.130
 than the wii because the graphic difference 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.109
 between the gamecube and the wii but y'a 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.360
 almost nothing to see there is a 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.650
 regression is frankly a pity 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.160
 the manufacturers' share of 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.180
 developers or even from nintendo 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.820
 it was like the sound of an engine 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.810
 fouled paris I preferred on the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.030
 wii trauma center 87 eur 5 in opinions 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.710
 trauma center new blood game 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.520
 excellent where you control a 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.139
 surgeon via stressing a lot 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.580
 action a lot of action it's not 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.039
 war games trauma center when j 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.080
 think very beautiful story 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.810
 this game is a sad so this one is 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.720
 at the base and a handsome guy away from 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.610
 first name out on ds 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.530
 this is an idea that for the wii and hop 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.979
 I wash discreetly my table I even 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.720
 some world records 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:10.199
 I posted on youtube in motion 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.560
 your record where she see and excellent 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.169
 extra I conjure that we all and hop I 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.060
 sums up at the table but stops doing this 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.560
 gesture 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:24.479
 I finished and looking in detail 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.639
 the catastrophic result of this 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.070
 video I think it would be time to 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.169
 redo a video my collection yes but 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.490
 that's like always it's necessary that 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.669
 I have time and above all must I 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.669
 thought
