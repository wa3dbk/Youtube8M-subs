sports just hold on pitch
we're<00:00:19.900> almost<00:00:20.080> out<00:00:20.670> showing<00:00:21.670> out<00:00:21.910> huh

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:47.869

seriously<00:00:48.879> who<00:00:49.269> just<00:00:49.570> decides<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.409> build<00:00:50.500> a

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
seriously who just decides to build a

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.520 
seriously who just decides to build a
giant<00:00:50.949> themed<00:00:51.370> room<00:00:51.670> deathtrap<00:00:52.449> actually<00:00:53.289> I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
giant themed room deathtrap actually I

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.430 
giant themed room deathtrap actually I
think<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.460> may<00:00:54.609> know<00:00:54.789> those<00:00:55.600> circuit<00:00:56.050> patterns

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
think I may know those circuit patterns

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.529 
think I may know those circuit patterns
in<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.649> first<00:00:56.859> chamber<00:00:57.129> I<00:00:57.489> told<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.269> I<00:00:58.300> knew

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
in the first chamber I told you I knew

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.380 
in the first chamber I told you I knew
them<00:00:58.719> that<00:00:59.170> style<00:00:59.649> is<00:00:59.920> unique<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.429> Balto<00:01:00.879> your

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
them that style is unique to Balto your

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.660 
them that style is unique to Balto your
whole<00:01:01.570> planet<00:01:01.869> you<00:01:02.530> think<00:01:02.829> your<00:01:03.010> people<00:01:03.460> built

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
whole planet you think your people built

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.109 
whole planet you think your people built
this<00:01:03.820> path<00:01:04.149> of<00:01:04.330> lions<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.989> know<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.920> mean<00:01:06.549> yes<00:01:06.820> but

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
this path of lions I know I mean yes but

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.870 
this path of lions I know I mean yes but
not<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:07.780> them<00:01:08.049> we<00:01:08.649> know<00:01:08.799> my<00:01:09.009> planet<00:01:09.460> provided

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
not just them we know my planet provided

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.700 
not just them we know my planet provided
the<00:01:09.970> technology<00:01:10.600> for<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.869> original<00:01:11.320> Voltron

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
the technology for the original Voltron

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.499 
the technology for the original Voltron
and<00:01:12.070> we<00:01:12.340> know<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.580> raw<00:01:12.729> metal<00:01:12.970> is<00:01:13.210> mined<00:01:13.420> from

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
and we know the raw metal is mined from

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.749 
and we know the raw metal is mined from
here<00:01:13.750> on<00:01:13.840> Ariel<00:01:14.259> hence<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.039> chamber<00:01:15.460> with<00:01:15.610> the

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
here on Ariel hence the chamber with the

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.120 
here on Ariel hence the chamber with the
nasty<00:01:16.270> blacksmith<00:01:16.750> theme<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.289> hunk<00:01:17.740> I'm<00:01:17.920> sure

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
nasty blacksmith theme a hunk I'm sure

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.219 
nasty blacksmith theme a hunk I'm sure
will<00:01:18.369> recognize<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.119> unusual<00:01:19.659> energy<00:01:19.869> those

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
will recognize the unusual energy those

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.899 
will recognize the unusual energy those
towers<00:01:20.679> were<00:01:20.830> firing<00:01:21.100> at<00:01:21.340> us<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.729> last

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
towers were firing at us in the last

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.270 
towers were firing at us in the last
chamber<00:01:22.500> he's<00:01:23.500> right

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
chamber he's right

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.609 
chamber he's right
that's<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:25.000> same<00:01:25.270> stuff<00:01:25.630> powering<00:01:26.110> Voltron

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
that's the same stuff powering Voltron

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.880 
that's the same stuff powering Voltron
that<00:01:27.490> comes<00:01:27.759> from<00:01:27.940> Ariel<00:01:28.330> -<00:01:28.569> I<00:01:28.899> don't<00:01:29.380> think<00:01:29.619> so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
that comes from Ariel - I don't think so

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.699 
that comes from Ariel - I don't think so
it<00:01:30.549> seems<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.149> me<00:01:31.299> that<00:01:31.330> these<00:01:31.750> trials<00:01:32.380> and

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:32.709 
it seems to me that these trials and

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:39.830 
it seems to me that these trials and
Voltron<00:01:33.280> itself<00:01:33.759> were<00:01:34.360> designed<00:01:34.899> by

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.660 

how<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:41.170> this<00:01:41.350> fair<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:42.009> thought<00:01:42.400> we<00:01:42.549> already

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
how is this fair I thought we already

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.480 
how is this fair I thought we already
had<00:01:42.820> a<00:01:43.060> tech<00:01:43.420> trial<00:01:43.750> enough<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.650> this<00:01:44.830> blast

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
had a tech trial enough of this blast

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.440 
had a tech trial enough of this blast
the<00:01:45.700> bots<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.180> let's<00:01:46.330> move<00:01:46.509> on<00:01:47.940> our<00:01:48.940> Volk<00:01:49.210> cons

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
the bots and let's move on our Volk cons

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.020 
the bots and let's move on our Volk cons
are<00:01:49.600> dead

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.300 

hey<00:01:55.030> come<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.450> let's<00:01:55.990> go<00:01:56.229> with<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.500> boom-boom
