to<00:02:03.180> take<00:02:03.330> out<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.270> good<00:02:09.540> time<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.050> use

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
to take out this is a good time to use

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.790 
to take out this is a good time to use
that<00:02:10.590> high-speed<00:02:11.070> technique<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:13.650> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that high-speed technique because that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.510 
that high-speed technique because that
boat<00:02:13.980> has<00:02:14.580> me<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> past<00:02:16.520> she

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
boat has me up in the past she

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.340 
boat has me up in the past she
goes<00:02:17.700> slope<00:02:18.060> as<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:18.420> boat<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.870> will<00:02:19.200> you

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
goes slope as this boat it will you

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.900 
goes slope as this boat it will you
up

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.500 

you<00:02:23.300> need<00:02:23.780> heat<00:02:24.020> helps<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.470> learn<00:02:24.680> matter<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
you need heat helps to learn matter the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.130 
you need heat helps to learn matter the
ding<00:02:27.470> ding<00:02:27.770> didn't<00:02:28.660> alright<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.750> actually

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
ding ding didn't alright this actually

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:40.330 
ding ding didn't alright this actually
is<00:02:30.230> water<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:33.170> kind<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.410> cool<00:02:39.340> one

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
is water so it's kind of cool one

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.340 
is water so it's kind of cool one
interesting<00:02:40.580> thing<00:02:40.820> about<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.720> they

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
interesting thing about this is they

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.990 
interesting thing about this is they
tried<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.620> add<00:02:42.740> just<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.460> little<00:02:43.490> bit<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.820> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
tried to add just a little bit of a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.910 
tried to add just a little bit of a
texture<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.630> shine<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.110> water<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.560> had<00:02:45.830> in

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
texture and shine to the water I had in

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.540 
texture and shine to the water I had in
those<00:02:45.980> white<00:02:46.220> spots<00:02:50.590> well<00:02:51.590> unfortunately<00:02:51.740> I

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
those white spots well unfortunately I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.680 
those white spots well unfortunately I
don't<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:53.030> worked<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:53.300> well<00:02:53.420> as<00:02:53.480> they

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
don't think it worked as well as they

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.320 
don't think it worked as well as they
had<00:02:54.500> planned<00:02:54.550> because<00:02:55.550> there's<00:02:55.700> no<00:02:55.910> texture

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
had planned because there's no texture

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.810 
had planned because there's no texture
in<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:56.540> water<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.070> wouldn't<00:02:58.550> know<00:02:58.670> if

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
in this water and and I wouldn't know if

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.920 
in this water and and I wouldn't know if
I<00:02:58.940> was<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.300> two<00:02:59.450> feet<00:02:59.600> from<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.900> ground

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
I was like two feet from the ground

I was like two feet from the ground
right<00:03:00.260> yeah<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.440> just<00:03:00.560> wouldn't<00:03:00.920> know<00:03:01.100> can't

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.640 
right yeah I just wouldn't know can't
see<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:01.970> visually<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.870> really<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.380> fly

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
see it visually you really have to fly

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.770 
see it visually you really have to fly
my<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.920> instruments<00:03:04.550> they<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.330> force<00:03:05.660> you

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
my the instruments they really force you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.100 
my the instruments they really force you
to<00:03:05.900> fly<00:03:06.200> by<00:03:06.470> what<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.400> little<00:03:08.110> instrumentation

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
to fly by what is little instrumentation
