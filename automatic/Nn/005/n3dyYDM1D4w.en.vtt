that's<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.180> compression<00:00:39.750> release<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:41.550> I'll

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that's the compression release and I'll

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.310 
that's the compression release and I'll
show<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.090> how<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> start<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> minute

but<00:00:43.469> I'll<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> quick<00:00:43.980> walk<00:00:44.219> around<00:00:44.250> real

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
but I'll do a quick walk around real

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.580 
but I'll do a quick walk around real
quick<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.750> I'll<00:00:46.020> start<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.530> both<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
quick and I'll start it with both the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.510 
quick and I'll start it with both the
battery<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.579> pull<00:00:51.449> started<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.860> I'll<00:00:53.010> I'll

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
pull start it first great shape we just

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.729 
pull start it first great shape we just
don't<00:00:59.219> need<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> generator<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.090> large<00:01:00.359> and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
really well in cold weather we've

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.900 
really well in cold weather we've
started<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.560> down<00:02:02.740> around<00:02:03.009> 10<00:02:03.220> degrees<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.850> I

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
started it down around 10 degrees and I

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.400 
started it down around 10 degrees and I
pull<00:02:04.119> started<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:04.869> see<00:02:05.020> how<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.320> would

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
pull started it just to see how it would

work<00:02:05.440> can't<00:02:05.800> work<00:02:05.950> fine<00:02:07.050> but<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.200> start<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.530> you

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
work can't work fine but to start it you

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.720 
work can't work fine but to start it you
just<00:02:08.800> flip<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.190> lever<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:10.390> run<00:02:11.430> turn<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.550> key

on and then I'll show you the rest while
my<00:02:17.350> wife<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.590> filming

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.660 

I'm<00:02:27.270> full<00:02:27.540> starting<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.050> with<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.290> cool

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
I'm full starting it with a cool

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.690 
I'm full starting it with a cool
afflictive<00:02:29.670> fuel<00:02:29.880> ever<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.360> run<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.860> then

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
afflictive fuel ever to run and then

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.630 
afflictive fuel ever to run and then
turn<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.120> key<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.720> position<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.640> then

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
the full started you pull the rope until

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.020 
the full started you pull the rope until
you<00:02:38.070> hit<00:02:38.220> compression<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:41.100> push<00:02:41.280> down<00:02:41.520> on<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
you hit compression and push down on the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:03:14.240 
you hit compression and push down on the
compression<00:02:42.720> release

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.619 

it's<00:03:15.250> got<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.489> lot<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:15.849> compression<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.599> can

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
it's got a lot of compression you can

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.050 
it's got a lot of compression you can
see<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.230> with<00:03:17.409> bouncing<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:18.489> hard<00:03:18.730> when<00:03:18.909> it

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
see that with bouncing so hard when it

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.360 
see that with bouncing so hard when it
stops<00:03:21.599> now<00:03:22.599> for<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.930> electric<00:03:23.349> starch<00:03:23.680> you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
stops now for the electric starch you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.649 
stops now for the electric starch you
can<00:03:24.489> see<00:03:24.640> when<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.819> turn<00:03:24.939> this<00:03:25.239> off<00:03:25.450> it

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
can see when I turn this off it

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.520 
can see when I turn this off it
automatically<00:03:26.200> keeps<00:03:26.439> the<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:28.329> run<00:03:28.569> lever

automatically keeps the the run lever
over<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.579> stop<00:03:30.819> it's<00:03:31.239> got<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.420> solenoid<00:03:31.989> on

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
over to the stop it's got a solenoid on

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.809 
over to the stop it's got a solenoid on
it<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.049> start<00:03:35.379> it<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.709> don't<00:03:36.310> have<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.700> use

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
it so to start it you don't have to use

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.759 
it so to start it you don't have to use
the<00:03:36.939> compression<00:03:37.450> release<00:03:37.750> if<00:03:38.049> it's<00:03:38.319> a<00:03:38.409> warmer

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
the compression release if it's a warmer

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.869 
the compression release if it's a warmer
day<00:03:38.799> if<00:03:39.730> it's<00:03:39.909> really<00:03:40.359> cold<00:03:40.569> you'll<00:03:41.439> want<00:03:41.650> to

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
day if it's really cold you'll want to

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.349 
day if it's really cold you'll want to
pull<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.980> rope<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.459> get<00:03:45.639> it<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.940> compression

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
pull the rope to get it to compression

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.750 
pull the rope to get it to compression
push<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.440> down<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.739> then<00:03:48.010> use<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.430> starter

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
push that down and then use the starter

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.009 
push that down and then use the starter
but<00:03:50.790> today<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.000> shouldn't<00:03:52.359> start<00:03:52.599> just<00:03:52.810> fine

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
but today it shouldn't start just fine

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.490 
but today it shouldn't start just fine
without<00:03:54.959> pulling<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.049> thing<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.349> if<00:03:56.409> you

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
without pulling the thing and if you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.319 
without pulling the thing and if you
want<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.769> use<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.280> intake<00:03:57.700> air<00:03:57.849> heater<00:03:58.120> you

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
want to use the intake air heater you

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.839 
want to use the intake air heater you
can<00:03:58.510> push<00:03:58.750> this<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.170> hold<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.500> in<00:03:59.620> for<00:03:59.920> 10<00:04:00.700> or

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
can push this and hold it in for 10 or

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:51.680 
can push this and hold it in for 10 or
20<00:04:01.060> seconds

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.880 

so<00:04:52.350> since<00:04:52.800> we're<00:04:52.980> in<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.990> campground<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.230> don't

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
so since we're in a campground I don't

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.350 
so since we're in a campground I don't
really<00:04:56.100> want<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.400> run<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.700> any<00:04:56.850> longer<00:04:57.060> than

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
really want to run it any longer than

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.210 
really want to run it any longer than
that<00:04:57.390> due<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.350> noise<00:04:58.500> but<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.800> can<00:04:59.040> hear

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
that due to the noise but you can hear

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.400 
that due to the noise but you can hear
how<00:04:59.340> loud<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.730> is<00:05:00.800> this<00:05:01.800> would<00:05:02.010> be<00:05:02.130> great<00:05:02.280> for<00:05:02.400> a

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
how loud it is this would be great for a

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.530 
how loud it is this would be great for a
home<00:05:04.410> backup<00:05:05.010> generator<00:05:05.460> due<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.360> higher

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
home backup generator due to the higher

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.370 
home backup generator due to the higher
power<00:05:06.870> could<00:05:07.560> be<00:05:07.620> good<00:05:07.920> for<00:05:08.390> a<00:05:09.390> construction

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
power could be good for a construction

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.990 
power could be good for a construction
site<00:05:10.710> or<00:05:10.740> whatever<00:05:11.010> just<00:05:11.370> because<00:05:11.610> the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
site or whatever just because the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.610 
site or whatever just because the
longevity<00:05:12.210> of<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.690> engines<00:05:13.110> with<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:13.440> being

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
longevity of the engines with it being

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.260 
longevity of the engines with it being
the<00:05:13.710> diesel<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.070> everything<00:05:14.370> just<00:05:14.610> 42<00:05:15.060> hours

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
the diesel and everything just 42 hours

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.870 
the diesel and everything just 42 hours
on<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:15.690> right<00:05:15.840> now
