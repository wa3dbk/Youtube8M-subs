repetitions<00:05:23.979> it<00:05:24.490> is<00:05:24.789> important<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.389> combine

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719

in<00:05:26.680> this<00:05:27.159> way<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.759> develop<00:05:27.909> different<00:05:28.599> kind

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
in this way you develop different kind

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.129 
in this way you develop different kind

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
of coordination and pathways so the

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.890 
of coordination and pathways so the
