can<00:00:04.240> you<00:00:04.390> show<00:00:04.600> the<00:00:05.370> equipment's<00:00:06.370> on<00:00:06.490> your

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
can you show the equipment's on your

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.750 
can you show the equipment's on your
project<00:00:07.530> materials<00:00:08.530> that<00:00:08.740> you<00:00:08.950> use<00:00:09.160> this<00:00:09.610> is

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
project materials that you use this is

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.190 
project materials that you use this is
the<00:00:09.970> 9-volt<00:00:10.510> battery

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
the 9-volt battery

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.159 
the 9-volt battery
yes<00:00:11.530> and<00:00:11.889> then<00:00:12.339> this<00:00:12.849> is<00:00:13.059> the<00:00:13.240> radio<00:00:13.599> which<00:00:13.959> has

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:14.169 
yes and then this is the radio which has

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.070 
yes and then this is the radio which has
the<00:00:14.320> antenna<00:00:14.860> okay<00:00:15.549> okay<00:00:15.940> and<00:00:16.120> then<00:00:16.630> these<00:00:17.020> are

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
the antenna okay okay and then these are

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.230 
the antenna okay okay and then these are
the<00:00:17.260> two<00:00:17.380> paper<00:00:17.770> clips<00:00:18.039> I'm<00:00:18.400> using<00:00:18.789> this<00:00:19.030> two

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
the two paper clips I'm using this two

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.730 
the two paper clips I'm using this two
paper<00:00:19.480> clips<00:00:19.689> in<00:00:19.869> order<00:00:20.170> to<00:00:20.320> connect<00:00:20.619> this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
paper clips in order to connect this

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.160 
paper clips in order to connect this
alligator<00:00:21.609> clips<00:00:22.330> and<00:00:22.720> this<00:00:23.500> is<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.800> LED<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
alligator clips and this is the LED and

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.740 
alligator clips and this is the LED and
we<00:00:27.160> need<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.429> solar<00:00:27.670> cell<00:00:28.060> in<00:00:28.330> order<00:00:28.599> to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
we need the solar cell in order to

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.090 
we need the solar cell in order to
transfer<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:31.619> line<00:00:32.619> further<00:00:32.950> energy<00:00:33.460> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
transfer the line further energy and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.410 
transfer the line further energy and
with<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.250> while<00:00:36.460> connecting<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.240> the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
with this while connecting to the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.560 
with this while connecting to the
amplified<00:00:38.050> speaker<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:39.730> can<00:00:39.880> send<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.240> audio

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
amplified speaker we can send the audio

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.260 
amplified speaker we can send the audio
signal<00:00:40.990> from<00:00:41.170> this<00:00:41.410> life<00:00:41.830> to<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.580> solar<00:00:43.000> cell

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
signal from this life to the solar cell

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.800 
signal from this life to the solar cell
and<00:00:43.420> then<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:43.840> can<00:00:43.990> hear<00:00:44.320> what<00:00:44.920> unit<00:00:45.250> let's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
and then we can hear what unit let's

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:54.760 
and then we can hear what unit let's
turn<00:00:46.810> it<00:00:46.960> on<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:48.250> we

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.670 

when<00:00:55.340> we<00:00:55.460> connect<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.420> negative<00:00:56.750> charge<00:00:57.320> to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
when we connect the negative charge to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.639 
when we connect the negative charge to
the<00:00:58.250> badge<00:00:58.790> way<00:00:59.059> we<00:00:59.480> can<00:00:59.719> see<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:01.579> like<00:01:01.760> a

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
the badge way we can see the like a

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.910 
the badge way we can see the like a
dilemma<00:01:03.649> lights<00:01:04.070> up<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.879> when<00:01:05.089> we<00:01:05.119> turn<00:01:05.420> on

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
dilemma lights up and when we turn on

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.290 
dilemma lights up and when we turn on
the<00:01:06.920> radio<00:01:07.280> we<00:01:07.520> cannot<00:01:07.790> hear<00:01:08.030> anything

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
the radio we cannot hear anything

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.760 
the radio we cannot hear anything
because<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:08.960> haven't<00:01:09.110> turned<00:01:09.380> on<00:01:09.619> this

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
because we haven't turned on this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.580 
because we haven't turned on this
picture<00:01:11.920> Wow<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:14.570> when<00:01:14.810> we<00:01:14.930> turn<00:01:15.080> or<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:15.409> can

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
picture Wow so when we turn or we can

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.370 
picture Wow so when we turn or we can
listen<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.450> okay<00:01:17.450> if<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.899> turn<00:01:18.080> off<00:01:18.110> to

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
listen to it okay if you turn off to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.880 
listen to it okay if you turn off to
review<00:01:18.680> what<00:01:18.830> happens<00:01:19.190> no<00:01:19.909> doubt<00:01:20.680> just<00:01:21.680> like

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
review what happens no doubt just like

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.520 
review what happens no doubt just like
turn<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:24.369> if<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.700> block<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.690> light<00:01:27.020> what

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
turn it on if you block the light what

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.499 
turn it on if you block the light what
happens<00:01:27.920> if<00:01:28.220> we<00:01:28.460> block<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.880> light<00:01:29.060> there<00:01:29.390> will

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
happens if we block the light there will

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.419 
happens if we block the light there will
be<00:01:29.570> no<00:01:30.130> audio<00:01:31.130> signal<00:01:31.520> humming<00:01:31.759> phone<00:01:32.119> is<00:01:33.429> this

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
be no audio signal humming phone is this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.820 
be no audio signal humming phone is this
plan<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.300> solar<00:01:35.509> cell<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.110> there<00:01:36.679> will<00:01:36.800> be

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
plan to the solar cell so there will be

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.760 
plan to the solar cell so there will be
no<00:01:37.070> sound<00:01:37.340> yes<00:01:38.890> clapping<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:41.470> yes

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
no sound yes clapping it yes

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.130 
no sound yes clapping it yes
so<00:01:43.670> here

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
so here

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.080 
so here
some<00:01:45.770> signals<00:01:46.430> are<00:01:47.120> transferred<00:01:47.720> by<00:01:48.170> by<00:01:49.090> logic

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
some signals are transferred by by logic

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.890 
some signals are transferred by by logic
yes

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
yes

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.930 
yes
as<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.440> know<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.770> sound<00:01:52.310> signal<00:01:52.610> have<00:01:52.790> been

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
as you know that sound signal have been

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.180 
as you know that sound signal have been
transferred<00:01:53.480> in<00:01:53.750> manifolds<00:01:54.470> for<00:01:54.620> them<00:01:54.920> like

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
transferred in manifolds for them like

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:19.660 
transferred in manifolds for them like
in<00:01:55.940> bio<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:58.490> life

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.730 

you
