00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.660 
one cream the only negative thing I
really<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.770> say<00:01:43.920> about<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
really have to say about it is that it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
really have to say about it is that it
doesn't<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.210> SPF<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.079> you're<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
doesn't have SPF so if you're going to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.410 
doesn't have SPF so if you're going to
be<00:01:46.710> spending<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:47.040> outside<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.119> would

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
be spending time outside then I would

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480 
be spending time outside then I would
put<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:48.930> SPF<00:01:49.290> moisturizer<00:01:49.500> underneath<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
put on an SPF moisturizer underneath it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
put on an SPF moisturizer underneath it
otherwise<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.810> amazing<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> really
