00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.005
Today

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:10.619
is a day for truth.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.160
The world needs to know
what happened,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.460
and to know what he stands for.

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:22.439
That kind of power is dangerous.

00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.465
Let the record show that this committee
holds him responsible.

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:55.722
That's how it starts.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.225
The fever,

00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:01.353
the rage

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:03.853
that turns good men

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:07.980
cruel.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.157
This bat vigilante
is like a one-man reign of terror.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:17.786
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:21.081
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.289
This means something.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.211
It's all some people have.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.461
It's all that gives them hope.

00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:31.508
People hate

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.719
what they don't understand.
Be their hero, Clark.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.888
Be their angel, be their monument,

00:01:38.222 --> 00:01:40.322
be anything they need you to be.

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:42.519
Or be none of it.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.605
You don't owe this world a thing.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.448
You never did.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.370
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.823
Devils don't come
from hell beneath us.

00:01:57.292 --> 00:01:58.942
They come from the sky.

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.686
Twenty years in Gotham,
how many good guys are left?

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:05.225
How many stayed that way?

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:09.087
He has the power
to wipe out the entire human race.

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:22.939
And we have to destroy him.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.951
You're gonna go to war?

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.540
He is not our enemy!

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:53.131
Black and blue,

00:02:54.214 --> 00:02:55.383
god versus man,

00:02:57.885 --> 00:02:59.554
day versus night!

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:06.563
The red capes are coming.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.013
The red capes are coming.
