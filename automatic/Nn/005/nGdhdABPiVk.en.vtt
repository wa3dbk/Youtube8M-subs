come<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:31.189> building<00:00:32.189> ourselves<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.840> swipe<00:00:34.040> on

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
come on building ourselves a swipe on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:01:40.780 
come on building ourselves a swipe on
the<00:00:35.070> front<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.340> my

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.830 

one<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.910> problems<00:01:42.240> we've<00:01:42.390> had<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
one of the problems we've had is that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.950 
one of the problems we've had is that
the<00:01:43.110> guarding<00:01:43.650> stops<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.880> chains<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.780> into

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the guarding stops the chains get into

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.320 
the guarding stops the chains get into
the<00:01:46.050> gorse<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.550> end<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.880> skidding

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
the gorse and then you end up skidding

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.520 
the gorse and then you end up skidding
the<00:01:48.450> tractor<00:01:48.810> trying<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.050> push<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> balls

the tractor trying to push the balls
over<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> cut<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> front<00:01:50.700> guard<00:01:50.970> off<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
over here I cut the front guard off so

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.020 
over here I cut the front guard off so
the<00:01:51.420> chain<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.160> truth<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> front

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the chain and the truth out the front

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.719 
the chain and the truth out the front
and<00:01:54.210> gets<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.290> course<00:01:55.530> before<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.580> main

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and gets the course before the main

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.250 
and gets the course before the main
machine<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.930> testing<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.160> modified<00:02:02.700> swipe

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
machine is testing the modified swipe

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.230 
machine is testing the modified swipe
which<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.830> fixed<00:02:05.280> up

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:28.440
