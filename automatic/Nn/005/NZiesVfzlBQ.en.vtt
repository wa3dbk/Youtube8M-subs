CHEESE CUPCAKES

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.210
Cupcakes does not always have to be sweet.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.659
There are plenty of savory cupcakes with a different fillings.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.810
It is prepared quickly and easily.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.509
Today I will make cheese cupcakes.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.149
To do this we need: 2 cups of wheat flour, 255 grams of cheese,

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.999
1.5 cups of sour cream, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.630
4 eggs and 1/2 tsp ground paprika.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.020
Combine the ingredients as follows: dry - into a first container, liquid - into another.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.020
First sift the flour through a sieve together with the baking powder.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.970
I have not big sieve, so I'll sift by piecemeal.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.940
Add the baking powder.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.770
The flour becomes more lush.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.310
Add 1/2 tsp of salt and ground paprika.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.460
Now we combine the liquid ingredients.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.340
Divide the eggs.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.340
4 eggs.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.820
Whisk.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.220
Add the sour cream and stir.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.850
Done. Remained only the one ingredient - cheese.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.850
Rub the cheese on a coarse grater.

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:20.269
Add the grated cheese to the flour.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:27.739
Mix the cheese with the flour.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.899
The cheese fully roll in flour.

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:44.779
Add the mixture of eggs and sour cream.

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.209
Thoroughly mix until smooth.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:02.379
The result is a viscous sticky dough.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.979
It's already prepared.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.239
We can place the dough in a molds for baking.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.279
I will use a metal molds for cupcakes.

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.609
Inside put a baking paper.

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.619
You can use a silicone molds.

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.049
Put the dough in molds.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.499
Note that the dough rises well.

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.729
So fill the molds for 2/3.

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:43.729
Put the cupcakes to bake in a preheated 180 C oven.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.829
It took 35 minutes - you can check the cupcakes.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.339
To do this, use a wooden stick.

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.219
I pierce the cupcake.

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.109
If the dough does not remain on the stick, the cupcakes are ready.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.499
To make the cupcakes became more toasty, you can hold it for another 5 minutes on the heat.

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.879
But I am heating off the heat and leave the cupcakes in an open oven for 10 minutes.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.789
The cheese cupcakes - great for breakfast.

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.319
You can take it with you to the work or give it to your children to school.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.670
The cupcakes are pretty nourishing and at the same time not heavy.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.010
Cook with fun and bon appetit!

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.300
