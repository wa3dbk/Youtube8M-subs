achievement of buried what people did in
the<00:01:03.989> starting<00:01:04.320> room<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> moon<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.949> training

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the starting room the moon is training

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.370 
the starting room the moon is training
the<00:01:05.519> endless<00:01:06.119> waves<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.570> zombies<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.170> getting

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the endless waves of zombies and getting

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
the endless waves of zombies and getting
enough<00:01:07.590> points<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:07.950> juggernog<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.700> then

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
enough points for juggernog and then

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820 
enough points for juggernog and then
they<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.750> 5,000<00:01:10.350> points<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.710> they

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
they would get 5,000 points so they

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
they would get 5,000 points so they
could<00:01:11.010> pack<00:01:11.189> upon<00:01:11.460> c<00:01:11.640> m1911<00:01:12.479> getting<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
could pack upon c m1911 getting the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.080 
could pack upon c m1911 getting the
Mustang<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.200> Sally<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.580> means<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.880> no

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
Mustang and Sally so this means that no

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.149 
Mustang and Sally so this means that no
man's<00:01:15.299> leg<00:01:15.509> can<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.750> returning<00:01:16.380> possibly<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
man's leg can be returning possibly and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
man's leg can be returning possibly and
buried<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.520> most<00:01:18.240> likely<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> pack<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> punch

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

possibly speed Cola would be in the

first room also another thing about the
achievement<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.770> called<00:01:25.950> awaking

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
achievement is that it's called awaking

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.490 
achievement is that it's called awaking
gazebo<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> pretty<00:01:27.720> strange<00:01:28.020> name<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
gazebo which is a pretty strange name I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
gazebo which is a pretty strange name I
mean<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.610> gazebo<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
mean if you don't know what gazebo is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
mean if you don't know what gazebo is
it's<00:01:30.600> basically<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.020> roof<00:01:31.290> shelter<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.860> all

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it's basically a roof shelter with all

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.980 
it's basically a roof shelter with all
sides<00:01:32.340> open<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.939> they're<00:01:33.360> usually<00:01:33.509> found<00:01:33.780> in

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sides open and they're usually found in

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
sides open and they're usually found in
the<00:01:34.049> middle<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.560> public<00:01:34.740> park<00:01:35.159> providing

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the middle of a public park providing

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
the middle of a public park providing
shade<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> rest<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> anybody<00:01:37.079> who<00:01:37.229> wants<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
shade and rest to anybody who wants it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
shade and rest to anybody who wants it
then<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.670> confuses<00:01:38.909> me<00:01:39.329> though<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.990> if

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
then it really confuses me though but if

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.870 
then it really confuses me though but if
you<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.920> may<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> name<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
you think about it it may be the name of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.760 
you think about it it may be the name of
the<00:01:41.970> hillbilly<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.630> jail<00:01:42.930> cell<00:01:43.259> which<00:01:43.590> can

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the hillbilly in the jail cell which can

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
the hillbilly in the jail cell which can
be<00:01:43.829> referred<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> as<00:01:44.579> gazebo<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:46.409> could<00:01:46.530> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
be referred to as gazebo or it could be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.649 
be referred to as gazebo or it could be
the<00:01:46.799> ghost<00:01:47.009> woman<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> map<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.420> could

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the ghost woman in the map which could

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
the ghost woman in the map which could
be<00:01:48.780> called<00:01:48.990> gazebo<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> hillbilly<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
be called gazebo but the hillbilly is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.670 
be called gazebo but the hillbilly is
most<00:01:51.119> likely<00:01:51.329> not<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:52.049> called<00:01:52.259> gazebo

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
most likely not going be called gazebo

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859 
most likely not going be called gazebo
because<00:01:53.070> my<00:01:53.220> sources<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.610> said<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> me<00:01:54.210> no

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
because my sources have said to me no

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
because my sources have said to me no
specific<00:01:55.350> name<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.740> title<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> be

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
specific name or title is going to be

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.359 
specific name or title is going to be
given<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.060> man<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.680> most<00:01:58.950> likely<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
given to this man so it's most likely to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.950 
given to this man so it's most likely to
be<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> ghost<00:01:59.759> lady<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> how<00:02:00.930> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
be the ghost lady and this is how you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.380 
be the ghost lady and this is how you
awaken<00:02:01.530> her<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:02.189> try<00:02:02.549> decide<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.149> give<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
awaken her or try decide to give the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
awaken her or try decide to give the
achievement<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.930> odd<00:02:04.079> name<00:02:04.350> which<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.979> really

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
achievement and odd name which I really

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.709 
achievement and odd name which I really
don't<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.579> likely<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> will<00:02:06.509> most

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
don't think it's likely so it will most

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.600 
don't think it's likely so it will most
likely<00:02:06.899> awakened<00:02:07.439> something<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:08.069> provide<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
likely awakened something or provide you

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.979 
likely awakened something or provide you
with<00:02:08.729> something<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.780> use
