00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this transmitter from Traxxas that I had

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.939 
this transmitter from Traxxas that I had
laying<00:00:56.850> around<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.469> decided<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> use<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.890> on

you will not be able to fit any bit
about<00:02:51.010> even<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.580> in<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.810> truck<00:02:53.100> because

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
about even this in that truck because

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.620 
about even this in that truck because
there's<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.390> no<00:02:55.510> more<00:02:55.660> space<00:02:57.480> that's<00:02:58.480> much

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
there's just no more space that's much

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:13.890 
there's just no more space that's much
larger<00:03:08.010> here<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.130> can<00:03:09.280> play<00:03:09.430> with<00:03:09.580> this<00:03:12.870> one<00:03:13.870> a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
larger here you can play with this one a

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.900 
larger here you can play with this one a
crack<00:03:14.519> hold<00:03:15.519> on<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.910> want<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.420> too<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
crack hold on you want to get it too I

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.210 
crack hold on you want to get it too I
should<00:03:22.900> probably<00:03:23.049> spin<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.650> tires<00:03:23.860> or

awesome<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:14.670> mean<00:04:15.670> they<00:04:16.209> probably<00:04:16.450> just<00:04:16.600> a

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810

little bit but not much way way way way
way<00:04:27.790> faster<00:04:28.390> than<00:04:28.630> stock<00:04:30.720> run<00:04:31.720> with<00:04:31.930> it

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
way faster than stock run with it
