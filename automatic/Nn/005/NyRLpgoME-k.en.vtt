00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 tec shop on the day courses for 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.390
 youtube ers 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.719
 this video is offered by pixar wall-e 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.490
 new era games links in description and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.259
 here is the day and today I came to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.820
 very cool video for you is another 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.250
 chat is the question is worth it 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.300
 update or migrate to windows 10 or 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 if you use windows 7 or windows 3.1 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.970
 it's worth it in my opinion is worth it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 it's very worth the windows 10 is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 very good very light 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.079
 is the system that gets better at 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.930
 my opinion that the then single set 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.940
 problem and how is a new system it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 has not been tested on all radios 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.489
 possible in the world as windows 7 and is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.170
 used for many years 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.149
 so what happened many 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 computers had a problem with the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.780
 windows 10 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 many people were left behind with a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.640
 prejudice because you had a problem but it is 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.230
 normal I would have one too 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.520
 prejudice I had trouble soon 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 face with 2 10 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 In my case I had no problem. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 I installed another perfectly all 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.130
 programs that used all the games without 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.229
 catch without anything so kind to me is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 perfect but as I said some people 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.250
 they had problems but I walked 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.869
 seeing the comments and everything else 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.299
 the vast majority have no problem 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.580
 most of them are usually 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.320
 but how did I talk to some people? 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.330
 had 5 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.759
 in my opinion windows 10 is very 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 good because it brings nice features I 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.390
 I already did a video talking about the seven 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 Windows 10 News 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 among them are the new start menu 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.240
 and that was ball show you can 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.390
 customize and remember you want 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.100
 You can increase with his mother and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 put whatever you want here 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.579
 in this part of the world I prefer the best 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.290
 so it gets more organized but there it is 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.960
 this is at the discretion of each 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.479
 one thing I really liked was the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.360
 Here's a question from the windows 10 store. 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.540
 the store works very well this here came 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.180
 It's just the right time everyone already 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.349
 It is used to the smartphone with the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.640
 tablet be it running the android and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.340
 windows phone does not matter 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.519
 they all have their own 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.540
 shop and everyone is already accustomed 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.099
 people today have lost that 10 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.319
 that habit of entering websites of 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.879
 download download something all 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.230
 You want which entered the store 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.569
 own operating system this 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.980
 makes life much easier you do not need 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.480
 running behind sites that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.220
 make downloads 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.110
 now neither of the 10 the same thing you 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.910
 enter here in the store and you 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.299
 what you want 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.340
 the game ceps programs all that you 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.970
 interest or legal that video of the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.430
 serginho here by tabs or by categories 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.140
 windows 8 had this too but it is very 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.540
 Bad because when you open the store it 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.970
 open full screen in tablet format is 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.829
 horrible did not work right you 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.140
 put the lucky number I will not 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.209
 Cell phones worked the business took 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.660
 two days will install here not everything 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.879
 it works, it's fast and it's practical 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.079
 and have applications at school is because 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.860
 Do you want to have it installed in your 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.769
 computer 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.760
 everything works very well 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:20.090
 organized very well and the great 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.250
 advantage of this store is that it has apps 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.630
 windows phone then games and 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.549
 applications that you are accustomed to 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.920
 use windows phone or even android 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.099
 because many apps are multi platform 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.170
 has apps released to android for 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.940
 impromptu phone so I s 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.190
 so it 's because you're accustomed to 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.940
 use on your smartphone or tablet 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.370
 can now also use on pc and epp 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.590
 is woman so adaptable I thought then 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.790
 This helps me in my opinion here. 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.040
 a play very well done a thing 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.450
 they really came to leave the windows 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.060
 very cool and has other news 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.090
 also like here if you 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.310
 search for what you want in the future will 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.720
 have the color also the search works a lot 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.120
 better than the search for windows 8 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.910
 windows 7 has here the notifications by 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.579
 while a museum does not work the way 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.090
 that we want exactly but already 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:17.209
 works somewhat is more or less 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.970
 here has facebook notifications short 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.140
 game notifications of things you 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.729
 use on your windows so this is good 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.900
 legal this stock exchange 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.960
 so my 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.130
 It was very good and certainly worth it. 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.900
 it's pretty much worth migrating to windows 10 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.370
 my opinion for you're 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.169
 wanting to migrate 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.169
 do the following takes windows 7 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.979
 windows 8 8 points and make a backup of 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.830
 all you have install programs 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.190
 installer programs 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.229
 image video files is all that 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.780
 you are backing up everything is not a 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.210
 external hd or pendrive and hence the analysis 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.210
 to windows 10 if there are problems to 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.680
 you need the first one gives problem 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.600
 in this research, see if I do not have 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.250
 problem this problem is you too 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.289
 solve problems sometimes it's thing 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.660
 simple and ready you continue tomorrow 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.400
 a very serious problem with 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.820
 work something that you used right 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.340
 very much there that you make you go in 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.770
 windows sorry for the start menu as well 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.380
 here settings and here is the 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.660
 security and recovery and 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.789
 week back here pro windows 7 o 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.910
 windows 8 is very easy 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.220
 and then you come back with the previous windows 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.150
 There's no excuse for using the 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.250
 windows 10 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.930
 if you install not only the right and you can 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.370
 coming back is very easy 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.840
 Good, so this is my opinion I think 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.190
 which is very good 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.080
 I really liked it, I 'm sure I'll use it. 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.789
 in all the people I've been using 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.340
 for now in one but started to 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.900
 to acquire a license for windows 7 as 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.639
 I think it's cheaper than you 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.530
 purchased a license for windows 10 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.810
 Then I remember windows 7 windows 8 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.050
 pro windows 10 again and also because 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.139
 It really was very good, it was very 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.919
 nice of you certainly worth having 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.690
 of the 10 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.659
 So this is what you have doubts about. 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.860
 windows 10 comment there a panel in the 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.000
 channel has the so-called 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.550
 tutorials about the ten already have a lot 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.530

 learn everything about windows 10 from 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:35.100
 installation until the configuration of this new 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.320

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.320
 windows 10 link in description
