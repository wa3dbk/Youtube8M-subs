watching the video in normal quality

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
watching the video in normal quality
it's<00:01:00.480> worth<00:01:00.750> noting<00:01:01.260> however<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.769> normal

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's worth noting however that normal

quality is usually really poor
here's<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> second<00:01:07.140> reason<00:01:07.320> why<00:01:07.620> you<00:01:07.980> may

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
here's the second reason why you may

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.510 
here's the second reason why you may
want<00:01:08.550> to<00:01:08.610> change<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.090> playback<00:01:09.630> settings

want to change the playback settings

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
want to change the playback settings
sometimes<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.180> even<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> HQ

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
sometimes you don't even get the HQ

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.190 
sometimes you don't even get the HQ
button<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.800> play<00:01:13.980> with<00:01:14.180> for<00:01:15.180> example<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
button to play with for example when you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
button to play with for example when you

option maybe you are like me and prefer
to<00:01:24.000> watch<00:01:24.180> videos<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.840> high<00:01:25.080> quality<00:01:25.380> always

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
to watch videos in high quality always

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.580 
to watch videos in high quality always
how<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.900> watching<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
how do you know you're watching and the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.310 
how do you know you're watching and the
best<00:01:28.800> quality<00:01:29.340> available

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
best quality available

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.770 
best quality available
the<00:01:31.950> third<00:01:32.190> reason<00:01:32.460> could<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.630> don't

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the third reason could be that you don't

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
the third reason could be that you don't
want<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.200> keep<00:01:34.410> toggling<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.040> HQ<00:01:35.610> switch

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
want to keep toggling the HQ switch

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
want to keep toggling the HQ switch
every<00:01:36.270> time<00:01:36.510> perhaps<00:01:37.500> YouTube<00:01:38.160> is<00:01:38.310> reading

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
every time perhaps YouTube is reading

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640 
every time perhaps YouTube is reading
your<00:01:38.760> connection<00:01:39.240> speed<00:01:39.270> wrong<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.530> want

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
your connection speed wrong and you want

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.300 
your connection speed wrong and you want
to<00:01:40.860> watch<00:01:41.070> an<00:01:41.250> HQ

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
to watch an HQ

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.860 
to watch an HQ
finally<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.700> fourth<00:01:44.970> reason<00:01:45.120> could<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.690> that

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
finally the fourth reason could be that

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.200 
finally the fourth reason could be that
sometimes<00:01:46.410> toggling<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> switch<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.970> cause

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
sometimes toggling the switch can cause

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.050 
sometimes toggling the switch can cause
playback<00:01:48.750> problems<00:01:49.340> especially<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:50.850> there

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
playback problems especially when there

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.930 
playback problems especially when there
is<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.480> of<00:01:51.510> traffic<00:01:51.870> on<00:01:52.200> YouTube<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> here

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
is a lot of traffic on YouTube so here

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.240 
is a lot of traffic on YouTube so here
is<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.330> method<00:01:54.480> to<00:01:54.810> always<00:01:55.380> watch<00:01:55.590> videos<00:01:56.070> in
