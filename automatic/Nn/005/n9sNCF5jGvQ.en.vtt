00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 View from the pebbly High Sierra was a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.870
 human anthill but in the mud 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.120
 it was all very organized 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.670
 each had its function and all 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.639

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.849
 big nugget or bamboo ra as they say in the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849
 garimpo 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.930
 is a village belonging to the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.810
 county of curionópolis to 800 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 miles from Bethlehem in Par and became 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.500
 in the 80's the largest garimpo to heaven 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500
 open world 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.489
 the story begins here 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.309
 this is the road that leads to the pebbled saw 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.650
 an old sign indicates the distance are 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.530
 35 km to the village of 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.199
 garimpeiros 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.600
 the trip up pebble was terrible 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.180
 in the time of the garimpo and did not improve much 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.960
 the dust and the holes are the enemies 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.510
 of the drivers 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 but on the way also to beautiful landscapes 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.330
 and the old airport runway around here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.110
 tonnes of gold were disposed of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.110
 little airplanes 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.450
 when we arrive in bare saw we find 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.240
 old houses 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.870
 almost all wood and mud streets 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.160
 red is still here the only pump 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.160
 place gasoline 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.189
 extremely poor Ávila of a 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.430
 the glorious time made of sweat dust and 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.189
 gold when men enriched the night 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.360
 for the day and as fast as they did 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.619
 fortune lost everything is not coming 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.149
 that adventure 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:04.149
 every time you raise many garimpeiros 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:08.050
 because they had applied everything here 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.599
 thinking that they were going to get more 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.150
 in fact few were alive or 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.299
 better not to bamburrar but everyone dreamed 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.090
 with that day one of them was white 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.849
 today is dedicated to preserving the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.330
 of peeled saw guard reports 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.880
 interviews and he makes images 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.900
 equipment and a vast archive of 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.090
 on dvd 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.849
 he is considered the keeper of memory 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.630
 it was a matter of saving this 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.880
 story of someone who has been here for the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.280
 put these reports together for 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.670
 form a file for our children 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.400
 to know how this story happened 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.239
 How is the story worked on? 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.359
 season of heavy work in pebble saw 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.359

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.120
 John lost everything and cries. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.890
 Indian lost everything and studies Maria feels 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.410
 I miss the good times. 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.140
 characters who lived the heyday of 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.080
 garimpo but did not show a good life of 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.200
 but at night we do not even like 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.150
 remember it was too good fernand leger 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.700
 honesty had been my bag of gold 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.350
 here enough of your network in the neighborhood will 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.180
 an open nobody mess 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.060
 no one stirred because surveillance was 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.060
 strictly the same way nobody fought 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.610
 in the garimpo the differences were solved 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.610
 in curionópolis almost always shakes 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.190
 a few minutes from the center we find the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.810

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.570
 a soccer stadium 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.850
 before it was a crater in which thousands of 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.850
 men who dug the gold demand 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.780
 a mountain of land carried in bags 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.730
 on the shoulders but in the human anthill 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.190
 that seemed chaotic was actually 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.980
 quite organized every garimpeiro 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.109
 had a specific function and all 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.780
 worked in a coordinated way 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.280
 a prospector called horse is silent 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.169

 I just want to carry on the back the house was 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.870
 divided into gullies that were small 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.390
 three meters long by two 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.870
 wide but a garimpeiro was common 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.570
 accumulate several ravines and put the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.430
 as many workers as possible. 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.430
 to increase the chances of finding or 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.870

 the right to exploit the soil in the region 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.700
 was from the valley of the sweet river that ceded the area 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.970
 for the garimpeiros 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.760
 the population grew without stopping in the village 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.880
 government mandated the federal

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.410
 when it was finally authorized in 1985 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.870
 the presence of women in the garimpo 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.430
