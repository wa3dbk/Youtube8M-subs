luck<00:02:04.680> again<00:02:05.159> Chamberlain<00:02:06.060> simply<00:02:06.540> failed<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
luck again Chamberlain simply failed the

luck again Chamberlain simply failed the
West<00:02:07.350> Brom<00:02:07.560> player<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.920> thought<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> foul

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
West Brom player I thought it was a foul

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
West Brom player I thought it was a foul
but<00:02:09.239> he<00:02:09.569> kept<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> play<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> thought

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
but he kept the play going and I thought

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.550 
but he kept the play going and I thought
okay<00:02:11.220> no<00:02:11.400> worries<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.970> then

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
okay no worries and then

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.260 
okay no worries and then
Chamberlain<00:02:13.099> was<00:02:13.220> clearly<00:02:13.730> fouled<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:14.239> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
Chamberlain was clearly fouled in the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.210 
Chamberlain was clearly fouled in the
box<00:02:14.360> whose<00:02:14.840> trip<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.380> time<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.770> was<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> real

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
box whose trip this time it was a real

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.460 
box whose trip this time it was a real
trick<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:17.630> tell<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.930> took<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.170> penalty

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
trick and I tell it took the penalty

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.770 
trick and I tell it took the penalty
again<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.830> he<00:02:18.890> scored<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:20.000> be<00:02:20.120> fair<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.660> I

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
again and he scored but to be fair I I

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.370 
again and he scored but to be fair I I
think<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.530> we<00:02:21.739> had<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:22.040> 1<00:02:22.340> by<00:02:22.550> 4<00:02:22.880> or<00:02:23.270> 5<00:02:23.569> goals<00:02:23.930> we

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
think if we had a 1 by 4 or 5 goals we

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.449 
think if we had a 1 by 4 or 5 goals we
wouldn't<00:02:24.560> even<00:02:24.620> be<00:02:24.770> talking<00:02:24.890> about<00:02:25.310> the

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
wouldn't even be talking about the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.680 
wouldn't even be talking about the
penalties<00:02:25.640> as<00:02:25.910> much<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.150> we<00:02:26.270> are<00:02:26.360> now<00:02:26.510> it's

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
penalties as much as we are now it's

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.660 
penalties as much as we are now it's
because<00:02:26.989> they<00:02:27.440> were<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.709> two<00:02:27.890> deciding<00:02:28.489> goals

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
because they were the two deciding goals

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.390 
because they were the two deciding goals
it<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:28.940> two<00:02:29.150> nil<00:02:29.390> wasn't<00:02:29.780> 45<00:02:30.080> now<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.250> was

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
it was two nil wasn't 45 now if it was

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.770 
it was two nil wasn't 45 now if it was
that<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.910> think<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.300> we<00:02:32.420> wouldn't<00:02:32.630> be

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
that then I think that we wouldn't be

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.979 
that then I think that we wouldn't be
tossing<00:02:33.170> over<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:33.709> much<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:34.069> we<00:02:34.190> are<00:02:34.310> now

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
tossing over as much as we are now

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.180 
tossing over as much as we are now
because<00:02:35.989> there<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.380> important<00:02:36.860> girls<00:02:37.040> they

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
because there are important girls they

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.160 
because there are important girls they
they<00:02:37.640> did<00:02:37.849> cost<00:02:38.030> was<00:02:38.269> from<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.569> game<00:02:38.750> in

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
they did cost was from the game in

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.839 
they did cost was from the game in
general<00:02:39.470> plan<00:02:39.860> thought<00:02:40.069> we<00:02:40.160> dominated<00:02:40.370> we

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
general plan thought we dominated we

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.460 
general plan thought we dominated we
created<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.390> many<00:02:41.540> chances<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.110> thought<00:02:42.319> your

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
created so many chances I thought your

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.809 
created so many chances I thought your
video<00:02:42.709> was<00:02:42.800> actually<00:02:42.980> really<00:02:43.400> good<00:02:43.640> today

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
video was actually really good today

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.270 
video was actually really good today
deserved<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.510> goal<00:02:44.720> he<00:02:45.350> had<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.530> future<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.069> here

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
deserved a goal he had a future in here

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.440 
deserved a goal he had a future in here
there<00:02:46.430> were<00:02:46.519> four<00:02:46.819> chances<00:02:47.209> they<00:02:47.330> were

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
there were four chances they were

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.630 
there were four chances they were
genuine<00:02:47.989> chances<00:02:48.590> usually<00:02:49.220> he's<00:02:49.340> got<00:02:49.459> half

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
genuine chances usually he's got half

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.830 
genuine chances usually he's got half
chances<00:02:50.060> here<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.299> then<00:02:50.480> but<00:02:50.660> he<00:02:50.690> actually

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
chances here and then but he actually

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.900 
chances here and then but he actually
created<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.530> few<00:02:51.709> chances<00:02:51.890> for<00:02:52.160> himself<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.670> I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
created a few chances for himself and I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.039 
created a few chances for himself and I
like<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.239> every<00:02:53.420> time<00:02:53.450> we've<00:02:53.720> got<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> ball

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
like that every time we've got the ball

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.720 
like that every time we've got the ball
on<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.260> left<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.950> didn't<00:02:55.160> corral<00:02:55.400> himself

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
on the left it didn't corral himself

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.850 
on the left it didn't corral himself
into<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> corner<00:02:56.360> flag<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.410> have<00:02:57.620> no

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
into the corner flag and you have no

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.710 
into the corner flag and you have no
space<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:58.459> out<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:59.060> actually<00:02:59.360> cut<00:02:59.569> in

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
space to get out of you actually cut in

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.870 
space to get out of you actually cut in
as<00:02:59.930> soon<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:00.290> he<00:03:00.410> could<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.830> just<00:03:00.890> opened<00:03:01.760> up

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
as soon as he could and just opened up

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.550 
as soon as he could and just opened up
the<00:03:01.970> plate<00:03:02.180> completely<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:03.170> were<00:03:03.260> players

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
the plate completely that were players

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.259 
the plate completely that were players
running<00:03:03.890> left<00:03:04.310> running<00:03:04.610> right<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.120> just

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
running left running right and you just

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.360 
running left running right and you just
had<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.660> many<00:03:05.780> angles<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.380> work<00:03:06.560> with<00:03:06.799> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
had so many angles to work with and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
had so many angles to work with and
that's<00:03:07.640> how<00:03:07.940> driven<00:03:08.239> your<00:03:08.480> likes<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.810> play<00:03:09.019> and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
that's how driven your likes to play and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.630 
that's how driven your likes to play and
I<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.799> way<00:03:09.890> he<00:03:10.010> played<00:03:10.220> today<00:03:10.400> and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
I like the way he played today and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.039 
I like the way he played today and
hopefully<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:11.030> can<00:03:11.150> keep<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.480> up<00:03:11.540> as<00:03:11.690> well<00:03:11.840> at

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
hopefully you can keep it up as well at

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.780 
hopefully you can keep it up as well at
the<00:03:12.200> back<00:03:12.380> were<00:03:12.680> pretty<00:03:12.950> stable<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.549> first

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the back were pretty stable the first

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.520 
the back were pretty stable the first
half<00:03:13.970> was<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.209> bit<00:03:14.420> shaky<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.110> second<00:03:15.440> half

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
half was a bit shaky but the second half

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.470 
half was a bit shaky but the second half
we<00:03:15.680> were<00:03:15.769> pretty<00:03:16.069> easy<00:03:16.280> going<00:03:16.579> putt<00:03:17.329> from

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
we were pretty easy going putt from

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.940 
we were pretty easy going putt from
towards<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.959> end<00:03:18.079> but<00:03:18.140> met<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.440> few<00:03:18.650> errors

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
towards the end but met a few errors

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.319 
towards the end but met a few errors
because<00:03:19.310> we<00:03:19.400> were<00:03:19.459> trying<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.670> pass<00:03:19.880> slowly

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
because we were trying to pass slowly

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.569 
because we were trying to pass slowly
and<00:03:20.600> just<00:03:20.750> buy<00:03:20.900> some<00:03:21.109> time<00:03:21.320> both<00:03:22.310> or<00:03:22.489> all

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
and just buy some time both or all

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.550 
and just buy some time both or all
around<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:22.940> was<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> great<00:03:23.359> performance

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560
