00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 joko guild wars 2 friends already today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.210
 again 12 video on a channel as if 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.690
 we have not had enough of it today 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.400
 had 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.349
 There was a small one today 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.109
 tuesday patch and with this patch 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.359
 have that but can take a look 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.680
 I got wings with this patch came 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.710
 already in the wardrobe before 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.359
 Visible new wing skins into the game 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.029
 so you can your back part 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 Indent object over the chin and if 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.250
 you are a blended you see these totally 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.660
 awesome big wings so if 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.370
 hindsight has been reluctant to say 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.930
 no we do not want to captain guilds 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.980
 because there are clipping errors then 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.840
 I do not know what he thought 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.230
 I would say guild capes 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.350
 I was alone from the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.110
 movement from the whole mechanic 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 You can also see how you see it 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 run wonderfully without it too and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.719
 Of course, looks natural is like 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.399
 always jewelry and gimmick as I said 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.500
 costs 500 games but is only today 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 Available only for 24 hours 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.180
 These wings are only available for 24 hours 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.220
 They will be back in the game from time to time 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.080
 be available and then stop too 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.490
 really only for a very short time 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 in the context of offered the cpp and who 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.590
 This wing wants to have the wings 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.229
 should now admonish gm too 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.659
 gold exchange rates are currently one 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.790
 disaster due to the wings 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.020
 Of course it is actually one 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.950
 a bit more worthwhile that's for 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.570
 to make real money 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 that is not so expensive then 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.900
 Do you have this skin for your wardrobe 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.250
 unlocked and can be used anytime 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.909
 your backs share with your chin if 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.860
 he wants that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.479
 and if that's too mainstream for you then 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.979
 but the back part fades so long 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.689
 until nobody runs around with it because of it 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.189
 it is mainstream and because the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.180
 People realize that the wings are him 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.350
 damn a lot of sight in the game block 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.490
 however, this will be the third on the 10th 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.009
 then change again on the 10th 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.680
 yes, the camera patch should be called it 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.540
 But with her then a collision 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.030
 system is overworked like ours 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.850
 camera therefrom in 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.590
 have held on when they are behind us 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.179
 placed and blocked by objects 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.179
 will still contain life still understand 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.840
 after one of the party right on 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.030
 to run 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.000
 but he did not last long 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.410
 now with the new camera feature 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.540
 we have the possibility both in the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.250
 ego-perspective to go as well over 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.900
 the shoulder perspective maybe too 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.430
 to fix the camera in a different way 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.880
 that he as special screenshots 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.920
 possible is the possibility in 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.560
 can attack beautiful own 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.210
 see the topic to do together with 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:51.210
 his g this in his friends the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:52.650
 are all aggressive here both and 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.940
 You see the wings are clattering 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.740
 with the partially still running 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.360
 a little bit around but it's just bling 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.740
 bling in this game what you play in the game 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.690
 shop can buy it for the most part 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.220
 bling bling or helping one's bank 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.770
 to expand a bit so you can do more 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.140
 it can carry around with and 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.700
 Who does not bling bling yes 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.860
 actually plays in the rarest 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.920
 case wars 2 because either you get up 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.890
 archive with bling bling or on skins 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.360
 that is the core and I wish 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.740
 Have fun with it now 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.740
 we will be back next time
