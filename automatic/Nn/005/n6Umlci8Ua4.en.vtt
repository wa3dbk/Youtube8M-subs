00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.899 
with Gus is that he is so he's just like
a<00:01:42.290> machine<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.920> mean<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.430> guys<00:01:43.579> got<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
a machine I mean the guys got the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.550 
a machine I mean the guys got the
strongest<00:01:44.270> right<00:01:44.479> arm<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.840> poker<00:01:45.049> right<00:01:45.320> so

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
strongest right arm and poker right so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.850 
strongest right arm and poker right so
if<00:01:45.950> all<00:01:46.189> of<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.310> sudden<00:01:46.610> he's<00:01:46.790> checking<00:01:47.860> that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
if all of a sudden he's checking that

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.219 
if all of a sudden he's checking that
makes<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.759> makes<00:01:49.820> everyone<00:01:50.420> suspicious<00:01:51.020> so

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
makes that makes everyone suspicious so

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.050 
makes that makes everyone suspicious so
it<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:51.619> need<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.890> have<00:01:52.040> a<00:01:52.070> style<00:01:52.430> for<00:01:52.549> traffic

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
it you need to have a style for traffic

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.490 
it you need to have a style for traffic
but<00:01:53.390> i<00:01:53.420> do<00:01:53.509> think<00:01:53.600> Gus's<00:01:54.079> style<00:01:54.320> works

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
but i do think Gus's style works

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.780 
but i do think Gus's style works
perfectly<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.100> trapping<00:01:55.460> because<00:01:55.610> they're

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
perfectly for trapping because they're

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.999 
perfectly for trapping because they're
they're<00:01:56.210> they're<00:01:56.240> built<00:01:56.719> in<00:01:56.899> Gus<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.710> betting

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
they're they're built in Gus is betting

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.530 
they're they're built in Gus is betting
at<00:01:58.100> all<00:01:58.219> these<00:01:58.340> hands<00:01:58.850> while<00:01:59.210> these<00:01:59.329> other

built-in trap he was trying to explain
and<00:02:52.760> he<00:02:52.820> couldn't<00:02:53.060> really<00:02:53.240> but<00:02:53.600> other<00:02:53.810> people

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and he couldn't really but other people

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.020 
and he couldn't really but other people
find<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:54.770> difficult<00:02:54.800> or<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.790> mean

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
find it so difficult or do I mean

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.090 
find it so difficult or do I mean
realistically<00:02:56.360> like<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.320> don't<00:02:57.380> really<00:02:57.590> trap

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
realistically like I don't really trap

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.550 
realistically like I don't really trap
but<00:02:58.340> he<00:02:58.400> does<00:02:58.790> trap<00:02:59.150> people<00:02:59.510> i<00:02:59.660> saw<00:03:00.110> i<00:03:00.260> saw<00:03:00.350> him

can I do is Gus you're trapped because

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.150 
can I do is Gus you're trapped because
of<00:03:14.690> his<00:03:14.780> style<00:03:15.050> so<00:03:15.440> there<00:03:15.590> are<00:03:15.620> two<00:03:15.770> kinds<00:03:16.070> of

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
of his style so there are two kinds of

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.710 
of his style so there are two kinds of
traps<00:03:16.370> there's<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.910> trap<00:03:17.150> where<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.450> flop<00:03:17.690> a

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
traps there's the trap where you flop a

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.280 
traps there's the trap where you flop a
huge<00:03:18.080> hand<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:19.190> think<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.460> yourself<00:03:19.550> well

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
huge hand and you think to yourself well

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.810 
huge hand and you think to yourself well
most<00:03:21.290> people<00:03:21.650> would<00:03:21.770> slow<00:03:21.980> play<00:03:22.220> but<00:03:22.430> if<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.610> can

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
most people would slow play but if I can

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.460 
most people would slow play but if I can
fast<00:03:23.090> play<00:03:23.300> this<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:23.660> if<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.870> raised<00:03:24.140> right<00:03:24.440> here

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
fast play this in if I raised right here

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.960 
fast play this in if I raised right here
on<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.800> flop<00:03:25.010> there's<00:03:25.310> no<00:03:25.430> way<00:03:25.550> they<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.760> put

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
on the flop there's no way they can put

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.520 
on the flop there's no way they can put
me<00:03:26.060> on<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.270> huge<00:03:26.480> hand<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.080> that's<00:03:27.200> you're

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
me on this huge hand and that's you're

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.840 
me on this huge hand and that's you're
trapping<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.160> way<00:03:28.310> you're<00:03:28.490> playing<00:03:28.730> it

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
trapping that way you're playing it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.430 
trapping that way you're playing it
exactly<00:03:29.180> like<00:03:29.300> a<00:03:29.450> big<00:03:29.690> hand<00:03:29.870> wouldn't<00:03:30.050> play<00:03:30.260> it

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
exactly like a big hand wouldn't play it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.320 
exactly like a big hand wouldn't play it
sometimes<00:03:31.280> though<00:03:31.490> you<00:03:31.550> really<00:03:31.850> do<00:03:32.060> flop<00:03:32.300> a

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
sometimes though you really do flop a

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.420 
sometimes though you really do flop a
big<00:03:32.630> hand<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.200> just<00:03:33.230> there's<00:03:34.220> just<00:03:34.340> no

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
other element of trapping also and

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.300 
other element of trapping also and
that's<00:03:50.390> using<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.020> history<00:03:51.530> using<00:03:52.280> what

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
using that play by using the the history

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.780 
using that play by using the the history
of<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.230> bedding<00:04:09.560> between<00:04:09.860> us<00:04:10.010> I'm<00:04:10.190> trapping

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.939 
kind and you made a little bet your
opponent<00:04:48.119> called<00:04:48.329> and<00:04:48.599> on<00:04:48.989> the<00:04:49.139> turn<00:04:49.379> you<00:04:49.799> have

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
opponent called and on the turn you have

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.709 
opponent called and on the turn you have
a<00:04:49.979> full<00:04:50.219> house<00:04:50.399> now<00:04:51.119> your<00:04:51.239> opponent<00:04:51.509> checks

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
a full house now your opponent checks

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.329 
a full house now your opponent checks
and<00:04:51.959> to<00:04:52.110> be<00:04:52.199> tricky<00:04:52.529> you<00:04:52.649> check<00:04:52.889> again<00:04:53.039> and

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:53.339 
and to be tricky you check again and

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:55.699 
and to be tricky you check again and
then<00:04:53.729> on<00:04:53.819> the<00:04:53.939> river<00:04:54.059> he<00:04:54.569> moves<00:04:54.839> all<00:04:55.049> in<00:04:55.289> like

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:55.709
