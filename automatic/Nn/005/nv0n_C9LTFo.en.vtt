anyway<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.980> trace<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.430> problem<00:00:32.550> down<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.510> what

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
anyway we trace the problem down to what

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.740 
anyway we trace the problem down to what
we<00:00:34.380> believe<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.870> door<00:00:36.870> handle<00:00:37.410> sensor<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
we believe is the door handle sensor a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.530 
we believe is the door handle sensor a
little<00:00:39.750> sensor<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> door<00:00:40.620> handle<00:00:41.100> here

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
little sensor in the door handle here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
little sensor in the door handle here
and<00:00:43.070> when<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> open<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and when you go to open when you go to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
and when you go to open when you go to
pull<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> hand<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> sensor<00:00:46.710> obviously

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
pull the hand or that sensor obviously

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.910 
pull the hand or that sensor obviously
sensors<00:00:47.879> you're<00:00:48.030> pulling<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> handle<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
sensors you're pulling the handle and it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.459 
sensors you're pulling the handle and it
drops<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> window<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:50.820> inch<00:00:51.020> enough<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.230> pass

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
drops the window an inch enough to pass

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
drops the window an inch enough to pass
the<00:00:52.890> rubber<00:00:53.190> seal<00:00:53.520> there<00:00:53.820> he'll<00:00:54.360> open<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the rubber seal there he'll open the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
the rubber seal there he'll open the
door<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> yeah<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.500> chain<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.949> change<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
door so yeah so chain to change it you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.290 
door so yeah so chain to change it you
need<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> remove<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.660> door<00:01:00.690> panel<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> whole

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
everything is quite easy to break off so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
everything is quite easy to break off so
just<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.450> take<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> time<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.350> remove
