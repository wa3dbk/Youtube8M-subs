00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.130
 inspired by makeup is usually used 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.930
 traditional because you already came 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.119
 asking for a long time that gives a look that 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.160
 recreate a look inspired by celebrities and 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.109
 that also in turn I created a look that 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.970
 I was carrying many lately 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.009
 my eyes and good as I was what it was 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.380
 pretty inspired on that I decided 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.210
 merge what I use obviously more than 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.280
 how makeup using each 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.200
 editing in adapting it to my face and 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.050
 bring you this tutorial today obviously 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.700
 this look is not 100% identical to hers 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.320
 remember I am not professional in these 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.180
 far from what makes the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.620
 Makeup can obviously recreate it 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.720
 easier people who are not 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.820
 professionals but in turn I decided 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.650
 adapt the makeup to my face is to say 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.630
 I do not have eyes so big and so 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.520
 round like her then for example 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.170
 I had to light up a little bit more 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.880
 area of ​​the animal to give that illusion 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.470
 just in the eye I also wanted them 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.180
 tell you that in my life I am using these 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.250
 gaps that the truth is excellent 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.750
 quality and have an excellent price and 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.189
 I'm going to leave the link where 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.840
 I got in the information box 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.950
 because really if they like the brush 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.869
 of makeup 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.539
 the makeup can not be undertaken 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.729
 lose this set come quite full 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.560
 Bring 8 brushes for what would be the area 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.939
 of the eyes and the truth I love the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.829
 quality if you want me to talk to you 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.420
 a little more in detail of these 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.979
 brushes to think about in the comments 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.649
 but hey what do you think if we are going to see 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.970
 how this look requires and good for 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.250
 start what I'm doing first is 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.899
 take this gap of those who are competent 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.210
 at the beginning this is a brush 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.009
 enlighten and it's going to be our leaders that 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.140
 makeup I'm taking a character 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.060
 coffee in half image according to my 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.340
 skin colors I'm pretty pale 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.110
 you are all more little hands should 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.670
 moderate that hour with a tongue of 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.220
 cat of what I'm doing is apply 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.259
 a bone color both in the bone of 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.990
 eyebrows like in what would be all the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.909
 eyelid and it returns to the rosita of 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.530
 blur to mix these two 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.899
 remember that the shadows that we are 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.429
 using are 100% matt 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.079
 we are going to blur a little bit to 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.569
 little to create the intensity that 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.640
 we want and give the definition to the eye and 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.950
 the way that suits us in my case 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.940
 it is a little more elongated and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.099
 Now I'm doing what I want 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.959
 I commented at the beginning that he has to look 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.330
 in the nba so that my eyes can still see 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.340
 a little bit both areas 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.050
 and it returns to my brochita to blur 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.570
 lend the buzz with a color a 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.010
 slightly darker between 1 2 and two tones 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.500
 darker than the color we use 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.140
 at the beginning of this medium coffee for me 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.090
 it would be a dark coffee you look at 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.710
 based on your skin color is like this hoop 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.570
 girls I could not mix it 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.520
 well I had to go to another second 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.260
 blur if you go to 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.390
 go see that friends who are the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.820
 makeup are going to be realizing without 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.920
 need more blurring oils because 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.780
 they will see the cuts and patches of 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.520
 little by little we create the intensity in 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.160
 the parc all always sowing the color 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.830
 darker in the extreme view of the eye to 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.820
 just do not load the rest of the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.680
 area of ​​the eyes 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.840
 once we fade and we achieve a 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.520
 between the eyes I'm reviewing with the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.980
 tongue of giant cats is that the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.570
 I really love the bone color now 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
 I'm going to use these false decals that 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.510
 I will also leave the link in the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.150
 Remove information in case they want it 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.220
 have two great ones and then waited for 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.080
 to dry is to winnow the eyelashes 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.820
 I'm going to be the makeup of 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.190
 face and moisten mier with remove water 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.980
 thermal and start contouring more than 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.970
 with also illuminate the face because as 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.040
 you know 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.050
 really highlights his features in this 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.840
 case I am applying the firm corrector 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.500
 Maybelline at the highest points of 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.080
 my face 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.420
 seal this well with dust so it does not 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.420
 move and exit any embedded brillito 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.710
 and go back to what would be the brown shadow 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.720
 half dark coffee mixing the delights 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.910
 of my lower dreams and mixing them 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.290
 with this ally of this makeup for 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.210
 that is more carbonized this is 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.870
 obviously optional but I feel that 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.110
 complete the look of flight to my brochita 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.550
 to illuminate the lacrimal and what is 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.560
 this is not just what I'm going to 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.110
 to do is to continue doing 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.750
 this is fundamental in this makeup 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.700
 You could say it's key but watching 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.700
 to adapt it to your options and your 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.080
 black allies if you have a 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.030
 glue that I know is black saltes 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.990
 this step but the truth for me was 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.990
 quite necessary 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.070
 What I'm going to do is mix my 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.100
 details with the false with a mascara 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.750
 ward with a mascara that is not playing by 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.090
 course and I want to use these 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.470
 tabs and I'm going to apply also first 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.479
 in the lower lashes 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.580
 she usually uses it for me too 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.229
 it is optional obviously he prefers it 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.960
 brut is like I told you at the beginning 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.300
 adapt all with scioli is doing 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.199
 is concentrate a little more lacked 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.210
 applying the matt latches and how I 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.000
 spend a little bit of the line with euros 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.270
 I'm already lowering it a little bit of everything 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.460
 with triplet now what I'm going to do is 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.620
 remove the highest points of the face 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.900
 very little with the shadow that eliminates the 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:27.280
 tear 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:30.700
 but with very little of what has come out of 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.370
 the natural line because 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.090
 but I do not have them and I'm going to move on 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.250
 react 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.140
 this delineated with an airplane and to choose a 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.510
 brown because I felt I was better 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.180
 with my skin tone and lips 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.640
 teeth is very important not to use a 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.230
 color as he uses it we have to 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.640
 pay our teeth close what 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.530
 I'm doing is compensating the 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.990
 makeup with a thermal water you 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.040
 use the thinker that you want and so 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.040
 is how the look looks 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.480
 that was all for today I hope 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.220
 that you liked as you already 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.840
 I explained I am not an expert in sales and 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.670
 much less so obviously he could 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.550
 have had common mistakes like 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.960
 anyone who does not know 100% 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.220
