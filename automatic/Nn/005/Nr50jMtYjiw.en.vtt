00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410 

I

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:02.420 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.130 

cause<00:00:03.420> it's<00:00:04.260> quick-draw<00:00:04.740> 106<00:00:05.340> and<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:07.020> to

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
cause it's quick-draw 106 and going to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.799 
cause it's quick-draw 106 and going to
show<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.439> how<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.830> build<00:00:08.100> a<00:00:08.400> German<00:00:08.940> artillery

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
show you how to build a German artillery

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:20.089 
show you how to build a German artillery
can<00:00:11.059> all<00:00:13.670> round<00:00:18.259> one<00:00:19.259> that's<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:19.980> an

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
can all round one that's not like an

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.560 
can all round one that's not like an
artillery<00:00:20.580> cannon<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.939> would<00:00:21.179> shoot<00:00:21.359> down

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
artillery cannon that would shoot down

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.759 
artillery cannon that would shoot down
planes<00:00:21.599> but<00:00:22.400> different<00:00:23.400> 14<00:00:23.849> on<00:00:24.089> the<00:00:24.150> ground<00:00:24.769> so

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
planes but different 14 on the ground so

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:37.420 
planes but different 14 on the ground so
these<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.820> pieces<00:00:27.089> that<00:00:27.300> you'll<00:00:27.689> need<00:00:36.170> so

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
these are the pieces that you'll need so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.690 
these are the pieces that you'll need so
step<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:41.510> is<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.720> have<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.170> piece<00:00:43.560> which<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
step one is to have this piece which you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
step one is to have this piece which you
need<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.510> piece<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:46.860> else<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

need to have this piece or else you
can't<00:00:47.520> make<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.560> step<00:00:49.560> two<00:00:52.730> is<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.790> take<00:00:54.210> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
can't make it step two is to take this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:10.810 
can't make it step two is to take this
piece<00:01:05.659> step<00:01:06.659> 3<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.179> these<00:01:09.299> pieces

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
piece step 3 to get one of these pieces

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.389 
piece step 3 to get one of these pieces
and<00:01:12.890> stick<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.399> it's<00:01:15.149> like<00:01:15.299> this
