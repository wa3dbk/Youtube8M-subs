against Java Oh what do you think master

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
against Java Oh what do you think master
well<00:01:54.869> when<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> comes<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> tools<00:01:55.740> used<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.340> kill

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
well when it comes to tools used to kill

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:04.459 
well when it comes to tools used to kill
Java<00:01:57.570> wasn't<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.110> Luke<00:02:01.729> no<00:02:03.140> that's<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.380> know

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
Java wasn't that Luke no that's you know

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.870 
Java wasn't that Luke no that's you know
I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> matter<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> convenience

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I think it was a matter of convenience

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.779 
I think it was a matter of convenience
it<00:02:06.270> acted<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> weathervane<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.610> think

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it acted as a weathervane if you think

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.639 
it acted as a weathervane if you think
about<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> lightning<00:02:09.450> rod<00:02:09.599> sort<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.259> kinda

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
about it a lightning rod sort of kinda

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.920 
about it a lightning rod sort of kinda
you<00:02:10.860> know<00:02:10.890> edit<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.690> fun

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you know edit there and and it was fun

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.080 
you know edit there and and it was fun
to<00:02:13.050> look<00:02:13.170> at<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:14.099> forced<00:02:14.370> her<00:02:14.489> because<00:02:14.879> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
to look at and it forced her because I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.210 
to look at and it forced her because I
think<00:02:15.450> symmetrically<00:02:16.260> speaking<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> cheese

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
think symmetrically speaking the cheese

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.860 
think symmetrically speaking the cheese
danishes<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> side<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.300> her<00:02:18.390> head<00:02:18.420> didn't

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
danishes on the side of her head didn't

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.809 
danishes on the side of her head didn't
work<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.410> she<00:02:19.770> had<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.250> minute<00:02:20.640> then

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
work so she had to get that minute then

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.850 
work so she had to get that minute then
it<00:02:20.849> just<00:02:21.120> played<00:02:21.360> into<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.900> then<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.709> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it just played into it and then and I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.729 
it just played into it and then and I
think<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.879> tool<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.300> killed<00:02:24.590> she<00:02:25.590> could

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
think that the tool to killed she could

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:50.270 
think that the tool to killed she could
have<00:02:25.830> been<00:02:47.810> or<00:02:48.810> talk<00:02:49.110> about<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.650> imagine<00:02:49.950> it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
have been or talk about it or imagine it

what a man's got to do okay
you<00:03:28.349> know<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.500> think<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.069> actually<00:03:29.159> is<00:03:29.580> a

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
you know I think it actually is a

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.580 
you know I think it actually is a
glimpse<00:03:30.209> into<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.750> dark<00:03:30.930> side<00:03:31.110> which<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.349> like

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
glimpse into the dark side which I like

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.869 
glimpse into the dark side which I like
because<00:03:32.159> I<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:32.549> it's<00:03:32.670> really<00:03:32.790> interesting

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
because I think it's really interesting

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.509 
because I think it's really interesting
to<00:03:33.269> see<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:33.989> know<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.680> he's

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
to see that you know that that he's

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.520 
to see that you know that that he's
susceptible<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.299> as<00:03:36.480> well<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:37.349> then

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
susceptible to that as well but then

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.880 
susceptible to that as well but then
makes<00:03:37.739> better<00:03:37.920> choices<00:03:39.319> so<00:03:40.319> I<00:03:40.349> like<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.620> like
