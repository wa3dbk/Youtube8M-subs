but<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.820> very<00:00:48.059> difficult<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.809> him<00:00:48.960> into

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
but it is very difficult to get him into

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
but it is very difficult to get him into
poses<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:52.550> sort<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.910> t-rex

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
poses because it is a sort of like t-rex

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.760 
poses because it is a sort of like t-rex
feet<00:00:55.309> he's<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.820> stable<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.960> could<00:00:58.469> lean

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
feet he's not as stable you could lean

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.369 
feet he's not as stable you could lean
him<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.160> his<00:00:59.309> tail<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.210> suppose<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> would

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
him on his tail I suppose that would

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.210 
him on his tail I suppose that would
work<00:01:01.969> but<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.329> looks<00:01:03.690> funny<00:01:04.159> I'm<00:01:05.159> very

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
work but that just looks funny I'm very

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
work but that just looks funny I'm very
difficult<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> pose<00:01:06.299> him<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
difficult to pose him because of the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
difficult to pose him because of the
limited<00:01:07.439> articulation<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.460> we're<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
limited articulation so we're going to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.140 
limited articulation so we're going to
use<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.590> Star<00:01:10.590> Wars<00:01:11.360> Star<00:01:12.360> Wars<00:01:12.659> base<00:01:13.939> or<00:01:14.939> now

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
use the Star Wars Star Wars base or now

here looks great look at that but as a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.389 
here looks great look at that but as a

have the movie series ultra poseable
spider-man<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.000> suppose<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:10.050> look

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
spider-man I suppose that would look

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.310 
spider-man I suppose that would look
great<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.709> your<00:02:10.950> shelf

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
great on your shelf

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.890 
great on your shelf
but<00:02:13.320> as<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.490> standalone<00:02:15.000> figure<00:02:15.600> it's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
but as it is as a standalone figure it's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.980 
but as it is as a standalone figure it's
not<00:02:16.170> something<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.220> would<00:02:17.690> write<00:02:18.690> home<00:02:18.960> about

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
not something I would write home about

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.310 
not something I would write home about
and<00:02:19.970> really<00:02:20.970> lose<00:02:21.240> sleep<00:02:21.510> over<00:02:21.720> hunting<00:02:22.200> this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
and really lose sleep over hunting this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.080

the<00:03:00.630> sculpting<00:03:01.520> really<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.820> swiveled<00:03:03.600> it's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
the sculpting really just swiveled it's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.100 
the sculpting really just swiveled it's
very<00:03:04.530> hard<00:03:04.860> they<00:03:05.580> bend<00:03:05.940> about<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> few<00:03:06.960> degrees

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
very hard they bend about a few degrees

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.210 
very hard they bend about a few degrees
out<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.090> very<00:03:09.840> difficult<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
out like that but very difficult to

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.210 
out like that but very difficult to
actually<00:03:11.400> get<00:03:11.760> him<00:03:11.880> into<00:03:12.120> decent<00:03:12.750> poses<00:03:13.530> he's

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
actually get him into decent poses he's

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.170 
actually get him into decent poses he's
got<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.660> swivel<00:03:15.660> tail<00:03:15.960> I<00:03:16.320> suppose<00:03:16.950> he<00:03:17.760> posed<00:03:18.000> him

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
got a swivel tail I suppose he posed him

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.000 
got a swivel tail I suppose he posed him
that<00:03:18.360> way<00:03:20.330> yeah<00:03:21.350> whatever<00:03:22.350> he<00:03:22.709> could<00:03:22.860> be

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
that way yeah whatever he could be

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.620 
that way yeah whatever he could be
jumping<00:03:23.489> up<00:03:23.580> like<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:25.610> does<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.910> jaw<00:03:27.270> move

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
jumping up like that does the jaw move

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.120 
jumping up like that does the jaw move
no<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.260> doesn't<00:03:28.850> but<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:31.470> that's<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:31.890> that

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
suppose when the movie comes out and you

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.500 
suppose when the movie comes out and you
like<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.980> villain<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.519> you<00:04:14.550> like<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.360> have

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
your spider-man balance it off good

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.200 
your spider-man balance it off good
versus<00:04:19.080> evil<00:04:19.260> then<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.769> suppose<00:04:20.190> yes<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:21.060> go

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
versus evil then I suppose yes you go

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.820 
versus evil then I suppose yes you go
ahead<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.450> pick<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.690> up<00:04:21.810> but<00:04:21.989> this<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.680> not

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
ahead and pick it up but this is not

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.440 
ahead and pick it up but this is not
going<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.190> be<00:04:23.370> something<00:04:23.640> that's<00:04:23.850> very<00:04:24.180> hard

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
going to be something that's very hard

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.580 
going to be something that's very hard
to<00:04:24.539> find<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.169> think<00:04:25.380> you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
to find I think you

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.810 
to find I think you
shelves<00:04:26.070> are<00:04:26.160> going<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.370> be<00:04:26.430> filled<00:04:26.699> with

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
shelves are going to be filled with

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.300 
shelves are going to be filled with
these<00:04:27.030> with<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.480> guy<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.960> Hasbro<00:04:28.740> has<00:04:29.070> done<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
these with this guy a Hasbro has done a

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.280 
these with this guy a Hasbro has done a
good<00:04:29.460> job<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.389> case<00:04:30.570> of<00:04:30.600> sort<00:04:30.960> but<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.110> think

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
good job in the case of sort but I think

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.980 
good job in the case of sort but I think
there's<00:04:31.410> two<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.860> them<00:04:32.120> at<00:04:33.120> least<00:04:33.389> one<00:04:33.780> or
