00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.609
 2012 was rich in good shooters and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.820
 oddly enough most titles 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.440
 were already somehow known to the players 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.450
 rockstar shown on the last chapter in 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.750
 trilogy about max adopted gearbox 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.800
 allowed us to overthrow handsome jack 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.380
 terrorizing the planet pandora 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.240
 we marveled at the incomprehensible ending 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.029
 adventures of captain shepard but 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.420
 wait because there were still headlights edge 3 with 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.090
 dark us two plan c2 three for son 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.790
 counter strike global offencive finally 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.219
 what to tell you then if everything 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.270
 so understandable it may seem that shooters 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 now all sorts of sequels covered and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.340
 rebuilding and so on but not all 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.920
 rise from the bottom of the game ocean 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.590
 breaths of fresh air that do not give 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.399
 my hope drown no i don't mean 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.520
 de zona 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.840
 this game has simply absorbed a lot 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.879
 developments of various games and she 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 really good but not 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.390
 are original 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.230
 what I'll tell you so is the ops aspect 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.359
 the line 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.729
 overseas disaster game in which you 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.400
 will kill a record number not 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.799
 Russians and even non-Arabs 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.950
 soldier know know this game got no 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 especially good marks from critics but i 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 I will try to explain why the end and so 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.939
 let's start you captain martin walker 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 commander from the clans of the delta consisting 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.080
 of two more people to become fully 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.530
 built on single meadow clichÃ©s 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.509
 military engineer and adamson just black 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.549
 I'm not racist but true in all these 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 stories of people with black skin set aside 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.200
 your squad send their special role 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.420
 in ruined permanent sandy 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.490
 the storms dubai from which the americans 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 undertook to evacuate the locals but 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.409
 if you follow the signal for help John 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 konrad local head of commander 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.610
 mission thanks a little bit failed me 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.340
 it seems that to understand what will happen next 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.869
 worth it all goes wrong and our 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.390
 poor delta squad will have to 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.520
 break through 1000 soldiers not only 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.799
 the local population which was not 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.170
 wants to evacuate from their slums but 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.700
 and the american soldiers themselves all you 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.530
 now told looks pretty 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.360
 corny agree yes and the game itself 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.879
 looks quite the same 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.960
 At first, in general, the first half hour of the game before 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.000
 eerily banal 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.070
 insist the player on another shooter or 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.410
 call of duty but with a smaller budget 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.660
 but do not be fooled you will not be all 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.680
 a game of beating arabs between broken cars 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.990
 in the middle of the desert 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.420
 no you will slowly move on 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.580
 incredibly beautiful apocalyptic 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.440
 mountains never rich he and now 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.990
 inhabited by only a few hundred 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.000
 Arabs terrorists and soldiers trying xx 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.480
 comprehended in half an hour the game will be 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.940
 look like that and then like that and even that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.370
 so then the accent will suddenly change and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.650
 merry pinned ear over the heads decided 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.570
 do with you psychology in close 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.550
 angles will show us scenes 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.740
 console to the decomposed mountains of corpses 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.560
 hung on the pillars of the body and in general 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.870
 something strange and incomprehensible and very 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.210
 frightening around then appears 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.240
 a question about our role in this war who 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.280
 believe whom we obey on this wave 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.050
 we will be carried to the very end 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.720
 sometimes makes you go back and see 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.360
 bloody stains you left 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.980
 and then we will show the ending that 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.780
 brought you your decision 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.060
 so it can be said that spec ops 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.310
 the line exchanged quality gameplay 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.050
 on excellent and narration about some 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.810
 done your time with mafia 2 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.360
 but in fact it is not so given 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.430
 minus his control the Greeks in the plot behind 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.890
 stamped some dialogues are not 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.930
 too much and variety game 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.510
 gives a stunning result 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.370
 very good voice wolf it 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.160
 engaged in the same man that at one time 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.320
 voiced by Nathan Drake series in chart with 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.530
 on the one hand it's funny but on the other 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.090
 the symbolic is symbolic to him just fine 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.370
 managed to convey the moral and mental 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.680
 state of your character first 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.380
 powerful military of our usual 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.480
 shooters and near the end of the broken straight 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.490
 and figuratively poor guy who 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.620
 realizes that there is no way back 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.750
 therefore breaks through the next 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.350
 a pack of enemies at the same time insults everything 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.230
 around 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.690
 gifts your weapon is also good music 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.180
 sounds of music shots here in general 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.150
 separate separate role after all cozy 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.060
 settling in dubai 33 squad made his 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.470
 radio station and even DJ who will 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.970
 sometimes cut the muse 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.220
 long talk or right on time 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.410
 battles the picture here is just 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.330
 terrific especially considering the system 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.490
 requirements at all when showed it 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.410
 familiar many at first thought that before 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.830
 them to the film and the prices are really 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.050
 made like a movie and no worse than a movie 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.030
 I also really liked how here 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.070
 You can use the environment for their own purposes 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.230
 for example throwing a grenade you are not only 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.720
 kill all the enemies around it well, 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.000
 raise a cloud of sand which will be for 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.010
 you something like a smoke grenade or 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.230
 for example you can shoot a window under 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.740
 sniper so that he fell on 40 floors 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.380
 way down 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.900
 cruelly but effectively and why is it so 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.570
 bad credit 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.670
 not minor bugs and this is a multiplayer 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.910
 which is here but it was made 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.310
 another studio and essentially imposed by the game 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.100
 dumb publisher honestly he absolutely 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.230
 no, he is his need to evaluate 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.300
 and if there is a high score then buy 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.700
 many children who will talk 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.470
 what's the story incomprehensible multiplayer 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.750
 generally worse than call of duty 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.880
 therefore have to appreciate low otherwise 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.350
 the remaining reviews of these critics will lose 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.180
 weight and confidence like this 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.010
 use yourself to rate and review 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.320
 but it is still important to understand that we have a game 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.990
 not for everyone, but we ourselves know which game 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.750
 I usually like everyone I like the phrase very much 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.030
 the game is an art that he himself invented 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.740
 it does not apply to all games but 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.840
 specifically to spec ops the line 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.970
 she fits perfect for me it was 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.640
 very interesting experience not everywhere myself 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.190
 justified but want to get 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.620
 such a little bit more often than once a year 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.560
 the most important thing that makes you think 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.450
 and talk and you yourself know dear 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.040
 worth it thanks for watching 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.390
 I really hope that you review 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.700
 liked and liked you not only 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.890
 review but the game itself please buy and 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.960

 fingers top subscribe to the channel 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.530
 the main thing is to subscribe because 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.540
 Subscriber little I need to have its 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.340
