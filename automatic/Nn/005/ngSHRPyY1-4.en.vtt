00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.849
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:16.130
 I'm here to show you how the gnv 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:19.730
 installed in my j3 here is the valve 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.730
 where does the supply 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 this kit is the fifth generation kit 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 it is not the third 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.769
 this valve that I never worked there 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.340
 hereafter I'll show you where 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.629
 fueled external temptation and how do you 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.129
 can see the fifth generation kit 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.320
 it almost shows a lot that the car 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.440
 has been converted and if this is the reducer 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 your name on goal 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 and here under the cover piece you have the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.670
 nozzles that they let know 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.650
 who collected it if it was the title the kit of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.470
 third generation would have to do the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.740
 reinforcement of choosing or the fifth generation 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.960
 do not need 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.729
 as you can see with very good legal 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.270
 show you here now the valve 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.270
 external 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.920
 here was outside where I fill 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.660
 together with fuel at least the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.470
 open field every time 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.470
 stocked 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:56.850
 here is the drum reminds me that I put it 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.850
 It's 13 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.039
 seeing there is the name of the converter 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.460
 here is the little computer 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:26.470
 You see, this fifth generation has no 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.980
 option to start the car only directly on the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.870
 escape he will always give no 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.170
 original fuel which in the case of 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.170
 I'm going to call the vehicle here. 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:55.300
 notice that this is already connected to the other 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.680
 The car here is only good in 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.180
 gasoline does not like to turn it does not work 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.500
 just in gas 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.110
 Here I'm going to disclose it okay 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.030
 seeing they are flashing 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.060
 here is this fifth generation 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.209
 he's in the gas station, see that 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.250
 little gasoline that came in here 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.950
 no use you will not he will not 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:27.250
 pass the fifth generation roll of 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.030
 third generation, it becomes 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.030
 speed up 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:42.420
 and he does not do it is good because he avoids 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.990
 of the driver walking alone in places 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.690
 it automatically goes to the place 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.410
 without realizing that I see if I can do 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.410
 a test here 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.950
 I'm leaving here to close the lid. 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:23.540
 I'm going to leave, notice that he's in the 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.540
 gasoline still do not work at all 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.270
 I go for a walk here you had 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.520
 three will pass automatically and does not 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.940
 I stare the car you do not feel the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.950
 car turns to gas when you 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.020
 least expect it already is in chaos without 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.020
 Did you realize that? 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.540
 I'm leaving here from home. 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.550
 and in one 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.470
 he's not going to spend a little more here 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.990
 boring because I left with the car today 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.310
 then the engine already're a glass passed 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.320
 You can see without feeling anything here. 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.780
 he still passed a little faster 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.789
 Because I already left with the car today. 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.030
 then the engine has warmed up a bit it 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:19.470
 passes a plate but in the morning and he 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.479
 take a little more time to 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.830
 to pass because the engine is cold it 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.620
 passes after a certain temperature 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.740
 it's no use accelerating that he does not 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.090
 will not pass he will pass 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.430
 automatically and you do not realize it 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.660
 I'm going to turn on the air and notice that he's already in the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.650
 gas 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.150
 Luisinha're seeing here รณ here is 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:49.190
 Because it 's a little dark now. 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.190
 find out what points here 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.990
 the line has stopped flashing, it is already 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.150
 in the gas 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:05.410
 I'll turn on the air, I'll just turn it on. 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:07.449
 he will not fiddle with anything on the engine 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:17.349
 Of car 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:20.889
 a good one for gasoline 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:24.669
 just pick up here and push the button 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:27.210
 so I'm on gas if I press 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.210
 here again 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.360
 he does not pass a direct place 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:41.320
 spent the summer 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.540
 Good, I have nothing to complain about. 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.770
 conversion 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:51.850
 I really liked the result though the 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:56.050
 people have had some expense before like the 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:59.350
 you can pay paper with the document 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.030
 investment expenditures in this case 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.410
 little higher fifth percent 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.810
 generation 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.710
 but in my opinion it's very worth it 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.710
 big hug
