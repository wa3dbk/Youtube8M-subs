00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
one is when i first installed it it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.670 
one is when i first installed it it
looked<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.520> crap<00:00:53.960> they<00:00:54.960> were<00:00:55.020> bubbles

looked like crap they were bubbles
everywhere<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> give<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.000> few

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
everywhere you do have to give it a few

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.410 
everywhere you do have to give it a few
days<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:02.699> bubbles<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.030> work<00:01:03.270> themselves

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
days the bubbles will work themselves

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.160 
days the bubbles will work themselves
out<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> bubble<00:01:04.439> right<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:06.170> unless

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
out there's a bubble right here unless

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.120 
out there's a bubble right here unless
you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:09.860> had<00:01:10.860> several

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.649 
you can see that or not I had several
bubbles<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> screen<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.360> they're<00:01:12.510> all

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
bubbles on the screen but they're all

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.929 
bubbles on the screen but they're all
working<00:01:12.900> themselves<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.430> only<00:01:14.670> issue<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
working themselves out the only issue I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
working themselves out the only issue I
have<00:01:15.180> right<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.110> some<00:01:16.290> micro

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
have right now as I have some micro

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.609 
have right now as I have some micro
bubbles<00:01:16.770> down<00:01:17.189> towards<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.729> bottom<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> as

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
bubbles down towards the bottom but as

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
bubbles down towards the bottom but as
the<00:01:20.310> day<00:01:20.460> goes<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> days<00:01:21.270> go<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.930> seem

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the day goes as the days go on they seem

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.789 
the day goes as the days go on they seem
to<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.619> disappearing<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:24.030> was

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
to be disappearing because this was

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.050 
to be disappearing because this was
these<00:01:25.799> micro<00:01:26.159> bubbles<00:01:26.310> were<00:01:26.610> telling<00:01:26.970> like

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
these micro bubbles were telling like

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.870 
these micro bubbles were telling like
way<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:29.579> seem<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.790> be

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
way up way up here so they seem to be

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.249 
way up way up here so they seem to be
dissipating<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.540> hopefully<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> few<00:01:31.020> days

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
dissipating so hopefully in a few days

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.719 
dissipating so hopefully in a few days
the<00:01:32.100> crystal<00:01:32.520> screen<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.240> crystal<00:01:33.659> clear

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
the crystal screen will be crystal clear

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.560 
the crystal screen will be crystal clear
