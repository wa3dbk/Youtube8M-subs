review for my lego transformers mini g1

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.829 
review for my lego transformers mini g1
Fortress<00:00:12.280> Maximus<00:00:13.410> yeah<00:00:14.410> so<00:00:15.400> he<00:00:16.059> isn't<00:00:16.209> really

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:16.839 
Fortress Maximus yeah so he isn't really

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.950 
Fortress Maximus yeah so he isn't really
my<00:00:17.109> best<00:00:17.470> Lego<00:00:18.300> transformer<00:00:19.300> as<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:20.560> can<00:00:20.710> see

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
my best Lego transformer as you can see

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.159 
my best Lego transformer as you can see
he's<00:00:22.960> a<00:00:23.560> headmaster<00:00:24.009> so<00:00:24.579> I<00:00:24.789> do<00:00:24.909> have<00:00:25.089> his<00:00:25.449> head

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
he's a headmaster so I do have his head

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.040 
he's a headmaster so I do have his head
right<00:00:26.919> here<00:00:27.460> it's<00:00:28.119> not<00:00:28.329> the<00:00:28.479> best<00:00:28.630> as<00:00:28.839> you<00:00:28.869> can

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
right here it's not the best as you can

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.160 
right here it's not the best as you can
see<00:00:29.319> this<00:00:29.499> is<00:00:29.679> it<00:00:29.829> in<00:00:29.979> robot<00:00:30.460> mode<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.779> arms

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.170 
see this is it in robot mode the arms

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.230 
see this is it in robot mode the arms
are<00:00:32.290> too<00:00:32.500> low<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:33.100> head<00:00:33.310> is<00:00:33.490> just<00:00:33.760> that<00:00:33.970> and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
are too low the head is just that and

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.600 
are too low the head is just that and
the<00:00:34.660> legs<00:00:34.870> are<00:00:35.020> all<00:00:35.170> one<00:00:35.350> piece<00:00:35.530> and<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.400> head

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
the legs are all one piece and the head

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.200 
the legs are all one piece and the head
is<00:00:36.850> on<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.420> back<00:00:38.760> yeah<00:00:39.760> so<00:00:40.030> not<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.360> best

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
is on the back yeah so not the best

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.200 
is on the back yeah so not the best
here's<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.330> actual<00:00:43.630> figure<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:45.430> does<00:00:45.940> have

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
here's the actual figure it does have

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.820 
here's the actual figure it does have
all<00:00:46.390> three<00:00:46.690> modes<00:00:46.900> it<00:00:47.200> transforms

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
all three modes it transforms

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.730 
all three modes it transforms
differently<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.580> bit<00:00:49.000> than<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:50.100> original<00:00:51.100> toy

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
differently a bit than the original toy

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.100 
differently a bit than the original toy
of<00:00:53.740> fortress<00:00:54.220> access<00:00:54.640> but<00:00:55.480> this<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.810> a<00:00:55.840> mini

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
of fortress access but this is a mini

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.190 
of fortress access but this is a mini
version<00:00:56.320> so<00:00:56.829> yeah<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:58.690> didn't<00:00:59.020> have

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
version so yeah because I didn't have

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.530 
version so yeah because I didn't have
enough<00:00:59.500> pieces<00:00:59.800> to<00:01:00.070> build<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.670> actual<00:01:01.090> large

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
enough pieces to build the actual large

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.020 
enough pieces to build the actual large
version<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.850> here's<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.899> headmaster<00:01:06.030> it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
version so here's the headmaster it's

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.190 
version so here's the headmaster it's
kind<00:01:07.329> of<00:01:07.740> good<00:01:08.740> this<00:01:09.700> would<00:01:10.179> be<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:10.840> little

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
kind of good this would be this little

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.489 
kind of good this would be this little
thing<00:01:11.439> here<00:01:12.179> which<00:01:13.179> is<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:13.509> head<00:01:13.719> it<00:01:14.079> would<00:01:14.289> be

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:14.499 
thing here which is the head it would be

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:19.469 
thing here which is the head it would be
like<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:15.100> other<00:01:15.310> smaller<00:01:15.819> headmaster<00:01:18.479> yeah

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
like that other smaller headmaster yeah

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.899 
like that other smaller headmaster yeah
that<00:01:19.869> doesn't<00:01:20.560> really<00:01:21.069> work<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:21.549> only<00:01:21.789> one

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
that doesn't really work it's only one

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.090 
that doesn't really work it's only one
piece<00:01:22.119> it<00:01:22.329> doesn't<00:01:22.600> even<00:01:22.749> transform<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.409> it's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
piece it doesn't even transform so it's

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.090 
piece it doesn't even transform so it's
just<00:01:24.310> uh<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:25.329> I<00:01:25.600> couldn't<00:01:26.229> make<00:01:26.380> another<00:01:26.950> one

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
just uh this I couldn't make another one

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.529 
just uh this I couldn't make another one
so<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.920> transform<00:01:30.280> this<00:01:30.789> you<00:01:31.060> just<00:01:31.270> take

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
so and to transform this you just take

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.899 
so and to transform this you just take
these<00:01:31.990> two<00:01:32.380> arms<00:01:33.630> flip<00:01:34.630> them<00:01:34.810> down<00:01:35.639> then<00:01:36.639> take

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
these two arms flip them down then take

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.139 
these two arms flip them down then take
the<00:01:37.090> leg<00:01:37.299> slip<00:01:37.630> them<00:01:37.840> back<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.999> there<00:01:39.999> you

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
the leg slip them back and there you

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:47.099 
the leg slip them back and there you
have<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.420> head<00:01:42.569> yeah<00:01:43.590> okay<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
have the head yeah okay now on to the

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.269 
have the head yeah okay now on to the
actual<00:01:47.439> figure<00:01:48.539> he<00:01:49.539> has<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:50.079> 3<00:01:50.109> rams<00:01:50.619> one<00:01:51.039> here

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:51.279

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
stuff yeah not the best so you guys one

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.809 
stuff yeah not the best so you guys one
on<00:02:08.740> both<00:02:09.100> legs

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
on both legs

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.530 
on both legs
you<00:02:09.909> as<00:02:10.269> you<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.599> see<00:02:10.780> there<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.480> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
you as you can see there and there so to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.800 
you as you can see there and there so to
transform<00:02:14.200> into<00:02:14.499> is<00:02:15.030> well<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.329> a<00:02:16.359> city

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
transform into is well this is a city

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.420 
transform into is well this is a city
would<00:02:17.109> I<00:02:17.290> think<00:02:17.499> it<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.650> yeah<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.219> to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
would I think it is yeah but to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.959 
would I think it is yeah but to
transform<00:02:18.879> him<00:02:19.599> into<00:02:19.840> his<00:02:20.549> battle<00:02:21.549> station

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
transform him into his battle station

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.399 
transform him into his battle station
I'm<00:02:22.239> not<00:02:22.450> sure<00:02:22.599> what<00:02:22.719> as<00:02:22.840> well<00:02:22.989> as<00:02:23.079> I<00:02:23.170> called

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
I'm not sure what as well as I called

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.080 
I'm not sure what as well as I called
but<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:25.030> something<00:02:25.840> mode<00:02:26.439> his<00:02:27.370> battleship

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
but it's something mode his battleship

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.229 
but it's something mode his battleship
or<00:02:28.209> something<00:02:28.540> mode<00:02:28.719> you<00:02:29.439> just<00:02:29.650> take<00:02:29.859> these

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
or something mode you just take these

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.839 
or something mode you just take these
fold<00:02:31.239> them<00:02:31.420> forward<00:02:32.139> and<00:02:32.980> then<00:02:33.219> take<00:02:33.430> his<00:02:33.609> feet

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
fold them forward and then take his feet

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.959 
fold them forward and then take his feet
fold<00:02:34.510> them<00:02:34.689> down<00:02:35.849> then<00:02:36.849> take<00:02:37.209> his<00:02:37.510> arms<00:02:38.049> and

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
fold them down then take his arms and

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:46.649 
fold them down then take his arms and
slide<00:02:39.969> them<00:02:40.499> out<00:02:41.499> here<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.510> slide<00:02:46.510> them

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
slide them out here like so slide them

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:55.679 
slide them out here like so slide them
on<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:51.000> take<00:02:52.000> these<00:02:52.560> ramps<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:53.889> and<00:02:54.689> rotate

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
on then take these ramps here and rotate

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:02.670 
on then take these ramps here and rotate
them<00:02:55.959> back<00:02:58.230> let's<00:02:59.230> not<00:03:00.989> rotate<00:03:01.989> these<00:03:02.169> ramps

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
them back let's not rotate these ramps

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.949 
them back let's not rotate these ramps
back<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:04.810> take<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.939> ramp<00:03:06.939> put<00:03:07.419> it<00:03:07.540> up

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
back and then take this ramp put it up

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.280 
back and then take this ramp put it up
down<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.859> then<00:03:10.049> rotate<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.290> around<00:03:13.259> and<00:03:14.259> then

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
down and then rotate it around and then

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.259 
down and then rotate it around and then
down<00:03:15.159> and<00:03:16.560> here<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.590> Fortress<00:03:18.579> Maximus<00:03:18.759> and

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
down and here is Fortress Maximus and

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.490 
down and here is Fortress Maximus and
it's<00:03:19.470> battleship<00:03:20.470> mode<00:03:20.829> thing<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.470> is

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
it's battleship mode thing so this is

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.099 
it's battleship mode thing so this is
the<00:03:23.799> front<00:03:24.099> again<00:03:24.849> not<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.269> best<00:03:25.509> as<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:25.959> can

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
the front again not the best as you can

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.550 
the front again not the best as you can
see<00:03:26.409> two<00:03:27.340> feet<00:03:27.489> are<00:03:27.699> a<00:03:27.729> bit<00:03:28.000> too<00:03:28.209> high<00:03:28.569> for<00:03:29.349> that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
see two feet are a bit too high for that

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.629 
see two feet are a bit too high for that
but<00:03:30.400> yeah<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:32.500> still<00:03:32.799> think<00:03:33.009> he's<00:03:33.129> pretty<00:03:33.280> cool

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
but yeah it still think he's pretty cool

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.949 
but yeah it still think he's pretty cool
now<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.599> transform<00:03:35.169> into<00:03:35.409> his<00:03:35.769> robot<00:03:36.340> mode<00:03:36.959> you

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
now to transform into his robot mode you

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.140 
now to transform into his robot mode you
just<00:03:38.199> take<00:03:38.470> his<00:03:38.739> feet<00:03:39.009> here<00:03:39.310> flip<00:03:39.909> them<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.269> I

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
just take his feet here flip them up I

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.080 
just take his feet here flip them up I
take<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.419> here<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:45.030> flip<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.150> back<00:03:46.479> let's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
take this here and flip it back let's

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.559 
take this here and flip it back let's
put<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.209> back<00:03:52.229> like<00:03:53.229> sup<00:03:54.359> doesn't<00:03:55.359> easily

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
put it back like sup doesn't easily

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.550 
put it back like sup doesn't easily
break<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.049> lot<00:03:56.319> um<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:57.129> then<00:03:57.790> just<00:03:58.349> stand<00:03:59.349> him

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
break a lot um and then just stand him

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.439 
break a lot um and then just stand him
up<00:03:59.709> here<00:04:00.609> oh<00:04:03.599> hi<00:04:04.599> just<00:04:05.139> a<00:04:05.319> camera<00:04:06.030> okay<00:04:07.030> now<00:04:07.419> i

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
up here oh hi just a camera okay now i

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:17.449 
up here oh hi just a camera okay now i
take<00:04:10.259> this<00:04:13.139> take<00:04:14.139> this<00:04:14.169> ramp<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:16.019> fold<00:04:17.019> it

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
take this take this ramp and fold it

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.450 
take this take this ramp and fold it
down<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:19.199> rotate<00:04:20.199> it<00:04:21.630> around<00:04:22.630> back<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.919> then

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
down and rotate it around back and then

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.700 
down and rotate it around back and then
down<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.380> there's<00:04:26.710> like<00:04:26.889> that<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:29.139> then<00:04:29.320> just

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
down so there's like that and then just

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.060 
down so there's like that and then just
take<00:04:30.539> his<00:04:31.539> hands<00:04:31.930> here<00:04:32.610> rotate<00:04:33.610> them<00:04:33.880> out<00:04:35.070> and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
take his hands here rotate them out and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.959 
take his hands here rotate them out and
then<00:04:37.029> flip<00:04:37.419> them<00:04:37.659> down<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.380> we<00:04:39.370> got<00:04:39.490> put<00:04:39.820> him

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
then flip them down what we got put him

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:46.079 
then flip them down what we got put him
down<00:04:40.139> they<00:04:41.139> said<00:04:41.380> put<00:04:41.710> down<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:44.580> there<00:04:45.580> he<00:04:45.880> is

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:46.089 
down they said put down and there he is

down they said put down and there he is
almost<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.960> robot<00:04:47.380> mode<00:04:47.409> now<00:04:48.310> just<00:04:48.639> take<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
almost in robot mode now just take the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.339 
almost in robot mode now just take the
headmaster<00:04:50.529> uh<00:04:52.469> what's<00:04:53.469> this<00:04:53.770> little<00:04:54.010> peg<00:04:55.349> you

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
headmaster uh what's this little peg you

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.969 
headmaster uh what's this little peg you
can<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:57.449> slide<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.630> on<00:04:58.779> and<00:04:59.169> there<00:04:59.949> is

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
can just slide it on and there is

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.610 
can just slide it on and there is
Fortress<00:05:00.820> Maximus<00:05:01.029> in<00:05:01.990> robot<00:05:02.500> mode<00:05:02.820> so

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
Fortress Maximus in robot mode so

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.909 
Fortress Maximus in robot mode so
articulation<00:05:05.620> his<00:05:06.010> head<00:05:06.070> can<00:05:06.690> rotate<00:05:07.919> 360

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
articulation his head can rotate 360

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.769 
articulation his head can rotate 360
degrees<00:05:11.070> its<00:05:12.070> arms<00:05:12.460> can<00:05:12.849> only<00:05:13.029> go<00:05:13.300> this<00:05:13.539> once

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:13.779 
degrees its arms can only go this once

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.820 
degrees its arms can only go this once
it<00:05:13.930> out<00:05:14.099> but<00:05:15.099> they<00:05:15.279> can<00:05:15.490> go<00:05:16.320> if<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:17.500> can't<00:05:17.710> you

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
it out but they can go if you can't you

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.930 
it out but they can go if you can't you
get<00:05:17.979> it<00:05:18.010> yeah<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.520> can<00:05:18.699> they<00:05:18.940> can<00:05:19.120> go<00:05:20.880> all<00:05:21.880> the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
get it yeah you can they can go all the

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.909 
get it yeah you can they can go all the
way<00:05:22.210> back<00:05:22.539> up<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.469> here<00:05:23.919> yeah<00:05:24.880> these<00:05:25.750> two<00:05:26.500> side

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
way back up to here yeah these two side

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.550 
way back up to here yeah these two side
things<00:05:27.279> hinder<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.240> motion<00:05:28.659> these<00:05:29.380> ones

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
things hinder the motion these ones

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.689 
things hinder the motion these ones
making<00:05:30.550> near<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.909> motion<00:05:31.300> um<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:32.620> yeah<00:05:33.430> and

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
making near the motion um so yeah and

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.730 
making near the motion um so yeah and
then<00:05:35.010> also<00:05:36.010> his<00:05:36.580> feet<00:05:36.880> can<00:05:37.300> pivot<00:05:37.630> down<00:05:38.199> and

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
then also his feet can pivot down and

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.659 
then also his feet can pivot down and
his<00:05:39.719> you<00:05:40.719> can<00:05:40.930> find<00:05:41.169> out<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.560> knee<00:05:41.770> all<00:05:42.610> the

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
his you can find out the knee all the

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.040 
his you can find out the knee all the
way<00:05:42.880> back<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.599> then<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.919> can<00:05:45.099> move<00:05:45.250> his<00:05:46.050> leg

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
way back and then you can move his leg

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.290 
way back and then you can move his leg
forward<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:49.469> back<00:05:50.469> like<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.880> do<00:05:52.150> all

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
forward and back like that and do all

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.230 
forward and back like that and do all
sorts<00:05:52.330> of<00:05:52.630> stuff<00:05:52.690> so<00:05:53.820> thanks<00:05:54.820> for<00:05:54.909> watching
