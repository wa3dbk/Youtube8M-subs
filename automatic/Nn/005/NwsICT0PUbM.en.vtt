for a number of reasons firstly to
extend<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.149> battery<00:01:53.330> life<00:01:53.720> for<00:01:54.110> as<00:01:54.200> long<00:01:54.380> as

secondly it's possible that the flashing

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.089 
secondly it's possible that the flashing
red<00:01:58.580> LED<00:01:59.450> light<00:01:59.720> might<00:02:00.140> be<00:02:00.349> reflected<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.009> a
