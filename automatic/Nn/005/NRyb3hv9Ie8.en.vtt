important<00:01:30.439> wickets<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.399> think<00:01:31.909> there's

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
important wickets and I think there's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.490 
important wickets and I think there's
sort<00:01:32.180> of<00:01:32.270> two<00:01:32.329> key<00:01:32.659> box<00:01:32.899> from<00:01:33.049> Smith<00:01:33.320> and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
series to get off to a good start and

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.370

try and go one and up and if we do that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.649 
try and go one and up and if we do that
we're<00:02:00.950> being<00:02:01.100> great<00:02:01.280> momentum<00:02:01.609> but<00:02:02.030> no<00:02:02.539> we've

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
we're being great momentum but no we've

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.910 
we're being great momentum but no we've
got<00:02:02.810> good<00:02:02.929> form<00:02:03.200> going<00:02:03.409> into<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.649> Test<00:02:03.859> match
