00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.220 
seems kind of crazy that you would allow
people<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.850> replay<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> chapters<00:03:12.990> but<00:03:13.110> you

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
people to replay the chapters but you

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.510 
people to replay the chapters but you
wouldn't<00:03:13.500> show<00:03:13.620> them<00:03:13.740> on<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.980> map<00:03:14.190> where<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
wouldn't show them on the map where the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.250 
wouldn't show them on the map where the
chapters<00:03:14.910> starting<00:03:14.970> point<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.570> act<00:03:15.750> maybe

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
chapters starting point is act maybe

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.810 
chapters starting point is act maybe
that<00:03:16.440> might<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:16.650> available<00:03:16.860> later<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.460> in<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
that might be available later on in the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.290 
that might be available later on in the
game

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300
