00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.740 
part so also we've got the Guru Granth
control<00:02:15.880> here<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.270> there's<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.480> raised

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
getting up off the ground you know this

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.290 
getting up off the ground you know this
this<00:02:32.200> that's<00:02:32.739> part<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.520> bottom<00:02:34.000> art<00:02:34.120> the

yourselves up especially on harder
ground<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:39.100> helps<00:02:39.430> take<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> lot<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:39.940> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
ground this helps take a lot of the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.430 
ground this helps take a lot of the
abrasion<00:02:40.510> out<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.900> they<00:02:41.050> still<00:02:41.230> wear

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
abrasion out of that they still wear

down<00:02:41.680> before<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.220> glove<00:02:42.459> but<00:02:42.880> not<00:02:43.030> quickly<00:02:43.209> so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
down before the glove but not quickly so

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.870 
down before the glove but not quickly so
you<00:02:43.780> know<00:02:43.959> that's<00:02:44.050> what<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.380> there<00:02:44.410> for
