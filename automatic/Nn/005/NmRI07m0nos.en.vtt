00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.629
 i 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.740
 hello how about youtube friends with what 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.919
 promised I bring you the secrets by 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.869
 so to say the delivery of rayman in 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.669
 the most voted comments I've been 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.920
 seeing that they ask me to crash 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.670
 bandicoot so then in the next 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.280
 Video hands-on work without saying more 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.500
 let's start 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.239
 we started with a curiosity they knew that 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.480
 in rehmÃ¡n 3 there would be a boss called 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.909
 software this boss was after you 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.789
 crash bandicoot style and you would have to 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.010
 flee from him dodging obstacles this 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.960
 boss was removed since the boss was 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.299
 too big for the world and the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.369
 animations that this one did as per 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.210
 example running did not run 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.210
 correctly 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.119
 but something that many were wondering and 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.490
 as we know that what you say is true 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.619
 well after playing it a good time 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.100
 I noticed many things like 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.049
 example in the last level of rayman 3 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.829
 before fighting with lipton the boss of 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:27.460
 this world if we get 43,000 points 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.110
 or more we can access a door that 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.759
 is at that level where 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.880
 I wrote that that door was like 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.520
 any other side like for example in 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.170
 some deliveries like kazooie banjo but 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.360
 many doors 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.220
 good entering this door we will continue 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.619
 advancing and we would find three 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.929
 characters the first one is a kind of 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.000
 kangaroo the second is a kind of 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.759
 bird that runs very fast from a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.280
 side by side and a third with surprise 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.649
 we find software running 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.049
 but without moving I think that in this 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.000
 room is some beta characters 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.000
 that did not get to come out in the game 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.120
 if we reach the last level to the tower 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.730
 del and puss without the 43 thousand points the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.220
 door to appear to close without any 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.130
 access some 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.820
 for my part the support here that software 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.890
 it came out and it came out in the beta because 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.920
 I downloaded the beta de honra de man 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.410
 3 and after passing it to me since it's too much 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.940
 short is like a kind of demo to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.250
 load the screen you get this image 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.920
 in this image we can observe some 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.140
 heads and on the right we realize 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.540
 that there is a giant who can only see him 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.790
 half body 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.480
 So this is where everything starts to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.480
 Make sense 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.600
 although we can also find a 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.990
 tester than in the world in which 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.360
 we fight with the boss like you stamp the 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.370
 that controls a giant feet if 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.770
 we pay attention to the scenario of 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.950
 battle we can see a sign that says 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.770
 gloves and in it there is a picture a very 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.200
 so much like what software is this 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.170
 so particular character 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.970
 of course wanted means searched and 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.110
 refers to who have been 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.110
 looking for that character 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.120
 the truth I do not know about you but for me 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.190
 beta version of a game always or the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.920
 most of the time it has been done to me 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.280
 much better or more interesting than the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.980
 final 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.080
 why then because from my point 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.090
 of view the beta version is the idea 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.770
 of a game since it is 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.350
 beta version usually makes many changes 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.910
 and our changes sometimes take things away 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.910
 that make a game good 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.830
 this western secret is called clark is 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.800
 secret and we can find it in the king 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.780
 controls this is to increase 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.990
 all the brightness the game because if it is not 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.130
 so it will not be possible to see the window in the 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.140
 wall 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.600
 this window can not be accessed 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.200
 playing clean we have to resort to 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.450
 books or tricks to enter it 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.150
 if we can enter we can find 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.140
 some signs that say to win 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.080
 points of life 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.160
 I try to shoot on a bridge for three 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.990
 mega shots 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.410
 try to jump under a well or 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.889
 somewhat confusing source and the last 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.629
 what does it say 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.659
 to fully recover life 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:36.689
 try to push a tree when you reach the 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:38.969
 end of this kind of tunnel we can 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.499
 find us with a kind of party and 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.360
 we can find the children of 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:44.189
 balloons and a tiny 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.129
 and let's not forget what seems to be a 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.509
 kind of character playing the guitar 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.389
 The funny thing is that if we use the 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.860
 chips to enter this room and the 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.409
 character that seems to be playing the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.449
 guitar is an optical illusion in few 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.090
 words there is nothing since if we see it 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.740
 in front of us we can not find a 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.590
 said figure for this character 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.349
 I really do not know if this has anything that 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.210
 do with the game because for years 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.860
 I do not play it 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.220
 but I suppose this has nothing 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.220
 what to see 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 This seems to me a mockery and a bit 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:23.699
 annoying that appears in the re man 3 is 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.740
 that at a level you are entering this 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.560
 place as shown in the video we 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.320
 we find with a cameo or a teasing them 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.050
 it looks familiar 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.380
 exact is a recreation of the last 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.180
 scene but with the rayman characters 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.500
 the truth is that it is very convincing and the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.500
 video shows it all 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.550
 look at this video, it does not seem familiar 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.700
 a dark rayman following the same 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.190
 movements to the letter if they see it 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.900
 and think carefully they will realize 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.720
 which is very similar to what happens in the 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.390
 super mario galaxy 2 you could say that 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.090
 the super mario galaxy 2 grabbed the idea 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.100
 of the rehman 1 obviously the claw of 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.340
 rehman 1 since the hand was not created 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.340
 First 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:30.009
 and to finish that reminds you of this 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.080
 a divided life 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.430
 comment in the comments box what 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.610
 is what reminds them to see if 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.800
 you know more or less where I get 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.509
 this phrase clo box 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.069
 well that was it for this video I hope 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.800
 that you liked it and I wanted to tell you 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:46.360
 I already got it to the 500 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.639
 subscribers and I would like to make a 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.099
 special in you ask me what 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.930
 you want to know about me good that 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.909
 I 'm going to leave the page where you 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.250
 you can ask the questions and I'll put them 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:58.509
 in the next video but he has 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.169
 I hope you liked it and 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.169
 until next time 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.810
 do not 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.960
 to 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.530
 do not 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.530
 no no 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.800
 Y 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.670
 do not 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.060
 no no
