00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
dirt to this place in the middle of

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.100 
dirt to this place in the middle of
London<00:01:25.460> would<00:01:25.850> take<00:01:26.119> us<00:01:26.330> months<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:26.990> months

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
London would take us months and months

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
and months and cost millions so we have

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.300 
and months and cost millions so we have
to<00:01:29.540> get<00:01:29.690> creative<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.500> believe<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.100> or<00:01:31.130> not

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
to get creative and believe it or not

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.730 
to get creative and believe it or not
this<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.610> crushed<00:01:31.970> concrete<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.530> not

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
this is crushed concrete so it's not

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.230 
this is crushed concrete so it's not
dirt<00:01:33.950> then<00:01:34.190> you<00:01:34.280> dig<00:01:34.460> out<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.759> ground<00:01:35.000> we

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
dirt then you dig out of the ground we

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.020 
dirt then you dig out of the ground we
just<00:01:35.450> crushed<00:01:36.290> concrete<00:01:36.619> break<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.580> down<00:01:37.759> and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
just crushed concrete break it down and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.469 
just crushed concrete break it down and
sieve<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.840> until<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:39.979> binds<00:01:40.759> together<00:01:41.240> and

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
sieve it until it binds together and

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.419 
sieve it until it binds together and
then<00:01:41.600> we<00:01:41.690> can<00:01:41.840> make<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.080> course<00:01:42.320> out<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.679> it<00:01:42.800> we

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
then we can make the course out of it we

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.370 
then we can make the course out of it we
create<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.030> whole<00:01:44.240> mass<00:01:44.570> which<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.170> around

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
create the whole mass which is around

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.609 
create the whole mass which is around
5,000<00:01:46.250> tons<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.670> bricks<00:01:47.440> underneath<00:01:48.440> the

5,000 tons of bricks underneath the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.469 
5,000 tons of bricks underneath the
course<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.130> then<00:01:49.460> we<00:01:49.580> put<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.850> fines<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.270> top

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
course and then we put the fines on top

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.870 
course and then we put the fines on top
of<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:50.929> then<00:01:51.380> if<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.619> rains<00:01:51.890> it's<00:01:52.640> gonna

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
of it and then if it rains it's gonna

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.520 
of it and then if it rains it's gonna
hold<00:01:53.149> within<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.630> bricks<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.200> not<00:01:54.319> on<00:01:54.409> the
