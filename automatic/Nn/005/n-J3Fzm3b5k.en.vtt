00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.760 
clean up the edges fine tune the shape
it<00:00:33.690> does<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.230> bit<00:00:34.350> bigger<00:00:34.649> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
it does get a little bit bigger so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
it does get a little bit bigger so
always<00:00:35.100> start<00:00:35.460> smaller<00:00:35.940> than<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
always start smaller than you think you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.540 
always start smaller than you think you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
dots in the center of those eyes now I

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.630 
dots in the center of those eyes now I
had<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> change<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.260> heart<00:02:23.320> here<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.920> while<00:02:24.490> my

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
had a change of heart here and while my

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.180 
had a change of heart here and while my

darker<00:02:27.790> pink<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.330> thought<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.600> would<00:02:28.690> go

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
darker pink I just thought it would go

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.650 
darker pink I just thought it would go
better<00:02:29.110> with<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.560> design<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:31.150> two<00:02:31.330> teeny

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
better with this design and two teeny

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.690 
better with this design and two teeny

little dots inside the eyes with white

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.630 
little dots inside the eyes with white
polish<00:02:34.090> for<00:02:34.300> some<00:02:34.480> reflection<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:36.520> this

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640

skunks<00:02:37.000> arm<00:02:37.240> it's<00:02:37.540> basically<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.020> an<00:02:38.380> L

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650

certain way and I find it impossible to
film<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:14.800> I've<00:03:14.860> done<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.070> off-camera<00:03:15.730> and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
film so I've done that off-camera and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.350 
film so I've done that off-camera and
then<00:03:16.780> using<00:03:17.320> my<00:03:17.350> nail<00:03:18.340> art<00:03:18.550> brush<00:03:18.880> I'm<00:03:19.150> just

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
then using my nail art brush I'm just

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.990 
then using my nail art brush I'm just
adding<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.870> pink<00:03:20.140> heart<00:03:20.980> for<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.340> O<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.850> I've

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
adding a pink heart for the O and I've

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.120 
adding a pink heart for the O and I've
used<00:03:22.540> my<00:03:22.750> nail<00:03:22.959> art<00:03:22.989> pen<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.530> write<00:03:23.560> stinks

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
used my nail art pen to write stinks

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.500 
used my nail art pen to write stinks
just<00:03:24.340> because<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.580> wanted<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.940> find<00:03:25.120> her<00:03:25.269> lines

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
just because I wanted to find her lines

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.860 
just because I wanted to find her lines
then<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.050> pen<00:03:26.260> would<00:03:26.500> allow<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.970> moving<00:03:28.300> on<00:03:28.510> to

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
then the pen would allow so moving on to

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.979 
then the pen would allow so moving on to
our<00:03:29.640> other<00:03:30.640> nails<00:03:30.910> we've<00:03:31.209> got<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.630> flower

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
our other nails we've got this flower

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.949 
our other nails we've got this flower
pattern<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:32.739> five<00:03:32.980> little<00:03:33.280> dots<00:03:33.959> to

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
pattern so it's five little dots to

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.330 
pattern so it's five little dots to
create<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.350> petals<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.800> three<00:03:36.160> little

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
create the petals it's three little

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.940 
create the petals it's three little
lines<00:03:36.700> connect<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.630> top<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:38.050> those<00:03:38.230> creating

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
lines connect the top of those creating

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.410 
lines connect the top of those creating
two<00:03:39.250> petals<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:39.790> you're<00:03:39.880> going<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.090> do<00:03:40.209> this

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
two petals so you're going to do this

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.410 
two petals so you're going to do this
three<00:03:41.230> more<00:03:41.260> times<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.160> have<00:03:42.370> four<00:03:43.090> sets

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
three more times so you have four sets

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.420 
three more times so you have four sets
of<00:03:43.600> petals<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.830> then<00:03:44.950> we're<00:03:45.100> going<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.280> move

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
of petals and then we're going to move

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.310 
of petals and then we're going to move
out<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.820> next<00:03:46.239> row<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.600> got<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:46.930> design
