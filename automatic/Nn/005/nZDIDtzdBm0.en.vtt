overall<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> basics<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.160> pretty<00:00:29.340> much<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
overall the basics are pretty much the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.700 
overall the basics are pretty much the
same<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> few<00:00:31.109> new<00:00:31.289> things<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
same but there are a few new things that

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.049 
same but there are a few new things that
have<00:00:31.800> been<00:00:31.890> added<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.520> few<00:00:32.700> things<00:00:32.850> have

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
have been added and a few things have

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.720 
have been added and a few things have
been<00:00:33.180> removed<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.989> I'll<00:00:34.140> cover<00:00:34.320> later

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
been removed which I'll cover later

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.920 
been removed which I'll cover later
first<00:00:35.730> let's<00:00:36.120> talk<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.719> get

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
first let's talk about how to get

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
first let's talk about how to get
started<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.070> arguably<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> hardest

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
started and this is arguably the hardest

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.690 
started and this is arguably the hardest
part<00:00:39.450> I'm<00:00:39.719> sure<00:00:40.200> most<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.129> by<00:00:41.520> now

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
part I'm sure most of you know by now

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
part I'm sure most of you know by now
that<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.030> first<00:00:42.210> step<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> find<00:00:43.020> 10<00:00:43.410> albino

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that the first step is to find 10 albino

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
that the first step is to find 10 albino
royal<00:00:44.219> feathers<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.300> mentioned<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.870> part

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
royal feathers as I mentioned this part

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260 
royal feathers as I mentioned this part
can<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.320> quite<00:00:46.739> tricky<00:00:47.010> maybe<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.120> already

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
can be quite tricky maybe you already

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
can be quite tricky maybe you already
have<00:00:48.539> one<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.840> two<00:00:48.989> from<00:00:49.170> leveling<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> get

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
have one or two from leveling but to get

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.830 
have one or two from leveling but to get
to<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> full<00:00:50.579> ten<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
to the full ten you're going to have to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.200 
to the full ten you're going to have to
do<00:00:51.930> some<00:00:52.110> serious<00:00:52.320> royal<00:00:52.890> farming<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.969> best

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
do some serious royal farming the best

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.970 
do some serious royal farming the best
map<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.600> easily<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> mudflats<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
map is easily the mudflats and

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
map is easily the mudflats and
thankfully<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.180> normal<00:00:57.390> mode

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
thankfully you can do it in normal mode

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840 
thankfully you can do it in normal mode
some<00:00:58.620> people<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.070> recommend<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> ship

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
some people like to recommend the ship

graveyard<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.719> think<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> mudflats<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
graveyard but I think the mudflats is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.560 
graveyard but I think the mudflats is
far<00:01:02.010> superior<00:01:02.190> thanks<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> its<00:01:03.030> higher<00:01:03.300> row

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
far superior thanks to its higher row

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.280 
far superior thanks to its higher row

don't<00:01:04.890> forget<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.280> hunt<00:01:05.430> down<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> area

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
don't forget to hunt down the area

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
don't forget to hunt down the area
unique<00:01:06.570> who's<00:01:06.840> back<00:01:07.110> bloomers<00:01:07.680> use<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> higher

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
unique who's back bloomers use a higher

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.740 
unique who's back bloomers use a higher
chance<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.520> dropping<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> feathers<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.510> well

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
chance of dropping the feathers as well

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
chance of dropping the feathers as well
so<00:01:10.409> once<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:10.890> 10<00:01:11.100> feathers<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so once you have your 10 feathers you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.070 
so once you have your 10 feathers you
need<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.729> head<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.240> lionize<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.869> we

need to head back to lionize which we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
need to head back to lionize which we
can<00:01:13.290> trade<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> feathers<00:01:13.920> donessa<00:01:14.250> feel

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

plain<00:01:15.150> white<00:01:15.420> world<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.680> idea<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
plain white world it's a good idea to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
plain white world it's a good idea to
roll<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> rod<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.759> some<00:01:17.939> currency<00:01:18.330> until

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
roll the rod with some currency until

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
roll the rod with some currency until
you<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.869> least<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.409> an<00:01:19.560> increased<00:01:19.979> rarity<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you at least get an increased rarity of
