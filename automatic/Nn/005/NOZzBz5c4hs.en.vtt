00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.840
 the renovation of the new rabo office on the corner of the Kanaalstraat and the JP 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.779
 coenstraat is progressing steadily 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.939
 the renovation will be ready by mid-June 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.459
 the rabobank tries to keep the poses from the camp 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.699
 restore as much as possible 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.000
 in the museum cafÃ© de lomboklaan smart the leader of the rabobank and lombok and 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.539
 peter hagenaar see how the property comes from that made the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.770
 government the new part 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.329
 this will also go in again 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.310
 besides that we have this 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.010
 entrance that 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 Here is a customized training is also a piece 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.380
 the main entrance to the square 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.370
 that make 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.180
 in recent years we were a great place and a photo shop on the corner of the jp 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.020
 Coenstraat and the Kanaalstraat 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.300
 the photo shop of van egdom was initially a drugstore 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.690
 and already fairly quickly 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.450
 He turned out to be much more Amsterdam 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.450
 now i'm going and i'm sawers 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.640
 and it gives according to the alderman 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.440
 sat here now is that the stairs that are taken away above mister minute you know 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 that a test for a recovery time here 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.990
 both stations 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 The report also never knows how it goes not like the birdhouse 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.050
 bunch of losers 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.930
 the narrow staircase through which 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.240
 the second floor 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 on top of that comes alcohol 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.580
 the story is about structural dope use 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.400
 what it is because that the report becomes the bin 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 the electoral council will come next year 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.020
 lucia richer 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.290
 the facade 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.590
 the finish is a bold lettering that escapes 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.750
 consciously choose not to set up a large light package 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.840
 but I already have a very light look to it 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.700
 and then again a great performance 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.280
 from the outside 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.230
 if you look at the 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.230
 the inside then we go for a much larger model 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.700
 with that, it makes sense that the neighborhood is fixed, but we want to 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 convinced of new things about the damage 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.139
 now the rabobank are stuck on the avenue of new guinea 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.279
 nevertheless, the bank has already had offices on the Kanaalstraat in earlier reminders 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.589
 stood for volunteer 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.719
 a bit i thought i suspect you also a little humility investigation 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.509
 to insure the passenger 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.429
 They were also in this and shortly afterwards they are already looking ahead to the Kanaalstraat 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.589
 to the two legs on the couch, say a little but to the 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:39.689
 greengrocers 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.900
 have you had nothing for three years so also the fellow self to repent 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.969
 went shopping by being hit by a car 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.379
 and the people before us but happily kept it up 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.840
 and to dave that is why they are so tired because they have to prop up too small 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.870
 after landing, they settled down in a timber trading midfield 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.719
 And there you have a point I estimate that it is a very long time even sitting there 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.509
 them now 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.119
 but now they are a bit with the new branch in the clover meadow 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.189
 antonius church 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.099
 in the coming months there will be hard work in the new building 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.889
 in the end, it must become the rabo office of the future that customers have 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.059
 the newest techniques can arrange banking 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.719
 had to come after many things here 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.139
 who are nowhere in the Netherlands 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.439
 that is not going to try lommel best actually a very suitable neighborhood 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.439
 full especially because we now have a very many different population groups 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.489
 we are all actually represented on average eur 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.169
 but many many nationalities 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.549
 yes that says lydia laan try new things and i think the lombok 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.739
 where work may have been made, it would be nice to see how it works 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.120
 banker of the future
