00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
controller thingy here LCD screen touchy

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.049 
controller thingy here LCD screen touchy
touchy<00:00:35.360> all<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.280> good<00:00:38.280> fine<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.030> dandy

touchy all that is good fine and dandy
but<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.930> also<00:00:40.350> connect<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.430> baby<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
but we also connect this baby to the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.130 
but we also connect this baby to the
motherboard<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.140> nice

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
blow up screen on your computer it's all

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.029 
blow up screen on your computer it's all
HTML<00:00:49.860> based<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.050> becomes<00:00:52.350> platform

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
HTML based so it becomes platform

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.380 
HTML based so it becomes platform
independent<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.030> don't<00:00:54.180> need<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> worry

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
independent you don't need to worry

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
independent you don't need to worry
about<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:55.079> device<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.039> sandwich

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370

so<00:00:58.650> right<00:00:59.040> now<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.370> looking<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
so right now we're looking at the

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.760 
so right now we're looking at the
Windows<00:01:00.450> version<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.530> connected

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
Windows version that is connected

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.150 
Windows version that is connected
directly<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.700> fan<00:01:03.300> controller<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
directly to the fan controller but you

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.300 
directly to the fan controller but you
can<00:01:05.400> also<00:01:05.610> connect<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.990> from<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> outside

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.420 

you<00:01:11.880> could<00:01:12.180> compare<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> small<00:01:13.979> web

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you could compare this to a small web

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.350 
you could compare this to a small web
server<00:01:14.820> running<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.540> computer<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:16.049> all

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
server running on your computer at all

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920 
server running on your computer at all
and<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.820> depending<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.119> size<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and so you get depending on the size of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
and so you get depending on the size of
your<00:01:21.960> screen<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:23.100> different<00:01:23.340> UI<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
your screen you get different UI this is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
your screen you get different UI this is
the<00:01:24.689> bigger<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:25.530> we're<00:01:26.009> having<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the bigger one because we're having a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.840 
the bigger one because we're having a
use<00:01:26.909> permit<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:28.189> just<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.280> show<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.490> quickly

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
use permit here just to show you quickly

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
use permit here just to show you quickly
you<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.149> all<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.659> settings<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:32.220> show<00:01:32.399> you

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you got all the settings but to show you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.469 
you got all the settings but to show you
quickly<00:01:32.850> I'll<00:01:33.360> enable<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> preset<00:01:35.299> maybe<00:01:36.299> I'm

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
quickly I'll enable a preset maybe I'm

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
quickly I'll enable a preset maybe I'm

outside my folding rig at home is
running<00:01:39.240> hot<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.750> check<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> temperatures<00:01:40.619> I

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
running hot I check the temperatures I

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.180 
running hot I check the temperatures I
got<00:01:40.979> scared<00:01:41.399> so<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.479> pump<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:43.830> fan<00:01:44.009> speed

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
got scared so I pump up the fan speed

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.609 
got scared so I pump up the fan speed
for<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.580> bit<00:01:44.729> until<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.240> home<00:01:45.270> however<00:01:45.750> your

we've been working on for quite a while
I'd<00:02:03.270> say<00:02:03.569> it's<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> first<00:02:04.349> one<00:02:04.709> where<00:02:04.979> we've

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I'd say it's the first one where we've

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
I'd say it's the first one where we've
had<00:02:05.310> three<00:02:05.700> hands<00:02:05.970> build<00:02:06.420> something<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
had three hands build something from the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
ground up total freedom is mini-itx but

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.259 
ground up total freedom is mini-itx but
it's<00:02:12.420> this<00:02:12.720> big<00:02:13.170> not<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.340> fit<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.640> mini<00:02:14.819> ITX

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
it's this big not to fit the mini ITX

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.710 
it's this big not to fit the mini ITX
motherboard<00:02:16.049> but<00:02:16.350> rather<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:17.130> fit<00:02:18.120> all<00:02:18.390> the
