00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.190 

what<00:00:02.340> I'm<00:00:02.460> about<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.909> do<00:00:03.030> now<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.540> test<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
what I'm about to do now is test the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.550 
what I'm about to do now is test the
quadcopter<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:06.000> safe<00:00:06.899> environment<00:00:07.470> in

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
quadcopter in a safe environment in

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.620 
quadcopter in a safe environment in
other<00:00:07.710> words<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.069> little<00:00:08.280> cage<00:00:08.519> just<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.480> make

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
other words a little cage just to make

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.209 
other words a little cage just to make
sure<00:00:09.809> everything<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.200> working<00:00:10.410> properly<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
sure everything is working properly and

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.870 
sure everything is working properly and
it<00:00:11.370> actually<00:00:11.610> lifts<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:13.549> that's<00:00:14.549> what<00:00:14.790> I'm

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it actually lifts so that's what I'm

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:51.319 
it actually lifts so that's what I'm
about<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.289> how<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.560> works

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.090 

okay<00:00:52.329> as<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.660> can<00:00:52.690> see<00:00:52.899> from<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.500> test<00:00:53.800> the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
okay as you can see from the test the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.729 
okay as you can see from the test the
quadcopter<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:55.420> was<00:00:55.809> able<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.110> hover

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
quadcopter actually was able to hover

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.369 
quadcopter actually was able to hover
I<00:00:56.769> don't<00:00:57.640> know<00:00:57.760> how<00:00:57.879> stable<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:58.480> is<00:00:58.600> you<00:00:59.289> know

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
I don't know how stable it is you know

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.979 
I don't know how stable it is you know
could<00:00:59.530> get<00:00:59.739> caught<00:00:59.980> up<00:01:00.100> on<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.600> cage<00:01:01.600> but

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
could get caught up on the cage but

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.109 
could get caught up on the cage but
let's<00:01:02.500> try<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:02.860> without<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.280> cage<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.909> see

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
let's try it without the cage and see

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.829 
let's try it without the cage and see
what<00:01:04.269> happens

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
what happens

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.539 
what happens
of<00:01:05.320> course<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.649> battery<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.070> up<00:01:06.220> pretty<00:01:06.460> well

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
of course the battery is up pretty well

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.270 
of course the battery is up pretty well
depleted<00:01:07.479> at<00:01:07.570> this<00:01:07.720> point<00:01:08.049> so<00:01:08.350> not<00:01:09.100> going

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
depleted at this point so not going

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.340 
depleted at this point so not going
anywhere<00:01:09.610> just<00:01:09.970> see<00:01:10.240> we<00:01:10.390> can<00:01:10.540> hover<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:11.080> little

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
anywhere just see we can hover a little

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:58.240 
anywhere just see we can hover a little
bit

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.130 

well<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> say<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.299> happy<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
well I have to say I'm happy with the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.789 
well I have to say I'm happy with the
initial<00:02:01.200> test<00:02:03.170> got<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
initial test got to do it where the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.830 
initial test got to do it where the
ground<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.220> much<00:02:05.430> softer<00:02:05.759> before<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
ground is much softer before I take this

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.249 
ground is much softer before I take this
thing<00:02:07.049> off<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:08.869> think<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.170> be

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
thing off but I think it's going to be

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.220 
thing off but I think it's going to be
fine<00:02:10.970> I've<00:02:11.970> got<00:02:12.150> some<00:02:12.330> adjustments<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> do

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
fine I've got some adjustments to do

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.140 
fine I've got some adjustments to do
with<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.459> various<00:02:15.260> p.i<00:02:16.260> settings<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.150> that's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
with the various p.i settings and that's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.699 
with the various p.i settings and that's
the<00:02:18.269> next<00:02:18.450> step<00:02:18.540> button<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> far<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.459> good

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the next step button so far so good

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.870 
the next step button so far so good
everything's<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.840> battery<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
everything's in here battery so the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.309 
everything's in here battery so the
important<00:02:27.239> thing<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.780> motors<00:02:28.140> will

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
important thing is that the motors will

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.920 
important thing is that the motors will
actually<00:02:28.709> lift<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.239> I'm<00:02:30.750> well

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
actually lift this and I think I'm well

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.030 
actually lift this and I think I'm well
on<00:02:30.959> my<00:02:31.110> way<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.440> dois<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.060> end<00:02:33.299> so<00:02:34.040> check

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
on my way to dois to that end so check

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920 
on my way to dois to that end so check
the<00:02:35.160> orientation<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.790> propellers<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the orientation of propellers the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.539 
the orientation of propellers the
motives<00:02:37.380> were<00:02:37.560> actually<00:02:38.010> reversed<00:02:38.340> when<00:02:38.519> I

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
motives were actually reversed when I

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.150 
motives were actually reversed when I
first<00:02:38.790> started<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.230> guess<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
first started this so guess what it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.550 
first started this so guess what it
stayed<00:02:41.489> nice<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.730> flat<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> ground<00:02:42.720> so

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
stayed nice and flat on the ground so

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.960 
stayed nice and flat on the ground so
now<00:02:43.739> it's<00:02:43.890> working<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.959> far<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.350> good

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
now it's working and so far so good

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.120 
now it's working and so far so good
more<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> come
