00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:23.850
 5 iphone and i honor zion 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:25.859
 Both phones have a very stylish design. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.740
 In principle, I like these two 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.740
 phones have a fairly durable case 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.399
 stress tolerant so to speak and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 scratch resistant 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:48.260
 what do u learn it a lot more 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.250

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.719
 brighter much more crisp how to search shop 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:09.950

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:12.180
 iphone and screen size means screen 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.200
 Fifth iPhone 4 inch

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 parameters and honor him he surpasses 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.720
 fifth iphone means iphone phone 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 him dual-core apple os x 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.000
 and the phone and honor Simon has 4 nuclear 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.619
 processor and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.180
 speed of 1.7 gigahertz 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 surpasses the fifth iphone 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.940
 RAM we have to find Simon 2 gigabytes 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.759
 when on iphone 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.930
 on the fifth iphone only one gigabyte 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.700
 the fifth iphone does not support the new 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.970
 standard Wi-Fi and Sivas spike 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.290
 speed fay whereas almost si he 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.170
 supports that is, you have no problem 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.140
 can watch in high resolution 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.880
 TV online streaming if you have 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.280
 there is 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.670
 essay router distributing high speed 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:39.540
 the Internet 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:42.620
 iphone camera so that the back camera 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:50.430
 There is never a front to which they are removed 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:52.410
 8 megapixels look for simon 4 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.760
 megapixels but in principle if you look 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.760
 I do not know them as far as you can see 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.970
 probably all the same iphone 5 more like 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:14.220
 reflects the real picture real 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:16.440
 colors here on the battery learn Ivan in 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.970
 principle exceeds several hours 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.590
 5 iphone means plus price is the most important 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.160
 I want to notice this phone is worth only 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:30.000
 650 dollars for 16 gigabytes this phone 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.239
 that's worth $ 900 have bends in 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.900
 principle by camera size 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:41.190
 battery video that is but it surpasses 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.230
 the fifth iphone so if you want 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.530
 buy a new phone now and not 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.140
 wait for the release of iphone 5s or 6 iphone 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:54.480
 and then I recommend a definite idea 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.510
 In total, it is like an analogue superior to 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.019
 quality 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.640
 the phone is all thanks to the swami was 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.239
