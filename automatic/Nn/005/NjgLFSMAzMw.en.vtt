00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
initial release of the game but we know

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.040 
initial release of the game but we know
that<00:00:22.800> they're<00:00:22.949> doing<00:00:23.070> DLC<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.180> could<00:00:24.390> I'm

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that they're doing DLC so we could I'm

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
that they're doing DLC so we could I'm
not<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> say<00:00:25.590> safely<00:00:26.070> assume<00:00:26.369> because

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
not going to say safely assume because

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.050 
not going to say safely assume because
there's<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.269> chance<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> 3<00:00:29.279> DLC<00:00:29.760> packs

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
there's a chance that the 3 DLC packs

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.120 
there's a chance that the 3 DLC packs
are<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.570> only<00:00:31.260> ones<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.710> they're<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.980> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
are the only ones that they're going to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.069 
are the only ones that they're going to
release<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.090> assume<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.420> maybe

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
release but we can assume that maybe

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.520 
release but we can assume that maybe
some<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.800> DLC<00:00:35.340> packs<00:00:35.670> may<00:00:36.059> contain<00:00:36.600> movie

some of the DLC packs may contain movie

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.459 
some of the DLC packs may contain movie
characters<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.300> there's<00:00:39.300> movies<00:00:39.809> spanning
