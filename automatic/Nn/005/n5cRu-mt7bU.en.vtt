to be a legend when he retires he in my

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.400 
to be a legend when he retires he in my
opinion<00:00:31.329> and<00:00:31.660> is<00:00:31.900> one<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.259> all-time

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
opinion and is one of the all-time

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.190 
opinion and is one of the all-time
greatest<00:00:32.920> goalkeepers<00:00:33.250> like<00:00:33.790> ever<00:00:34.030> so<00:00:34.930> so

greatest goalkeepers like ever so so
good<00:00:35.940> I'd<00:00:36.940> say<00:00:37.270> mainly<00:00:37.840> focus<00:00:38.380> on<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.800> overall

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
good I'd say mainly focus on the overall

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.610 
good I'd say mainly focus on the overall
ratings<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.090> player<00:00:40.420> rather<00:00:41.020> than<00:00:41.380> the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
ratings of the player rather than the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.700 
ratings of the player rather than the
stats<00:00:42.370> themselves<00:00:43.090> view<00:00:44.050> because<00:00:44.230> i<00:00:44.440> believe

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
stats themselves view because i believe

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.110 
stats themselves view because i believe
the<00:00:44.829> overall<00:00:45.100> rating<00:00:45.340> reflects<00:00:45.700> them<00:00:45.940> better

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
the overall rating reflects them better

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.510 
the overall rating reflects them better
than<00:00:46.300> their<00:00:46.480> stats<00:00:46.750> been<00:00:46.900> made<00:00:47.080> Buffon<00:00:47.800> 90

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
be fair for him obviously passing and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.770 
be fair for him obviously passing and
dribbling<00:01:29.829> being<00:01:30.789> his<00:01:30.999> main<00:01:31.270> two<00:01:31.479> attributes

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.449 
to now rather than in 10 years maybe
about<00:01:43.450> five<00:01:43.719> six<00:01:44.020> years<00:01:44.139> or<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:44.770> we<00:01:45.280> will<00:01:45.399> have

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459

messy<00:02:09.729> isn't<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.179> video<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.110> could

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
messy isn't in this video so we could

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.350 
messy isn't in this video so we could
put<00:02:11.470> him<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.709> next<00:02:11.890> I'll<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.190> Robin<00:02:12.670> 90

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
put him in the next I'll be a Robin 90

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000 
put him in the next I'll be a Robin 90
rate<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.630> would<00:02:13.780> be<00:02:13.930> fair<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.380> kind<00:02:14.830> of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
rate it would be fair and kind of

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.160 
rate it would be fair and kind of
compare<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.430> legend<00:02:16.209> ratings<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.660> these<00:02:16.840> cars

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
compare the legend ratings to these cars

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.650 
compare the legend ratings to these cars
the<00:02:17.500> current<00:02:17.890> ones<00:02:18.099> on<00:02:18.400> FIFA<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.480> you've<00:02:19.630> got

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
the current ones on FIFA so you've got

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.590 
the current ones on FIFA so you've got
like<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.020> 90<00:02:20.470> rated<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.490> but<00:02:21.970> true<00:02:22.180> gueno

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
like a 90 rated that but true gueno

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.480 
like a 90 rated that but true gueno
that's<00:02:22.840> not<00:02:22.990> out<00:02:23.320> yet<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.710> I've<00:02:24.070> never<00:02:24.250> heard

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
that's not out yet and I've never heard

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.410 
that's not out yet and I've never heard
of<00:02:24.670> him<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.450> Robin<00:02:25.840> deserves

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
of him so I think Robin deserves

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.240 
of him so I think Robin deserves
definitely<00:02:27.020> in<00:02:27.110> 90<00:02:27.380> rate<00:02:27.560> when<00:02:27.890> he<00:02:28.010> does

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
definitely in 90 rate when he does

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.699 
definitely in 90 rate when he does
eventually<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:28.940> his<00:02:29.060> legend<00:02:29.390> card<00:02:29.630> okay<00:02:30.500> now

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
eventually get his legend card okay now

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.970 
eventually get his legend card okay now

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
football player and that is Cristiano

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.680 
football player and that is Cristiano
Ronaldo<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.950> believe<00:02:37.340> there's<00:02:37.910> only<00:02:38.450> ever

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
Ronaldo I believe there's only ever

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.320 
Ronaldo I believe there's only ever
going<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.959> be<00:02:39.080> three<00:02:39.380> or<00:02:39.500> four<00:02:39.770> players<00:02:40.330> legend

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
going to be three or four players legend

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.420 
going to be three or four players legend
sorry<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:42.140> are<00:02:42.260> going<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.470> get<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.709> 95<00:02:43.190> rate

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
sorry that are going to get the 95 rate

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.010 
sorry that are going to get the 95 rate
and<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.670> think<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.030> could<00:02:44.239> be<00:02:44.390> obviously<00:02:44.720> Pele

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
and I think it could be obviously Pele

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.370 
and I think it could be obviously Pele
we've<00:02:45.319> got<00:02:45.560> messy<00:02:46.520> Ronaldo<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.660> possibly

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
we've got messy Ronaldo and possibly

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.830 
we've got messy Ronaldo and possibly
meriden<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.100> maybe<00:02:49.340> not<00:02:49.640> but<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:50.330> not<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> fan

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
meriden or maybe not but I'm not a fan

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.390 
meriden or maybe not but I'm not a fan
of<00:02:50.870> him<00:02:51.080> he's<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.230> bit<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.560> twat<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.040> be<00:02:52.130> honest

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
of him he's a bit of a twat to be honest

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.300 
of him he's a bit of a twat to be honest
but<00:02:53.239> obviously<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.410> 95<00:02:54.800> rating<00:02:55.069> could<00:02:55.160> be<00:02:55.280> a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
but obviously that 95 rating could be a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.559 
but obviously that 95 rating could be a
bit<00:02:55.459> biased<00:02:55.700> because<00:02:56.030> obviously<00:02:56.239> I'm<00:02:56.480> a

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
bit biased because obviously I'm a

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.229 
bit biased because obviously I'm a
massive<00:02:56.900> Ronaldo<00:02:57.290> fan<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.040> maybe<00:02:58.250> show<00:02:58.519> of<00:02:58.580> 93

86<00:03:09.560> parts<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.069> those<00:03:10.160> would<00:03:10.280> be<00:03:10.340> some

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
86 parts and those would be some

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.640 
86 parts and those would be some
incredible<00:03:11.569> stats<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.019> mean<00:03:12.140> we've<00:03:12.290> got<00:03:12.319> some

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
incredible stats I mean we've got some

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.890 
incredible stats I mean we've got some
legends<00:03:12.980> with<00:03:13.130> terrible<00:03:13.400> stats<00:03:13.790> some<00:03:14.510> legends

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
legends with terrible stats some legends

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.539 
legends with terrible stats some legends
with<00:03:15.049> some<00:03:15.230> very<00:03:15.380> opie<00:03:15.830> stats<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.340> think

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
with some very opie stats and I think

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.309 
with some very opie stats and I think
Ronaldo<00:03:16.940> would<00:03:17.420> be<00:03:17.510> one<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.780> those<00:03:17.870> legends

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
Ronaldo would be one of those legends

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.170 
Ronaldo would be one of those legends
that<00:03:18.470> would<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.799> be<00:03:18.830> absolutely<00:03:19.489> ridiculous

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that would just be absolutely ridiculous

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.020 
that would just be absolutely ridiculous

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
worse than Thiago Silva because he is

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.289 
worse than Thiago Silva because he is
kind<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.290> at<00:03:42.470> its<00:03:42.530> peak<00:03:43.040> or<00:03:43.310> he<00:03:43.370> was<00:03:43.579> about<00:03:44.269> a

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
on our ultimate team but hid he's

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.270 
on our ultimate team but hid he's
definitely<00:04:36.600> better<00:04:37.080> than<00:04:37.410> my<00:04:37.830> likes<00:04:38.040> of

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
definitely better than my likes of

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.580 
definitely better than my likes of
Cannavaro<00:04:38.759> and<00:04:39.000> stuff<00:04:39.300> but<00:04:39.780> not<00:04:40.020> quite<00:04:40.320> there

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
Cannavaro and stuff but not quite there

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.860 
Cannavaro and stuff but not quite there
with<00:04:40.770> mal<00:04:40.979> Dini<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.520> Beckenbauer<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.330> Baresi

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
with mal Dini and Beckenbauer and Baresi

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.770 
with mal Dini and Beckenbauer and Baresi
but<00:04:43.110> anyway<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:43.710> think<00:04:44.009> of<00:04:44.370> 90<00:04:44.639> raid<00:04:44.850> ledger

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
but anyway I think of 90 raid ledger

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.300 
but anyway I think of 90 raid ledger
card<00:04:46.110> bitch<00:04:46.320> would<00:04:46.530> be<00:04:46.620> good<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.979> obviously

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
card bitch would be good and obviously

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.460 
card bitch would be good and obviously
his<00:04:47.490> pace<00:04:47.759> back<00:04:48.120> then<00:04:48.389> was<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.900> lot<00:04:49.080> better<00:04:49.259> than

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
his pace back then was a lot better than

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.219 
his pace back then was a lot better than
it<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.680> now<00:04:49.889> so<00:04:50.100> around<00:04:50.340> 70<00:04:50.850> it<00:04:51.060> be<00:04:51.509> between<00:04:51.810> 60

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
it is now so around 70 it be between 60

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.529 
it is now so around 70 it be between 60
and<00:04:52.320> 70<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.740> reckon<00:04:53.130> but<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.729> defensive<00:04:54.300> stats

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
and 70 I reckon but the defensive stats

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.510 
and 70 I reckon but the defensive stats
are<00:04:54.690> ridiculous<00:04:55.169> like<00:04:55.350> I've<00:04:55.560> put<00:04:55.800> down<00:04:55.979> 94

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
are ridiculous like I've put down 94

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.460 
are ridiculous like I've put down 94
defense<00:04:56.789> of<00:04:56.910> 19<00:04:57.240> physical<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.960> definitely

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
defense of 19 physical it definitely

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.409 
defense of 19 physical it definitely
would<00:04:58.680> be<00:04:58.830> around<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.190> mark<00:04:59.400> there<00:04:59.759> anyway

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
would be around the mark there anyway
