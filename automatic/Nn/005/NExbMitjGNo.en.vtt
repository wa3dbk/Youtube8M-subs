00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.300
 how disgusting that sucks 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:11.219
 the human being that disgusts the selfishness that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.559
 he is really having the human race 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.990
 everyone thinks about himself everyone thinks about 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.990
 own business and should not be thought of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.660
 others that disgust the animalists who 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.880
 sucks those legal because I say this 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.359
 because we have reached a point where 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.429
 human beings do not know animal rights 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.200
 give more importance to practically 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.809
 animals than to their brothers because in the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.129
 world all are my brothers are i 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.620
 we are all brothers in the world 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.680
 all all all I do not run 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 disco is all like for ignorant tramps 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.370
 of the Northern League who do not understand 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.160
 blatantly the situation 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 economic that we are experiencing hardships 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 social we are living the main one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.910
 blame is not on immigrants like 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.770
 they would have us believe these buffoons 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.960
 of pigs as they are called these co 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.030
 of the northern area 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.229
 their fault is the electoral law that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 we wanted and now we are 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.549
 bringing about ungovernability is the fault of 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.010
 a minister of the Northern League who has 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.970
 defined what made a crap 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.900
 then the pork that made the crap 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 responsible for the situation that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.780
 we live 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 my brothers moroccan my brothers 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.060
 from whatever the art of the world enters 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.740
 rules but there is an incipit this is that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 let's say the introduction because he came to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.470
 say such a thing because they are there 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.200
 things that annoy me 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.390
 more than the others when I see that they are there 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 of discrimination when I see that there 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.810
 i am and this is not really me 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.900
 they annoy me when I see speeches 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.940
 racists then say 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.160
 I have to say I have to say something by force 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.260
 I've happened to personal stories like that 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.450
 alternating trauma than seeing some 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.160
 things and I have decided that I will always talk about 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.750
 plus the immigration of things like that maybe 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.530
 once with the belly once with the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.190
 head 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.000
 But today I want to tell you something 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.860
 because I say it gives more importance 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.320
 of animals than humans 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.540
 I tell myself why I get it on mine 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.979
 level one facebook page 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.929
 letter to read a letter 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.340
 which I will link to you below practically 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.270
 a discussion between vegans 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.650
 I don't know if well or not but it could 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.170
 however it seems to me to be so 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.459
 because it is taken from vegan with the house 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.380
 I think it is a site 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.620
 account of the kind there is this person who 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.390
 he asks for one evening all I asked myself 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.620
 question is a legal thing for a 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.410
 let all be a child at a distance 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.750
 from africa for example 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.780
 no because i am afraid that then that money there 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.030
 buy milk or meat 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.269
 live animals to exploit then type 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.860
 for the so absurd pasture to worry about 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.780
 what to feed a child 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.220
 especially if they are in countries of the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.350
 third world in a country where the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.980
 malnutrition one of the main causes 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.310
 of death 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.730
 I think, however, asks this but hear the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.430
 answer the questions are never stupid 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.670
 I often know the answers from a 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.200
 film as this will be for me all 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.640
 set of reasons prefer to have a 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.470
 more control over the money than the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.750
 fate this is right but to feel that 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.550
 slaughter against would like to have it still 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.070
 better but instead of adopting a 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.470
 remote child adopt an animal a 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.040
 distance first because there is much more 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.860
 need to adopt 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.180
 the distance and then because in the perspective of 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.040
 give the movies a message to show 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:39.310
 the cow or the pig has no equal 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.310
 how what not what we will eat not missing 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.650
 he practically says that if they receive 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.689
 well let's leave this other part 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.010
 make century over evil now comes 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.230
 the point 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.980
 I still think that the life of a 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.700
 animal is exactly as good as that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.290
 of a child 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.519
 an animal's life is worth exactly 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:05.810
 like that of a child from these 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:08.540
 words we can understand this whole ethic 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.730
 sanity in the doorway 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.650
 to vegan food and I believe they tie 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.079
 especially the animal rights belief but 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.000
 again that sucks more than anything and that 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.530
 I read an article that I am then for 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.709
 find out more below in ne 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.180
 find the various where it is explained 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.889
 situation of workers in Qatar 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.470
 foreigners for the 2002 and 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.919
 2022 in Qatar there will be the World Championships of 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.199
 football 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.090
 well qatar asked for labor 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.010
 so he asked workers to go 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.659
 build infrastructure hotels bridges 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.599
 roads st 10 percent there will be one 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:44.419
 the woman is very big , many foreigners are 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.490
 neighboring countries and are not private in 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.500
 qatar to work mainly i 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.870
 Nepalese because the income the phlegm 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.219
 like for example because the world instead 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.639
 let's say the per capita income 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:58.110
 very low so trying are gone 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.939
 there with the job perspective of 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.770
 salary of earnings etc. work 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.330
 regular 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.310
 what happens these people arrive in 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.900
 qatar and employer if this in 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.729
 documents become so meant 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.620
 because they are without documents they cannot 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.919
 leave the state without the exit of the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.979
 employer and therefore and are there and 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.610
 they do not receive payments for a long time 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.199
 when they are paid they are not paid 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.789
 less and less than was agreed 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.279
 they have no access to drinking water 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.259
 during working hours they work 6 17 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:32.460
 8 o'clock the scorching heat think that alone 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:35.969
 from 8 August it seems to me from 4 June 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.770
 44 hotel workers died at the Hotel Rossa 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.009
 it is calculated for 2022 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.529
 when the Qatar World Cup arrives 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.699
 4,000 workers will die now vi 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.529
 you will remember that during the last ones 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.969
 European football world cup do not 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.009
 I remember though I thought it was the hand 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.139
 where it was anyway there was a problem with 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.490
 straying and therefore romania because 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.349
 a race and world where unfortunately 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.029
 settled the stray question 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.710
 killing animals for charity yes 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.389
 can challenge the way to kill the 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.310
 world eradicate the plague, etc. that one 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.800
 It is always good to discuss things but 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.490
 I remember the campaigns then called eats 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.490
 in romania 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.710
 the animals the animals happens of the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.830
 episodes that are the slavery of the 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.229
 21st slavery in the 21st century 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.610
 and these fucking animals obviously 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.009
 since there are no major animals 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.560
 but only human lives that you want it to be 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.810
 ignore the story but above all 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.789
 ignored by the dead today worries more 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.639
 Kitten who died in ring 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.340
 or of the one he caught with the 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.629
 newspaper on the head an animal that is of 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.240
 a problem of the day you realize 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.710
 that we are discussing animal rights activists 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.319
 they want to give up experimentation 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.150
 animal discusses these things in 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.669
 italy and in the world there is a slavery 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.319
 veils of operating in one exploited because 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.479
 compare the song of 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.699
 first the life of a child is worth as much 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.469
 that of an animal but when I hear 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.529
 these things I say we should take away 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:02.789
 national health treatment 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:04.620
 paid to vegans for animal rights holders 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.379
 we have to take it off because I'm one 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.849
 waste because they are self-defeating 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:12.139
 they are mean idiots they don't respect the 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:15.000
 human life and please circulate 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:17.279
 this news of the fact that in qatar 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.770
 human beings are exploited for 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:21.900
 to do business to make a show 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.520
 because this is a shame the article 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.830
 find below 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.830
