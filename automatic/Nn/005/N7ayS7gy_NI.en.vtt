Here's the "Terraluna" a masterpiece presented at SIHH this year 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.800
It's an exceptional watch 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.280
equipped with a movement made of 780 pieces

00:00:42.264 --> 00:00:46.324
This is a perpetual calendar watch

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.660
that accommodates the four precisely jumping

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.420
perpetual calendar displays: date, day of week, month, and leap year

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.840
The great novelty comes from the back of the watch

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:07.285
with a patent-pending orbital moon-phase display

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.160
It shows the current moon phase as well as the positions of the moon

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.960
and sun as an observer in the northern hemisphere would see them

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.500
through 3 different circular discs

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.900
In the middle of the celestial disc, the earth disc rotates through 360 degrees once a day

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.340
the balance spring represents the sun

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.040
as a day and night indicator

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.540
This masterpiece will be produced in very small quantities

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.155
