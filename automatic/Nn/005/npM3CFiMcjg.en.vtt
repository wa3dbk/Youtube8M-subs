College in this video we're going to

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.550 
College in this video we're going to
look<00:00:17.850> at<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.359> Accuplacer<00:00:18.930> review<00:00:19.050> for

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
look at the Accuplacer review for

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.620 
look at the Accuplacer review for
arithmetic<00:00:19.880> here<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.029> going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.359> look<00:00:21.510> at

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
arithmetic here we're going to look at

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.779 
arithmetic here we're going to look at
whole<00:00:21.840> numbers<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.380> fractions<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.369> topic

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
whole numbers and fractions the topic

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.640 
whole numbers and fractions the topic
we're<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> focus<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:24.900> video<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we're going to focus on in this video is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.179 
we're going to focus on in this video is
addition<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.400> subtraction<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.890> procedure<00:00:28.890> for

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
addition and subtraction a procedure for

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.919 
addition and subtraction a procedure for
adding<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.699> subtracting<00:00:30.090> fractions<00:00:30.480> are

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
adding and subtracting fractions are

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.290 
adding and subtracting fractions are
very<00:00:31.170> similar<00:00:31.650> well<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.460> first<00:00:32.700> need<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:32.969> find

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
very similar well we first need to find

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330 
very similar well we first need to find
the<00:00:33.510> least<00:00:33.719> common<00:00:33.980> denominators<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> both

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the least common denominators of both

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
the least common denominators of both
terms<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.090> write<00:00:36.660> equivalent<00:00:37.079> fractions<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
terms and write equivalent fractions so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
terms and write equivalent fractions so
our<00:00:38.190> example<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.059> subtraction

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
our example is going to be subtraction

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.400 
our example is going to be subtraction
but<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.190> want<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.850> find<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.410> LCM

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
but what we want to do is find the LCM

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.150 
but what we want to do is find the LCM
or<00:00:44.070> LCD<00:00:44.760> least<00:00:45.629> common<00:00:45.930> denominator

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
or LCD least common denominator

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.959 
or LCD least common denominator
sometimes<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.370> called<00:00:47.489> least<00:00:47.730> common

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
sometimes it's called least common

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.299 
sometimes it's called least common
multiple<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.410> our<00:00:49.530> case<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:50.070> looking

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
multiple and in our case we're looking

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.799 
multiple and in our case we're looking
forward<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> 5<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:52.730> 10<00:00:53.730> well<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.629> least

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
forward to 5 and 10 well the least

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689 
forward to 5 and 10 well the least
common<00:00:55.110> multiple<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:55.890> again<00:00:56.280> least<00:00:56.489> common

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
common multiple or again least common

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.709 
common multiple or again least common
denominator<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.930> course<00:00:58.520> 10<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.239> both<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
denominator is of course 10 so both of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.090 
denominator is of course 10 so both of
our<00:01:00.840> fractions<00:01:01.350> need<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> denominator

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
our fractions need to have a denominator

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910 
our fractions need to have a denominator
10<00:01:02.969> our<00:01:03.390> second<00:01:03.989> fraction<00:01:04.199> already<00:01:04.710> has<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
10 our second fraction already has a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.850 
10 our second fraction already has a
denominator<00:01:05.850> 10<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.590> worry

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
denominator 10 so we just need to worry

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
denominator 10 so we just need to worry
about<00:01:08.040> writing<00:01:08.580> an<00:01:08.670> equivalent<00:01:09.330> fraction<00:01:09.360> for

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
about writing an equivalent fraction for

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
about writing an equivalent fraction for
the<00:01:10.290> numerator<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.210> multiply

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the numerator so we have to multiply

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.810 
the numerator so we have to multiply
this<00:01:12.720> fraction<00:01:13.049> by<00:01:13.500> 2<00:01:14.180> over<00:01:15.180> 2<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.549> we<00:01:17.549> rewrite

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this fraction by 2 over 2 so we rewrite

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
this fraction by 2 over 2 so we rewrite
the<00:01:18.180> whole<00:01:18.299> part<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.930> there's<00:01:19.140> our<00:01:19.290> 12<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the whole part so there's our 12 and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640 
the whole part so there's our 12 and
then<00:01:20.670> we're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> take<00:01:21.210> 2<00:01:21.509> times<00:01:21.869> 2<00:01:22.290> so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
then we're going to take 2 times 2 so

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.039 
then we're going to take 2 times 2 so
that<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.619> over<00:01:25.619> 10<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> we're<00:01:27.960> going

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
that is for all over 10 now we're going

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.050 
that is for all over 10 now we're going
to<00:01:28.110> bring<00:01:28.470> our<00:01:28.650> second<00:01:29.070> fraction<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.670> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to bring our second fraction over so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.980 
to bring our second fraction over so
that<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.420> our<00:01:30.600> three<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.350> seven<00:01:32.990> tenths

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
that is our three and seven tenths

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
that is our three and seven tenths
alright<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> problem<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.670> can't

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
alright but we have a problem we can't

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.749 
alright but we have a problem we can't
take<00:01:39.320> 4-7<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.520> whole<00:01:41.729> numbers

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
take 4-7 so just like with whole numbers

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.630 
take 4-7 so just like with whole numbers
we<00:01:42.360> need<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.600> borrow<00:01:42.960> however<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.950> process<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
we need to borrow however the process is

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
we need to borrow however the process is
different<00:01:44.880> when<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.240> comes<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.600> fractions

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
different when it comes to fractions

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.080 
different when it comes to fractions
well<00:01:46.590> we're<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.979> borrow<00:01:47.250> from<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.700> 12

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
well we're going to borrow from the 12

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.469 
well we're going to borrow from the 12
so<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> make<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.590> 12<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.479> 11

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
so that's going to make the 12 and 11

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.010 
so that's going to make the 12 and 11
and<00:01:52.259> we're<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> give<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.930> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and we're going to give it to you that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.530 
and we're going to give it to you that
fraction<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.700> twelfth<00:01:57.299> but

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
fraction so there's the twelfth but

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.060 
fraction so there's the twelfth but
we're<00:01:57.750> giving<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> fraction<00:01:58.890> so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
we're giving it to the fraction so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.100 
we're giving it to the fraction so
here's<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> four<00:02:01.460> tents<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.810> then<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:03.990> we

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
here's the four tents and then what we

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.169 
here's the four tents and then what we
want<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:05.299> rewrite<00:02:06.299> our<00:02:06.770> 11<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.729> we

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
want to do is rewrite our 11 and then we

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.420 
want to do is rewrite our 11 and then we
created<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.810> mixed<00:02:10.110> number<00:02:10.289> by<00:02:10.619> putting<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.129> one

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
created a mixed number by putting a one

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.830 
created a mixed number by putting a one
in<00:02:11.760> front<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> four

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
in front of the four

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.619 
in front of the four
so<00:02:13.140> now<00:02:13.319> we<00:02:13.379> want<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> write<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.370> a

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
so now we want to write that as a

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.089 
so now we want to write that as a
improper<00:02:15.629> fraction<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:16.560> we're<00:02:16.709> going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.890> take

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
improper fraction so we're going to take

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.080 
improper fraction so we're going to take
10<00:02:17.580> times<00:02:18.450> 1<00:02:18.900> plus<00:02:19.280> 4<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.580> again<00:02:20.849> we're<00:02:21.000> going

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
10 times 1 plus 4 so again we're going

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.780 
10 times 1 plus 4 so again we're going
to<00:02:21.180> take<00:02:21.300> 10<00:02:21.540> times<00:02:21.840> 1<00:02:22.200> which<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.440> 10<00:02:22.890> plus<00:02:23.280> 4

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
to take 10 times 1 which is 10 plus 4

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.759 
to take 10 times 1 which is 10 plus 4
and<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.920> 14<00:02:27.080> all<00:02:28.430> over<00:02:29.510> 10<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.049> we<00:02:31.200> created<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
and have 14 all over 10 so we created a

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.770 
and have 14 all over 10 so we created a
mixed<00:02:32.099> number<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:32.549> an<00:02:32.700> improper<00:02:33.330> part<00:02:33.599> but

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
mixed number with an improper part but

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.809 
mixed number with an improper part but
that's<00:02:33.900> our<00:02:34.170> borrowing<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.069> now<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.519> bring

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
that's our borrowing so now we can bring

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.550 
that's our borrowing so now we can bring
the<00:02:36.090> denominator<00:02:36.780> at<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.049> second<00:02:37.379> fraction

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the denominator at the second fraction

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.589 
the denominator at the second fraction
over<00:02:37.980> which<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.640> our<00:02:38.790> three<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.709> seven<00:02:41.599> tenths

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
over which is our three and seven tenths

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.410 
over which is our three and seven tenths
and<00:02:43.069> now<00:02:44.069> we're<00:02:44.280> set<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.660> subtract<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:47.090> 14-7<00:02:48.090> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
and now we're set to subtract so 14-7 of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.789 
and now we're set to subtract so 14-7 of
course<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.110> seven<00:02:50.069> all<00:02:50.940> over<00:02:51.510> 10<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.230> then

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
course is seven all over 10 and then

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.370 
course is seven all over 10 and then
will<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.010> subtract<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.670> whole<00:02:53.849> part<00:02:54.150> 11<00:02:54.989> minus

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
will we subtract the whole part 11 minus

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.690 
will we subtract the whole part 11 minus
3<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.810> 8<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.620> fraction<00:02:59.190> does<00:02:59.340> not<00:02:59.489> reduce

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
3 is 8 this fraction does not reduce

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:12.320 
3 is 8 this fraction does not reduce
anymore<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.690> we<00:03:01.049> are<00:03:01.640> done

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.390
