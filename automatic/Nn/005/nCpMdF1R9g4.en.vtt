 if a shaker of 30 grams of protein 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.120
 regarding integration

 of the city nutrition four axes that 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:18.590
 first 4 after training 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:22.580
 bucovina sulphate for joints e 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:26.240
 then the carnitine is over and a dot 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:31.789
 try these supplements based on 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:37.010
 clark comprises 800 mg of coves 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:41.240
 carnitine and 1,300 mg of club is seen 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.500
 then it went very well then multivitamin 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:50.949
 like this which blue vitamin c and 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.949
 for the moment and then it also started 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.460
 of the alpha lipoic acid clue to 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.360
 colic alpha 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:08.250
 twice a day 300 mg of cyanines 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.479
 world I eat more carbohydrates now 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.740
 that anyway I am grateful to bf will put 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.639
 something really great too 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.380
 push a little more to stay 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.120
 let's not lose our muscle 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.590
 that I did my training though 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.389
 I'm doing a cutting diet 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.020
 non-training trophy workout 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.360
 how we maintain muscle shaft 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.280
 well that's all 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.580
 I will see a glimpse of mine 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.580
 work out 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.419
 then as I had planned mine yesterday 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.810
 trainer inserted something for me 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:49.830
 push harder to keep the mass 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.460
 lean and maybe increase it anyway 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.840
 in training for trophic also of the 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.800
 my diet is nothing and committed a 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.599
 workout 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.340
 I chose the salt and nothing I find 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:09.349
 very valid because in addition to the usual 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.979
 Citrine carnitine sick 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:17.400
 Creatine caffeine inside too 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.949
 many amino acids vitamins and even the 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.870
 papain that an enzyme to break down 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.870
 proteins that you find papaya 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.979
 no
