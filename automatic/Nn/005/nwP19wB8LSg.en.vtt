00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
I guess and I just heard kind of a

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.130 
I guess and I just heard kind of a
popping<00:01:24.310> noise<00:01:24.340> coming<00:01:25.180> from<00:01:25.360> over<00:01:25.659> here<00:01:25.869> so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
popping noise coming from over here so

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.440 
popping noise coming from over here so
yeah<00:01:27.009> better<00:01:27.280> come<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.520> see<00:01:27.670> what's<00:01:28.000> going<00:01:28.300> on

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450

here<00:01:33.180> didn't<00:01:34.180> explode<00:01:34.630> all<00:01:34.899> or<00:01:35.110> oh<00:01:35.790> there<00:01:36.790> we

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
here didn't explode all or oh there we

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.520 
here didn't explode all or oh there we
go

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
go

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.249 
go
let's<00:01:38.530> get<00:01:38.710> pretty<00:01:39.070> soft<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.610> think

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.810 

probably<00:01:47.890> won't<00:01:47.950> hurt<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.280> poke<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.520> few<00:01:48.759> holes

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
probably won't hurt to poke a few holes

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.899 
probably won't hurt to poke a few holes
in<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.360> now<00:01:50.280> probably<00:01:51.280> should<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.549> done<00:01:51.729> that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
in it now probably should have done that

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.280 
in it now probably should have done that
in<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.119> beginning<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.750> don't<00:01:52.810> know<00:01:53.020> if<00:01:53.140> that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
in the beginning I don't know if that

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.020 
in the beginning I don't know if that
could<00:01:53.500> explode<00:01:53.950> or<00:01:54.159> not<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:54.640> guess<00:01:54.850> it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
could explode or not but I guess it's

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.289 
could explode or not but I guess it's
possible<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.890> had<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> baked<00:01:57.189> potato<00:01:57.369> explode<00:01:58.149> in

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
possible I had a baked potato explode in

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.389 
possible I had a baked potato explode in
the<00:01:58.420> oven<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:59.080> other<00:01:59.229> day<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.890> I<00:01:59.950> never<00:02:00.189> had

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
the oven the other day and I never had

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.609 
the oven the other day and I never had
that<00:02:00.430> happen<00:02:00.640> before<00:02:01.030> but<00:02:04.080> made<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> big<00:02:05.380> mess

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
that happen before but made a big mess

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.490 
that happen before but made a big mess
so<00:02:06.430> now<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.580> always<00:02:06.909> pokel<00:02:07.299> is<00:02:07.450> huh<00:02:08.580> huh

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
so now I always pokel is huh huh

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.809 
so now I always pokel is huh huh
it's<00:02:11.500> getting<00:02:11.739> pretty<00:02:11.800> soft<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.580> think<00:02:12.730> it's

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
it's getting pretty soft I think it's

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.630 
it's getting pretty soft I think it's
almost<00:02:13.060> done<00:02:13.390> actually<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:15.040> put<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> lid

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
almost done actually I just put the lid

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.729 
almost done actually I just put the lid
on<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.940> let<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.120> cook<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.080> little<00:02:17.260> bit<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.709> I

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
on and let it cook a little bit more I

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.630 
on and let it cook a little bit more I
think<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:19.650> spaghetti<00:02:20.650> squash<00:02:20.800> has<00:02:21.310> been<00:02:21.489> in

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
think that spaghetti squash has been in

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
think that spaghetti squash has been in
there<00:02:21.760> about<00:02:21.970> three<00:02:22.330> hours<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.470> I'm<00:02:23.830> gonna

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
there about three hours now so I'm gonna

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.380 
there about three hours now so I'm gonna
open<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.489> see<00:02:24.670> how<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.970> looks

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
open it and see how it looks

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.180 
open it and see how it looks
oh<00:02:30.269> it's<00:02:31.269> really<00:02:31.510> soft<00:02:31.780> that's<00:02:32.380> pretty<00:02:32.980> much

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
oh it's really soft that's pretty much

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.800 
oh it's really soft that's pretty much
done<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:37.140> smells<00:02:38.140> really<00:02:38.470> good<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:40.600> think

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
done and smells really good and I think

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.720 
done and smells really good and I think
the<00:02:40.930> juice<00:02:41.230> from<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.680> squash<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.340> running

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
the juice from the squash is running

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.090 
the juice from the squash is running
into<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> water<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> bottom<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:47.100> think

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
into the water in the bottom so I think

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.150 
into the water in the bottom so I think
what<00:02:48.400> I'm<00:02:48.489> gonna<00:02:48.670> do<00:02:49.000> now<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.739> I'm<00:02:50.739> gonna<00:02:50.860> take

what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take
this<00:02:51.430> out<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.030> then<00:02:52.239> I'm<00:02:52.359> gonna<00:02:52.480> put<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.170> can

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
and I tasted the water that's in the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.530 
and I tasted the water that's in the
bottom<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.400> crock<00:03:15.700> pot<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.359> make

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
bottom of the crock pot just to make

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.180 
bottom of the crock pot just to make
sure<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.810> didn't<00:03:17.109> taste<00:03:17.290> funny<00:03:17.739> or<00:03:17.950> anything

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
sure it didn't taste funny or anything

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.039 
sure it didn't taste funny or anything
and<00:03:18.609> it<00:03:18.700> tastes<00:03:18.970> fine<00:03:19.209> there's<00:03:19.780> not<00:03:19.900> really

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
and it tastes fine there's not really

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.550 
and it tastes fine there's not really
that<00:03:20.230> much<00:03:20.470> anyway<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.090> figure<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:23.470> know

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
that much anyway so I figure you know

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.470 
that much anyway so I figure you know
there<00:03:23.709> might<00:03:23.859> be<00:03:23.920> some<00:03:24.280> vitamins<00:03:24.850> in<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.180> so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
there might be some vitamins in that so

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.000 
there might be some vitamins in that so
I'm<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.720> gonna<00:03:25.840> leave<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.590> there<00:03:26.799> and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
I'm just gonna leave that in there and

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.270 
I'm just gonna leave that in there and
it<00:03:27.160> might<00:03:27.340> add<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.549> little<00:03:27.760> more<00:03:27.910> flavor<00:03:28.209> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
it might add a little more flavor and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.130 
it might add a little more flavor and
I'm<00:03:30.280> just<00:03:30.489> gonna<00:03:30.609> put<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:30.970> can<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.630> spaghetti

this with a little bit of kosher salt
a<00:05:50.869> little<00:05:51.199> bit<00:05:51.289> of<00:05:51.379> onion<00:05:51.709> powder<00:05:51.740> and<00:05:52.959> just<00:05:53.959> a

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
little bit of honey to make it a little

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.869 
little bit of honey to make it a little
bit<00:05:56.149> sweeter<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.899> usually<00:05:57.499> use<00:05:57.679> sugar<00:05:58.129> but<00:05:58.580> I

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
bit sweeter I usually use sugar but I

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.119 
bit sweeter I usually use sugar but I
saw<00:05:59.809> a<00:05:59.839> guy<00:06:00.050> doing<00:06:00.319> a<00:06:00.409> video<00:06:00.529> the<00:06:00.919> other<00:06:00.979> day

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
saw a guy doing a video the other day

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.629 
saw a guy doing a video the other day
and<00:06:01.490> he<00:06:01.580> said<00:06:01.849> honey<00:06:02.149> is<00:06:02.419> it<00:06:03.249> gives<00:06:04.249> a<00:06:04.399> more

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
and he said honey is it gives a more

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.629 
and he said honey is it gives a more
subtle<00:06:04.999> flavor<00:06:05.569> let<00:06:05.719> me<00:06:05.809> see<00:06:05.959> how<00:06:06.019> that<00:06:06.199> is

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.459 

yeah<00:06:10.639> like<00:06:10.939> that<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:11.509> think<00:06:11.959> the<00:06:12.079> honey<00:06:12.259> is

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
yeah like that I think the honey is

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.230 
yeah like that I think the honey is
nicer<00:06:12.889> than<00:06:12.919> sugar<00:06:13.339> for<00:06:13.669> sweetening<00:06:13.909> your

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
nicer than sugar for sweetening your

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.199 
nicer than sugar for sweetening your
sauce<00:06:14.449> it's<00:06:14.959> a<00:06:15.019> little<00:06:15.199> more<00:06:15.319> subtle<00:06:15.529> not<00:06:15.860> so

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:16.209 
sauce it's a little more subtle not so

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.329
