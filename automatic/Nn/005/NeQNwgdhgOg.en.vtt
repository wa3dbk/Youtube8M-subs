00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.709
 Gongora 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.449
 As minimum 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.119
 go dead 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 even more 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.620
 the one that does not care 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.939
 of the pavements 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.710
 when talking about food safety 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.390
 all the old people are referred to 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.409
 sean koroni coso acute 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.260
 that can make food harmful to the health of the consumer 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.409
 concept that implies 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:38.710
 that food 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 will not cause harm to the consumer 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 when they are prepared as they consume according to the intended use 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700
 the safety of food 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.340
 it is an important reason for concern 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.470
 in case of street food foods 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.680
 the latter are prepared manipulate and process 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.210
 with traditional methods without keeping the minimum safety standards 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.940
 sanitary 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.090
 on the other hand 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.680
 the poor quality of raw materials and food products 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.930
 they deteriorate because the sellers 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
 street workers lack the necessary installation 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 to keep food the right temperatures 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.910
 for prolonged periods as a result the microorganisms present 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.359
 in food 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.839
 we reach high counts capable of producing diseases 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.369
 Street vendors do not have access 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.719
 to an adequate supply of potable water for cooking 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.270
 to wash 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.320
 the utensils and cutlery normally use the same water over and over again 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.590
 during the day 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.120
 without changing it providing an ideal environment for the growth of 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.280
 microorganisms 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.220
 Among the factors that contribute to the possible risks of food are 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.320
 they influence the inadequate agricultural talk 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380
 the lack of hygiene in all phases of the food chain 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.609
 the absence of preventive controls 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.599
 in the cooperation and preparation of the pavements 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.219
 the use of an appropriate chemical product 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.639
 contamination of raw materials 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.879
 the ingredients and the water 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.560
 the insufficient overcrowding palm today in adequate food contamination 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:21.619
 and against pollution 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.719
 the concept of pollution is understood as all matter 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.789
 microbes 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.279
 or its toxins 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.560
 parasites chemicals 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.319
 by the active way 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.739
 toxins there was another harmful agent 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.659
 that are incorporated into the food 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.449
 with the capacity to produce diseases there are those who consume it 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.099
 basically 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.430
 that matter can be of a biological chemical or physical type 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.039
 biological contamination 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.199
 includes batteries 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.449
 the viruses the congos 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.369
 Mo and yeasts 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.279
 and the other parasites 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.089
 the main problem 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.889
 what are the bacteria 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.589
 for its ability to reproduce on pavements to quantities that 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.869
 they make the person who consumed them sick 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.409
 or even produce toxins that make you sick 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.259
 chemical contamination 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.889
 usually occurs in the same place of primary food production 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.579
 by received that they want in substance used to control the plagues in 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.789
 the crops 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.659
 or substances as a veterinary drug 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.129
 in osh sick animals that are then slaughtered 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.199
 This type of contamination can also be caused by the content of their 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.459
 toxic substances of a chemical nature 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.459
 that are found naturally in food 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.429
 physical contamination 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:50.719
 Several kinds of foreign matter can contaminate the food as they can be 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.130
 metal particles 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.349
 detached by utensils hop equipment 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.419
 Pieces of glasses by breaking lamps piece of wood 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.029
 coming from packaging 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.409
 rings pencils bracelets 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.539
 there were others 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.859
 all of which can fall into food and contaminate 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.859
 food contamination mechanism 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.069
 primary or source pollution 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.739
 It occurs during the process of food production itself 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.090
 at present 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.820
 It is very difficult to produce completely exempt vegetables 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 of contaminants 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.919
 chickens ok to swim without a battery in their 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.259
 intestine which is almost always inevitable that some foods 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.509
 come with some degree of pollution ted from the place of 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.610
 production 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.460
 direct pollution 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.949
 possibly in the simplest way as if they contaminate food and 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.080
 this way contaminants arrive in food through the person who 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.099
 they manipulate 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.029
 examples of this type of pollution 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:55.700
 it may be that the crowded 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.120
 when a manipulator 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.750
 eliminates droplets of saliva when sneezing another being in the process areas 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.909
 when the manipulator with infected wounds 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.149
 touches the food the raw materials or foods have contact with a 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:13.409
 common chemical product can be a pesticide 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.830
 when on the line this they land 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.930
 flies or other pests 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.509
 or when a foreign body is with for food during the process 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.379
 cross contamination 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.410
 This type of contamination is understood as the passage of any pollutant 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.270
 drums 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.570
 chemical product 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.039
 physical element 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.659
 from a food 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.289
 or more I wanted to premium 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.270
 contaminated to a food that is not 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.400
 to surface in contact with this one 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.910
 that are clean table equipment utensils 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:05:59.169
