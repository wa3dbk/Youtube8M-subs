 characters who can not be any 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.930
 investment of any character and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.689
 for you to change the color for example with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.970
 here in the school is this yellow and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.790
 closing sales is for you to change this 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.800
 with yvone you will press the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.739
 choosing the character's clothes can 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 choose tournament but how it is normal 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.300
 x ps4 rouanet box the year you will 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 push the button that will be or whatever 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.649
 option button on bs-4 because it's the right 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.930
 equivalent to ps3 status and the menu button 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.829
 xbox year 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 ok then the rate of 11 squeezes obvious or not 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.670
 toolbox case ok then let's go 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.020
 the tournament with the bodies in a training the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.840
 The cup does not go like this and I choose 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 This button I said is true. Snake it. 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.759
 will not change the color of the number already 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.960
 understood 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.439
 here in the year of course to enter the game 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.509
 Come on, let's change the clothes of another. 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.100
 here johnny cash character for example 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.070
 certainly not right 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.869
 So let's choose which johnny cage we're going to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.329
 To choose soccer that is the one of Brazil that 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.329
 and I do not want this clothes I want it 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.820
 I do not want this any other 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:46.140
 alternative is another thing to do this 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.510
 on the keyboard i found the will press enter 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.479
 I pressed the button and cef in the case here in the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.800
 my keyboard is is I put the insert button but 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.830
 can see here that if I put not here 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.330
 gives to finally have not been there the button 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.940
 that I voted for right then I think 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.619
 it really is the Unicef pattern 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.250
 sacred for anyone to change 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.929
 the clothes ok let's go gitane cheese in that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.270
 clothes 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.270
 At this stage, let's take a look 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.310
 And there you are seeing fit. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.140
 then on the menu it seems that there is in the world but 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.790
 When it arrives in the gameplay of the game is 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.750
 seeing there or the school clothes that were 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.860
 yellow is black and the color of the uniform 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.330
 johnny cage prokop turned blue and 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.769
 yellow 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.630
 so I'll leave you then with 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.360
 some clothes some different things 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.209
 the character with the default color and 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.010
 with the color is the alternative you already have 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.019
 a look since then that 's it I stayed there 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.060

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.650

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.680
 If you liked or are not writing write 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.510
 for more right fitting tips but 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.239
 gameplay in online matches as 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.220
 techniques that teach to do in combos 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.590
 there with the characters all over here 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.430
 in that game also if he traveled 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.750

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.549
