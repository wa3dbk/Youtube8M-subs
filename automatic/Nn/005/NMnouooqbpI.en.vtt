me<00:00:39.960> away<00:00:40.110> from<00:00:40.140> football<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> have

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
me away from football but now now I have

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.119 
me away from football but now now I have
not<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> bad<00:00:43.469> thing<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
not that not that was a bad thing it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.029 
not that not that was a bad thing it
wasn't<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> bad<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:46.350> when

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
wasn't a bad thing it was just now when

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
wasn't a bad thing it was just now when
I<00:00:47.129> go<00:00:47.160> home<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:48.329> more<00:00:48.480> time<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.870> think

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
I go home I have more time to think

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.260 
I go home I have more time to think
about<00:00:49.110> cooking<00:00:49.559> now

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
about cooking now

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.900 
about cooking now
I<00:00:53.530> think<00:00:54.530> what<00:00:54.650> Georgia<00:00:54.980> wants<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.280> know<00:00:55.400> how

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
I think what Georgia wants to know how

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.450 
I think what Georgia wants to know how
is<00:00:56.090> life<00:00:56.330> now<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.630> you're<00:00:57.080> a<00:00:57.110> bundle<00:00:58.070> on<00:00:58.250> I'm

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
is life now that you're a bundle on I'm

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.940 
is life now that you're a bundle on I'm
single<00:00:58.820> you're<00:00:59.170> in<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.290> high-profile

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
single you're in a high-profile

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.079 
single you're in a high-profile
relationship<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:02.390> mean<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.230> is<00:01:03.760> it's<00:01:04.760> not<00:01:04.879> easy

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
relationship I mean it is it's not easy

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.390 
relationship I mean it is it's not easy
and<00:01:05.530> see<00:01:06.530> there's<00:01:06.740> other<00:01:07.340> things<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:09.400> go

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
and see there's other things that go

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.520 
and see there's other things that go
through<00:01:10.490> your<00:01:10.700> mind<00:01:10.820> but<00:01:11.300> I<00:01:11.600> think<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.350> think

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
through your mind but I think I think

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.200 
through your mind but I think I think
the<00:01:12.620> difference<00:01:12.800> now<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.510> when<00:01:14.510> I<00:01:14.540> go<00:01:14.750> home<00:01:15.100> I'm

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
the difference now is when I go home I'm

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.100 
the difference now is when I go home I'm
didn't<00:01:17.210> think<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.420> had<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.540> think<00:01:17.720> about<00:01:17.840> his

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
didn't think I had to think about his

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.920 
didn't think I had to think about his
football<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:19.640> know<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.720> my<00:01:21.710> family<00:01:22.130> so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
football you know and and my family so

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.999 
football you know and and my family so
that's<00:01:23.930> probably<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.320> only<00:01:24.350> difference<00:01:24.800> but

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
that's probably the only difference but

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.130 
that's probably the only difference but
I<00:01:25.369> was<00:01:25.850> happy<00:01:26.000> then<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.509> I'm<00:01:26.630> happy<00:01:26.810> now<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.350> I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
I was happy then that I'm happy now so I

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.080 
I was happy then that I'm happy now so I
there's<00:01:30.140> no<00:01:30.410> I'm<00:01:30.680> not<00:01:30.830> more<00:01:31.310> sad<00:01:31.610> or<00:01:33.940> I'm<00:01:34.940> not
