00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
different units as I mentioned earlier

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.300 
different units as I mentioned earlier
you<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.880> your<00:03:33.150> infantry<00:03:33.780> your<00:03:34.500> cavalry<00:03:35.130> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you have your infantry your cavalry and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.780 
you have your infantry your cavalry and
your<00:03:35.849> archers<00:03:36.590> each<00:03:37.590> with<00:03:37.919> different<00:03:38.430> health

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
your archers each with different health

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.280 
your archers each with different health
and<00:03:39.120> attacks<00:03:40.109> as<00:03:40.700> well<00:03:41.700> as<00:03:42.030> different<00:03:42.690> attack

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
and attacks as well as different attack

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.080 
and attacks as well as different attack
patterns<00:03:43.859> on<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.760> 2d<00:03:45.389> battle<00:03:45.840> board<00:03:47.090> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
patterns on the 2d battle board the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.470 
patterns on the 2d battle board the
monsters<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:48.989> three<00:03:49.919> different<00:03:50.370> units<00:03:51.060> with

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
monsters have three different units with

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.909 
monsters have three different units with
roughly<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.230> same<00:03:52.440> setup<00:03:52.799> as<00:03:53.069> your<00:03:53.609> troops<00:03:53.970> do

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
roughly the same setup as your troops do

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.680 
roughly the same setup as your troops do
so<00:03:55.919> they'll<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.340> one<00:03:56.639> that's<00:03:56.849> ranged

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
so they'll have one that's ranged

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.140 
so they'll have one that's ranged
they'll<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.440> one<00:03:58.799> that's<00:03:59.160> their<00:03:59.639> cavalry

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
they'll have one that's their cavalry

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.870 
they'll have one that's their cavalry
and<00:04:00.540> their<00:04:00.720> infantry<00:04:01.349> so<00:04:01.799> depending<00:04:02.579> on<00:04:02.669> which

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
and their infantry so depending on which

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.490 
and their infantry so depending on which
ones<00:04:03.090> coming<00:04:03.359> at<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:03.840> they<00:04:03.989> might<00:04:04.169> have<00:04:04.319> more

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
ones coming at you they might have more

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.890 
ones coming at you they might have more
help<00:04:04.769> they<00:04:05.069> might<00:04:05.190> have<00:04:05.340> more<00:04:05.549> attack<00:04:05.900> you

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
help they might have more attack you

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.620 
help they might have more attack you
might<00:04:07.079> have<00:04:07.200> less<00:04:07.440> health<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.919> solar

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
might have less health and solar

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.930 
might have less health and solar
so<00:04:10.630> once<00:04:10.990> you<00:04:11.140> get<00:04:11.380> into<00:04:11.650> battle<00:04:11.950> your<00:04:12.460> units

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
so once you get into battle your units

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.750 
so once you get into battle your units
are<00:04:13.120> randomly<00:04:13.720> placed<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.920> left<00:04:15.220> side<00:04:15.520> of

a step forward and attack if possible
you<00:04:31.270> have<00:04:31.480> two<00:04:31.870> objectives<00:04:32.530> one<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.580> which<00:04:33.760> is
