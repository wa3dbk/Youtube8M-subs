minimum maximum and average so you want

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.150 
minimum maximum and average so you want
you<00:02:44.810> don't<00:02:44.930> want<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.230> minimum<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.829> be<00:02:45.980> low

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
you don't want the minimum to be low

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
higher an average to be the best so you

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.530 
higher an average to be the best so you
