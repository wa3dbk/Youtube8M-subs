has left um normally I think he could he
could<00:04:43.340> definitely<00:04:44.320> beat<00:04:45.320> cloud<00:04:46.040> but<00:04:46.670> right

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
could definitely beat cloud but right

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.680 
could definitely beat cloud but right
now<00:04:46.880> at<00:04:47.180> this<00:04:47.300> stage<00:04:47.480> you<00:04:48.940> know<00:04:49.940> I'm<00:04:50.120> gonna<00:04:50.360> go

now at this stage you know I'm gonna go

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.560 
now at this stage you know I'm gonna go
with<00:04:51.320> cloud<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:52.370> know<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.520> think<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:53.270> fact

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
with cloud you know I think the fact

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.860 
with cloud you know I think the fact
that<00:04:53.690> his<00:04:53.960> azz<00:04:54.170> athleticism<00:04:54.890> his<00:04:55.430> youth<00:04:55.870> he's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that his azz athleticism his youth he's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.080 
that his azz athleticism his youth he's
not<00:04:57.050> a<00:04:57.110> guy<00:04:57.350> just<00:04:57.650> stands<00:04:57.950> in<00:04:58.190> bangs<00:04:58.490> if<00:04:58.940> he

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
not a guy just stands in bangs if he

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.340 
not a guy just stands in bangs if he
stands<00:04:59.450> in<00:04:59.660> banks<00:05:00.230> bangs<00:05:01.190> with<00:05:01.580> woods<00:05:02.390> Clinton

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
stands in banks bangs with woods Clinton

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.310 
stands in banks bangs with woods Clinton
woods<00:05:03.530> he<00:05:03.710> definitely<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:04.550> think<00:05:05.300> cloud<00:05:06.080> will

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
woods he definitely I think cloud will

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.980 
woods he definitely I think cloud will
lose<00:05:06.530> but<00:05:07.100> if<00:05:07.370> he<00:05:07.520> fights<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:08.120> little<00:05:08.480> smarter

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
lose but if he fights a little smarter

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.620 
lose but if he fights a little smarter
uses<00:05:09.860> his<00:05:10.040> youth<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:10.580> athleticism<00:05:11.090> moves

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
uses his youth and athleticism moves

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.370 
uses his youth and athleticism moves
around<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:13.250> ring<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.180> little<00:05:14.510> bit<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:14.990> doesn't

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
around the ring a little bit it doesn't

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.010 
around the ring a little bit it doesn't

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
but not necessary nice wide hooks but

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.940 
but not necessary nice wide hooks but
they're<00:05:52.730> pretty<00:05:52.880> fast<00:05:53.360> hooks<00:05:53.900> you<00:05:54.440> know<00:05:54.470> he's

they're pretty fast hooks you know he's

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.530 
they're pretty fast hooks you know he's
coming<00:05:55.370> off<00:05:55.550> a<00:05:55.820> guy<00:05:56.270> umberto<00:05:56.930> with<00:05:57.290> speed<00:05:57.680> so

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
coming off a guy umberto with speed so

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.540 
coming off a guy umberto with speed so

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
he showed himself to be okay in that

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.420 
he showed himself to be okay in that
fight<00:06:01.940> both<00:06:02.720> these<00:06:02.930> guys<00:06:03.140> can<00:06:03.440> get<00:06:03.590> out<00:06:03.770> boxed

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
fight both these guys can get out boxed

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.680 
fight both these guys can get out boxed
but<00:06:05.180> I<00:06:05.210> believe<00:06:05.830> your<00:06:06.830> Rango<00:06:07.400> is<00:06:07.700> just<00:06:08.540> a

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
but I believe your Rango is just a

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.610 
but I believe your Rango is just a
little<00:06:09.050> more<00:06:09.230> busier<00:06:09.980> and<00:06:10.420> he's<00:06:11.590> for<00:06:12.590> a

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
little more busier and he's for a

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.100 
little more busier and he's for a
brawler<00:06:13.130> for<00:06:13.970> a<00:06:14.000> stand<00:06:14.450> there<00:06:14.630> and<00:06:14.780> fight<00:06:15.080> I

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
brawler for a stand there and fight I

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.140 
brawler for a stand there and fight I
think<00:06:15.470> he's<00:06:15.590> a<00:06:15.620> little<00:06:15.860> more<00:06:16.130> busy<00:06:16.670> and<00:06:16.970> active

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
think he's a little more busy and active

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.480 
think he's a little more busy and active
but<00:06:17.930> I<00:06:17.990> think<00:06:18.230> he's<00:06:18.350> just<00:06:18.470> a<00:06:18.620> little<00:06:18.650> smarter

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
but I think he's just a little smarter

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.420 
but I think he's just a little smarter
doesn't<00:06:19.880> necessarily<00:06:20.300> just<00:06:20.750> load

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
doesn't necessarily just load

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.580 
doesn't necessarily just load
I<00:06:21.520> mean<00:06:22.390> both<00:06:22.630> these<00:06:22.870> guys<00:06:23.110> have<00:06:23.380> a<00:06:23.410> tendency

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
I mean both these guys have a tendency

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.590 
I mean both these guys have a tendency
to<00:06:23.890> load<00:06:24.100> up<00:06:24.250> but<00:06:24.370> I<00:06:24.460> think<00:06:24.670> Bailey<00:06:24.970> is<00:06:25.270> shown

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
to load up but I think Bailey is shown

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.590 
to load up but I think Bailey is shown
in<00:06:26.560> his<00:06:26.860> career<00:06:27.040> so<00:06:27.280> much<00:06:27.460> to<00:06:27.760> to<00:06:28.030> load<00:06:28.240> up<00:06:28.420> too

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
in his career so much to to load up too

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.990 
in his career so much to to load up too
much<00:06:28.780> but<00:06:29.470> no<00:06:29.620> matter<00:06:29.770> what<00:06:30.070> I<00:06:30.340> believe<00:06:30.370> this

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
much but no matter what I believe this

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.180 
much but no matter what I believe this
cycle<00:06:31.630> ended<00:06:31.990> and<00:06:32.170> knock<00:06:32.380> up<00:06:32.590> is<00:06:32.770> both<00:06:33.010> these

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
cycle ended and knock up is both these

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
cycle ended and knock up is both these
guys<00:06:33.400> pack<00:06:33.910> power<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:35.730> it<00:06:36.730> should<00:06:37.060> be<00:06:37.180> a

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
guys pack power and it should be a

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.960

right hand coming through this hook if
that<00:07:02.320> happens<00:07:02.850> then<00:07:03.850> your<00:07:04.090> angle<00:07:04.360> might<00:07:04.510> be<00:07:04.630> in

some<00:07:04.900> problems<00:07:05.320> but<00:07:05.350> I<00:07:05.500> think<00:07:05.920> that<00:07:06.010> I<00:07:07.080> think

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
some problems but I think that I think

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.260 
some problems but I think that I think
he<00:07:08.260> like<00:07:08.830> I<00:07:08.950> said<00:07:09.190> he<00:07:09.340> I<00:07:09.520> think<00:07:09.850> he's<00:07:10.030> gonna

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
he like I said he I think he's gonna

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.090

knockout<00:07:15.870> Matt<00:07:16.870> you<00:07:17.080> know<00:07:17.110> it'll<00:07:17.860> be<00:07:17.950> a<00:07:17.980> late

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190

one<00:07:18.250> it's<00:07:18.670> not<00:07:18.790> gonna<00:07:18.940> be<00:07:19.030> something<00:07:19.390> early<00:07:19.780> I

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
one it's not gonna be something early I

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.340 
one it's not gonna be something early I
think<00:07:20.350> if<00:07:20.800> Billy<00:07:21.070> you<00:07:21.790> know<00:07:21.910> Bailey<00:07:22.510> wins<00:07:23.050> it

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350 
think if Billy you know Bailey wins it

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.410 
think if Billy you know Bailey wins it
that<00:07:23.740> might<00:07:23.980> be<00:07:24.190> a<00:07:24.220> little<00:07:24.430> bit<00:07:24.670> mid<00:07:24.910> roundish

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.300 
that might be a little bit mid roundish
or<00:07:25.630> something<00:07:26.020> where<00:07:26.320> he<00:07:26.410> just<00:07:26.650> catches<00:07:26.920> them

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310
