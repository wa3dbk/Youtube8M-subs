00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
my feeling in this match is I think that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.859 
my feeling in this match is I think that
Jeff<00:00:29.580> Hardy<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.390> that's<00:00:30.570> gonna<00:00:30.689> go

over<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.320> match<00:00:31.529> because<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.219> look<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.520> it

over in this match because I look at it
this<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.910> think<00:00:33.090> he's<00:00:33.180> gonna<00:00:33.329> defeat<00:00:33.660> mr.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this way I think he's gonna defeat mr.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.680 
this way I think he's gonna defeat mr.
Anderson<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> way<00:00:34.860> Kurt<00:00:35.760> Angle<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:36.270> an

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
Anderson that way Kurt Angle has an

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
Anderson that way Kurt Angle has an
excuse<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.320> not<00:00:37.380> retiring<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
excuse for not retiring and then you

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.400 
excuse for not retiring and then you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.690 
vacated the bold bit of overbooking I
thought<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> last<00:00:47.039> pay-per-view<00:00:47.579> with

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
thought at the last pay-per-view with

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.279 
thought at the last pay-per-view with
Kurt<00:00:47.910> Angle<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> Jeff<00:00:48.539> Hardy<00:00:48.719> which

Kurt Angle and Jeff Hardy which

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.900 
Kurt Angle and Jeff Hardy which
ultimately<00:00:49.530> ended<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.520> three-way

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
ultimately ended up with this three-way

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.510 
ultimately ended up with this three-way
left<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> spilled<00:00:53.100> over<00:00:53.190> into

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
left right and it spilled over into

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
left right and it spilled over into
impact<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.149> that's<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> little

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
impact I think that's one of the little

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
impact I think that's one of the little
problems<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.590> TNA<00:00:56.129> does<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.120> seems<00:00:57.329> like

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
problems that TNA does is it seems like

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.630 
problems that TNA does is it seems like

with<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.380> fact<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> liked

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
with that I like in fact I kind of liked

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.300 
with that I like in fact I kind of liked
it<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.340> TNA<00:01:21.090> tends<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.509> sometimes<00:01:21.659> put

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
it because TNA tends to sometimes put

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.410 
it because TNA tends to sometimes put
too<00:01:23.310> many<00:01:23.430> gimmick<00:01:23.850> matches<00:01:24.240> into

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
too many gimmick matches into

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
too many gimmick matches into
pay-per-views<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> fact<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
pay-per-views and I like the fact that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.469 
pay-per-views and I like the fact that
this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.700> straight-up<00:01:26.939> match<00:01:27.210> let

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this is just a straight-up match let

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.140

just<00:01:32.610> straight<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> novelty<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.079> itself

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

opinion<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.390> think<00:03:06.840> they<00:03:07.080> need<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.410> slow<00:03:07.650> things

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
opinion I think they need to slow things

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.010 
opinion I think they need to slow things
down<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.459> think<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:09.150> everything<00:03:09.450> we<00:03:09.660> do<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.989> so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
down I think that everything we do is so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.930 
down I think that everything we do is so
quick<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.739> fast<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.340> they<00:03:11.430> don't<00:03:11.550> let<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
quick and so fast and they don't let the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.450 
quick and so fast and they don't let the
fans<00:03:12.180> absorb<00:03:12.630> what<00:03:12.840> they<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.020> is

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
fans absorb what they do is

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.610 
fans absorb what they do is
like<00:03:13.640> spot<00:03:14.330> after<00:03:14.480> spot<00:03:14.630> on<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> spot<00:03:15.470> they

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
like spot after spot on the spot they

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.950 
like spot after spot on the spot they
need<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.920> just<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:17.360> take<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.660> down<00:03:17.780> a<00:03:17.840> notch

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
need to just just take it down a notch

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.680 
need to just just take it down a notch
and<00:03:18.440> progress<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.430> built<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.090> match<00:03:20.330> but

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
and progress and built you match but

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.900 
and progress and built you match but
yeah<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.860> should<00:03:22.100> be<00:03:22.190> measured<00:03:22.370> enough

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
yeah it should be measured enough

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.180 
yeah it should be measured enough
and<00:03:23.210> finally<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.170> what<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.530> don't<00:03:24.590> think<00:03:25.070> is

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
and finally and what I don't think is

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.380 
and finally and what I don't think is
going<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.490> be<00:03:25.580> nots<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.060> night

and then being in the middle you know

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.540 
and then being in the middle you know
actually<00:03:57.020> they're<00:03:57.200> technically<00:03:57.950> easier<00:03:58.190> to

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
actually they're technically easier to

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.980 
actually they're technically easier to
officiate<00:03:58.850> because<00:03:59.360> some<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.690> rules<00:03:59.900> that

don't apply in a four-way I mean you

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.700

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
really disqualification because how do

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.640 
really disqualification because how do
you<00:04:08.300> spell<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.630> by<00:04:08.810> one<00:04:09.020> person<00:04:09.290> out<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.560> the

you spell it by one person out of the
way<00:04:10.010> back<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:10.850> they're<00:04:11.030> technically<00:04:11.420> kind<00:04:11.660> of

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
way back so they're technically kind of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.540 
way back so they're technically kind of
easier<00:04:12.050> it's<00:04:12.380> actually<00:04:12.680> harder<00:04:13.010> on<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.310> on

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
easier it's actually harder on the on

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.770 
easier it's actually harder on the on
